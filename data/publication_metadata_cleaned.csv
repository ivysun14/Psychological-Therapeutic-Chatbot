The client, suffering from traumatic grief, was experiencing extreme pain when she thought of her son's death.  The goal of the EMDR session was to further process the trauma associated with her son's death so she could think of him with positive feelings. EMDR is not a short cut through the grief process.  Rather, EMDR enables the grief process by processing the obstacles that can complicate the grief.

The moment chosen to start the EMDR session was a moment a few days before when she was driving and experienced a very painful realization that her son was dead.

This is an incomplete session, with the session ending before the Installation Phase was complete because other emotional material was starting to come up.  Consequently the Body Scan was skipped as well.  After the tape ended, a safe place exercise for to ground and relax the client was provided"

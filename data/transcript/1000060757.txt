<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Client 0518-014, Session #16, March 5, 1971.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm glad I'm seeing you right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? Something happening or-?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just don't know how to [character my tales] (ph) of what's going on. I just feel incredibly confused. I don't know. I had a really good morning. I had just a beautiful morning. I spent the whole morning talking to Summer and Katherine's sister, Dalia and Crispin and (inaudible 0:01:07) who were two other people. And we just had the most beautiful rap. </p>

<p>And I went with them to the (inaudible 0:01:14) office. They were interviewed by the [maroon] (ph). It was just really good. Like, I just feel so much better about where the weather people are in it. It's so much more comprehensible to me. They're human and they're not crazy, violent, martyr, vanguard weirdos, you know? </p>

<p>And they're just really warm and I really like Dalia a whole lot. We just had a really good talk. It also felt good to be understanding politics better because it has always been sort of like very important to me. But I haven't known how to make it human and how to make it a part of my life. And it was just really good. I just was super high from having seen them.</p>

<p>But there's really nobody that can...I mean, not nobody...Holly could understand and Carmen could because they have the same kind of political leaning that I do. But I ran into Cathy and I tried to talk to her about it and she really can't understand it in this way. She really doesn't...can't see violence and doesn't understand the idea of revolution. She's really- </p>

<p>And this very crazy thing has been...I haven't told you about it because I haven't known what to make of it. And all of a sudden it's really confusing me right now. Did I...have I told you a little bit about Jobe at all? [0:02:47]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think so. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I had a funny feeling that I hadn't told you. A lot of it was because I really just didn't understand what was going on. And there were lots of other things to talk about with you. There never seems quite enough time to talk about everything anyway.</p>

<p>And Jobe is this guy that I met and he's a freshman, too, but really different. And when I first met him and we first saw each other and danced together and stuff, I just really...I thought it was the same thing. I thought I was doing this ego-trip thing. And then...and I could tell somewhere along the line, that it wasn't that because he didn't feel that way towards me. He wasn't like worshipping at all. </p>

<p>If anything, I was really uncomfortable in trying to find myself when I was with him. And I didn't...I can never really...I can't tell how much I like him. And lots of times, I feel really older than him and I start thinking, well, he's just this poetic, sweet, soppy freshman boy. Then we talk again. I see him again and he just has so much more and is really...and he's critical of me, which always makes me more involved in this funny way. He's really critical of me and there's something and it just...and it wasn't this ecstatic, dreamy meeting somebody and playing with them and stuff.</p>

<p>And I just...but I can never quite tell what it is I feel. But I know that instead of not wanting to see him, I do want to see him, which is really different than how I've been with lots of people recently. I've been excited by being infatuated with them and them with me and then I don't really- [0:04:51] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: -want to see them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's really different. And I don't...a lot of times, I don't feel comfortable. Lots of times, I don't feel even like what I say is "familiar." And I don't feel very much myself. Or maybe I just...I don't know. But it's really involving and confusing me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not quite-</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't really know why we're with each other and I don't know how much he means to me. But all I know is that I'm really involved and it's very confusing. And I really respect him a whole bunch. But I don't really understand what we're doing with each other and that's bothering me. </p>

<p>And I just...I went to see him. I knew he'd be at the library and I went to the library. I could tell that he was really happy. And all he did is just be very critical and wouldn't really listen. Then all of a sudden he said, "Well, for the past two days, I've been wanting to see you and just like shake you and tell you something, but I'm not really sure what it is. And it's really a (inaudible 0:06:15) and some of it I think has to do with you using words and having no meaning behind them," or something. There's a lot...something else about, "not being on your side." And I don't know. I just...and we just started to talk when I came over here.</p>

<p>He said, "Well, I don't really know if I can really talk to you yet because it hasn't formulated in my mind and lots of times when I talk before I understand it, I just get very far away from it," which I know he does. He can ramble off on something when we're trying to talk. But I just...I feel completely confused about it. [0:06:47] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because you've sort of come in to being confused about your relationship and then he says this confusing thing. And it has something to do with the weathermen and so forth, only he's not quite clear what. And besides, he doesn't know yet. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it doesn't have anything to do with the weathermen. I mean that part has nothing to do with it. All it did is just show me that's when he is...when it was most obvious that we were arguing with each other and not being with each other in this way because no matter really what I said, he would disagree with it. He would like...there was something that way about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's like...but I just...I can't get straight how I really feel about him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How you feel about-?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How I feel about Jobe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm, because you find yourself respecting and looking up to him and taking his criticism. [0:08:09]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also because I don't understand why I'm so...but also I don't understand why I'm so uncomfortable with him...why I keep on getting this feeling of not...I'm not being me. I mean I guess it is a lot that I don't like who I am when I'm with him and he doesn't like it either in some way. But we're both sticking with it and neither of us can quite get out of it.</p>

<p>I don't know why I'm attached to him. I don't know why he matters to me, except that lots of times when he says things, he's just really sensitive and really...and sometimes, I just really respect who he is. In other ways, he's really young. </p>

<p>And then he's in this completely different world and I don't know any of his people and he doesn't know any of mine. That's very confusing to me, too, since it's funny the way I really live in a whole...I mean I've been with this bunch of people for a long time and they're all completely interconnecting. He's outside of the whole thing. That's also just discontinuous. I mean he lives in a dormitory and he's a freshman and there are all these freshman boys in his room and it's just completely different than anything that I'm used to but- [0:09:23] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's a whole different-</p>

<p>PATIENT: -set. And so I kind of started out thinking...feeling superior to him because I was older and...but then-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, now with the dormitory and stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then I was like...but then it's...in lots of ways he just knows a whole bunch more than I do and he's much straighter than I am. I don't mean straighter like "hip straight." But I mean-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean straighter like "honest straight."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I just feel completely confused by not knowing what to do with how I feel about him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, not knowing whether to look up to him or to look down on him for one thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And also it's just very...I feel very much not...a lot of the times...not me with him. But somehow, I'm still caught.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean you feel not "you" with him or you don't like the person you are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean I think that this all kind of...I don't know how to explain it, except for that I just always have this feeling. I mean I feel I'm going to lose myself a whole bunch...I mean like lose touch with how I'm feeling and who I am...just a whole lot. That's one reason I love Diane so much. I think I told you this in the very beginning because I always felt like I was me when I was with her. And I just had that feeling. [0:11:16]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You were always [spaced] (ph) and you were always there. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, more than that...that I just always recognized the things that I was saying and the ways I was acting and liked it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, as you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't always think I was really neat, but it was me...something that I could own as my own, whether it was good or bad. And somehow, lots of times, I just wonder where the things I'm saying comes from and how I'm acting comes from. I just like don't understand it and it's distasteful and it's just- And I've always had that feeling. That's usually been...I mean I've usually been friends with people...I mean I don't know which comes first, the chicken or the egg, but it always seemed like the people that I really felt close to were the people that I felt I was most often really "me" with, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the people that I wasn't me with were people who knocked me off my balance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that's part of it if you're not sure of your balance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I just...it just is very fitting of like there's this like...it's this kind of acting, but I'm not a good actor when I'm not me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Do you act anything in particular?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, lots of times I try, but since I'm not a good actor, it never comes out right. It just like comes out being just very weird. I can't...I don't know how to explain it any more because it's just this very weird thing. I don't know how to explain it any better than that. [0:13:02]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Not anything in particular, but just you being something other than yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's like my comments are completely off base like (inaudible 0:13:16) and that's how I really feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll do something really peculiar. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, peculiar and icky kind of. I don't like who it is, but I really have this feeling of that it's not me. And if I don't want to identify who I am, then I really in this very important way, disown it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like sort of klutzy or I don't know...socially klutzy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not even so. It's not necessarily any...it's not so much that way. Sometimes, that's part of it, but it's...I can't...like lots of times it's just with one. Like with Jobe, it's just with him...when I'm just with him. </p>

<p>I guess it's trying to be something instead of just being...just being, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The trying I think is a big part of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what it is, but it's just really horrible. And in that way, I'm locked and I never...and some of it is...some of- I'm just flashed on Evander. And I think I mentioned this once before a long time ago. It was last September when I went to California and I...I don't know if I told you very much about this, but I was just more miserable than I've ever been. I was really pretty suicidal even. And I met this guy. I was really...I was just...I haven't ever since then been so depressed. I just would cry every morning when I woke up just because I had a whole other day to go through. [0:15:21]</p>

<p>But there's this guy, Evander that I was seeing kind of out of utter loneliness who is a straight, very weird person, but who I really respect. He was much older than I was...29 or something. He was really heavily into politics, but was unlike any other person I've yet ever met. But my relationship was really strange. I never felt like I was me with him. I never hardly talked. I felt completely alien. And all we did was sleep together and that was always good, so I could never understand...I mean I always thought that for that to be good, right, there must be some emotional basis and we kept on staying with each other. But I felt completely alienated from myself. </p>

<p>I had no idea. I had no respect for myself. I could never say an intelligent thing. I could never just talk to him. We didn't even have conversations. I just kind of mutely followed him around. It was just really...but I was really all convoluted and...but somewhere I really...whenever I listened to him talk to other people or watched him, I really liked who he was as a person. I really liked the things he said and the way he acted and the things that he thought about. But I could never be a person with him.</p>

<p>And somehow in the same...there's something similar in what Jobe and I are doing in that I really like who he is and I think...and I can't understand why I can't just be me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow you...I don't know. There's...like you can't respect both of you or something. It's like he...I don't know...like he's so far above you or something or...not really, but as it turns out, he's so far above you that you're just nothing and have to please him. [0:17:49]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's what I was doing with Evander. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't quite apply to Jobe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't quite apply to Jobe because everything is ambiguous about Jobe. All my feelings about Jobe are ambiguous. Lots of times, I really think he's little and silly in a kind of romanticiness (ph) that is only in the movies and that is only when I'm lying and I don't respect. But sometimes, I don't think that at all. </p>

<p>Also, in some way it's funny as I realize the whole thing is...it's really real and that he's really...we could just pretend and try to make everything nice and just like kid around together and be sweet and stuff. But in some way, I have a feeling like this is relationship in an important way because he's really responding to what's really going on between us. There is something weird and there is some way that we're not at each others' sides and we're not being supportive of each other. We're...I don't know. I'm just really completely confused. </p>

<p>In some way, I wouldn't just want to not be real and just pat each other on the head. But we're not doing that at all, which makes it really important to me. And also, whenever anybody is critical of me, it's just...it's very important to me. [0:19:40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happens when he's critical of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: First, it hurts a whole lot. Then I really take it seriously because I really respect his criticism. I'm just always, I guess, basically worried about being dishonest to people and then they won't be able to see through it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that when he sees you being dishonest-</p>

<p>PATIENT: And lots...yeah. But I think I'm not even really that dishonest with him...just when he sees contradictions in who I am, I really take it seriously. Lots of times, like with Marco...Marco is that person that I love so much. He was my first love here. </p>

<p>Lots of times, I would...he was really critical of me. Lots of times, I would even take criticism that I didn't really even think was true, but I would take it and always try to find it to be true in this funny way. Lots of times it...because I mean a lot of it is because I think that I'm not critical enough and so that I'm probably hiding it from myself and it probably is true even if it doesn't ring in my gut automatically. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A person is doing something for you that you need to have done...that function that you don't do for yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, a lot of it, yeah. [0:21:29] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought maybe it's important because you really want to be better. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a lot of it, too. That really is a lot of it. And it's just very hard for me to change on my own...just decide don't do that anymore. I really have to have it be in relation to people to really see how important it is. And so that's why it's really important to me that- And I really do want to be different and I really do want to be better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's like somebody...if somebody takes the trouble to criticize, it's hurtful, but that's really caring, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And also that I'm just...I have an incredible facility to be dishonest with myself or just...if not to be dishonest with myself, to be honest with myself about some things, but do it anyway. And somehow if there's another person saying, "No. You can't act that way with me," I can't...that is...it like really forces me to try to be different because it's really injuring a relationship I'm having with somebody. [0:23:06] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and it makes it possible in some way that it wasn't before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To do, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't just have to [spill] (ph) all with it...all locked up in yourself with your own willpower or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. What also really distresses me that...that we're all...that Jobe and I are like tangled up in each other and there's a certain amount of not being sure we like each other in some- That just freaks me out. Like, as he said that thing about "not being on your side," I just didn't know where to put any of that. And I know that no matter what happens I really want to be...I think he's just a really incredible person. I don't necessarily feel like I have...I want him to be my boyfriend and I want to be his woman. There's definitely that possibility and I did...I slept with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel bad about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That's the funny thing is I slept with him twice, which is something I haven't done and I found that I didn't not want him to come again, which is always what it is, right? So I did. That was confusing, too. [0:25:01] </p>

<p>And I went over to the library and I tried to find him. But then things aren't quite right. Things don't quite feel like (inaudible 0:25:12) last time. Almost all the time I've been with him, we're not really-</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of in a way like you're drawn to him in spite of yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible 0:25:31) But I keep on looking for this kind of glowy (ph) feeling. Like, sometimes when I leave here, right, I just have a really good feeling. And when I talk to Holly sometimes and almost all the time when I talk to Cathy, there's just this like really strong caring about each others' feelings. And that just lets you know what the other person is talking about. You know where the other person is at, you know? And you basically like it. That is really what keeps me running...those...that kind of being with somebody is really what gives me my energy. </p>

<p>And that hasn't been happening between Jobe and I. I keep on wanting that to happen and invent ways and that's part of it. I keep on trying to be something to make that happen. And it doesn't happen probably because I'm trying to be a particular way.</p>

<p>I don't know. And then I keep on having this feeling and I told it to him. I wish I could erase having ever been with him at all and meet him all over again and pretend like nothing had ever happened so I could start on a clean sheet because I already feel like I'm in a really bad cycle. It's true. I really do get locked into cycles with people. </p>

<p>Like, Diane and I now talk to each and she doesn't avoid being with me. I call her up to find, "Oh, the FBI came to my house yesterday. [Did I tell you about that?"] (ph) (inaudible 0:27:05) But...and she said, "Why don't you come home? I'd like to talk to you," just like we're out of that bad cycle, which we couldn't...that we were really in before.</p>

<p>Wendy and I got into a bad cycle that we're getting out of. I really get into bad ways of dealing with people and I get uptight. So as soon as I'm with them it's all icky because I'm uptight and worried about it being icky. And so I just have to say that I just got into a bad cycle with them and I want to like...because it doesn't have to be that way. Oh, sh*t. It could be something really nice, but I'm already in this bad cycle, too. And I don't know how to break it, you know? I know I'm the only person who can. I mean it's not like...I mean I get (inaudible 0:27:57) to myself. I'm not blaming it on the cycles of the seasons or the year and the universe or anything. It's definitely me. But I just get into bad- [0:28:06]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's you, but it's not...it is something that is bigger than you in a sense and you can't just change it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's me feeding on me and my (inaudible 0:28:18). I mean because once things are not really good with somebody, I get worried instead of just like being, okay, so it isn't letting it pass in a new time, [same ending] (ph), some kind of rebirth. I just get into being very worried and uptight about it, which creates the cycle. I mean I don't obviously create the cycle, but I'm also a victim to it. I'm just like...I don't know.</p>

<p>He's also very far away from the political place that I'm trying to understand. And that's just very important to me and he's really confusing. There are so many contradictions in what I think and he points them all out and upsets me. And, I don't know. And politics keeps on making that realer and realer. Like, the FBI came to my house yesterday morning. The came and asked us billions of questions about all our friends and who we knew and took out pictures and asked us to identify people and asked us about the weather people and about going up to the Capitol. </p>

<p>And our telephone is tapped. I mean lots of the information that they had there was no other possible way they could have gotten it but through the telephone. We thought our phone was tapped for the past couple of weeks anyway because we've heard all sorts of (inaudible 0:30:01) like some warnings and stuff. We thought we were just being paranoid. </p>

<p>But it's just like he doesn't really understand me and he points out things like politics has to deal with ideologies, not with how people feel a lot of the time. And I keep on trying to say, "Well, that's old politics and there's really new politics being born and it does stem from people's feelings...from their anger and from their frustration and not just with Marxist and Leninist minds." I don't know, but it's just like I get really confused. [0:30:49]</p>

<p>And I called and I said something about the pigs and he said, "Well, just don't you see? Just calling somebody a 'pig' is just being really horrible. How can you do that?" And I realized that there's something basically icky about that, right? Before you know who they are or anything, you're just labeling them this animal. But another part of me says, "Well, they've chosen to take on this kind of job. They didn't have to do it and the job is a necessarily repressive one." And I don't know. I just get completely confused.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like in one way he's right and in one way he's wrong and you don't know how to put it together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And they're two really different ways of lifestyles, too, that go along. We're two different people...kinds of people in a [friend's way.] (ph) People who are into politics really are always talking and have like the necessarily, constantly-struggling consciousness, where his is very different. Although I can't say that he's blind or insensitive. I don't know. I don't know what to...I just have no idea how it will come together. And then I haven't been able to study at all. I just haven't been able to work a stitch. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that pulls your pieces apart more, too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And then also, for some reason my inside...I woke up this morning because I have an IUD and when I had the IUD put in, there was this very specific and really dreadful pain. And I woke up this morning with just like this stomach ache. It must have been my stomach ache because I know-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know stomach aches, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know it's either because I haven't slept enough, because I'm upset or because I'm not eating right. I can tell. I've got one of those Jewish stomachs, right? [0:33:03] </p>

<p>I had this weird stomach ache and I went to the bathroom and I'm bleeding. And I don't know what it is. I think it's the IUD, but I don't want to deal with it today and go to the hospital today. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's scary...scary that there's something wrong with the IUD and it's scary that you didn't want to deal with it and that it's still lingering around. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm also worried that I'm just being hypochondriac-y about it. </p>

<p>It's just like- (groans). It's like ninth...it's almost tenth week. Did I miss something already? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's half-written. You still have it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have no idea what I'm writing my paper...I have this big paper to write and I haven't even read any of the material for the course yet. I tried to sit down last night and read it and I just couldn't. I read the same page maybe four times without having...I had no (inaudible 0:34:17) about what this person was talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's happening with you? What's happening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just feels like I'm like in the middle of this thing that I just can't-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like there are just all these pieces just not getting together, unless I'm worried because I was completely and utterly ecstatically high when I left Dalia and Crispin and then 15 minutes later, I just felt completely and totally confused. And I was worried about being so happy because it seemed like...I don't know. And I just feel-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tossed around too much. One thing to the other and like how can you know where you are if you're changing all that fast? How can you know what you think about anything and how can you know what you feel? [0:35:32]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. One minute I'm rapping about the revolution to the [maroon] (ph) right, and talking about it. I mean I don't have any pretense of being any kind of revolutionary. I'm obviously billions of miles from that. But it's something that I want to get to be able to be in and understand when we look at the struggle (inaudible 0:36:00) and then the next minute, I'm talking to Jobe who has no comprehension of what I'm talking about. And suddenly it doesn't matter quite as much. Well, it does and it doesn't. I wanted to make him understand and to be there, too, but he isn't so I lose it in some way, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like it was...it had a certain place before. It was pretty important...quite important. And then it got less important and how did that happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes and no. It kind of...I mean it did. It got important. I had to come and bring it to him and try to make him understand it. And in some way I feel like how could I ever be close to anybody who isn't into that because it's so important to me? But then there's also a certain way that I was...it seemed in my head that I was talking almost apologetically about politics trying to justify it...justify something that 15 minutes ago, I was taking not only for granted but...or incredibly, almost most importantly important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like 15 minutes ago, you had this stuff as solid basic assumptions. Then you have- That gesture was too much. What do you do with it? You know, stop! Yeah, too much to cope with. [0:38:09]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know how to make sense of any of it. I don't know how to put it together. Also it just like bothers me that here I am getting into this f*cked up relationship, too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're in it. You're not controlling it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And some of me...I know that some of me feels a little bit of amazement and in this funny way, relief, that I'm in something that I'm not controlling it. Because lots of times...not control, but in a different way...I'm using the word differently than you just used it. Like, I definitely feel like I'm controlling Dexter. I can make him just worship me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And you like not to have that kind of control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I like not to have that kind of control. And it feels good to be more gutly (ph) mixed up with somebody in some way, but it's also so f*cked up that that kind of overrides that it's involvement.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels strange to be really caring about what's happening between him and me. But it's also because it's so f*cked up and I'm not sure. I mean I'm just feeling I'm getting farther from myself so it doesn't feel good. I don't know. I mean it's like...and I just feel ambivalent about absolutely everything. Everything that I even say has two sides to it. [0:40:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, I don't know. Like, you're in so much confusion already that I don't know. Somehow everything else is even more so. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how...and this thing about feeling like I'm not me really upsets me and I don't know what to do about owning it or how I just get rid of acting that way. A lot of this even I just...I think some of it feeling like it's not me is when somebody doesn't like me. I kind of disclaim what is that they're reacting to as not me. Because when I'm with Dexter, I still feel like it's me. I don't like it so much even though he does. I'm completely and utterly critical of it, but I still own that I'm this ego-full woman.</p>

<p>But somehow...but it...no, but it's...I don't know what you'd call it. I think it's really...I don't think it's so much that he doesn't like it. I think it's that it really feels alien to me. And I think probably there it tangles a little bit. [0:42:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's a funny deal because it's not...you can't...it's not of something that you can put your finger on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's not like a complete other person. It's not like another personality that I can say, well, I turn into this type of person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or even other characteristics that you can point to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just so peculiar or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think you understand as much as it can be understood. How do I not do that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. Does Jobe understand? That would help, I guess, if he did. It would already be a lot better. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I tried...I've said things. Like I told him that a lot of time with him, I don't feel like I'm being me. But he's just never seen me, I don't think. So it's just kind of well, I think he thinks it's a way of saying, well, things aren't good and the person that you don't quite like isn't me, which is really like who I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you see it sort of as a ducking out of responsibility or something? [0:43:50]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or something. Because I was saying something about...when he first started saying to me when I said something about just like I was so f*cked up right now and he said something like, "You know, you're only building on what you were," and that really hurt me. He said, "It's not like all of a sudden you're f*cked up and all of a sudden you won't be. It's like what you're growing into." I mean I don't know. I can't really explain what he said because he wasn't very clear about it. He (inaudible 0:44:23) Then it wasn't just like...I don't know. I don't even know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't know. Something about the way you said that made it seem like you're not, but you could be panicking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can feel this panic really (inaudible 0:45:21).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See. Let it come through some.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really scared (inaudible 0:45:35)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It'll cut you over or something. You can scream and make noise and that kind of stuff if you kind of feel it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really scared to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, because it just happened.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's because I don't have any way of getting out of it once I'm into it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, if you get into it more and more and more and more...it's like the world is going to fall apart or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like I have this really just (inaudible 0:47:52). I feel like there are two things that just...I'm being thrashed around by these waves and then these just really horrible screams.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Screaming.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but the screaming doesn't help. It doesn't relieve anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just like compounds it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So the screaming...it's like a horrifying sound.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just makes me like completely more panicked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And the thing is, it's not like once the scream happens...it's I don't know if I'm screaming or somebody is screaming at me. It's like it keeps on happening like (inaudible 0:49:28).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's just a horrible feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's something about terror in it, too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really scared. I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I'm scared of doing it and I'm scared of not doing anything. (inaudible 0:50:44) Because if I go outside and I go over to Cathy's house, (inaudible 0:50:53)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's not faceable either. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Also, I feel so much better when I feel I have control over it. Just like accepting it and being able to (inaudible 0:51:21) I don't feel like it wouldn't help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just one more kind of thing...you're pushed around by it and caught in it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really don't know what to do. I don't even know what to do next Monday. I didn't know what to do when I woke up. I don't know if I should run back and try to find Jobe and talk to him and see if that'll help. (inaudible 0:52:00) It's John's birthday. I really wanted us to go. And I can't imagine...I mean it just seems like there is such a discrepancy in terms of wishing somebody a happy birthday and (inaudible 0:52:19) [I'm somewhat really tired.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be so good just to rest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be really nice to wake up refreshed and nice to wake up and find out that none of this is really happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Get back into where it's like the ordinary world and you...things are familiar and everyday and regular and not this sort of cosmic terror...weird place. [0:53:55]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm feeling more (inaudible 0:54:34) It's just like (inaudible 0:55:38) I saw the split second of sane. I mean just like a second of sane, but I really (inaudible 0:55:54) I don't let myself get into it. I might (inaudible 0:56:01)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's like a door.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't even like let myself (inaudible 0:56:16) I just let myself see it. I mean-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Going in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can't even go anywhere near it. Do we have to (inaudible 0:56:44)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can stay a little longer if you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just really scared.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 0:57:53)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Are you making some kind of terms with what it's like to have a place like that or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just realizing that I haven't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You're taking it in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 0:59:30) a very strong image in my head...like a picture image of it. But I keep on trying not to because (inaudible 0:59:51)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you've moved up a little way from it now from being almost in the picture before to where it's a picture in your head (inaudible 1:00:11)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just like the second it occurred to me was the only second I was there and then quickly I put it away so it's a picture. I got very aware of sitting here (inaudible 1:00:33) on the chair and stuff. It's kind of my way of saying I'm not there, I'm really here. It really is a picture.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it really came...it's like...it's the simple, physical things that are real.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I'm scared of letting you get any closer. But then I just get...I feel very weird otherwise because I just feel incredibly controlled and I can feel (inaudible 1:01:58) being in control. That's not...that's not a nice feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you going to wander off into a cloud and (inaudible 1:03:46)?</p>

<p>(patient begins to cry)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a feeling that what you need to hear is someone to say, "Come in right here by the fireplace where it's nice and warm." [1:04:57] </p>

<p>You don't have...you need to have someone say you don't need to face it all by yourself.</p>

<p>(period of silence until 1:07:25)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's happening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 1:07:47)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Walking out the door not knowing what to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel like I want to walk out like that. And I feel (inaudible 1:08:35) okay, I know it happens all the time, but (inaudible 1:08:41) and you said you would stay with me, but you wouldn't when I asked you to do that. (inaudible 1:08:50)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   On the couch?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Just lie right down?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I feel very funny.  (5-Minute silence)

<p>I'm finding it very hard to focus.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Your thoughts, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhum.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   That's not required.  (Pause) The main requirement as I think I mentioned when you were here, is that you say whatever you're thinking out loud.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I suppose the main thing that I'm thinking is, uh, I think of this more in terms of saying things that bother me and you know, working out why -- you know, especially things that happen to be on my mind at the moment.  And I had a very nice day today, (chuckle) so I can't think of anything to say, (chuckle) which is sort of an example of a negative way I look at things, I suppose.  (2-Minute silence) It does make me think, though, the fact that in most situations when I feel a little bit uneasy I always think I talk too much and say too much and don't listen or think first.  And then now I can't.  I feel very funny about talking at all.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, it's hard to have so much freedom isn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Hmm.  Well, the other thing that happens is so many things fleetingly go through your mind.  And, and now just, you have to select something of what's passing through and, and you keep thinking, that's not really important or I guess a lot of things I feel sort of funny about saying.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It does make me think of something though that I began to think, realize more clearly than ever before, just this fall.  Uhm, that very often when somebody's just bringing up a subject in which I'm involved, I found myself very quickly becoming defensive and you know, almost saying, "I didn't do it" kind of thing and uhm, you know, immediately making excuses for something that, situation that doesn't (chuckle) even exist.  (Silence) So that made me wonder why I took things that way.  (2-Minute silence)</p>

<p>} I suppose another thing that's making it hard is uh I keep thinking there's a certain kind of thing to talk about here and I know I'm limiting myself very much when I think that way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, it's a little trick you play on yourself to make it possible to not say what you think.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I also keep thinking well, I have to say it the right way, think about, in other words it has to come into my mind and then I have to think about it awhile (chuckle) so I say it the right, you know, say it different ways in my mind so finally I say it the right way, (chuckle) which I never do in real situations.  (Chuckle) I usually say things too quickly.  (Silence)</p>

<p>One thing that has been on my mind, I suppose, well all the time, more specific than just my general relationship with people is how I get along with the boys that I'm teaching and the fact that in a way I just don't relate to them at all, you know, as people.  And that's -- as I've become more aware of it I've again tried to see how I could do something about it.  And I can't really see quite what happens that, that I don't really involve myself in conversations with them, truly involve myself in conversations with them, even though I do like them and I'm interested.  And I sort of have to keep consciously reminding myself that they're people to appreciate.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   They're 5 or 6 year old boys?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes, both 5 and 6.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Uhum.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And I think I feel more comfortable when I'm handling them as a group than if I'm handling, if I'm on an individual one to one relationship with them.  And I s--, I'm more aware of this now because, uhm, I have an assistant who is particularly good in one-to-one relationships, so that's I suppose her real strength.  So it's, you know, something that I suppose I've always known but I never really faced up to before.  And, and I can see that this is an area that I really do feel uncomfortable in -- and then it -- because it carries right on with anybody, older, younger people.  It's more of people making me feel at ease, then I can relate. But I don't really have, I can't initiate a --</p>

<p> (Pause) Yet I don't, I keep going over it thinking, "What is it?"  Because I really do have an interest in them, you know.  Now back to just the boys, and I do care what happens to them, but somehow there's something that's missing.  And, and, they're very quick, of course, to sense it too, which is probably why, another reason why I've begun to be able to see that I am doing this.  And I, and it does matter what mood I'm in.  If I've, if generally I feel that I'm handling things in my life and everything has been going happily, well then I, I suppose I almost do relate to them.  But it's when I'm feeling under pressure, which seems to be a lot (chuckle) of the time, then I can't and I get very dictatorial.   (Silence)</p>

<p>Because feeling under pressure I -- that's another thing I always wonder about -- because I don't know whether it's a matter of again being afraid I can't cope with things -- therefore being able to take only a few things at one time to handle -- or if it's just a matter of organization and I'm just not organized.  Because I'd be interested.</p>

<p>This year I'm doing more than I've ever tried to do before and, and right so far anyway, I don't feel as if it's too much.  So I somehow feel I can cope with things more and that's because probably I'm teaching again something I've already taught.  And, I think my husband is a little more understanding or less demanding or, I don't know, he seems to be anyway to me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And we have a new director under whom I work at school who seems to be uhm, particularly interested in the things that I think are important.  Last year I had -- it was a very difficult woman to work under.  And I guess I react a certain way anyway to women that I work under and assuming they don't always see me the way I am or are over critical, I don't know.  I, I've talked about this with my husband and even though I think I've worked under some very difficult women, he's always felt that it's more than that.  It's the way I see them as my supervisor (pause) as somebody to please.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think in a way it must, well, I'm sure it has something to do with how, how my relationship with my mother was.  But when I think about how she was -- well, first of all, she was very strict and I knew she had certain standards that I had to meet and some of those I found very hard.  But generally she wasn't openly critical except for you know, basic measures of discipline uhm, behavior that just had to be kept.  But other than that, there are a lot of things I know I was or did that she vaguely disapproved of in another person, but that she never would really say.  And I imagine just sensing it, I, it would be very upsetting to me.</p>

<p>The thing I think of right now is the way I'd handle money when we were given an allowance. And the only time I ever heard her really say anything, and she never did to me, was talking to a friend of hers.  And she made the comment that one daughter saved very well and handled money beautifully and the other daughter just -- I've forgotten how she put it -- but anyway, the money just went and the girl had no sense, which was me.  And, and I guess just that criticism anyway made me upset, but also knowing that these unspoken criticisms were always hanging over the, in the air.  And she'd never really would show pleasure either. And I suppose what I -- and this is something that I would get upset at in the supervisors -- that if I did something they liked, why couldn't they indicate it and not just assume that of course I would be doing those things.  And then I'd always be very fearful that I wasn't pleasing them too, and perhaps not, still maintain a certain independence and do what I thought was right.  And then I'd begin to be unhappy about that, so -- (pause)</p>

<p>Well, I still can't go home now visiting my parents without feeling very tense and upset in the family, especially if my husband comes too.  And I don't know why it's worse when he comes.  Except usually when he's there the whole family is there, including my brothers and sisters, my brother and sisters.  And very often if I'm there alone everybody else isn't there.  But, I know I feel competitive with my sisters, not so much with my brother.  And whenever there's a, any sizable group and there's a discussion, it seems to me, and I again could be imagining this, that uhm, neither of my parents particularly wants to hear anything that I have to say, which always gets very upsetting to me.  And usually I end up, up, feeling like having a tantrum.  I don't have one (chuckle) but I end up just feeling I can't control myself.  So I always have to leave.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   At the thought that they don't want to really listen, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes, that, that in a conversation I might start to say something and they'll either ignore me, whereas if somebody else starts to say something they would acknowledge that they're joining the conversation.  Or if I say something they treat it like well that's stupid and, you know, they won't pick it up or pay any attention to it.  They just kind of go on with their discussion as if I hadn't spoken.  And I don't know whether I imagine this or if it's really happening.  I just can't tell.  I've lost perspective on that.  But it just seems that every time there is any kind of a gathering at all with my parents, you know, so that you have -- and, and in my family, it's a very competitive thing to get into a conversation -- a lot of people have made comments about that, so that in itself is a kind of unfortunate situation.  But whenever it is really bad that way I just feel I can't handle it and I might imagine that, you know, they just don't want to hear me.  But really I'm just not fighting to get in.  I just don't know, but it always, I always think in terms of the fact that they don't want to listen to me.</p>

<p>And then there is the problem too that we don't agree on some things that are kind of important now in their way of thinking and in mine.  And I, they can hear other people say things that aren't agreeing with them, but I guess they just can't stand to have their own family saying things that are disagreeing.  And then I think maybe they keep feeling well, they have to train me, even now at my age, to think the way they do.  And they're very aggressive in these convers-- -- you know, something like a political discussion or on education -- now it seems as, like we always get into a fight, or just on a whole lot of things.  And even with friends of the family they're extremely aggressive and, and I think unkind to them about opinions that they don't share.  They, they aren't able to be open-minded at all and see that perhaps other people don't agree.  They just feel that what they think is right and there just can't be any way, any other way of thinking.  And I just, I just feel this is so unjust I, I don't know, it -- or maybe I say unjust because it lends something to the fact that I'm afraid they won't agree with me and that they'll attack me.  Because they really just attack somebody who disagrees and I never feel, I guess, strong enough to stand up under that.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I sort of resent it too because I think, on some things they, from having lived longer and seen how things can go, perhaps they're right.  But as a younger person, it seems that you have a certain amount of right to find out by mistake in thinking that you were mistaken, even if it involves others.  Because how can you ever get to a better level of thinking if you haven't made some mistakes first?  And the fact that they just don't seem to feel that that's even allowable, it has been very upsetting to me too.  They keep, you know, they'll maintain, "Well, we know because we've lived longer" or, "We went through the depression" is one of their -- I guess the depression is very much on their minds because it was a hard time for both of them, as it was for many people.  But they seem to feel that as a younger generation we haven't had to suffer and that it would be good for us to because then we'd appreciate some things and think in a different way.  And almost, you know, now it strikes me it's almost like they resent us because we didn't, haven't gone through something like that yet, and that things have come very easy to our generation.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's always made me wonder what my mother might have been like because I remember once thinking that I -- I suppose I'd been with some friends and their mother, mothers, had been fooling around with us and my mother never did feel at ease doing that with me and my friends -- and then it made me think that I'd never really seen her joke and laugh in the family at all.  She was just so grim, as if there were just so many things she had to do all the time and hated doing every single one of them.  And then after we were kind of on our own, even if we weren't actually living away from home, but, that, when she could relax more and had more free time she, she did loosen up and I don't know, a whole other side of her appeared.  It always made me wonder how much was just having had to really struggle at one point.  Maybe she took so much on and then, and just couldn't maintain what I would consider her better self.</p>

<p>And my father is kind of apt to be that way too, although he would joke around with the family a lot, but in a way he is kind of a grim person too.  And then I would think, well, I don't want to be like them.  (Chuckle) I guess the most upsetting thing is to see I sort of am.  (Pause) For instance my father would, or does find it very hard -- he loves to play practical jokes -- but he finds it very hard to uh, laugh at any jokes, or just, you know, comments that are kind of making fun of him, not really even very sharply.</p>

<p>And I realize that I'm sort of the same way that way, that I'm very slow to realize when a joke is being made, either involving me or about me, which is just a silly little thing and I should be able to laugh at it.  And he's very unable to uh, well I guess, well sometimes he isn't, but it seems generally he's, he's unable to make light conversation and just , you know, have fun with conversation and words, things like that.  And I, and I realize that I do too.  And, and I've always been very envious of people who can just kind of play around with words and quip and any type of light conversation, some of which I suppose is just stupid.  And, and there is no reason I should be envious if I find that I'm uncomfortable doing it, but, because I can't, I always have felt that way.  So at a cocktail party or that type of thing where you're fleetingly meeting people and you can't really carry on a conversation at all, I am inclined to just immediately try to plunge into something and get too serious.  And of course that just doesn't go.  (2-Minute silence)</p>

<p>When I think of the feeling of competition I have in my family -- I used to think it was mainly with my younger sister who is a little bit different from the general pattern that we followed in our family.  And she's now in PYKK (a foreign country) and will be married there and probably be living there or perhaps out of the United States for either all her life or quite a bit of time.  And I can remember thinking I was -- well, if I'm perfectly honest -- I was very glad in a way, although I am fond of her, because I felt, well now I won't feel all this competition.</p>

<p>But, well the next thing (chuckle) that happens is when I was in PTN where my parents have a house my oldest sister who has two children was up there.  And, and in, in the sense that my younger sister was always -- I felt favored because she seemed to be different and have talents that none of the rest of us seemed to have in music and art -- my older sister has always been more sensible and done things the way my parents think they should be done, even more than I have, although I followed fairly closely.  And again I felt the same kind of competition so I guess I just feel it no matter who's there.</p>

<p>And she's also -- I suppose I get defensive there too -- because she's married a man who's established in PNOTS and is fairly well off, was, through inheritance.  And, I don't know, it's just the kind of person my family feels, well, that, that sort of justifies everything they did with us and it's kind of a step up from where they were.  And since my husband is quite different I don't know, I guess I feel sort of defensive about that -- the fact that they seem to feel this other son-in-law is so much better in many ways and more admirable and somebody to be listened to and things like that.  Which is all kind of really a reflection on how I feel about myself.</p>

<p>But the thing, another thing that disturbs me is when, for instance, my sister is talking and everybody seems to be paying attention and so forth, and I listen to what she's saying and I, on the one hand I'm saying to myself, "Well, must be pretty good what she's saying if everybody is paying attention the way they are and must be pretty interesting."  So then I convince myself I'm interested and that it was one of the wisest things I've ever heard.  But then on the other hand I get very upset at myself for feeling that way, because very often it's a, not a very big thing at all, and it's repeated and you know, it's sometimes not even interesting.  And yet I don't have the strength to just feel about it the way I might feel about it no matter who was saying it.</p>

<p>And this then goes beyond that to friends I have.  I can think of several friends where the -- well, for instance in couples that are friends of ours -- where the girl is quite a strong individual.  And I'm always consciously saying to myself, "Now don't get pushed around.  Think what you think and say what you think," and things like that.  And it just seems I have to constantly keep that in mind or else I feel as if I'm sort of a jellyfish.  (Pause)</p>

<p>One thing I do do.  I'm always hesitant to, if I know I'm going to disagree with somebody -- sometimes I guess I'm afraid to even think the things that might disagree with somebody -- but if I do, I'm hesitant, I hesitate to say them or if it's a plan and I think something else should be done, I hesitate to say it, because I keep thinking well, maybe I'll hurt their feelings. But then I wonder if it's just a something I tell myself so that I won't have to admit that I'm really just kind of afraid to say things that I think.  (2-Minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Did something occur to you that you were afraid to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, I was just thinking, (chuckle) some of the things that pass through my mind, I just feel sort of stupid (chuckle) saying them because they just seem so silly.  Maybe I am afraid to say them.  Uhm, I was thinking about --</p>

<p>ANALYST:   -- how they'll sound.  You're afraid they'll sound stupid?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I guess so, in a way.  In a way they just seem like, well, (stammers) "How important are they really?"  But maybe that's because I've been telling myself they're not really important.  I was thinking of uhm, going from, I can't even remember what I stopped talking about, but the fact that in just general conversations I, I guess I'm often thinking in terms of, "Can I say, add anything to it?" or "Am I ever going to have anything to say?" or "Do I understand what they're talking about?"  So that then I never really am listening to what they are talking about or just involving myself without even being conscious of it.</p>

<p>And it occurred, then it occurred to me that one thing I always feel very uncomfortable at is if I am going to say something and as much as I -- well, for instance, as much as that my family, I want my family to listen to me and want to hear what I have to say.  On the other hand, or people in general, on the other hand, I feel very uncomfortable when (chuckle) everybody stops talking and listens to me and I, I just can hardly talk then when, when that happens.</p>

<p>And, uh, that made me think of an incident awhile back.  We were at a wedding and after the wedding we went to a party given by one of the, uhm, ushers and it just happens that, well, I've, occasionally now I've smoked cigars because I find it very hard to smoke cigarettes without having a really sore throat.  And I do like the taste of cigars and once in a while I just feel like smoking while people are drinking.  I suppose, again because then I can do something and I don't have to worry about the fact that I'm sitting there quietly.  And anyway, when I took this cigar, of course there were several comments.  And I really, at the time I probably in a way knew it would make a sensation and I was going to enjoy it.  But on the other hand, contradicting that, I don't like it when I do get the attention, because then I never feel I can handle it or know what to say or anything.  But anyway, this was a very fleeting thing because I didn't make anything of it.</p>

<p>There was a girl there who became very jealous of the fact that I had gotten this attention.  And she was a type of girl that has to have it all the time and was dancing and doing things by herself so that everybody would look at her.  And she was very good, and I, and I sincerely felt I was enjoying it.  But later, but every time she had a chance she would make a very sharp or nasty comment to me, some of which passed over me, because at the time it just didn't occur to me that she would have been jealous of those 2 seconds that people hadn't been paying attention to her.  Then I was kind of aware there was a certain antagonism and maybe I felt some for her, I don't know, because at the time I thought I was sincerely enjoying her act and thinking, "Wouldn't it be nice if I could be that free?"</p>

<p>But afterwards my husband was joking to me about it and I just, I couldn't decide how I felt, you know, whether I was, you know, pleased that I got the attention or pleased I made, I was able to make her jealous for the little bit I got, when I usually feel I am sort of a wallflower or a mouse, or something.  I, I don't know, I was just thinking about how I felt about it.  (Pause) Also I mean it just seems like sort of a silly thing to -- I guess I feel sort of embarrassed that, when I even think about something (chuckle) like that.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time is up.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I wondered if I could talk to you sometime about the time too, or did you want to --</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Bring it up any time.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, in here? (Chuckle)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Right.  Ok?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Ok.  (Chuckle)</p>

<p> Will it take quite a while to get used to this?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   We'll see.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Is this the door?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Right, this is the door.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Good-by.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Good-by.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause, Sigh, Pause) Uhm, well, I'm thinking some more about what I'm wearing, because uhm, it was a debate I had with myself today.  Uhm, I'm meeting MSCZ after I leave here, and when I had first thought about what I would wear tonight, I had planned to wear this.  And then, and I don't know, I guess I thought, I just hadn't thought about the fact I couldn't go home in-between.  Uhm, but lately, whenever we've done anything after here, I've gone home and changed, so that I guess that's why I was thinking that way.</p>

<p>And then when I realized I couldn't, (Sigh) I was thinking, well, I can't wear this.  Uhm, I don't know, you know, I'd, I guess I just thought, well, it's just not, it's just too dressy, or something.  Or maybe there's some other reason, that's what I was kind of wondering right now.  Because I feel as if I, you know, sort of dared myself to go ahead and wear it.  Because I was thinking, well, I can't see why I shouldn't wear it, i, if that's what I planned to wear.  Uhm, but I feel self-conscious about it.  And —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, when I, you know, up until getting here, I was, you know, fairly relaxed about it.  But once I saw you, I think I started feeling, well, I really wanted to attract your attention.  I don't know i—, that's an, I was thinking about yesterday, and uhm, I, I think I was sort of gradually working myself into this frame of mind when I was still here.  But it didn't quite seem clear to me until I left.  That, you know, I was sort of thinking, well this is ridiculous for me to be in this kind of state.  And I know I can survive, and i—, you know, I kept thinking, well, the whole question really comes down to whether or not I think I can get along without you, and not some of the side issues that I kept thinking up.And I guess it still bothers me that I, you know, keep going up and down, up and down.  But, uhm, I don't know, I felt (Sniff) well, more in control in a good kind of a way, you know, not as if I were falling apart, and as if I were desperate, and uhm, frantic, and so forth, by last evening.  And uhm, I don't know, I even had a dream I thought was kind of amusing, because it certainly f, fits right in at this time.  But then, (Sigh) uhm, and today, I was certainly feeling much more effective of, about the different things I was doing.  But then, when I start feeling this way, over what I wore, you know, I just think, well now here I go again, just my moods seem to go up and down so fast.</p>

<p>But the dream I had was uhm, (Sigh) uhm, I don't know how it started, because I'm wondering if it started with me being a male, I'm not sure.  In any case, uhm, i, it began sort of, there was somebody uhm, and that was not me, or somebody I knew, who had found what was called the belt of a god.  And th, there was some issue about it, and I ah, (Sigh) this person who'd found it was guarding it, and uhm, I can't remember why it was a question whether or not he should keep it.  But anyway, he was.  And (Sigh) I, I can't remember if I were the person telling somebody else, or if I were the one being told, in the dream.  But somehow I got involved.</p>

<p>And the part I remember most clearly, was my being in that house where this belt was, or I don't know, an, another term would be more appropriate, I think.  Something of the sort the Greeks used to wear, the Greek women wore, actually.  Uhm, and th—, (Sigh) the man who had found it had gone out, and it was almost as if I were his daughter then, or some other relationship.  And uhm, at that point I was a female, and there was a male who was involved.  And I don't know whether he was trying to get it because it w—, you know, it could be put in a museum, or (Sigh) no—, it wasn't just for personal use, I don't think.  </p>

<p>But uhm, in any case, it just became very clear to me that this was a very dangerous and bad thing.  And that it should just be thrown out, because of what it was going to be doing to everybody.  Uhm, so I threw it out.  And the belt was, was made of gold, but I think it was, you know, as if it were a snake wrapped into a belt shape.  And uhm, anyhow, I just took it that it was as if I were throwing out any wish for your strength, for your penis, or maybe penis, period.  Uhm, and that when the dream started, it wa—, it was a questions whether or not to keep it, o, or how to keep it if it were kept.  </p>

<p>And I don't know, but now when I think about it, I was thinking something that didn't occur to me when I was thinking about it before, that I threw it out while this man — whatever my relationship was with him, I can't, I don't know — was out.  And I think I threw it out despite what uhm, it was a younger man who was somehow working with me, whether or not he had told me about it, or I had told him, or you know, whatever it was.  Uhm, my decision went against what he wanted, too.  So I was sort of doing something uhm, that 2 men didn't, wouldn't want me to do.  Although this younger man, I think in the dream he wasn't so, you know, it was just sort of like a, a decision had finally been resolved.</p>

<p>Uhm, (Silence) I don't know, I think I, I was thinking again of, you know, my (Sigh) uhm, trying to throw things out, recently.  Uhm, and how I fluctuate o, on that.  And I don't know, just somehow, it seemed like a very s—, it was a very similar thing.  Because sometimes my mood is, I don't need this stuff, and why can't I just toss it all out?  And then other times my mood is, well what if someday I need it?  And what if, you know, the secret is here, or the answer that I'll be searching for, or something like that.  And uhm, (Pause) well, I think when I was thinking about it just now, I was just thinking, well I haven't really made it yet, in, you know, I have not thrown out everything that I think I can throw out, without any loss whatsoever.  </p>

<p>And some of it I'm aware of, because I just came across, I was cleaning out a closet yesterday.  Uhm, and I knew I had a box of something in there.  But, I actually didn't have the box.  I thought I did, and I found out in trying to find out where that stuff was (Sniff) that I had actually thrown out some things that I hadn't remembered that I threw out, sometime this winter.  Uhm, you know, which I was glad about.  I didn't have any, well, I wonder what I threw out, will I miss it.  I was just relieved that it was 1 less thing that I had thought I still had to go.</p>

<p>But uhm, but I found another box (Laughs) with not very much in it, but uhm, I'm quite sure most of what was in it could be thrown out.  And uhm, you know, so I just have this feeling, I ca—, I don't (Sniff) seem to quite be able to get this job done.  And even of the stuff I've gone through, I'm sure that if I went through it again in another year, I'd find more things to throw out.  And uhm, well I guess I was just sort of hoping, some day I'll finish all this.  </p>

<p>And (Sigh) well, it probably just all gets back to what was bothering me yesterday.  And you know, how, how, I don't know how to put it, but, you know, sort of, strongly can I really feel that I can get along without you, and don't need your strength?  Or uhm, (Sigh) I mean, I suppose it depends on the day, what it is I'm thinking particularly I need.  </p>

<p>And (Sigh) I don't know, it just bothered me that I could have spent the day yesterday i, in coming here, feeling the way I did.  I r—, I really felt depressed, and, and then h—, still through it all have a very strong feeling of, you know, sort of, it was ridiculous.  But I didn't feel it was ridiculous, well I don't know whether it was I was talking about it here, or uhm, (Stomach growls) or, you know, just that finally I was going to start feeling it was ridiculous, it must be that I was talking about it here.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was thinking about something else too, th—, sort of 2 things that have just happened.  Uh, this morning, we've had a plant that's, well, it had s—, there were several plants in one pot, all the same type.  And uh, first it was (Sigh) originally that there were 4 plants, and last summer one or two died, I can't remember which.  In any case, MSCZ repotted the plants and put in another of that same type that I had had singly, and, and that one was doing the best of the whole lot.  And the whole arrangement looked all right, and I didn't think anything of it until a 3rd, another plant in that new pot, uhm, died of the same thing the others had last summer.  And now it seems that the fo—, the last one of the original set is dying, and uh, and so the question is whether or not the other one has already been diseased. </p>

<p>And so I've been thinking about getting it out, but it's in a very big pot, and so, and it's the kind of thing MSCZ always has done, and I usually just pot smaller things.  So, you know, my thought was, well, I'll get the soil, but then MSCZ can do it.  And his feeling was, if I want it done, why can't I do it?  And i—, and it really is quite reasonable.  But he said something about it quite sharply this morning.  And uhm, well I didn't like his speaking sharply like that.  But I was thinking, well, really, why do I have this attitude I can't do it?  Ah, it's just that, something, it's something he's done, but I'm being rather narrow just to think he's the only one that can do it.</p>

<p>And then, uhm, last night I was trying to figure out just what I had (Sigh) discussed with FNI. She'd called on uhm, I think it was Friday, asking if we could see them on Sunday.  And I had said I didn't think so.  And uh, you know, but that I'd check with MSCZ, to see if he wanted to, because I didn't think we'd be back in the city in time.  And I'd call her only if we could, and I had set a deadline by the time I called, so there'd be no confusion.  </p>

<p>And then she started going through this week, saying, can we see them here, or there.  Uhm, but then she wasn't sure MW would want to, because they're doing other things.  And uh, I know it started with their wanting to see us tonight, but we couldn't, because we already had tickets for something.  But uhm, anyhow, it ended up that I think I was really honestly confused about what had been settled, and whether I was supposed to be calling FNI, or she, me, or it didn't matter one of us calling the other.</p>

<p>In any case, I was sort of saying something to MSCZ, and he got really mad — this was last night — and said that he thought it was just, you know, it was my doing it.  I think he said, "Well, if you think about it, I'm sure you'll remember."  I said, "Well, what do you mean?"  He said, "You are always confusing things when it's with FNI.  It's just something you do with her relationship with you."  </p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, a, and you know, and then I was thinking about it, and I was thinking, well, I really was confused.  I, in the end, called her, but she was not a—, she h, hadn't expected me to be calling before, and had sort of, I think, dropped the idea of our getting together, uhm, in the way she had presented it last week.  And when I called her (Clears throat) I called with just the attitude of well, I'll, I have certain things in mind that would be possible for me, and I'm not going to get into something that I really don't want to.  </p>

<p>Uhm, because when she had asked us about Sunday, I don't know why I even hesitated.  Uhm, you know, I said no for tonight, because it was just obvious.  And then, but then I hesitated about Sunday.  And uhm, later FRA called to see if we could bring FSOZ to a party on Sunday, and I didn't have any hesitation.  I knew that, well of course I've been thinking about this thing with FNI and decided it wouldn't be possible.  But also I can just deal more directly with FRA.  And uh, you know, I realize, that with FNI, uhm, I don't know whether it was that I wanted to say no, or just what it is that I wanted to do.  </p>

<p>But uhm, I, you know, in thinking about it, what MSCZ had said, it is true.  I'm always, uh, acting as if I don't know what I want.  You know, I'm hesitant, and uh, indecisive, you know, especially over the times when I've wanted to say no.  Uhm, or in this case it wasn't that I particularly wanted to say no, it was just that I knew it wouldn't be possible. </p>

<p>But uhm, (Pause) and also, I'd built up, I'd — finally it's turning out they're going to come to our house tomorrow night.  And I was surprised when they accepted.  Because I had built up this thing that they didn't want to come to our house, and I don't know why I'd build that up, either.  Unless, you know, it was sort of like, well how would they want to come to our house, because it was so inferior to theirs, especially in the summertime, when they have a terrace and uhm, and if they're not outside they have air conditioning.  We don't. </p>

<p>And I think it was combined with the fact that some of the last times they did come to our house, uh, I took it that they were rude, or MW was rude.  I don't think it was FNI so much.  And it just seemed to me, he didn't really want to be there.  And I th—, I guess what I did was decide not ask them, unless we were having more people, so that, you know, if they wanted to be rude, it wouldn't be so noticeable.  It wouldn't bother me so much.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And maybe, uh, I don't know, I was still thinking, well why, why couldn't I just be — it was such a simple thing in that it wasn't even a case of my thinking, well, I just don't want to see them.  But I still couldn't say something definite about Sunday, and you know why, because i, it's a pattern, it wasn't just this particular call with FNI.  </p>

<p>Uhm, and I was thinking, well maybe it's too, that lately it seems as if FNI's always calling, trying to get together.  And uh, we aren't calling, probably because we have less of a strong feeling about getting together with them, than we used to.  And maybe, this is why she's calling more, I don't know.  But it does seem as if she's always calling and uhm, I don't know, maybe underneath it all, I have some kind of a feeling of, sort of, stop bothering us.</p>

<p>Because I, I, I kn—, I do have a feeling of wanting to get free of whatever the old relationship was.  (Silence)  And (Laughs) I was thinking, I have this feeling as if there, uhm, a strange feeling about this weekend.  You know, I, I've had a feeling of time pressing, and uhm, not wanting to waste any time, this whole summer.  And not do things like resisting, a, and just not thinking the way I'd spent so much time, at one point, or several points.</p>

<p>And, but just now I was thinking, well, there must be something that I'm still missing in uhm, you know, my relationship with FNI, or what happened yesterday.  And then I think, b—, I'm sure there really isn't.  And I was thinking again of the feeling I had yesterday, about the end not being what I had imagined it to be.  Uhm, or, at least, you know, near the end.  And I was just thinking again today, that I, I don't have this feeling all the time.  But I was just having it now of, one of my fantasies had been that at some point near the end, or the last day, you would, you know, say some, one pithy wise thing that would, you know, be like giving me the gift (Laughs) that I've been looking for, that would carry me through my life.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   The golden belt.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh, 2-minute silence) Well, I, I guess I stopped partly just because I was uhm, wondering, you know, in the dream it just seemed to me I had thrown it out without uhm, too much problem deciding whether or not to.  And when I finally became this female who threw it out — and I don't know what I was before in the dream — and uh, so then I'm wondering, well, did I, you know, how much did I really (Laughs) throw it out?  I'm now thinking about what wise thing you're going to tell me that will stay with me all my life.</p>

<p>And then I thought of, you know, just sort of, well, it's kind of a couple of things.  Because I, I do think of it still, if I think of it, you know, in this way, as, you know, sort of the death th—, scene, the separation.  And uhm, I don't know, so many, I mean, it's kind of like a 19th century deathbed scene with the father giving his family his words of wisdom before he dies, or something like that.</p>

<p>And uhm, then I, I don't know, I was just thinking of my mother doing it, at a number of occasions, but the one that stands out in my mind is when I got married and was, you know, leaving.  Not that I would never see her again, but it was kind of as if she saw this to be her opportunity, that never again would I be quite in the relationship that I was with her.  Uhm, that was when she said, you should keep your, something like, keep your own counsel.  And uh, whether I agree with it or not, it certainly has stuck with me.  I me—, you know, I've remembered that she said that.  Uhm — </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, I, I suppose that could even be translated.  It might have had some other overtone, like keeping your own counsel really meaning, hang on to your secret thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well, because that's how I, a, at some point later, when I had thought more about it, I thought of it, you know, as keep your own counsel, so then you can have the kind of power that I have worked out having in the family.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I don't think it was so much, you know, that I think, oh, these are the words I'm going to live by.  I never felt that I wanted to live by them, although at the time when she said them, they just made me angry, I didn't know why.  Uhm, but it's just kind of like I, you know, I guess I've always had it in my mind that those are the appropriate occasions to say something.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, supposing you're my speech writer.  What would you, what words would you put in my mouth?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Laughs, Pause) I don't know, I've thought of it 2 ways.  One is that it would have to be, something I can't think of, because it would have to be a surprise, you know.  I don't know, I mean, I never would have thought of what my mother said.  Wh—, you know, again, I don't know why I keep bringing that up, since I never agreed with it.  </p>

<p>But uhm, then the other way I've thought of it, is (Sigh) you know, that you would somehow, reassure me that I actually will make it, you know, from your standpoint.  Which is, uhm, I don't know whether I take it, you know me better than I know myself, or you know human nature better than I do, or just what.  But, you know, in any case, you were to reassure me that I will be OK.  </p>

<p>Uhm, and if I think of it that way, I think, well, just the fact you are in agreement with my ending, must mean that you think that, so I don't know why I have to hear you say it.  Uhm, so it is sort of, just feeling that I, (Sigh) so, some words that are i, in, and you know, the fact you've said things all these years, isn't the same.  But it's that, you know, it's as if these words are going to be your gift to me, in some way.  Uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   The ones I have withheld until the last day. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, as you've said, you are persistent.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I don't know, I was just wondering about that.  Because, you know, it's something that has bothered me, uhm, I find it so hard to control, th, this kind of persistence.  And you know, not giving up, and I don't know quite why I'm so persistent, despite everything.  And I don't know, in a way, this is kind of, it's gotten into the form of sort of a game or something at this point.  So I was thinking, well, last night, I wouldn't be feeling this way.  Uhm, and in fact, I haven't been thinking this way recently, until just now.  So it's almost as if I'm playing a game.  </p>

<p>But there is an element to my kind of persistence that uhm, well, a—, you know, I really feel, I don't, it's almost as if it gets out of my control, or, I mean, I know it really doesn't.  Because if I don't want to persist, I won't.  But uhm, you know, it's just this, I can't give up.  I can never seem to give up, no matter how clear it is I should.  And uhm, well it's something that, either I am providing the model for FSO, or else whatever led me to be that way is leading her to be that way.  And I don't know which it is, but I see it in her and it bothers me.  And uhm, you know, I don't know how to deal with it in myself, exactly.  So then, I don't know what to do to help her.  </p>

<p>Uhm, (Pause) because I don't know, it's almost like I know, a—, when I say it, it's like a game now.  Last night my feeling was, I know I don't need you.  I know that, you know, maybe I would still like to continue this, or have your support at times wh—, that might be kind of difficult, but I know I don't need it.  And uhm, and, you know, so then if I know all this, why would I persist?  But it's kind of like, well, you know, can I still wheedle something out of you, or something like that?  Or it's always worth another try.  And I don't know why I — (Silence) </p>

<p>Well maybe i, it comes because I was thinking, well, I'm better with MSCZ than I used to be.  Uhm, an, and so then it seems to come down to that I can accept more readily, basically, not having my own way.  You know, sometimes it, it isn't that he's going to have his way, and so therefore I can't have mine.  But just whatever it is, it does seem to uhm (Sigh) get down to my accepting that I, on some small thing, that I can't have my own way.  And uhm, because it just isn't so important to me anymore.  (Pause, Sniff, Sigh, Pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know, you know, and I, th, think well, I know I don't need those words, or, you know, your power, or your penis, or a penis.  Uhm, the way I was feeling yesterday, and the way I let myself feel part of the weekend, uhm, I do—, (Sigh) you know, the, then I think, well, if I don't need all that, how could I let myself start feeling that way?  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, maybe, you know, partly you were depressed instead of crying.  Maybe you're really trying to avoid feeling sad and crying.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Yeah, well I did feel that way yesterday.  And I was just thinking about a story I read to FSOZ today, that uhm, usually when I read it I try to gloss over these 2 parts, because I just felt, well, she's, you know, if I put any emotion in the way I read them, well then, she'll be bound to get quite upset.  It's, the first story of Babar, his losing his mother, and then uhm, later when he decides to go back to the jungle and leave the old lady.  </p>

<p>And uh, FSOZ had, kn, knows the story well enough, so she was anticipating being upset when the mother was killed.  But I think I read it with more feeling today, or more desire to confront that particular uhm, point in the story, and the emotions involved.  An, and she got, I mean, she was handling it, but, you know, she was clearly upset about it.  And uh, then when he was deciding to go back to the jungle, and he was sad about leaving the old lady, and uhm, that part was, you know, the most meaningful to me.  Because it was kind of like, well he knew this was the decision for him to make, but he still had to leave the lady who had been important to him for awhile.  (2-minute silence, Sigh)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking about uhm, I don't know what, something I have understood in a different way since my grandmother died, because she was really the first one to die of anybody that meant anything to me, very, you know, emotionally I suppose, an emotional level.  And uh, I don't know, I think I'd always had the idea that if somebody died that was important to you, you know, you had to throw yourself into mourning, in some way, so that you just never were free from missing that person.  And that maybe it was just a way, well I don't know why I would have thought that way.  </p>

<p>But uhm, I guess I was thinking of this, because in, in this story while Babar is living with the old lady, he every once in a while thinks about his cousins in the jungle and misses them, and then he misses his mother and feels very sad.  And I was thinking, well, sometimes I, some little thing will make me think of my grandmother, and I'll feel very sad.  Uhm, but life did not stop for me in any way.  And uhm, well, it's just different, I guess, than what I had ever imagined.  (Clears throat)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What do you imagine thinking about me after we're finished? /</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I guess sometimes I've thought, well I might be wondering what you're doing now.  Uhm, but I think mostly, knowing how I've been the last, at least couple of summers when I came back from PTN after not seeing you, uhm, I don't know, I think I imagine that I probably wouldn't even think of you until I got depressed over something.  You know, like yesterday.  And then, or insecure, some problem that I just was finding very hard to handle, and it would lead me to feel insecure and not confident.  And then I'd, think, oh, I wish I could go to you.  You know, sort of, you would take care of me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because then I think, well, this weekend when I kept thinking about you, a, and you know, even considered the possibility that we were staying in your house, which was, there was absolutely no way, you know, that it was reasonable for me to think that.  Uhm, I'm just wondering now, whether that really is just part of my perhaps being more curious than I'm admitting.  I mean, I know I was one day, when I was thinking about questions I'd asked you.  But, you know, it involved then, wondering well, what was your life outside of here.  And  I guess I'm thinking, well that I, if I think of you at all, I guess I'd probably still wonder.  </p>

<p>I—, I think it used to bother me to think of somebody else being here at this time.  But I don't, uhm, I don't know, it's not something I've thought about lately.  I don't know if it still does, or not.  (Pause) Except then I think, well, if I were your speech writer, and what you could say to me (Laughs) another thing would be for you to tell me to come back and see you any time I wanted.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was thinking about uhm, you know, anticipating feeling insecure over something.  You know, I'm sure I won't have completely even gone after I stop coming here.  But I, I hope I won't have quite as intense a feeling of needing to come back as I'm imagining right now.  </p>

<p>And uhm, (Sigh) well then I think, well what, if I don't feel that, on occasion, and so then if I'm busy living my n—, life, and managing, I'm thinking, w—, then it would be almost like forgetting you.  And that really disturbs me.  I think, well, I can't forget you.  And in one way I know  I won't forget you, but on the other hand, I might not be thinking of you every minute, and needing you.  And I can't see—, you know, I don't always make that distinction of uhm, you know, if I'm not thinking about you and needing you, then I, it's as if I've forgotten you.  </p>

<p>PATIENT: Something happened Friday right when I left which completely surprised me and I think it made me sort of relate things.  Uhm, as soon as I was (clears throat) on the street the first thought that came into my mind was that (stammers) during the times I've been sitting there waiting before I came in here, that perhaps you were doing it so you could see how I would react to waiting and that maybe you were keeping me waiting (chuckle) on purpose.  And that was the first thought that came to my mind when I went out.  And so it made me —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Have, have I, have I kept you waiting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think probably I've been early.  (Chuckle).  But thi—, this was my reaction and the —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: — was completely a surprise to me that, I was just wondering if I remember on Friday I was feeling uhm, well, that I wasn't getting anywhere with a lot of the times when I was thinking of things and uhm, you had recalled that on Wednesday I had at the end of the time said I wouldn't be in on Thursday and that perhaps this had been on my mind right through holding things up, and so it just, I wondered if this thought had been in my mind all Friday and, because as soon as I got outside it came to me.  And I, I wasn't thinking about waiting here or anything.  And I just wondered if, you know, that there might be some connection.  And my reaction to the man that I passed coming in here was a similar type of thing, that he, he came out right after you were called and so I was just positive he came out to look at me (chuckle) and see who I was.  (Pause) And I think it's times like that that the thought this is being taped bothers me.  It's the only time I even think about it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, what occurs to you about that then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that somebody else could actually hear exactly what I'd said without any possible change that you might make or you know, anyway it would be exact wording and then, then come out and take a look at me and that disturbs me.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  So you thought the fellow who came out may be would know about you or —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Aha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And probably partly because of the way he did it.  I, I mean I always will get this feeling to some extent when people go by after I'm waiting there, but uhm it was more the way he came out and just looked and then went right back in again but (pause) but my hope, but after realizing that I just wanted to (chuckle) laugh, I don't know why I wanted to laugh.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Another thing that has been on my mind all weekend and it's well, one of these things that I decided I wanted to bring up when I got here, uhm.  MSCZ and I went up to my parents home in PTN and we didn't see them until Saturday evening but, uhm, I had a very, well I always get kind of nervous when I go up.  And this time I really just didn't feel that I wanted to see them at all.  Sometimes I'm eager to see them, even though I get nervous, but I really just had no desire to see them this time because I just felt we'd talk about the same things, we'd go through the same patterns and unless other people were there to be sort of buffers it would end up being very upsetting, and Saturday morning I woke up with a headache and there was no reason I should have a headache at all, but it just seemed to get worse and worse during the day and I began to do all the little things I do if I'm not feeling completely physically alright, complaining and things and that always annoys MSCZ, so he would in return be annoyed with me which only made me feel worse and feel I was more justified in complaining and then finally I managed to get rid of the headache.  I was taking some aspirin or something and I realized all along that it could have something to do with the tension I was feeling about just seeing my parents.  But then at supper I got a really bad sort of stomachache, or not, not exactly a stomachache but just suddenly again I had all these sort of a sharp pain in my stomach which lasted through the evening and then woke me up at night and then that was gone the next day.  And there were sort of times when I was afraid they might —, either might reoccur but it just seems as if it must have been connected somehow with the fact that I was with my parents.  But I wasn't aware once I was with them of being terribly upset.  I didn't have any time when I re—, I really felt terrifically upset and that I couldn't handle how I was feeling as I do sometimes when I see them.  And in fact I found that I could, when a subject came up that I just knew would be the type that would bother me I found that I could either let it, let them go on it and not let it bother me or else I could just not develop it and change it and sort of be constructive in a conversation and so I was kind of, feeling sort of pleased that things were going as well as they were.  And then it surprised me that I was having these physical reactions if that's what it was.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I think it does disturb me that there just doesn't seem to be anything that can be talked about that either you can't anticipate their reaction or that you haven't already talked about and you've had a well worn reaction from.  But then also uhm MSCZ and I went to a football game and at one point, which I was, my parents were also at the game but we didn't meet them and uhm one point when I was looking across the stand I saw this bare—, very vaguely a white haired lady and her general shape made me think of my mother, but, but it wasn't because my mother doesn't have white hair and for some reason I began to think of my mother as being old and this upset me very much too.  And I didn't know then whether it would because them being more healthy and having more life ahead of me I would feel life in a way that she couldn't anymore and, and that it was kind of a sad thing which you feel with old age anyhow.  Or whether it was feeling that as an old woman she wo—, wouldn't be around to be in a relationship of mother to me anymore.  I, I just couldn't understand why I was reacting that way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: She wouldn't be around anymore?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well —</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mean she would die?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Eventually yes, but that even as an old woman she would be the weaker one so she wouldn't be able to function as a stronger mother to me, weaker daughter relationship.  (Pause) I just can't tell what my feelings are about them anymore because I have been saying that I want their approval and that I want the warmth of a family feeling and being, feeling that I'm really part of it and all that, but I'm not, I'm just not sure if that's really true.  (Pause) And I find that, that now ver—, my mother is upset about some things in the family.  My brother is still trying to get into a branch of the service and he hasn't heard and my sister FNA is in PYKK and getting married any day and she hadn't heard from her and doesn't, my sister doesn't want her to her wedding and she's very upset about that and when she's upset about these things whenever she sees me she becomes more openly affectionate to me when we say goodbye or when we say hello.  And I just don't know how to respond now, I just feel very cold toward her then or feel like withdrawing when she wants to just hug me.  Because it just seems like it's coming too late now.  And somehow I'm not, I'm so used now not looking for that type of affection from her that I just feel almost colder to her when I get it.  Or sorry for her that she's so weak now she has to feel that way toward me or I don't know it's very — sometimes I'm afraid it's just simply because I can't react emotionally to my re—, I can't openly express my emotions either, just like them.</p>

<p>ANALYST: The hugging you is new?  She hasn't done that before?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.  Probab—, maybe she's doing the same as always but somehow it seems more prolonged and sincerely felt or that she's really expressing an emotion for a change or I don't know, it just seems different to me.  It might not be.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you feel my question implied one or the other?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but it made my think, well maybe I did.  It made me think that perhaps I'd been seeing earlier times in a different way because then they were because of my own emotional reaction to them.  And I guess I probably took it that you might have thought the same thing that I was coloring earlier times by how I felt.  I can see that something I do that I began to notice more and more with my father too, that when either he or I are expressing anything and then somebody asks a question of us which can be completely objective neither of us are able to take it objectively and we either feel we have to defend ourselves and justify what we've said or we get angry and feel that maybe what she said wasn't right after all and change it.  Or I don't know, we just both of us seem to find it very hard to just simply accept it as a question for clearing up a misunderstanding or a lack of understanding on somebody else's part.</p>

<p>This happened this weekend too with my father.  I've always known he did it, but it was, it's just so clear to me what, this was with my mother asking him a question on something he'd said and he just got furious at her and, and he always makes a big scene when he, when something like that ha—, happens and he almost has to call her stupid before he can let it go.  And he never, this was a case where she thought she—, he'd said another word than he did and instead of just repeating what he'd said he, he said something else and then when she said well, I thought I heard this, he got really mad at her and he just has never been able to have any humor about himself or, (clears throat) anything he's saying he seems to take so seriously.  And I know this is this happens to me an awful lot too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I was just thinking that whenever I, whenever I have the feeling that anything has gone wrong in a situation or when I have a feeling that someone is questioning me in a conversation my reaction always is well, something is the matter with me or something is wrong with the way I'm seeing it.  And then I get all involved in looking at myself and analyzing what I did or what I'm thinking and just sort of get all tangled up.  (Pause) And something else (chuckle) I noticed this weekend.  I don't know if it has any relationship at all but the whole thing of both of our stomachs rumbling and that bothering me when I am having trouble thinking of something to say or saying whatever is on my mind.  Uhm, I just, I, I've known it but just struck me that uhm my father's stomach is always rumbling and this has happened a lot for a long time because I was a little surprised when I noticed it this weekend at all.  And I just wondered if that might have any reason, any have any affect on how I reacted in here.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You wouldn't dare to mention it to him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.  Oh no.  I pretend it isn't happening.  If he mentions it, then you can kind of laugh with him, but you, but that's what I mean.  He can't, if you ever mentioned it, he would take it as some kind of a personal affront or a criticism of him or something, I don't know.  But he'd end up either being very serious about it and, or being very defensive about it.  And uh, just he would never take it the way you would just mean it and if you tried just to laugh at the fact that at some, some situation his stomach was making an awful lot of noise he would just be terribly upset and you just couldn't do it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>In fact, it just seems that any body function at all, he uh, he preferred, pretending it didn't exist and sex and everything.  MSCZ made some very minor joke about some— something that had to do with sex, I think it had to do with our female cat that we had spayed and the fact she's eating more now and that this was her only pleasure left.  And my parents as he put it, I didn't notice this, but he this is how he interpreted it, put on their grimmest expression when he said this and, you know, they just it's not even that they don't think it's funny, they have to react in a very disapproving way.  And my father used to just have a fit if we ever started to walk into his bedroom and he might be changing his clothes or in some state of undress.  In fact I can remember a time when I think I had some friends up in PTN and my father was around and his fly was undone and I remembered debating for a long time which would be better to ignore it and have him find out later and be horribly embarrassed or to tell him tactfully so he could do something about it and, because he, I think in the end I told him but he got so horribly upset that it was it was almost as if there were no way you could tell him and he could just take care of it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And there was a different atmosphere when we wanted to go into my parents bedroom when my mother was there alone because at least as a girl I always felt very free to come and go and she didn't seem to ever really mind.  But uh, when my father wa there it was almost like you had to ask for permission and when you finally were granted permission after waiting outside the closed door for a while, then you sort of tip-toed in and quickly took care of whatever business you had and got out because you were obviously intruding and disturbing them and, or him, not so much them.</p>

<p>(Laughing) I think it's the funniest thing in the world.  One time my father and mother and my younger sister and brother were in ac together and they had adjoining rooms and my sister and brother were in one room and (laughs) at one point my younger sister wanted to go in to speak to my parents and my father kept saying to my mother tell her not to come in because he was totally undressed and she had already started to come in before she, she heard him saying that so she saw him and it just somehow strikes me as being totally, ju—, the funniest thing my mother also knew she had, and I think she thought it was pretty funny too.  Because it just has always seemed so ridiculous that he has been quite the way he's been about it and (stammers) sort of like a vindication.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I've always wondered about something I did after well, partly during college, just with a few fellows but to me it was something that I couldn't stop myself getting into but I thought I was being extremely promiscuous with them and it was very upsetting to me that I was and yet I wouldn't stop myself from being that way and I always think one reason why I felt so upset was because I felt the disapproval of my father and thinking about how he would react if he knew, and he would be extremely disapproving.  And yet, and I didn't know whether I was in it, couldn't keep myself from being this way because I couldn't believe I was attractive to anybody and so if I found out I was, I wanted to enjoy whatever I could while I could or whether it was to get back at my father or what it was.  Because I used to vow when I was in high school that, I feel stupid even admitting this, but that I had, I wasn't ever even going to let anybody kiss me unless he was the person I'd already decided to marry.  And so I always had some strange views about dating and what things should go on while dating.  And, and that probably was a mixture of that and naivete and that I didn't really know what was happening half the time.  And how to take what ever was happening.  Because it just seemed to have somebody even touch me was already being too promiscuous.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, and I think this is another thing that made me feel with any of the, the fellows that I dated at all seriously, once I thought I had been promiscuous with them, however society would look at it, I felt I had been, and then I felt committed to them and this was another thing that made it hard for me to realize when things were really at an end and I should break up with them because somehow I felt I had done something beyond the point of return and now I had to marry them.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And also, I don't know how much this functioned in it either, I'd had an accident when I was uhm in 3rd or 4th grade and uhm my mother had one point when I was old enough so she felt that I should be warned about how you might feel toward a man and get into something further than you had meant to, she warned me that when I had been operated on, uhm, my vagina had been, I'd had to have a wall of it sewed up and that perhaps it had been sewed tight enough so that I would find intercourse painful and I don't know why she told, it was almost like she was holding that over my head, so don't do it no matter what kind of thing.  And I think that kind of gave me a sense of freedom because I knew the fear of having intercourse would be enough so that I would never get that far and so I just felt that I didn't really have to put any other controls on myself.  But yet I was constantly condemning myself for being promiscuous.  Even though I would limit it to somebody that would tell myself I was dating seriously and that I wanted to marry.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You didn't say what the accident was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was uhm, playing kangaroo or something, I had a stick acting like a tail between my legs and uhm somehow it stuck and I came right down on to of it and the stick uhm sort of went up my vagina and then I guess cut through some other walls.  I, I never did, was too clear exactly what happened but anyway, it was a very upsetting accident.  And I'm sure this is partly why I, well, I found it very hard to have intercourse full intercourse, I mean well I guess (chuckle) intercourse, not full intercourse, with MSCZ, because I was just so afraid of this and it just, I know something had been built up since that accident.  But I don't know quite why.  Except that there has always been a connection between the two because when I, after I'd been operated on and was out of the hospital, I had to wear Kotex and my mother explained what it was and told me about menstruating then and then later when I was about to begin menstruating she, there was a question whether it was just at least in my mind, I don't know if there really had been, but that I might have just opened up an old wound or whether I was really menstruating and I don't know, I just constantly connected the two together.  And I was always afraid to use Tampax because I might break through again and (pause) and I can just recall how I felt when it happened so clearly and yet I don't know whether I'm really recalling it or whether I'm just recalling what I'd like to think.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Can you describe it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How I felt?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I couldn't get off the stick at first because you know, I was kind of caught there and it was just a perfectly strong burning sensation and all I could do was take my breath in and sort of scream while I was taking my breath in and it was, the whole thing, I —  (Pause) And then after that was scared because my mother tried to be very cool about it and I knew I'd done something so I asked her if there was any blood and she said no, just lie down here for a few minutes and I looked while she was gone and my pants were just full of blood and it was just horrible because I don't think a child likes to see their own blood anyway and this was really awful.  And then I had to go, my doc—, my own doctor, and what he did hurt terribly and then I had to go to the hospital and it was the only operation I've had so that was frightening.</p>

<p>And the feeling I had when I was coming out of the either was that I'd been deserted and I remember the first time I was conscious after I'd been operated on and it was visiting hours and people were coming in for everybody else because I was in one of those children's wards and uhm, I don't know how long my mother was before she came after that, it might have been only a minute or two, but it just seemed like forever, so and I was sure that nobody was going to come.  And I had a terrible time after that because of the nature of the operation I, well, they, they wouldn't allow me to have bowel movements at first and then I was very badly constipated or at least something anyway so that it was extremely painful and ever s—, I've always been sort of as MSCZ puts it, anal, about the fact that I have to have a bowel movement every day or else I'm sure I'm feeling horrible.  I've always wondered if that's partly why.  Somehow when I do have one every day I just feel sort of cleaned out and freed and ready for the day.  And if I don't I never do.  Because I also was brought up with my mother preaching that you should.  And to form a little schedule so you would and that, and that might be why.  (Pause) And it's funny too, maybe I, as far as being in the hospital itself don't have any bad memories because after the first 2 or 3 days when I'd been so uncomfortable and was afraid for that first time that I was deserted after that I began to have a very nice time.  And my other memories are just of enjoying being in the hospital.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  So this is when you were you said in the 3rd or 4th grade?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.  I think maybe the 4th.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You should have been about 9 or 10.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhum.  That might be why I have no other memory of the 4th grade.  (Silence) Because another thing that occurred to me uhm, why I changed from sort of being daring and not thinking too much of consequences and just trying things when I felt like trying them and wanting to try them, to being very cautious and not even wanting to try things.  Occurred to me that I did have an awful lot of accidents when I was young and I just was wondering if after a while you can't help but think of the fact that you kept having accidents before and — (Pause)</p>

<p>Because especially after that one and I know I picked up the impression even at the time and I heard it after that uhm if when the stick penetrated me, it had been just a fraction of an inch further one way it would have broken a major vein or artery or done something that might have been extremely serious.  And another time I was going to see a friend of mine who was having a little fight with a neighbor and I just went over just to see what was happening and she was, she had a spoon and was sort of throwing dirt at them and they were throwing slates at her and I didn't realize this, so as I came up the slate whizzed by and hit, one hit me right under my eye which was a very startling thing to have happen and then I know I picked up the impression then that I was extremely lucky that I hadn't lost my eye, it had been so close.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know whether I got the impression by that time that just things were against me generally or just made me feel that unless I exercised extreme control and didn't do anything that things were bound to happen to me.  Because another accident when, this happened when I was 4, and I, I just have a very clear memory of, of it happening, but I don't know whether it really emotionally affected me was, some point I was challenging a friend to jump over a big rock, to me at the time it seemed enormous, now it would probably just be a little teeny thing and then I jumped over and somehow I got turned around and when I landed on my knees, I landed on a pointed rock and cut my knee and again it was a case of just knowing I'd done something and going home and then suddenly looking down and seeing blood ru—, running out from underneath my pants, my trousers and this at 4 was very upsetting.  And I had to have my leg out straight and stiff, I don't think I had a cast, but I, I couldn't bend it for a while so it was a big event and I had to be carried up and down stairs and things like that.  And I think all these accidents plus having the worst feet in the family the worst eyesight in the family and the worst teeth in the family at least I had to have the most work done, must have contributed to this feeling that I was far inferior in one respect even though I tried to build myself up in another.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But something I've been talking to MSCZ about occasionally and things that I will realize from talking things out here, that even though I realize them, maybe gradually, I'm, I'll be building up some sense of being a worthwhile person, but I don't know, so many of these things I've known already and you just wonder if how much good it's going to do to just realize them in a slightly different context.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

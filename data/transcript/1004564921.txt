<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a check for you. My insurance apparently doesn't have a payment agreement with you so that's...it's made out to my husband but he endorsed it on the back so the last provider I saw was able to just deposit those.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is strange. As far as I knew they had a payment agreement with me. I will take this but we'll hold off on cashing it until I follow this up with them. It's strange.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. The other thing is, according to this, my deductible applies until April 6 so I've lost my explanation of benefits for anything before April so if you could let me know how much I owe you for anything prior to April 6. [00:00:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, I can look it up now or I can look it up later and e-mail it to you, whatever you'd rather.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be better? Alright. I'll have to check into the insurance thing because as far as I knew I was on all of their accounts but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, my last provider also had a paid agreement with them but for some reason when we switched, when my husband changed jobs, we went from one insurance provided to another insurance and this Insurance just...it's all mysterious to me. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) It's mysterious to me too. I don't know why. Whatever, okay. [00:01:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) So I don't know if I've mentioned this but a great many of my friends I originally met online and I keep a blog and there's a very active blog community I'm a part of. Some of my closest friends who I see in real life and meet with in person I originally met through the Internet. So a big part of my social life happens online and there's this phenomenon called a "love mean" which has its roots in hate names where someone says, "I'm going to allow anonymous commenting on my blog. Tell me who you hate and why," and pretend to be people and be horrible and vicious and evil. A couple of people decided to turn that around and request positive anonymous comments and every so often someone will put one of these up on their blog and say, "Comment anonymously about people you know. Brighten someone's day." [00:02:57]</p>

<p>I don't know. I always find things incredibly fraught (ph) because a lot of times people will put their friends names in the (inaudible) but other times people will post for themselves saying nice things about me anonymously and I always find self nominating as it is to be, I don't know, needy, greedy, pushy, clingy.</p>

<p>So I usually don't participate but I discovered one completely randomly, someone else posted a link to something they had written about yet another person. And I had discovered someone had put my name in it without my knowing it and people were saying all these nice things about me and I don't know what to think about that. It's terribly...I don't know. I cried when I saw it. [00:03:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like you have a pretty clear idea what to feel about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I saw it this morning after I woke up from a very, really upsetting dream. (pause) So much context, I don't know where to start making this coherent. So I have this friend Forest who I've known since I was in undergrad, we lived in the Bradye house. And Forest is a great guy. Just generous and outgoing and he's everybody's friend. He's a great big teddy bear. And we haven't seen each other much in the last couple of years because we have jobs and our social circles have diverged somewhat. But I don't know, we hang out occasionally. We're still friendly even though we aren't as close as we used to be. [00:04:45]</p>

<p>But anyway, in my dream Forest invited me to his house to watch movies and make chocolate doughnuts which I don't even know where that Dane from because usually when we hang out we make sushi and watch movies. But in the dream I was making chocolate doughnuts together and we had gone shopping together, we got off the bus together, we got to his house, we're making doughnuts, and then Caleb (ph) my ex-boyfriend shows up with his buddy Wes who is his best friend and looks a great deal like him and also used to be my employee many years ago, and another friend of theirs who I didn't recognize in the dream. And they start eating the doughnuts and Forest starts dealing cards for a poker game and he deals four places...he deals four hands at a table set for four and Caleb (ph) and Wes and Forest and those other buddies sit down and are like, "Aren't you going to deal me in guys?" And they're like, "Oh yeah yeah yeah! You can sit on the end of the table. Don't worry about it." But I was like there's no chair and no room because that's where you put all of your beers and you didn't deal me cards. [00:05:51]</p>

<p>And I got really upset in the dream and then they mocked me for being upset because, "Yo! We're totally including you. You can bring us beers." And so I decided to go to bed and for some reason we were no longer in Forest's house, we were Danping because of dream logic. So I went into my tent and then this chick who is a singer who I'm very fond of — she's an independent artist. I've met her a couple of times. We sat on a panel together at a con once and she's a great person and wonderful and in many ways a role model for me. She shows up and it turns out that she's dating my ex and she sees nothing wrong with the situation and that's when my alarm woke up and I was really upset because the scenario of four dudes around a table playing cards while I'm left out, that actually happened a lot in real life in high school. [00:06:48]</p>

<p>I didn't have many friends in high school and I had mostly competitors who I hung out with. I think I've talked a little bit about friends (inaudible) and how fraught (ph) that was. But there's this core group of four dudes —who we just call by their last names. But those four would get together and play cards at lunch when I'd sit there, fifth person out, and of course they'd play yuker which is a kind of watered down form of bridge. It's played in partners so you can't deal in five people. It's a four person game. [00:07:29]</p>

<p>Over the course of high school I dated three of four guys in that group. That's horrible. (chuckle) But yeah, I would just sit there being bored watching them play cards. It was incredibly awful. Like, I can't even think of something more descriptive other than terrible. (pause) And I think if that sort of thing happened to me now I'd say, "What the fuck ever?" and walk away. But at the time that was the most social acceptance I got so I clung to it.</p>

<p>So I don't know. I don't know where this dream Dane from or why but it just...when I woke up I was just filled with all of these memories that I haven't thought of in ages and ages. That was horrible. And then I logged on and I saw this love mean (ph) and I was like...I don't even know. I'm very... (crying) It's been an emotional roller coaster of a morning and I've only been awake for like three hours. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) (inaudible) ...few hours. Yeah... (pause)</p>

<p>(silence from [00:08:48] to 00:09:19)</p>

<p>[Do you have an association to any parts?] (ph) of the dream, like the chocolate doughnuts which seem to stand out or poker instead of yuker?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am sure. There's context from both of those things. There's...a friend of a friend of a friend who I've never actually met but has a poker night at his house every Thursday and I've been invited because he invites people up to six hops away from him in social network. It's like a huge thing a lot of my friends go to but I've always been too intimidated to go because I guess all of the cool kids go and I don't feel like I'm cool enough to hang out with them or maybe I'm afraid of being made fun of. And also I don't play poker (chuckle). I don't know how to play the game. (laughter) And I've been told that poker night is more of a hanging out and having fun and that half of the people who show up don't actually play. And certainly there's precedent for that in my social circle. For years my apartment hosted an anime Monday night every week where yes, there's anime going on in one room of the house but like half the guests hung out in the dining room and just socialized. [00:10:47]</p>

<p>So that might be where the poker comes from because I know Caleb (ph), my ex-boyfriend, and Wes, his buddy and their housemate all go to poker night almost every week. So that might be where that Dane from. Chocolate, I have a friend who has a chocolate making business who I just saw not too long ago for Passover. I went to a Seder at her house where she debuted some new chocolate flavors. That was kind of awesome. And also when I was an undergrad I had a housemate, Jasmine, who was...she doesn't have a chocolate making business but she does make chocolates for herself and for her friends and for parties and her chocolates are quite good. And Jasmine and I have a...are ex-friends. (chuckle) So yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:11:40] to 00:12:02)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess something that's striking in the dream is how (pause) I guess unlike in real life it's people you feel really good about who are leaving you out.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:12:23] to 00:12:47)</p>

<p>Yeah I mean, clearly there's a lot that could be made up. But a lot of it I guess I'm not sure yet what about it seems right or should mean. (pause) When you say you woke up feeling really upset... (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The immediate thing I thought of when I woke up was like remembering being 16 and sitting with those guys from high school, and being left out. Like that wasn't a day after the fact, "Oh yeah, that looks familiar." That was like immediately upon waking up that's what I remembered and was feeling. It was awful! [00:13:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, you said there's not even more that you can think of to say except how awful it felt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Dan (inaudible), he used to call me the antichrist. That was my nickname in high school. Dan hated me and he was utterly furious when I started dating Willis and then Willis and I broke up and Willis started dating Jessica and I started dating Adam. It was just like, Dan was just vicious, like almost feral in his hatred of me but he was a part of the group and the group was all...they were the only people willing to hang out with me and... (pause) [00:15:00]</p>

<p>And in hindsight I can sort of see both Willis and Dan had no friends either and Adam had a bunch of hangers on who's parents went to his parents' country club but he didn't like any of them. Brady and Miles — I completely forgot about Miles — Miles and Brady were pretty far down on the social hierarchy also. When they played yuker it was also Adam, and Willis, and Dan and then either I or Brady would swap in. I guess most of them must have also been feeling pretty desperate for acceptance also and picking on me was something that united them but (sigh)...I don't know. Understanding the dynamics and how it happened doesn't really make the feelings any less painful. [00:15:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why did he call you the antichrist?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I don't even remember where it came from. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you know how much all this hurt at the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I knew I was miserable at the time but I don't think I would have been able to pinpoint why or how or identify what was going on.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:16:43] to 00:17:06)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did people write about you in the love mean (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: One person called me brilliant and intelligent. Another said I was awe inspiringly ferocious and have a big heart. Another said that I was generous and compassionate and none of those are things I would use to describe myself, except intelligent. That one's kind of...I can't even think of (inaudible) (chuckle) (pause) When I was growing up my Dad would often call me timid and at other times he would say I had a tiny stingy little heart. [00:18:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) That's awful! [What would an occasion of saying things like that?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The tiny heart comments often came when I was fighting with my sisters over the last cookie in the bag or something like that. He'd be like, "You're the oldest one. You should be..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The sort of thing sisters and brothers fight over?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah! And I mean, as an adult I can totally see that's normal for an eight year old kid but my dad would yell at me and tell me that I was the older one and I should let the younger ones have the treats because I'd had treats when I was younger before they were born and I had such a tiny heart and was so stingy and should learn to share with my sisters. I get in hindsight, I get that culturally in the time and place my father came from you had to be able to rely on your elder siblings because if anything happened to your parents the siblings who had already gotten married were the arbiters of your fate essentially. They were the ones who would arrange your marriage. Your entire life depended on them so you wanted to establish young that the older one should look out for the younger ones and give the younger ones the best portion of everything so that the younger ones would be cared for. [00:19:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. The older ones were kind of much more parentified in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I don't know (chuckle) that name calling and being cruel is the way to foster that kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...fraternal care and concern and love. I don't know, I was always the shy child and again in hindsight I think that if I had gotten better social training at home and learned how to be a functioning social being then I would have turned out to be an extrovert instead of having been painfully socially anxious about everything. Some of my earliest memories of interacting with my peers were very painful because I said the wrong thing, did the wrong thing, didn't know the right things and got teased and humiliated for it and so, yeah. [00:20:45]</p>

<p>(pause) Yeah my dad used to call me timid every time I refused to say hi to a stranger. Like it'd be "take your daughter to work" day introducing me to his residents and I would hide behind his legs or meeting distant relatives for the first time I would hide and mumble and not say anything. He would laugh and call me a timid mouse and say that he wanted his children to be ferocious lions and not timid mice. And then he would pull out the classic, "You must not be my real daughter," which was his go-to for everything. [00:21:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) That's kind of ironic because he's awfully (chuckle) socially awkward and not very outgoing either. He's a total wallflower at parties.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:21:58] to 00:22:28)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the thing I thought about your morning so far is the way that I think in the present, apart from your family, the problem things that are sort of difficult socially are generally much more to do with (pause) your trouble in imagining other people seeing the good in you or having confidence...especially having confidence in yourself and instead treating yourself like viciously and sort of excluding like the....kind of like pushing the feelings of various sorts you have a reaction to thing, kind of like leaving yourself out in an important way. So, (pause) I guess that's one thing that kind of strikes me about the context of the dream and what happened after is like... (pause). It's not that I don't think the memories are important or shaping. I do, but there's something important way in which the present is also true that (pause) you tend often to treat yourself viciously or leave yourself out in various ways that make it difficult to see how affectionately and how well people around you think of you or feel about you which is too bad. [00:24:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. Semi-relatedly to those the last couple of days I've been communicating with my several panelists for the convention I'm going to be on five panels and some of my fellow panelists are leading lights in the community — famous authors and scholars, well respected, and I'm feeling remarkable outclassed (laughter) and I'm considering dropping one or two of them because I just don't feel like I have anything valuable to contribute to the discussion. (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, rational brain knows that the people on the program committee know me; they're familiar with my writing. They wouldn't put me on these panels if they didn't think I had anything to contribute but on the other hand...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How big are the panels?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Five people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Five people? Oh, what a coincidence. [00:25:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But a lot of these names are people who I've admired from afar for years and just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds nice and exciting in a way but of course also intimidating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also terrifying! I mean, in previous years I've been on panels that I considered to be within my core competency areas like panels on disruptive technology and (inaudible) write about Disruptive Technology and Fiction, Believable versus Un-Believable Physics, Robotics and Mankind. But my panels this year are Baba Yaga and other Hidden (inaudible), Asian Ancestresses, the Arab Muslim East as Portrayed in Science Fiction Fantasy. These are not things that, as a scientist, are part of my core training and background. These are things I'm interested in and have opinions on and have read about but like...one of my co-panelists (chuckle) [is on the ball] (ph) and the other panel is a professor, a tenured professor, of folklore. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, (pause) let's see, I guess...</p>

<p>(silence from [00:27:33] to 00:27:50)</p>

<p>I imagine what you fear is feeling terribly incompetent or stupid or limited.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Among other things. I also fear looking like an idiot which is different from being an idiot. I think I fear looking like an idiot more than I fear actually being an idiot. And I can't quite decide if that's because deep down I'm convinced I'm not an idiot or because looking like an idiot just seems so much worse than actually being dumb. And I know that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the whole social thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, were you going to say something else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to say I also fear wasting other people's time but that's, I don't know, that's kind of tied into the fear of looking like I know what I'm doing. [00:28:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I guess it's sort of like somewhere, somehow, there's going to be somebody making vicious judgments like in the audience or on the panel with you. I'm imagining that realistically the worst thing that happens is you've got people who know a lot more about the topic and say more than you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But somehow it feels much more dire than that. (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) It does. I'm also a little bit uncomfortable with there's the description of the panel which is what I find out what to talk about, and then there's what the panelists have been discussing over e-mail for the past two weeks and like I thought the panel on Baba Yaga was going to be that Baba Yaga was just one exemplar of the phenomenon that happens in many cultures of dual goddesses. Goddesses that have two natures, nature of wisdom life giving and also death and destruction and so Baba Yaga is the witch who eats children but who also helps heroes on their journey, particularly Ivan in his journey to defeat Koschei the Deathless. And then there's Kali who is the mother goddess but also the goddess of death and destruction. There's Inanna and Ereckigala (ph) who are sisters and twins and of course Inanna is the goddess of fertility and life and Ereckigala (ph) is the goddess of death and Hell essentially. I can't remember what Babylonian's (ph) is called. [00:30:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are these from? I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Babylonian? (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said Inanna was also known as Ishtar (ph) which is you might be more familiar with. And just...I don't know. The dual nature goddesses have always been very interested and fascinating to me. And I just thought [the other] (ph) isn't exactly a goddess but you know, she's a powerful figure and the course of discussion on e-mail has been much more focused on Baba Yaga and specific and other Slavic myths that I know nothing about! (laughter)</p>

<p>And then the Asian Ancestresses panel, the panel description name checked a number of Middle Eastern and Indian sub-continental legend and historical figures in addition to east Asian figures, but I'm the only south Asian on the panel. All the others are east Asian. In fact, three of the other four are Chinese and the fourth is Taiwanese. So they all want to talk about [Chow Ben] (ph) and Milan and I mean I'm somewhat familiar with those but I had assumed that there was going to be a balance between east Asian and south Asian representations and they want to spend an hour talking about Milan which (laughter) okay, I've seen the Disney version but there are like 18 other versions that I haven't seen or read. [00:32:11]</p>

<p>It's frustrating, especially because the Asian Ancestresses panel which is...the panel description says, "Who are the female role models for Asian women and how do they appear differently in media and myth from the sourcelanders versus hyphenates in America?" Are you familiar with those terms? Do they make sense, source land and hyphenates? I feel like this might be a bit of jargon that needs... (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had an assumption of what it might mean but maybe it's not right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, sourcelander basically means someone who is born and raised in their country of origin whereas a hyphenate is someone who is first or second generation emigrant to kin. So yeah, that's what I thought we were going to be talking about and using various examples of we all might have passing familiarity with but no. (chuckle) And that was the one that I felt most competent to talk about of the five panels I was assigned, the one I felt most secure in. Yes, I actually have standing to talk about this and I don't know, it's frustrating, and clearly the thing to do is e-mail everyone and say, "This is what I thought the panel was going to be about and this is what I know and I'm prepared to talk about and I don't have a hour of certain thoughts on Milan, I'm sorry." I don't know. It's all very upsetting. [00:33:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it even clear that they don't want to talk about the south Asian, logical site you know more about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it might just be that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or are they just talking about what they know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they're talking about what they know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words, I guess I'm trying to sort out whether they might be welcoming of having, thank God, somebody who knows about the south Asian so it doesn't look like it's really about east Asian stuff and supposedly a panel for people interested in...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) I don't know. It's all very...all of these discussions we've been having over e-mail of all of my panels have been poking at my insecurity buttons a lot and I don't think I'm able to have perspective on any of it right now. [00:34:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (pause) Meaning you're so kind of stirred up by how scared and excluded you're feeling that it's hard to think your way through that to which because this is actually going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:35:26] to 00:35:42)</p>

<p>I guess what I'm also wondering about in terms of your aspect in high school is (pause) how it was awful from the combination of being awful in its own right and stirring up things from your family and from when you were younger at the same time. I bet not only were you sort of ill prepared socially to be confident to know what to do or how to handle different situations and sort of feeling good about yourself socially but you were told all sorts of horrible things about yourself too (inaudible) and I guess felt very much reiterated in sort of a similar, not exactly similar, way in high school. [00:36:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)...to your dream is I don't know if this is right but I think the fact that one of your family as well and you...I don't know how much you felt sort of on the outs specifically more so than your sisters. I guess I haven't exactly had the sense that you felt not a part of something before they were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's certainly how I've been feeling the last couple of years and in part that's the direct result of my choices to distance myself from their crazy dysfunctional dynamics and again, rational brain knows that it's probably healthy that I'm feeling excluded from their crazy dysfunctional dynamic so that distancing myself emotionally from them is totally the best thing for me and my marriage. But at the same time when I'm with them, I certainly...there's a part of me that feels like that 16 year old kid being shunted to the side at the card table and (pause) they all buy in to the same belief that the nuclear family is the most important thing ever and that you should protect the nuclear family and never trust outsiders and we're going to have...any my sisters especially are very close in completely unhealthy codependent ways that there's nothing even remotely normal about their dynamic. But they do have a number of in-jokes and they spend a lot of time together and have gone on adventures together and when I'm with them it's really hard. It's like being in the middle of a maelstrom. It's hard to see that this is horrible and destructive. All I see is that they all share something that I don't. [00:38:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was just talking to my sister yesterday about the graduation and plans for family photos and she and my youngest sister decided it would be terribly cute if we all got hoodies from our universities and had a hoodie photo. Well one she seemed completely ignorant of the Treyvon Martin case when all the hoodie pictures that were published after that which I just found gob smacking that that wasn't even on her radar but also this whole matchy-matchy, "We'll all look the same. It'll be awesome." Like, that just leaves me cold but apparently she and my younger sister think this is the best idea ever. They want to do matching makeup and everything which might actually work since we have mostly the same skin tone. But I don't know, I find it all very disturbing and creepy. [00:39:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I would imagine some of why it's horrifying is to deal with how tumultuous and chaotic everything is often among you. Matching makeup and similar hoodies just don't really bring you together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think, you know, every family develops its own mythology around its history. There are these two stories that my middle sister loves to tell, that my parents love to tell, as proof that I'm a horrible sister. The one when my middle sister was a newborn and I was like three and I was irritated that my grandfather wouldn't color with me so I threw my coloring book at him and it missed and hit my sister and one my sister tracks out as often as she can as proof that I've hated her since the day she was born.</p>

<p>And then later on, I was in the third grade, and of course my sister is close to four years younger than me. And we were playing in the woods behind our house. We were living in southern Alabama and our neighborhood backed up onto a bayou and so we were playing in the bayou with a couple of our friends, well a couple of my friends. All of us were in second or third grade and then there was my sister who was I think she was in kindergarten? First grade? No, kindergarten, whatever. And someone shouted, "Snake!" and growing up on a bayou you learn not to fuck around with snakes. That's like the first thing they teach kids. So all of us turned and fled because we were terrified because someone screamed, "Snake!" and everyone knows that when that happens you run to the porch and call a parent. [00:41:48]</p>

<p>And then it just didn't even occur to me to look for my sister. We were all running. She was the last in the pack because she was smaller, shorter legs, and she tripped over a Cyprus tree root and scraped up her elbows and knees and cut her lip and it was terrible and she finally limped into the house bleeding and crying. It can't have been more than ten minutes at most but it felt like ages after the rest of us got there. Immediately my sister and my parents spun it into a, "You didn't care about your sister. I bet you were hoping the snake would eat her." And then when my dad got home from work it was, "You know, back in the old country, we would never have considered leaving a younger sibling behind. You have to take care of your younger sibling. How could you?" And again, the story gets trotted out at Christmas and Thanksgiving as like, "Wasn't it funny when Cody (ph) wanted Krista to get eaten by a snake? Ha ha ha." [00:42:53]</p>

<p>And my family calls me Cody not Constance. I don't remember if I mentioned that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So my mom had a c-section when she had me and apparently there were complications and she was under anesthesia for almost a day. Or possibly she was still just unconscious from the surgery, I don't know. There were complications. It was messy. And my dad named me when my mom was still knocked out. He didn't clear my name with her. And she hates the name Constance (ph). Hates it, hates it, hates it. So Cody is my middle name. Apparently my mom wanted to name me Kimberly and my dad wasn't having any of that. No Anglo names for his child. So Cody it was which is a fairly common name in his country so that's what my mom has always called me because it sort of sounds like Kimberly. [00:43:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) That's awful!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I say that partly because I'm not sure what to say about it. (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: My family is so dysfunctional it even stuns psychologists into silence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) But yeah, there's been this family mythos that I hate my middle sister and want her to die which is absurd. I mean, there was sibling rivalry. How could there not be? And when my sister was very young I was jealous of the time and attention my parents gave to her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's pretty much what happens to human beings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But how there isn't? Right? So this mythos grew up around that starting almost immediately. And so when Mom got pregnant with my youngest sister, my middle sister said that as soon as she found out she put her hands on Mommy's tummy and whispered to the baby inside, "I will be the best sister that you'll ever have." And from the moment Jane was born, Krista wanted everything to do with her, wanted to be involved for caring for her. Krista was four when Jane was born but she wanted to be involved in every aspect of Jane's life. [00:45:41]</p>

<p>When I was high school and Krista was in middle school, my parents essentially gave up on parenting Jane. They just stopped disciplining her, stopped telling her what to do, stopped trying to guide her development and Krista pretty much took over raising Jane and she was like 13. So... (sigh) they have this horrible codependent dysfunctional...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, a 13 year old mothering a 9 year old. Yeah. We have to stop for now but we'll talk more next time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me know what...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I'll check with insurance. Yeah. [00:46:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that when my information like if I had a perfect I had reservation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Last night (inaudible 0:11:12.5). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was pretty (inaudible 0:11:16.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Allow me to get along and things like that (inaudible 0:11:30.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why I'm not so sure this morning exactly what (inaudible 0:11:40.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Yeah, like the future isn't so clear.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum. It's not about the, the looking at a dream or something where last night it was also exuberant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Like now it's down to the reality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, now I'm sober.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah (0:12:07.9) it (inaudible 0:12:09.8) yeah I'm just wondering if I'm associating, you know, like if I have but 8:15 and it never fails that's when I get up. One of them and I don't know who it's probably both that ah in the bathroom right now (inaudible 0:12:24.7) for about an hour when I first get up and that really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course, something I would never say anything about it so maybe I'll say something about it today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ask them why in case I have to take them back because I know other people use the john for a few minutes before, you know, if I can just say something about because I think I will testify.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just by the fact I don't didn't say anything about it because ah afraid I might be they might misinterpret it and think I'm trying to be (inaudible 0:12:56.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So like, like you've always kept quite because they might think the worse of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like if I complain about the (inaudible 0:13:09.7) in my new apartment I think they thought I was, you know, trying to make a big thing about the (inaudible 0:13:15.5) and nag and all these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, (inaudible 0:13:57.0) any discussion we have is sort of like perhaps utilized some of the points that have been bothering me about this apartment, you know, like I lived there last year and I'm the only one there and I suppose considerate it, you know, very much mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah, maybe other people who I really was ah thinking of them in terms of how much they were taking over and all these the old things have been changed so they were like they were taking over the entire apartment ah, you know, changing it from the way it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And perhaps the way I think it should be it's just, you know, like the entire their apartment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And everything is done their way and so it felt like I was moved from my apartment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Like losing your ground.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was just becoming, you know, a roomer in their apartment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah it turned out kind a bothered me because, you know, I had sort of an attachment to the place (inaudible 0:15:12.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just, you know, it was part of the thing that I mean now that I'm aware of it I think ah maybe I'll ask (inaudible 0:15:26.6) entire apartment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:15:32.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Like not being so much as an invasion all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum. Well I know they're starting to clean up things that bothered me like over the past few weeks ah when, when she moved in right she threw all this stuff in the foyer from the (0:15:59.5) in my room and she broke our ironing board bed and the trunk and a suitcase like everything was all over the floor and sometimes like I had to wind my way into my room and it really (0:16:09.7) annoyed me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never said anything about it because I didn't want to be thought of as like a nag but ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The suitcases were there for seven weeks and then ah, you know, the ironing board was always up in front of us (inaudible 0:16:25.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like she like yesterday she finally folded up the ironing board and I did ask her at one point to, to do something with the ironing board I think, you know, six, seven weeks but she finally did today or yesterday, you know, and ah. Oh ah the physical things that were bothering me up until yesterday ah were sort of corrected yesterday even before ah the scene.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So now I don't really have these, you know, complaints about the way (inaudible 0:17:12.5) and that just perhaps ah, you know, like when you've built some sort of relationship (inaudible 0:17:19.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:17:22.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. There aren't all those physical things standing in the way like, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like the suitcase in front of your door.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all these (inaudible 0:17:32.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Things kind a feed into that keep it all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it started off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright, I think that's ah, you know, I'm trying to situation I'm looking (inaudible 0:18:02.3) I'm not going to say most or half of my problems, you know, but it has just been a significant thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Like it has always been a, a real mental presence in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And you don't know how badly (inaudible 0:18:23.1). So maybe I'm (inaudible 0:18:28.7) work itself out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Well before you were saying you weren't utterly hopeful now this morning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And now you want to </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm, you know, sort of ah withhold my hopes so I'm not disappointed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm, passion isn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Uhm, (inaudible 0:19:39.6). But ah I'm just (inaudible 0:19:49.5) where something that I mean I know what, you know, what I was talking about ah forgetting the general idea or the direction I was moving in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well like immediately just before you said it was getting cloudy or, or over it. (0:20:09.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, ah so you mean just before I said that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, I, I realize that what I've been saying here because (inaudible 0:20:20.0) gave direction to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just let you know I've been (inaudible 0:20:23.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what but</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, all of a sudden I even lost my own like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Uhm, but what you were saying was kind of uhm you, you started to say well you're with you're withholding from this thing really from this apartment it has been really getting good like in a way you're you, you care about it but it's not any big thing. You want to try not to (inaudible 0:21:05.6) grab at about caring for it to get a lot better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, ah I don't like to think, you know, the way you make it sound I think of it like a care but ah I'm pessimistic </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really believe it can happen like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, more like ah</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really care about the ending, you know, the war.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ending the fresh and away things but I don't really believe it. Ah, I mean I don't really believe that's going to happen </p>

<p> (inaudible 0:21:44.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Yeah, you would like it a lot if it happened but you're (inaudible 0:21:49.9) got to be there a place to live in. Uhm, but you're kind a standing back and waiting to see if that to happen and kind a reserving judgment. You know, and if it happens that would be really great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not going to be crushed if it doesn't. (0:22:06.9)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It may, it may, you know, ah it may be unpleasant but I know I'm not going to be really crest fallen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or crushed I think that would be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, like you say all of you isn't, you know, there really caring and hoping or anything people like that, you know, would be, you know, like uhm it would be to bad if it doesn't work out but.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind a captured it for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, uh-hum. A little (inaudible 0:22:48.7) kind a watching for the outcome yeah well which way is it going to turn out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It ah probably be interesting ah about ah to be put in sort of a new situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Just to see how we would discuss that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean just like whether, whether the whether it would work itself out, you know, good or whatever bad it at least going to be an interesting to see something happening. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. (0:24:00.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like that I'm going to see something happening I think if she is going to get better or going to regress.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well as before it was just bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it seemed like it was going to stay bad and ah she was before trying and there is no point in doing anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No point in paying any attention to her because it was just unpleasant but now it's changed but so it's things that happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is movement there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's what, you know, resisting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was just. I know I don't feel as desperate as I did before as morning that morning feeling my doctor giving me a lot of pressure lot (inaudible 0:24:49.2) and ah so I finally decided as much as I hate to move in this apartment I don't want us to move ah that was probably I have been looking around and then ah I sort of after I decided that I wanted to move I sort of gave up ah I no longer felt like it was necessary to improve my relation with Josh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, as if you (inaudible 0:25:21.1) at what point then (inaudible 0:25:22.7) energy on your part.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and ah then as time progressed and (inaudible 0:25:31.3) to move to ah I became more and more desperate the more I moved just like the situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was letting it getting so unpleasant and it's like I can't stand some of these people what I would love to do is </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:25:45.6) with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's all torture and just wanting to escape.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And ah well now I'm not so desperate about moving, you know, I'm still trying because ah the doctor thinks I should for my health (0:26:10.5) and ah, you know, and the other reasons like (inaudible 0:26:14.4). I was thinking about staying here the summer but I was afraid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but at least it won't be it won't be unbearable. Ah, it would be nice if I can move but if I can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, at least (inaudible 0:26:51.9) caught up in the situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, so </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The, the sources are, are good there hopeful a doctor who has done a lot of (inaudible 0:29:03.8) for me (inaudible 0:29:06.0) he invented (inaudible 0:29:10.6) from my doctor and he said well, you know, that's it all you need but it just seemed like too easy for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Too easy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean ah too simply. I sort of felt that I needed about four doctors all saying, you know what, this guy is sick but I just need this one doctor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the doctor never had to say anything like ah crippling attack on such and such a date.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just that ah I suffer from, you know, asthma or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're kind a looking at this letter and thinking this, this is all I need to get out it doesn't make.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. This is something I've known for a long time and ah, you know, like the fact that I had asthma and.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. (0:30:00.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, you just take the letter from the doctor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it like, like being the draft is such an incredibly big thing in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that be </p>

<p>PATIENT: They put something federally through something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It really engulfs you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's very overwhelming very threatening. And, and you very much have this notation of being trapped by it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Definitely being (inaudible 0:30:27.5). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when this little thing can</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like there's no escape.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Then this little thing can spring the catch without</p>

<p>PATIENT: Without any struggle at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like just being very.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well if somebody tells me something like that I tend to believe it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like the, the escape isn't above isn't commiserate with the, the thing that's trapping you like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (inaudible 0:30:51.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like this guy looking at it, it doesn't seem right I should stash be able to get out in front of these people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems like I'm deceiving myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Deceiving yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In thinking that ah that this is actually going to be the procedure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum. You're worried that you catch hold of it I mean like when the doctor says, of course, you can get out with it. That you believed him more than he means it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I believed him that maybe he says it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That somehow you deceived yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I should have I deceived myself if I really have a lot of faith in this one doctor or something then the other ah because I should be more suspicious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of easy solutions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, everybody always said the easy solution to what.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To the draft.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Simply solutions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To the draft or you mean</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, life. Ah, and that's to a normal size problem like simply solutions that work. The draft is more than a normal size problem I mean it's legal it has got like (0:32:02.0) all these little things like everywhere you know like ah it's so elaborate and involved every possible situation is accounted for in the draft law, you know, every situation is a way for it to be handled, you know, like if a guy started to get out this way put some other walls that, you know, grab him back. It just seems like there is no way around it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean no matter no matter how much you want to get out it the you can't escape it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you know that's not true, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People do get </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I don't consider </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I mean</p>

<p>PATIENT: Having completed something you mean like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no I mean talking about, you know, but the only reason that I bring that up here is to say that, that I think uhm especially I just had a conversation with a friend who did that and he was talking about what was how the draft makes people think mainly that the draft gets people is one way that the draft gets people is by convincing them that there is no way out when in fact there's plenty of because it's a law and because of all the things there are (inaudible 0:33:22.3). But all I mean to say by that is to point out to you that this kind of sets uhm well you're right to be very pessimistic and accurate but there is a way in which also the also your pessimism is a mental that, that doesn't fit with all the facts.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, alright. Well if I believe in that </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The fact</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well you don't want </p>

<p>PATIENT: If I'm not pessimistic about it, it should fail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: While I really believe in it (0:34:04.5) I just don't know (inaudible 0:34:05.4) what to do. Ah, it was just what I'm saying it was a crutch for me, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. You didn't want you didn't want keep forgetting really not one who will go out on a limb.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right I (inaudible 0:34:23.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Now do you feel secure when your asthma comes back every two weeks (inaudible 0:34:31.6) or is that still (inaudible 0:34:32.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel pretty secure ah pretty substantial asthma problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like but </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pretty secure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But is like still there is (inaudible 0:34:51.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it might, it might go away, you know, it might go away so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So not retribution.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is just sort of there telling me that well it's still here now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You better hope that it is still here when ah they find out (inaudible 0:35:09.3), you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It could still go in the future but, you know, it hasn't yet but </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the future. Oh yeah and my doctor once told me that ah, ah I, I told her I hadn't had any trouble (inaudible 0:35:32.6) she was saying how well that ah sometimes a lot of it is mental and I didn't know exactly what she meant by that and ah, you know, if it's mental I certainly (inaudible 0:35:51.0) to keep it up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to get cured of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (0:36:00.5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Is that a serious concern to you as well as the </p>

<p> (inaudible 0:36:08.9)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but ah I sometimes like what if it is and ah what if goes only to the invention I mean why. You know, if it if it if it were psychosomatically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah, you know, suppose the problems stopped without me knowing why and then how would I how would I deal with that how would I try to, to ah get it back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm. Like you wouldn't have any way of, of recovering it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like being cut off from your (inaudible 0:36:43.6). Yeah</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that is kind of new I don't think it's that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know I just interesting like (inaudible 0:37:02.0) psychosomatic (inaudible 0:37:04.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but that is more of a daydream quality to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I really would like to get it over with from my friend if that's where the letter is from where all my students are from everything like that. Because the (inaudible 0:37:38.2) keeps me from, from I feel like it keeps me from (inaudible 0:37:42.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm very unsecure about my future I can't really stand up to it. Ah, I can't I can't sort of ah stand up to it on the she doesn't want to pay my tuition any more, you know, when I first I had to be because I can't (inaudible 0:38:13.4) doing things either way. So</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right now if I stood up to her and said I can't go on doing things your way, you know, if it would cut off the tuition ah I would be out in the cold and school wise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the then getting taken by the back I mean I just. I don't know I want to get a degree if the draft drafted me I couldn't really leave the country.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, because then I wouldn't be able to get my degree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. So you have to think (inaudible 0:38:59.7) you have to if you got a degree but that means that you that you can't say the things you hide. You can't risk what might come of things (inaudible 0:39:15.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well risk if you want I, I seem to feel certain I'm sure that if I had things my way he would ah he wouldn't give me any (inaudible 0:39:32.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also he </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The one who gives me money to support me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. I didn't mean risk in the sense of that is some (inaudible 0:39:41.4) you wouldn't make that because that's a very dangerous kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Once that happened.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's not only just telling him these things but I mean the facts are like changing the way ah we relate, you know, like right now he tells me he points me in every direction (0:40:01.1) just like I'm still a child. It's pretty much I do what he wants me to do what he tells me to do and ah, you know, I don't want it to be that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. You don't want it just to go the way he puts you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Other than that I think the, you know, I, I have these, these few things that I consider well the most pressing problems in my life until they are solved I can't really ah ever get around to relating to people. You know, relating to people the fact that I don't do it well is, is very significant too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In itself but ah I don't think I'll be able to do that until I, you know, have some sort of ah, ah until I work out the problem of the draft and the problem with school and the problem with college and just those three things the draft (inaudible 0:41:20.9) like ah in a mesh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are all entangled in each other and ah, you know, I like some connect my father to school and the draft altogether.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. How come you can't do something about personal relationships until those things change?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because they bother me so much ah I can't do what I want. Uhm</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that to say that until you feel free of those things you, you wouldn't be able to you need that kind of freedom to be able to relate to people or just feel better?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. (0:42:03.3) So I with those with those problems I just I'm always so wrapped up in myself and my problems that ah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the way you just sketched out your problems, the problem with your father I thought you were saying it doesn't seem changeable right now and the same thing with the draft. If you aren't going to go and take your physical now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but just because I can't just because I can't change it doesn't mean (inaudible 0:42:39.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I don't really then understand what you mean by solving these problems. What would have to change for you to feel free of them? Or to feel that you had some solutions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you're asking me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, I think to be certain that I wasn't going to be ah drafted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that would that is sort like the first thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh the</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really feel that I can, can deal with my father until.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Until I have that, that like being under the back in a very weak position.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He can always end up block tuition well you're going to get drafted now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now what would have to be for you to feel that you weren't going to be drafted? Would that have to mean that you would have had both the concrete thing of going to your pre-induction physical and having them give you (inaudible 0:44:00.3) or is there anything short of that could make you feel certain because this doctor?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I ah I would feel a lot better maybe, maybe even sure if I ah had a series of letters from doctors that I get asthma.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I just have one doctor one letter from one doctor</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I tried to get in touch with the doctors I had when I was in high school and things like that and they never called me. Didn't have anything in their records about asthma so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like if I had more, more letters about the problem I still bet or I went to see a, a specialist or something downtown something like that and got, you know, a letter from another doctor who wasn't associated with this one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. But that's something you feel you can do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like ah if I were to do it, it would be well (a) expensive, (b) maybe he would say you don't have any problem, you know, I can't write you a letter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How likely is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't even matter I'm sorry I said how likely is that and then I realized that, that it's just you're having endless givings about that, that ah that's significant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he might say that you have it but, you know, you hardly have it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might not help his letter might not help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or he might not even write one he might even tell you, you know, have the problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He might take away your, your refuge.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he wouldn't he wouldn't take it away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Undermine it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If he said I didn't have the problem ah and the Draft Board questions that one letter and they have to go into further and examine me to find out ah they might come to the conclusion I don't have a problem. (0:46:10.1)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. So that would be true</p>

<p>PATIENT: He sort of like</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If your asthma is that borderline.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I'm, I'm ah </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then that would be true then that is </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: True whether or not a sectional.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid of, of finding out ah the truth if I don't like what the truth is going to be (inaudible 0:46:37.6)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would rather I want to feel more secure then that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to take the chance (inaudible 0:46:43.8). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Even though you und... you understand that if lets say your asthma is that borderline there is a chance that, you know, what would happen by your closing that you wouldn't have any other thing prepared to get you out of the draft and you would go in. And then they would go into it further and would question you maybe. I mean if everything you hear is it may happen things the occurrence of it seems to be independent of ah the person downtown saying that, you know, he.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is it like to not wanting to think about it no. To think that it might not work now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's like saying well so does that all come up to mean that idea of going that, that the one thing that would make you feel more secure about the draft (0:47:59.8) which would be to substantiated letters you can't do because you might not get them. You might find out that, that, that your asthma isn't going to get you out at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you thought of Quaker House.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that's, that's why I that's where I found </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:48:22.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They will refer you to specialist to, to write letters I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum. They did they gave me a name (inaudible 0:48:31.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't</p>

<p>PATIENT: Stuff like that (inaudible 0:48:32.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to because </p>

<p>PATIENT: The doctor I talked to made it sound like I didn't need to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. But you don't believe him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't forget that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: People have been wrong before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One person (inaudible 0:48:50.5) I want to get a bunch of people together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who all tell me the same thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun. That what all I meant to say by that was that if you, you just said well he said you didn't do that but don't forget you don't believe him about anything else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:49:05.8)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't you don't believe him that you that uhm that your letters are going to get you out so you shouldn't believe him that you don't need any more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, no I believe my letter could help get me out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think that ah it's not enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, he says well you got asthma and it says so right here this is all you need, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just report that and I just sort of stood there babbling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, saying it shouldn't be this easy, you know, should I get a history he said well if you want, you know. Probably if you want you can go to other doctors anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just figured that, that, you know, ah listing just one person is </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, one person can always be wrong you don't have any idea of the probability of the results as I but you go to a lot people </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (0:50:02.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have seen a lot of doctors. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And a lot of people agree that like the probability of all them being wrong is a lot less.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. The reason I keep questioning you is because I don't see you also say you aren't willing to go and check out that probability to try to get a grade because of the risk entitled in that. The risk of being disillusioned.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the same time you're not anywhere near a 100 percent safe in your illusion but you're in your illusion it's like you have misgivings every time you don't have an asthma attack for two weeks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know I can't ah I can't think, you know, inclined to be (inaudible 0:51:05.9) in a rationale way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But is it like now (inaudible 0:51:12.5). Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I just can't </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Cope with it or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And my father keeps saying what the hell well you won't have to go to Vietnam don't worry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's his only response. I don't know I think we'll be out of Vietnam by the time you graduate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He has been saying that for four years. And it's getting awful close.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess with that (inaudible 0:51:39.0) is, you know, it's not any of these small things like whether this doctor is going to write off, you know, say you don't really have it or whether you don't have an asthma attack in two weeks or, you know, any of those things that we have really been talking about aren't really the issue. The issue is more like you, you think of the draft it's like a monster to you and it really does freak you out and you can't imagine why it can't get away from you from the from it's clutches. (0:52:07.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's part of like a system of problems too. You know, I don't like the way the whole American society runs with cars and computers and, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of like the front edge of this ah whole threatening, threatening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, this whole machine that is kind of running down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the front edge the back to get rid just might be something else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just going to worry about the (inaudible 0:52:55.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That it's intermeshed with all my other problems. And ah it's I can't expect to, to cope with my other problems in, in the ways that I think I should until I got this out of the way it's like the first thing I have to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh see the reason that I don't think that I, I have my doubts about that because what when we just talked about the draft it seems like you couldn't find anyone to relate that was dealing with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean can't find anyone to deal with it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it seems like after we got through talking about all of those alternatives and I kept pressing you and you started feeling like you were under attack and what happened was uhm it seemed to me like, like you didn't see any alternative for yourself but waiting until your, your, you know, you got this and then you went to the Draft Board and then you found out but like you didn't see why you should take any initiative do you understand? (0:54:03.6)</p>

<p> It's all that things addressed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the only thing I can do to solve it would be to write the letter and tell them, you know, that I don't want this to left any more and that's putting me in a precarious position.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. But all those about getting (inaudible 0:54:25.7) or getting more letters do anything like that really don't seem open to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't really follow you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In what sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I still have to sit around and wait for </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You weren't really going to </p>

<p>PATIENT: Test me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum, and you weren't really going to relax I could say until (inaudible 0:54:47.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of like building up to to a war analogy in hopes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Building up function weapons or something like that, that's just, you know, you still got to show that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's ah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You still don't know if they are going to work until you </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, regardless of how many letters I get ah there is still no guarantee.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The only guarantee is getting over with, you know, the only thing you can be certain of is you can't be certain about the future at all because there is just something about things that happened, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can be certain about the way things the way it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah certainly the uncertain of killing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can't just seem, you know, run right ahead into that (0:56:01.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Into that encounter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I still have to wait for it to come.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you couldn't bear to be right. But the idea of actually (inaudible 0:56:18.9) putting yourself in their hands. (Inaudible 0:56:20.7) like Thanksgiving he kicked you out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From getting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not only rebellion I just think it's that's sort of dumb.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The remote possibility it would just be my luck that I turned myself in and not get the (inaudible 0:56:37.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, and then come June they probably like (inaudible 0:56:44.3). I think I have I mean uhm you want you want to hold off the confrontation as long as you can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you never know when something else might come up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not like the sometimes I (inaudible 0:57:10.0) in an automobile accident you (inaudible 0:57:19.8). Like I can't I can't see how hurry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that they have wrecked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah so in a way you have given up (inaudible 0:57:32.6) you really don't it's just not viable. I mean it would make you certain one way or the other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not worth it's not worth it to be certain like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would be certain but </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there it's like saying yeah you would be certain but it turns out there are other things involved then just the certainty and uncertainty event (0:58:03.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's not only be certain it's being certain that you're not going to have to ah </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'm not going to be drafted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And you don't want to be</p>

<p>PATIENT: Being, being certain that I'm going to be drafted is certainly no better than being uncertain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether or not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Every I seem like I don't know. I feel like I really can't ah can't function but it because of the whole stress. You know, I can't ah it just seems like there is nothing I can do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't ah press I can't confront it immediately and I can't wait, you know, it would seem contradictory but it's just like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Neither one of them is acceptable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. There are different costs until each but the costs to each.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are unacceptable to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know I think (inaudible 0:59:20.9) well what sort of come out of this to me is that ah even if both are unacceptable maybe I would feel better if I went to see other doctors and tried to get letters.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Well, you know, something I did want to ask you about that I, I think I've pressured you a lot more today then I have other times and I uhm I was wondering how you were reacting to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, at one point perhaps just once ah it seemed to me as though I was getting some pressure on it like you were trying to tell me that I was being inconsistent or something but then all of a sudden it just flashed on me that if I am being inconsistent (1:00:08.3), you know, ah it's sort of that's what I'm here for is to find out why I am inconsistent be aware of something, you know, it really didn't bother me except, except at first.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like when I first became aware of the pressure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then it</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then like yeah all of a sudden I became well it's pressure that kind of pressure visit is okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not like you're sitting in judgment and ah my lies are going to get shown up and I'm going to be thrown in jail or something. It didn't do (inaudible 1:00:46.8). In a way it was almost good because it kept my mind going I had to keep on thinking and talking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah I couldn't daydream about the (inaudible 1:01:01.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Well it's not an alternative but, but also in a way well just think about feeling like it was uhm it's okay it's not that kind of pressure did you come to believe that or was that like telling yourself that and get yourself out of feeling pretty selective?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I believe it. You know, just, just being aware of the pressure it first made me uneasy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then very shortly after that uhm I just decided that ah because I had nothing to be defensive about or something like that, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Yeah, like it wasn't like it wasn't a matter of having to protect </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The area.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because ah (1:02:12.7). You know, I think acknowledged to myself at this point I could be very inconsistent, you know, it's like really I'm, I'm not like working and trying to build a position when you can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just like people to in Court to be like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you're don't have the stake and be unhappy maybe together (inaudible 1:02:34.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm not worried about it. You know, I'm not like working towards it ah (inaudible 1:02:44.1) your goal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess how I respond to maybe under the pressure is relevant to, it didn't bother me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum. Okay. Thursday </p>

<p>PATIENT: It also seems like (inaudible 1:03:33.3) if you weren't bored like a lot of times (inaudible 1:03:44.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh that's not true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I mean we can talk about that </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where should we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess where we left off the last time. I'm not sure where it exactly was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I had talked about the issue of power. Was that last time where we ended? And it didn't sit quite right for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's not that it didn't sit right. It's just that I wondered if that was indeed the case. Could be, I don't know, if that's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did it feel like partly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Could you explain that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I was just thinking of the idea of - you had talked about sort of objectification or objectifying. And I had wondered if it had something to do with the sort of power dynamic in a relationship. And I guess oftentimes therapists are seen as having more power than the client; I actually try to balance that, sort of my theoretical orientation. But still obviously you come in; you pay me. And so I wondered if maybe the fact that you often find yourself objectifying me or kind of describe me as artwork or pink bear (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...if that in some way served to change the power dynamic in your mind? So that's what I had been wondering, if that was related in any way. But when I first said it last time it didn't fit for you that that... [00:02:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still I guess don't think it does because if this is something that's been playing out in the other world, the day-to-day world for me, I don't see my direction or my objectification of people I don't even know or people I do kind of as being a power thing. So I understand that the dynamic here is different; you do have power and I'm entirely okay with that. But I don't think I'm trying to equalize it or shift it. I think it's just a, it's part of what I do generally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what does it mean that you do that generally?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It means that I did it earlier today. It means I do it here, it means I will probably do it later today. And although I did it earlier today, I stopped to ask myself so you're done with school; what is the pressure? What is the need for this? And I don't know. I couldn't answer it. I was a little dismayed but it also just seems like a force of habit. So I don't know how to explain it now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe it's not pressure that you were escaping from, or moving, or maybe it wasn't an escape. Maybe it was a move towards something rather than a move away. [00:04:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I've thought about this for the past couple of weeks. And this objectification to me seems like just - to give another poor fitting analogy is to say it's a nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there in that it's not as though I am thinking that any of these fantasies or whatever are something that I look to as a replacement for my current situation, my current status. So it's - I think it's the knowledge that it is impermanent, temporary, fleeting that carries the appeal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's not personal. To think of another word for objectification is kind of depersonalizing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but also it's - yes, I mean in such a way that it does not matter what they're like to be around. That's kind of beside the point. When I say they I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoever you're thinking of, who the object of the fantasy is. [00:06:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and when I think about these as they happen or just after, when I say they happen it's like five seconds sometimes. I don't know. I guess I - a number of things happened but one of them is I think to myself well, I think to myself before to what end? What do I really think this is going to happen? Why do I put myself in a position that I know isn't going to lead to anything?</p>

<p>So the other thing I was thinking about is this delusional sense that I have of encountering someone and either thinking that they are attracted to me or trying to make myself think or demonstrate that they're attracted to me. And it - and I guess when I say trying to make myself think that they're, trying to improve myself, it's like trying to get their attention, trying to get them to notice me I guess in order to perpetuate this feedback that I am desirable or whatever. And then it stops there because it has to. But I don't know what value there is in going through that process. It must have value if I'm doing it. [00:08:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or it had value at one time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes and it's become a habit. I don't know. I just don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What precedes your thoughts when you start to go into that fantasy mode? What's happening just before? You said this morning, stick to real life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's - I guess to clarify it there seems to have become I don't know if it's, if I should say an alternative to what I've been doing or another version of it. But it seems like I can look at somebody and find them attractive and although I enjoy the finding them attractive I don't necessarily go into a fantasy. [00:10:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that feel okay for you or does that feel uncomfortable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels a little uncomfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What feels uncomfortable about noticing that someone's attractive and enjoying that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess - I don't know, I just, I can't - maybe it's because it's so close to my other process that I can't until now, how to differentiate the two, or at least acknowledge that there are at least two versions of this. I don't know but it's - I guess in some ways it comes back to me wondering how would I react if in the process of finding somebody attractive I was put in a situation where I had to... [00:12:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're not - it sounds like the discomfort comes from not trusting that you would make a, if given an opportunity, you would make the choice that you want to make or that you want yourself to make.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Not should, want, yes. I don't know. So that to me seems like what happened this morning at least.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it seems like a lot of it is about trusting yourself. See in some ways the fantasies and the attractions are about testing yourself. I mean each time that you notice somebody and don't act on it it's a test.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. You mean do I act on it as far as enter it into a fantasy?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I mean entering into a real life interaction with the person because if you think about your relationship, the vow that you took was not to have other relationships with other people. It's not about that you're never going to find anybody else attractive. Nobody would be able to uphold that. [00:14:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do think that there's a difference between fantasizing about somebody and noticing that somebody else is attractive. But there's also a difference between fantasizing about an interaction and having an actual real life interaction with them, whether it be a flirtation or acting or the actual engaging in some sort of sexual behavior. Those are all separate things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I see them all as the same. And - or at least I have until recently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did they all get - how did they get defined that way as all being the same?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think at one time they were all, when I wasn't married for example - I should say I wasn't (inaudible) in any way with my wife then, partnered, whatever - I think the point was to find somebody attractive, flirt to the point where something does happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was all the same base; it was all part of the process. [00:16:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: All part of the process, yes, yes. And again even then I don't think it mattered, or I should say there were times when it didn't matter. The appeal was that it was fleeting, that it was - you didn't have to deal with whatever, life. And that hasn't changed. But I think it's just a matter of being able to realize that there are different degrees of subsiding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What led you to change that with your wife? So there was a point where it went from flirting to dating, to dating seriously to making a decision to get married. What prompted you to make those changes with her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think beyond the fact that I was and still am in love with her, I think for a long time it was I wanted stability and I wanted intimacy and as much of a family as a husband and wife are. And I don't know what else to say. [00:18:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was interesting because your fantasies provide the opposite of what you just said you wanted. You wanted intimacy; you wanted stability. And the fleeting attractions and fleeting fantasies they're not intimate, especially if it's a very objectified person. And there's no stability; it's actually the thrill of the moment rather than the sustained relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so what do you make of that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well in a very broad sense, that you have different needs, lots of different types of needs. You have a need for intimacy; you have a need for stability. You also have a need to experience a range of feelings and that fleeting charge that you get out of a fantasy it's an experience that you may not get out of a sustained relationship like you did at the beginning. And maybe it does come back in different ways over the course of the relationship but that intensity is something that doesn't stay over the long term, forever. So I guess a part of it is finding ways to meet your different needs in a way that feels acceptable because this doesn't feel acceptable to you. [00:20:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what do people do? I mean do they just understand that these things serve a purpose and they go no further than what is, what fulfills the purpose?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think people do lots of different things. Some people have multiple affairs. It doesn't sound like you want to do that but that is certainly one way that people do this. People create opportunities for those kinds of experiences in their own relationship. And sometimes doing something new and different with your partner, whether that be go and explore a new land - being in a different setting sometimes sparks a different set of feelings than what happens in your everyday life when you're debating how clean your apartment needs to be before you have someone over - some people engage in fantasies. And sometimes you decide what level of - there are some needs that don't get met all the time. So I think you have a lot of different alternatives. Feeling guilty constantly probably isn't the healthiest.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it's exhausting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Finding a way that enough of your needs are met that you feel satisfied with your life, not necessarily every day all the time but over the - in a broader sense - but also feeling okay about the kinds of choices that you're making. [00:22:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I still wonder even if I do understand that there is a point at which it serves a purpose and beyond that it's excessive or whatever, what is it about not being able to trust myself that is still there?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that seems really important. The not trusting yourself piece because I think it would feel so different - it would feel so much safer for you and you'd feel different if you knew that you have this fleeting thought and so what. But because you don't trust yourself, if the opportunity really presents itself you're not quite sure what you'd do. You can't say so what, that was an enjoyable thought, move on. Instead you move on to feeling very heavy about it because you're not sure that it was okay or that it would be okay if it were real life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So how would I do that? [00:24:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You start to trust yourself. What would happen if you did trust yourself? How would you know you did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I suppose even acknowledging that there's a difference between seeking someone's attention and then just finding somebody attractive is in a way trusting myself. But when I go to a coffee shop and I see the person behind the counter as attractive, will I go back to that coffee shop? Probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To get coffee or to see the person behind the counter?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To see the person behind the counter. And that, to me, when it involves volition, I think then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well then it feels much more active, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's not a passive like oh a person walks by...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pretty active. Then it's more of an active seeking out of a person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, or even being entirely happy to pay you every week to see you. Not so happy but, you know, acceptable. I guess that's when I start to wonder if it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wonder what your motivation is. [00:26:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And why I need that motivation or just have it? But I do know that it's not just a matter of seeing you that I've been coming here. I do realize that coming here and actually dealing with the very issue that I'm struggling with with you is - I mean I'm hopeful in that, I'm confident in that I am making progress. But when you ask what would it look like if I did trust myself. I mean I think it's easier to trust myself since I don't drink. But even still I've found myself in situations where I think it just felt wrong. I didn't go too far necessarily but it's - I could have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like one of the things that not drinking does for you, right, so your sobrigo is fully intact. I think the part of you that wants to follow the rules and it has high standards for what those rules are, drinking shuts that part of your brain down, right, so...[00:28:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I used to look forward to that in fact...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because the relief?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...because it allowed for lax behavior.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thing that not drinking doesn't change is what the desires are and your emotional reaction to things. It changes your behavior, your ability to control your behavior but the initial desires are still there and the river of over-reactions you're having to your environment, it doesn't make those go away. And that's the thing that it sounds like you really want to be gone for you is not to have that particular reaction. To have it matter less what the person behind the coffee counter looks like and to make the decision about which coffee shop to go to based on what logistically made sense, for paying for therapy whether you were seeing me or the guy next door to be the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That wouldn't be the same. And what I mean by that is that I couldn't work through this with...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, but this is not why you originally came to therapy. I mean it came up as part of your process... [00:30:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. True, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like something is missing in your relationship with your wife?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you mentioned earlier just the kind of adrenaline burst or just excitement or difference or response maybe I guess. I don't know. Perhaps trust.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that both ways? [00:32:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, just - I meant just her. It's, and she doesn't say it, she never brings it up, but even when the subject of Canada comes up, I just shudder. She doesn't. A couple days ago when I was finished she said what you need is a week in [inaudible], which is a region in Canada where that whole thing happened. And it's like, she was saying it lovingly and like I deserve it, but for me it was like a knife through my heart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you respond when she said that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said yes, yes, that's right. I just changed the subject. It wasn't like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wonder what would happen if you shared your reaction, your real reaction?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm afraid to because I don't want to, I don't want to bum her out either. I mean I think I've told her that for me, we've got friends from Canada recently, we just went down there to see them, and she's talking about having a house down there. And for me I think I told her that look Canada is not something I feel - I mean it's tainted for me. The whole country, the whole - I just can't, at least right now look at it as being a really appealing place to be at all. The reason people go there in large part is because of the beaches. And for me to find myself on the west coast of Canada would just be - it's just something I can't bear. Especially having gone to those places with her after it happened, when she knows and she was upset with me and I was feeling like crap. And that being the memory that I have of those places and the memory I've had of being in Canada for three months after that where I just felt like shit and I - so yes. And yet somehow I will forget those things when I'm out in the street. So kind of how do I do that? How do I forget how awful I felt for so long to even today and yet I'm still able to just... [00:36:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feeling good is really addictive, right? And the rush that you feel, however fleeting, in the moment of a fantasy or, it doesn't even have to be as involved as a fantasy, but that fleeting rush of endorphins that you experience when you lose yourself for a minute feels really good. And that's so addictive. It's the same endorphin rush that if you were taking Cocaine. So it can be really hard if those two things don't equate in - the horrible feelings that you suffered after the incident don't compute and don't equate to the fleeting rush that you have in the moment of a fantasy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it would be unreasonable to expect that I would deny myself of the rush of what those fleeting [inaudible at 00:38:22].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially if you don't have another way to get there because you can't expect yourself to never seek really pleasurable feelings. I mean that's a pretty natural drive. And if you're not having those good feelings in other ways, feeling really good about yourself and your accomplishments, getting that out of your relationship, you're not (ph) going to feel it someway. So I wonder if trying to provide yourself with opportunities to have really good feelings about yourself in other ways rather than just trying to shut this one way down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I see what you're saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And because you do carry around a lot of doubt about yourself and you carry around, maybe not constantly, but you certainly - I mean that decision to talk about the experience and the feelings that were brought up for you when you saw all these friends, or when she mentions maybe getting a house there, you clearly carry a lot of heavy feelings around. It almost makes your need for the other stronger because you want something to balance out that weight. I wonder what would happen if you talked about it more with your wife. Not necessarily the fantasy piece but the feeling badly piece. You're hesitant to talk about it because you don't want to bum her out, you said, but I wonder if that's almost - I was thinking about the DBT, kind of doing the opposite action thing. You avoid it because you don't want to bum her out. I wonder what would happen if you actually talked about it. [00:40:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. You know, the idea of getting help as a couple in order to even to check in to see where she is, that scares the hell out of me. It's like I know I'm going to feel like hell. I know we're leaving the country in August. I don't know how or when we're going to move through it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They have therapists in other countries.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're going to France, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They have English speaking ones there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True, true. But it's the very thing that I'm so angry with my dad about. That he didn't get help for me - and I was one of the ones who was affected by his failures. [00:42:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you know firsthand that avoiding it doesn't make the impact go away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I know. Exactly. I know how damaging it could be no matter how okay she seems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of the thing that's so scary for you is you don't really know where she is. And you might find out that she's okay, you might find out that she's not, you might find out that she's still really angry, or you might find out that she's forgiven you. But you don't know unless you really talk about it whether that be in therapy or on your own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. In our remaining time can we talk about something more uplifting?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what that might be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well sometimes it's helpful to put the stuff on hold. That's what the blue box is for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, is that what that's for? [00:44:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, to put stuff in that you just can't process anymore until the next time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's so tiny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has the ability to hold infinite amounts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that drawer might be more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can imagine it being there too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. Just never open it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. It's okay to put it on hold; it's not okay to put it away forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So next week I graduate and the family's coming to town Tuesday and Wednesday until Saturday and Sunday. Yes, so it still hasn't quite hit me yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You seem so proud.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess it just seemed easier than I thought it would be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't make it less valuable, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You worked quite hard from what I saw.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Put a lot of hours into learning the language, you wrote all the papers and manipulated and taken in a lot of information.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and, although this might be digressing into not uplifting, because it's over and because it went by so fast and because it didn't seem like it was that challenging, it just makes me question whether or not I really needed to do it at all. And yet I don't think I would've been able to reach that conclusion without having done it. At the same time, it's now leading me out of the country to do work that I probably couldn't do without it. So I guess questioning the motive for doing it and the logic of doing it is kind of beside the point. [00:47:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if you could take some time before your family arrives, because I know that once they get here you'll be doing your own thing, but you have the weekend. And I wonder if creating a narrative about your experience here that's true for you and that works to help you identify what it means for you to have completed the program that that might be different than what you thought it was going to mean coming in. But that doesn't make it not as valuable. So creating a narrative that this is what my time here meant and this is what I take away from it, it might help to give you some understanding of sort of what it does mean for you in your life rather than looking at - because what I hear you saying is this is what it wasn't. And it wasn't exactly what you thought it was going to be. And because you're looking at what it wasn't it doesn't feel valuable. But there are lots of things that it was, might be professionally, academically, personally. But just taking some time to create a narrative of what it was. [00:48:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, okay. If I don't tell you this before I leave - you're really wise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So are we over at [inaudible at 00:49:11] today?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will be over there. My last day, actually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see you're wearing the school colors.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not on purpose. But isn't that nice of me to intuitively do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right, that's right. Just seems so appropriate for some reason, but yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My [inaudible at 00:49:35] person didn't wear jeans. I'm not allowed to wear jeans over there so next week I get to rock my jeans.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't get to wear jeans over there?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not a lot of rules but they do run the sort of dress code rules.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see. Yes, I think Dr. [inaudible] wears cords a lot of the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's allowed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Since we have devolved into talking about clothing, we should probably end for the day. So do you want to make a guess at when you could come in because I don't think - do you have one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think it's going to be next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I figured that with all your family in town and graduation. [00:50:21]</p>

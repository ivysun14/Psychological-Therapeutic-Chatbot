Imago Couples Therapy, with Pat Love<br>
Couples Therapy with the Experts</p></center>

<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION:</u></b></p>

<p><b>Patricia Love, EdD</b> is a renowned expert on relationships and personal development, speaking at conferences all over the world. She is the author of the two popular books, <i>Hot Monogamy</i> and <i>The Truth About Love</i>, and the recent <i>How to Improve Your Marriage Without Talking About It</i>. She has appeared numerous times on Oprah, The Today Show and CNN.</p>

<p>This transcript shows the Imago Dialogue Process in an actual couples therapy session. 
Imago Couples Therapy provides the structure for your clients to have calm, empathic conversations with each other, no matter the conflict. In this session, Pat Love demonstrates this process with Kathy and Dave who report that they don't know how to discuss problems without tensions running high. Dave is afraid to talk to Kathy about his concerns and so they build up. Kathy is losing patience and trust in Dave. Dr. Love carefully and adeptly helps Dave communicate fears and requests to Kathy, and patiently helps Kathy reflect them back correctly. The couple leaves the session optimistic, with new tools to communicate their difficulties, and insight into unique ways they can demonstrate their love for each other.</p>

<p><b><u>LOVE'S APPROACH</u></b></p>

<p>Carlson: What is Imago Therapy, Pat?</p>

<p>Love: Well, "imago" means image in Latin and Greek, so it makes sense if live in Greece, for example. And what it really talks about is the images that we bring into adulthood from our early experience, so it's... and how these images get in the way of getting the love you want or keeping the love that you find, so to speak.</p>

<p>Carlson: What's an example of an image? I'm not sure...</p>

<p>Love: An image would be... For example, if I looked at my familiar love, or the love that I experienced as a child, it was a very distant love, it was a very anxious love, it was actually a neglectful love. So I brought in those negative images, so that when I get in a relationship, I might even act distant, I might even be neglectful of my partner. Or if my partner is neglectful of me, it feels normal, it feels familiar. But then over time, of course, that builds resentment and you don't get the connection that you want. So it makes us conscious. You were talking about the really being aware or having the insight. Imago therapy makes you conscious of the images that are from the past that are interfering with getting the love you want in the present.</p>

<p>Kjos: So you talked about your childhood experience. What led you to this approach to therapy? What influenced you?</p>

<p>Love: Well, I think you hit the nail on the head. I study in this profession for two reasons. One is to better myself, because I'm very aware that some of the advantages as well as the disadvantages that I experience as an adult are rooted in childhood. We don't come self-assembled—that we really do form our neural pathways through our experience. And some of those are very positive, and some of those need adjustment, so to speak. So part of it is to understand about myself. And of course the act of helping and the act of finding out what really does help—I have an innate curiosity, I'm a lifelong learner. And so I really want to know what helps people to be the best that they can be, and what helps people have the love that they long for.</p>

<p>Carlson: This Imago Therapy, how was it developed? And is there just like one Imago approach to Imago Therapy?</p>

<p>Love: Okay, that, great question.</p>

<p>Carlson: I guess that's two questions.</p>

<p>Love: My friends and colleagues, Harville Hendrix and his wife Helen Hunt Hendrix or Helen LaKelley Hendrix Hunt—she has many names, her birth name and her maiden name and her...</p>

<p>Carlson: Sounds like an image issue.</p>

<p>Love: That's right. And Helen and Harville actually developed this model together, and they were doing on the same journey that I've been on, which is trying to create the best, finest love for their family as well as for themselves. And what they really did together is they formed a living laboratory. And during that laboratory, what they would do is they would work on these processes, and then Harville and Helen would write it down. And they developed the Imago model from their own study—they're both psychologists, they're both very well read—and from their study, their experience in helping others, they formed this model. And he and I have been together for 20 years, and Helen and I have been friends for that long.</p>

<p>Carlson: So they researched themselves in order to come up with these ideas?</p>

<p>Love: Well, they're very, very well read, they study research, but also they worked in a living laboratory. Their relationship is a living laboratory.</p>

<p>Kjos: Well, how about cultural differences or, how does this work, have you worked with people of different cultures?</p>

<p>Love: Absolutely. Absolutely. And what Imago is really about, if you had to put it in a sound bite from my point of view, it's about consciousness, where it... and so the consciousness is an innate attribute for the human being. So it really has less cultural bias than most any model because it's really about, I just provide the information that's coming from my images, regardless of where the images are from. So there are images from the culture, there are images from the family. So the images that I bring are going to be from my family of origin regardless of where that was in the world.</p>

<p>Carlson: So you would tailor your approach, though, for each person you work with?</p>

<p>Love: Well, actually, the person tailors it, because Imago is two things. One, it's a theory, and the theory is that you will be attracted to someone who represents familiar love to you or holds the imago or the image of what says "I love you" to you—that we each come into adulthood with an imprinting or an image of what love looks and feels like. Now, that's very different as cultures vary. So depending on your cultural heritage, you will pick a person rather appropriate, appropriate from your culture. So first of all, it's a theory that you will be attracted to someone who will help you finish this unfinished business of childhood, because the unfinished business of childhood is, I might want, for example, for my imago, which I have distance and neglect and anxious, I want a neglectful person to come in and be close to me. I want a distant person to come in and pay attention and be attuned to me. And yet, because that's part of my experience, I have a defense around it. So part of it is a theory, but the other part of Imago is a set of techniques about, one is dialogue, talking and listening, you're going to see in a few moments. Another one is asking for what you want. So, see, it's not cultural, culture-specific, and you may be more or less inclined, for example, to ask for what you want depending upon your culture, but talking and listening is a part of every culture.</p>

<p>Carlson: So if I had a mother who was really close to me—</p>

<p>Love: Yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: —and I distanced from her—</p>

<p>Love: Yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: —and I had a father who I wanted to get close to who distanced from me, this is going to influence the kind of partner that I'm going to choose?</p>

<p>Love: Yes. Yes. And we know this from research, by the way. It's not just clinical observation. In fact, attachment theory is the most researched area in psychology. So we know that we're imprinted. We know that the brain, the neural pathways in the brain are formed through experience, that we come in with a genetic predisposition, but our experiences do affect us, and do influence our behavior and personality.</p>

<p>Carlson: So I chose my wife, or she chose me? I mean, I wasn't aware of this.</p>

<p>Love: No, no, it's not conscious. If you just... There's a neat exercise.</p>

<p><b><i>A. Think of:</i></b><br>
<b><i>Three Negative Characteristics of the people that raised you</i></b></p>
 
If you just write down, A, B, C, D, E, and A, if you would just write, think of the three negative characteristics of the people who raised you. Just the three negative characteristics, from a child's point of view, and you write down the negatives—like I might write, "Distant, neglectful, preoccupied." I might write those down. And then you write the positives. We also want the positives.</p>

<p><b><i>B. Think of:</i></b><br>
<b><i>Three Positive Characteristics of the people that raised you</p></i></b></p>

<p>Supportive, humorous, intelligent—those would be my three. And then you'd begin to think, "What is it that you longed for as a child? What was your heart's desire?"</p>

<p><b><i>C. Think of:</i></b><br>
<b><i>What you longed for as a child</p></i></b></p>

<p>Like in my family, I wanted them to spend time with me. I just never really got enough time. And then you think, "Well, how do you want to feel?"</p>

<p><b><i>D. Think of:</i></b><br>
<b><i>How do you want to feel?</p></i></b></p>

<p>What is it that feels good to you? When someone sees you or recognizes you, or when someone actually touches you or helps you out? What is it that you want to feel?</p>

<p>Like I wanted to feel safe and calm. Okay? So that was what I longed for feeling. That would be D. E is a real important questions because it's, "Think about yourself as a child." And I'll just ask each of you this question: When you were a little boy or a little girl, and you were frustrated, generally speaking, and this could be frustrated at school, frustrated with your parents, how did you respond to frustration?</p>

<p><b><i>E. Think of:</i></b><br>
<b><i>How did you respond to childhood Frustration?</p></i></b></p>

<p>What was the way... I mean, did you try harder? Did you get angry? Did you hit your brother? Did you blame yourself? Did you go to your room? How did you respond to frustration?</p>

<p>Carlson: When the going gets tough, the tough get going.</p>

<p>Love: So you tried harder?</p>

<p>Carlson: Oh, for sure.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. You just kicked in and got determined, tried harder.</p>

<p>Carlson: Stubborn.</p>

<p>Kjos: I got angry.</p>

<p>Love: You got angry. Okay. And your anger, was it outward or inward, Diane?</p>

<p>Kjos: Outward.</p>

<p>Love: Outward. Okay. So what we probably will say, if you just take that A, B, C, D, E, and once you write those characteristics down, above A, you could put the lines, "I am attracted to a person who is: angry, distant, whatever.</p>

<p><b><i>I am attracted to a person who is...</i></b></p>

<p>That would be your negative characteristics. But I want him to be: warm, loving, supportive, there for me—</p>

<p><b><i>But I want him or her to be...</i></b></p>

<p>—so that I can finally get—</p>

<p><b><i>So that I can get...</i></b></p>

<p>—For me, to get to feel normal and get somebody to spend time with me and feel safe.</p>

<p><b><i>And feel...</i></b></p>

<p>That's over the D part. And E is, "But I stop myself from getting the love I want from—</p>

<p><b><i>But I stop myself from getting the love I want...</i></b></p>

<p>—getting angry, trying so hard." Because just imagine, if you live with someone who is always trying and always working, what's the downside of that? And we probably could look at your wife's complaints and you would find the downside of that. Because for me, like for me, when I got frustrated, I became very self-sufficient. I thought, "I'll just do it myself." That's one thing I did. Well, think about... that's got an advantage just like yours has an advantage and yours has an advantage. Nobody will run over you if you have your strength and your power that comes from anger. But it becomes inconvenient in adulthood and in relationships.</p>

<p>Carlson: So does this have a happy ending? I mean, it sounds like all this garbage we had as kids we have to take into...</p>

<p>Love: No. You bet. First of all, what we know is, first of all, the older you get, the more of these issues you deal with. And the second thing is, we do deal with them. And the third thing is that your partner can be the most healing agent of your life. It's not about blaming parents and it's not about wallowing in childhood. That's not what this is about. It's about: Okay, here's the hand I've been dealt. Now, how do we create a context that's healing and loving and corrective from any deficits we had in... We can't go back and change the past, but we can change the present. So how do we become one another's healer or corrective agent, or just a positive agent? How do we create a relationship that's healing and supportive for both of us?</p>

<p>Carlson: So it sounds like it's really important that you work with couples together.</p>

<p>Love: You bet.</p>

<p>Carlson: I mean, a husband and wife in the same room.</p>

<p>Love: You work with this because, first of all, if you and I are in a relationship, and I get it, that trying harder is what saved your life psychically, that that was a successful coping mechanism for you, first of all I don't take it so personally. I have another image, another way of viewing your trying, that that saved your life as a little boy. And that probably got you a lot of reward. And if I hear your anger, I could take it personally unless I understand this is Diane feeling some pain or some insecurity, and I see it in a different... And that's that second-order change we talk about.</p>

<p>Kjos: We just did an email exchange that you pushed, and I blew.</p>

<p>Carlson: Yeah, I noticed that. And I tried harder, though.</p>

<p>Love: There you go. And he doesn't give up—that's why I'm here today, I want to tell you that. But see, if you can know that, okay, let's push rewind and say to Diane, "I wonder what it was that maybe she was feeling uncomfortable prior to the defense. Let's push rewind. Let's go back and try to redo this." I begin to see that in a different... And that's, again, that second-order change, that paradigm shift we're always trying for in therapy.</p>

<p>Carlson: So what are the techniques and strategies? I think you've kind of touched on some of these, but can you highlight what they are that are used in this approach?</p>

<p>Love: Yeah. You know, when I found Imago therapy, when I met Harville, I was teaching in an AMFT-approved program in marriage and family therapy. And at the time—this was 20 years ago—there were many, many books on theory of, "Oh, here's why couples get in trouble, blah blah." But not very many on technique. It's been so rewarding because the first technique is dialogue.</p>

<p>And it's really a way of talking that replaces your harmful pattern, because I don't know what it was like in your early family, but for me it was like there was no information—people shut down or they blew. It was one extreme or the other. So dialogue—and dialogue facilitates differentiation. It looks like—you're going to see me do this—it looks like just a simple little playacting exercise, but there's so much going on unconsciously. So that's a very important part.</p>

<p>Carlson: So what does "facilitate differentiation" mean?</p>

<p>Love: It means that, let me just say what it is. You talk, and not only do I listen, but I have to say back what you're saying, and that is a mirror. And what that means is, first of all, I can't be watching the movie in my head when you're talking. I am forced to tune into you.</p>

<p>Carlson: Oh, you've got to listen.</p>

<p>Love: I've got to listen because I can't say it back if I'm not listening, okay? But here's what happens. For the sender, when I mirror back, you are experiencing contact, and you're experiencing the closeness. But when you're talking and I'm listening, if I truly listen and have to mirror back, it's going to hit me: "Wow, Jon's reality is different than my reality." And that's what differentiation is. It's being able to be close, to hold onto yourself, and acknowledging separateness without disconnecting.</p>

<p>Carlson: Okay, so we can be different and yet connected. Okay.</p>

<p>Love: You got it.</p>

<p>Carlson: So that's one strategy—dialogue.</p>

<p>Love: That's one strategy. The second one is the behavior change request. You're going to see me do a form of this. And that means, okay, so often times people dialogue, talk, mirror, mirror, mirror, and then people say, "Yeah, but it didn't change anything." At some point the rubber's got to hit the road. I've got to tell you what I want. You've got to tell me what I want. In fact, this is a way to short-circuit a blowup, is for you to ask for what you want or, if your partner blows, then you can say, "How can I be of help? What's one thing I could do right this minute that would be helpful?" And that starts to defuse, and it gives him something to do when you blow. And also if you can feel that, what I call the aura, because I tend to blow also, if I can catch it early, I can ask for what I want instead of blowing. But if I blow, if my partner will just say, "How can I be helpful?" Now, you know, that takes a lot of maturity, and you may do it further down the line, you know, when we all calm down. So the second one is the behavior change.</p>

<p>Carlson: So that's better than saying, "You're just like your mother."</p>

<p>Love: Well, it'll probably get you closer together.</p>

<p>Carlson: All right. So we've got behavior change request.</p>

<p>Love: We've got behavior change request.</p>

<p>Carlson: Then what?</p>

<p>Love: Which is a great one. And then there's another one that I really like that's called, and it's a long exercise, it's called a container exercise. But what this helps you do—and it's very sophisticated and powerful—it helps you separate archaic pain from current pain. Now, here's why it's important. When you blow, for example, by using the container process, you really begin to understand and recognize if I'm experiencing old pain, pain from my mother, pain from my father, pain from my ex-husband, pain from that teacher who shamed me in fourth grade, whatever it is—because the brain remembers, by the way. It's all there. You know, you've got this neural pathway that is formed and you get in touch with the pain around that. But you begin to delineate or separate and recognize. Now I know I'd say 80 percent of the time, it used to be like two percent of the time, I know I can feel the regression or the archaic pain coming up and I'm like, "Wait a minute." See, I can stop it early. You probably can relate to this.</p>

<p>Kjos: Yes, yeah.</p>

<p>Love: If I can catch it early. But if I'm blindsided by an old issue—so the container helps you separate the past from the present. That's why the two of you really do become one another's healing agents or therapists.</p>

<p>Carlson: If you don't use the container then it's the dumpster.</p>

<p>Love: It's the dumpster, and neither, none of us likes to be dumped on.</p>

<p>Carlson: Right.</p>

<p>Love: Another one is like positive flooding. We know from research that really, you've got to offset the negatives with the positives. That loving couples have hundreds of these positive behaviors a day, and it may just be a smile, or holding that contact with your eyes a little bit longer, it could be the touch of a hand, it could be just acknowledging the richness of the color in your pants. I mean, it's not taking more time, necessarily. It's how we spend our time, that we all like to be acknowledged in a positive way. You're going to hear that on the tape. You're just going to see this couple illustrate that so well.</p>

<p>Carlson: And that's what we're going to do next, is we are going to watch the tape that you did with this young couple. What else should we look for?</p>

<p>Love: Okay. We should look, in this tape we should look for the images that each individual in this tape show, have. You're going to look for the image that you think he brings into the relationship and the image she brings into the relationship. And also you're going to look at how the dialogue will keep their conversation calm. And you're going to look at him come out of his fear. You're going to see a lot of fear on his face, and you're going to be able, if you watch real closely, and you're going to see by using a simple exercise that doesn't even hardly sound like an exercise the way I'm going to do it, just almost like talking normally, that he's going to be able to say things to her that he hasn't said before.</p>

<p>Carlson: What are you doing in this, if we're going to look at you?</p>

<p>Love: Okay, when you watch me, the main thing I'm trying to do of course is do no harm. But the second thing I'm trying to do is form a positive relationship with these two people. I mean, we're looking at 45 minutes. I'm really thinking of the realism and how I can honor them, and how can I be ethical in 45 minutes? You know, it's not just like how to make me look like a great therapist. It's like, what can I honestly and ethically do in 45 minutes? So I'm going to try to form a positive relationship. The third thing is I'm going to be doing—and this is the big thing—is I'm going to be trying to instill hope. And hope, by getting them to experience what they ask for, I'm going to try to give them what they ask for. And every session I start the same way: "How can I be of help?" And I try to give the client what they're asking for. And so what I'm trying to do is give them an experience that will shift their imago, shift their image of how they see each other.</p>

<p>Kjos: We see you do a lot of the reflecting back what you've heard.</p>

<p>Love: Yes.</p>

<p><b><u>SESSION TRANSCRIPT:</u></b></p>

<p>Love: So Kathy and Dave, thank you. Thank you for being here. And knowing that a change can really take place in a short amount of time, and knowing that we have a short amount of time together this evening, I'd like to start with asking each of you, if this time were to be really well spent, if you would walk away from here thinking, "You know, I really got what I came for, that was time that was worth my effort, worth the time getting there," what would be different, or what would you get, or what could I do, or how could we best use our time together? So if I could give you anything you want in your relationship, what would you leave with here this evening? And I'll ask each of you that question.</p>

<p>Dave: Me, personally, I think it would enhance our capabilities of, number one, being able to talk together without getting some frustrations, and the amount of time we actually spend together is, it's very important. And with that little time that we do have, because we work off shifts—</p>

<p>Love: Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Dave: —it really is a major part of our life, and if I could leave here feeling that, well, Kathy and I can, not get along but, you know, just be able to communicate a little bit better with any kind of flares.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. So let me see if I got it, and correct anything I say that's sort of off. One is that you could communicate better, because you work shift work, the time that's together you want to be really good or quality time, or very good time—you want that time to be good. And you would like to be able to talk with each other and communicate without the tempers flaring or the frustration flaring. Did I get it?</p>

<p>Dave: Yes, that was correct.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. So communicate better so that the time you spend with one another is better. Would that be sort of it in a nutshell?</p>

<p>Dave: That's correct.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. What about you, Kathy?</p>

<p>Kathy: Mine was communication, as well, and then also helping us understand that we're going to have arguments. You know, part of our problem, I felt, was you know, we had this philosophy, or I felt like Dave did, that there's no arguments. And then what happens is you don't express your feeling or your frustration, and then you know, years and years go on and it just builds and builds and builds, and then you start resenting the other one.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah.</p>

<p>Kathy: So, you know, learning to accept that that's normal, that that's a normal part of life, that that's going to happen, but not getting you know, like, turning each other off, or storming out of the room, and that's it, and then nothing's ever resolved.</p>

<p>Love: Okay, so knowing that disagreeing or arguing is a normal part of your life, but not letting it build up, and not just repressing it or pushing it down or not saying anything so that resentment builds up, but knowing it's a normal part of our life and being able to say it without tempers flaring and getting out of hand, so to speak. So it sounds like... Did you have something to add? Anything to that?</p>

<p>Dave: I think she hit it right on the button.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. So if I'm getting it, if you could walk away tonight saying, "You know what, I think we could communicate better," then at least we have used this time well. Would that be okay? Well, that's pretty simple. Okay. We can do this. I can guarantee you we can do this. But let's, before we come to that, let me get a flavor of what's it like, what are you like at your worst? What are you like that you know you do to stop communication, effective communication? I'm going to ask each one of you, not what your partner does, but if you had to say, "You know, at my worst, I think what I do that's not helpful to us is..." So I'm going to ask you to each own your part here a little bit. What do you do?</p>

<p>Dave: In my case I tend to hold my anger.</p>

<p>Love: Okay.</p>

<p>Dave: Instead of making a problem for both of us, I make it a problem for myself. So I kind of just suck it up, so to speak, and you know, whenever it does build up and I finally come out and say what's bothering me, it tends to be, "Well, why didn't you tell this to me before?" If you feel you did something wrong, you just want to hold it in, say, "I'm not going to tell her that, okay." Like I made a mistake, I just don't want to mention it, okay. Something might happen and you know, it's like, you don't want any wars.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. What goes on inside of you, either your body or your mind or your feelings, when you're holding that in? What are you like internally, or what goes on inside you?</p>

<p>Dave: Sometimes I feel like I'm hurting, okay. It's as though I feel like, you know, trying to get her advice is kind of like, "Well, maybe I should be able to solve a problem myself." And if I can't, and it finally comes out, it's like, it's hard. You know, it's like, to me our marriage is very sacred and I don't want to build up any kind of failures or something that would, you know, tend to throw our marriage down the spiral.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Now, this sounds real important. I mean, I don't know about you... I could see you were really interested in what Dave had to say when he was saying that. You have a very beautiful way of speaking. I mean, I don't know if this was one of the things that attracted you to him or not, but you do have a very articulate, beautiful way of speaking. So here's what I'm going to ask you to do. And again I'm going to come back and ask you the same thing, I'm going to ask you that same ownership question, okay?</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay.</p>

<p>Love: But what you said sounded so important. As I was hearing you say it. I'm going to ask you to say it again. And I'm just going to ask you, Kathy, just to say it back to him. Just word for word, only when he says, "I don't know when I have a question, or when I don't know what to do, I don't know whether to ask you, I don't want to feel like a failure," you know, you would just say "you." You're just going to mirror it back to him. Because this sounded really, really important. So I'm going to ask you the question again, and like, you spoke with me so beautifully, I'm going to ask you to just tell Kathy what it's like when you start holding this in. "When I hold things in, here's what goes on inside of me." You can repeat yourself, what you said to me, only she's going to say it back, and if you start, you're only going to be able to say it back in short piece because he's going to say a lot. So you just say, "Let me get this part," and say it back. And just give it to her like you gave it to me, it was so good.</p>

<p>Dave: Okay. Kat, I tend to hold a lot of tension, frustrations, and ways I feel that I had failed you, myself. Sometimes it will come back to haunt me. Other times, if I come out and actually say something, you know, well, it's like, "Why aren't we being together on this?" And it kind of hurts my feelings just to think that, "Well, what is she going to say? Okay. What is it that I'm going to get back? Do I just, ‘Heck with this, we'll keep it silent, we won't say nothing about it?'" And then...</p>

<p>Love: Okay. You know what? You're doing this so well. Because this is taking a risk for you to really express what you're expressing, here's a good way to do this. You say everything you have to say about it, and you just take it in, because you're going to need to hear this more than once. This is powerful. I don't know if it looks, sounds, feels powerful to you two—it does to me. I mean, I'm like getting chills up my back when I hear this. Because this is what's the important stuff. This is what you're asking for: that we can talk like this and she's really listening. Why this little technique is good is she has to listen or she can't say it back. Okay. So now you're going to give her that same piece in little sound bites so she can say it back to you, which proves to you she's listening to you. So just start, take it from the top, you don't have to say the same thing, you're just going to give it to her in little snippets.</p>

<p>Dave: On some occasions I feel like I've failed us. I feel like there's times where I could have communicated better yet I feared it would cause problems for us.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Let's say that much back if you... And if you forget, just say, "Would you say it again?"</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay. So I hear that you're saying that, or what I'm hearing is that you feel at times you've failed us because you've not communicated what's going on inside, because you didn't want it to hurt us in the long run. Did I get that right?</p>

<p>Dave: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay.</p>

<p>Love: And is there more?</p>

<p>Kathy: Is there more?</p>

<p>Dave: Not really. Just in short term, that's more or less what I had to say. Though your opinion sometimes is pretty valid, I just feel that asking your opinion may counter my plans, okay. I have a set idea on something, but your opinion may change that, so if it does change it, how do I handle it?</p>

<p>Love: Okay.</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay, so I guess what I'm hearing you say is that you want to ask my advice but you're afraid because I'm very opinionated, and what I say might change or alter your original plan, and that you're having a hard time understanding that and facing up with it if we have difference basically, you know, acknowledging me or approaching me and saying, "You know, that is a good idea, but I still think that this is a better way." Rather than letting down your guards.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. So I'm going to get you to be like a flat mirror, to only say what he says. Because I don't know if you noticed—</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay, because I was interpreting what he said.</p>

<p>Love: —because you were interpreting, and you were editorializing. Like, he never said you had a strong... He said you have a valid opinion. You know, and you said, "Well, I'm very opinionated." So you can see where you put a spin on it and you can start to work up...</p>

<p>Kathy: Because you're so used, I guess your mind's going and you're thinking, like, "What am I going to say next?"</p>

<p>Love: Exactly, exactly. And so would I ever suggest that you talk like this in the mirroring? No. As long as you're hearing each other, you don't have to talk like this. It's when something is so important and so powerful as what Dave is saying now that you... And what's great about the mirror is you can't play the movie in your head, because if you go on that movie in your head like, "Well, I'm very opinionated," see, he never said that. It would be great because we have it on video and you can go back and see what he said, then see how she took one little word and went into orbit with it. And we all do that, by the way.</p>

<p>So even though... So this simple little exercise is extremely powerful and here's why. Because in order for you to mirror him back—and I'm going to ask him to mirror you in a little bit, because this is what you all asked for—so in order for you to mirror him back you literally have to get into his reality. You can't say, "I'm very opinionated," because he never said that. You see? So that's why, even though this is a very simple technique, it's powerful, it has a big word in systems theory, it's called differentiation, which is only a function of the neocortex. It takes the highest form of thinking to do what I'm asking you to do, this simple little exercise. So it's real normal just to go off and, you know, put your own spin on it. But you begin to see, because what happens is, what you said earlier is, "We want to be able to talk and not have tempers flare and not get the frustration." Because differing is a normal part. Not only is it normal to be different, that's what gives a relationship its juice and its passion. Okay? So what happens is when your heartbeat gets to 95 beats per minute, adrenaline is pumped into your system. You can't help but get angry or shut down. See, your temper's going to flare or you're going to shut down and repress and resent, which you were describing. So that's the... You don't have a choice. The neocortex isn't in charge anymore, and you can see where when you put your spin on each other's words, because if you literally said, "My opinion is very valid—I have, what you're saying, Dave, is I have a valid opinion," which is literally what he said, that's calming. But if you say, "I'm very opinionated," you see what I'm saying? Okay.</p>

<p>So this is great. And this is exactly what y'all were asking for. And again, I'm not expecting you to go home and sit knee to knee and talk, you know, "Please pass the salt." "What you're saying is..." No. It's when things are important, because by using this process or another simple process, it stops the movie in your head. All of us have a preconceived image of what you think he's going to say, and so you don't...</p>

<p>It's called the shoot-reload method. Like when you're shooting your statement, I'm reloading my gun. I'm not listening to you—I'm reloading so I can fire mine. And you know, it's like... Okay. So y'all are doing great. So if you send her one more little sound bite again... And what you did that was so good was, Dave, you said, "Is there more?" And he said, "No, not really." And you were very patient. And then he went on and told you a whole lot more. So that was a beautiful piece. I don't know if, and again, you'll get to see it on tape, because you were patient with him when you said, "Is there more?" And he said, "No..." But because you were still listening, and tuned in to him, he went on and gave you a lot more information. So that's a real beautiful part of what happened between you there. Okay. So let's start again. Tell her, "What I'd really like you to hear in this, Kathy, is..." We'll try to bottom-line it again, and she's going to mirror it back.</p>

<p>Dave: Well, what I'd really like you to hear from this is that sometimes I hold my resentments and sometimes I hold my anger in. And I guess it's, because I'm a guy, have a tendency of just, "Okay, well, whatever you want to do, let's just do it, okay, no problem, all right." Whether, doesn't necessarily mean I want to do it, but I just say, "Okay, fine," you know. However, I wish there were some times where we can actually, you know, accept each other without me worrying about how you're going to feel.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. See if you can mirror that. And I know that was a lot.</p>

<p>Kathy: That was a long one.</p>

<p>Love: That's okay. And you make a stab at it, and what you miss, he and I'll just help you fill in.</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay. So what I hear you say is that you're feeling that you hold a lot of resentment in, and that there's times when I want to do things, and you just feel that you go along with it rather than trying to accept our differing opinions. That's where I got lost after that.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Is there more? Or did I get it? Just say...</p>

<p>Kathy: Is there more, or did I get it all?</p>

<p>Dave: That's, pretty much.</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay, what did I miss?</p>

<p>Love: Yeah and tell her, just fill in the piece that you'd like her to get, or maybe you think of something else.</p>

<p>Dave: I hope you understand, you know, from this session, it did, where how I feel about us, how I feel that, how much we can do better, I shouldn't say, being coached like we're kind of being coached right now, it should sort of be, I mean from day one we should have been I guess a little more honest with each other, though sometimes I feel like, will my honesty hurt your feelings? Or will my honesty fulfill the way I really feel?</p>

<p>Love: Okay.</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Want to make a stab at that?</p>

<p>Kathy: So I guess you're saying that you're afraid of... you're holding a lot in, the resentment, and you're afraid to state your opinion or state exactly how you're feeling because you're hurting my feelings. Did I get that?</p>

<p>Dave: Yes. In a nutshell.</p>

<p>Love: Okay, great. So let me ask you one more question. Then we're going to switch roles, okay?</p>

<p>Dave: Okay.</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay.</p>

<p>Love: If Kathy were to show you acceptance, what's one small thing that Kathy could do that would say to you, "Wow, she accepts me. Even though we disagree, she really accepts me"? How could she show that to you? What would be one small thing she could do?</p>

<p>Dave: Well, I tend to like compliments, myself.</p>

<p>Love: Okay, okay.</p>

<p>Dave: You know, when you work real hard to get something done, and you feel that what you've done is satisfactory.</p>

<p>Love: Okay.</p>

<p>Dave: And you kind of wait for someone, okay, someone to say something, kind of, "You did a good job, it looks wonderful." And then you don't hear that and you're like, "What did I do wrong? Let me go back and check." I'm a perfectionist. That's just the way I am. And I mean, I guess a compliment means that you did a good job. Put an end to it.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Okay. What goes on inside of you when she genuinely compliments you? What's that like for you? Just tell her what that's like for you.</p>

<p>Dave: I kind of get a tingle, thinking, "Okay, this is good. All right," you know.</p>

<p>Love: Is it a tingle in your stomach or in your... Does it make you feel excited, sort of, or?</p>

<p>Dave: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Yeah. Now, did you know that you have the power to excite this man?</p>

<p>Kathy: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Love: Just by a compliment?</p>

<p>Kathy: Yeah. I'm sure I must have done that Sunday when we finished the bathroom.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Did she do it?</p>

<p>Dave: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. What did you do? I mean, what was that like?</p>

<p>Kathy: We painted and we put up the border Sunday, and just, you know, that was like the finishing touch on the room, and it looked beautiful. And I think I even left him a note Monday.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah.</p>

<p>Kathy: You know, thanking him again, because we were working opposite shifts that day.</p>

<p>Love: So now, is that what you're talking about, the big projects? Or is it the big projects and the, "Thank you for bringing me coffee," or "thank you for..."</p>

<p>Kathy: "Picking up a gallon of milk."</p>

<p>Kathy: Right. The milk, or is it both, or is it the big things you want to be acknowledged for?</p>

<p>Dave: It's a little bit of both.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Okay. So one...</p>

<p>Dave: But the big things, for example, there are a few tricks in the trade that I'm learning, okay, like how to do some plumbing, installing some electricity, and this and that, okay. I didn't know how to do that kind of stuff. I took a stab at it.</p>

<p>Love: I'm impressed.</p>

<p>Dave: I took a stab at it. If it works, it does, okay. At least I feel I've tried, okay. And just knowing, "Okay, you put a lot of work into it, that's good, you know, great." Not that she doesn't say anything, I mean. It's hard work, it's not easy.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah. Now, do you feel clear about knowing what he likes in terms of compliments? I mean, does that seem real clear to you, or would you like a little more information?</p>

<p>Kathy: Probably a little more information.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah, because I would, if I were sitting in your seat, I would want... So like, give her some more examples. Like, one thing, I'm just making up this. Like, you are, to me, my opinion, are very nicely dressed. You're very well groomed. You're a handsome man. But... you take pride in yourself. Now, that impresses me. I don't know if that's the kind of thing that you would like—"Golly, your hair looks great, I love the shine in your hair," or, "Your beard really looks nicely, I love the way it's been trimmed up," or, "That necklace really shines nice next to your chest hair." I mean, I don't know, is that the kind of thing, too, that would be nice? I'm just wanting more information. She is too.</p>

<p>Kathy: Right, that's what I am.</p>

<p>Love: Give us a little detail. Give us a little nitty-gritty, or maybe it would be a secret you could tell her when we're not even on camera. But what is it that keeps that tingle going, the kind of compliments you like?</p>

<p>Dave: Well, I like the fact that she sometimes she makes her compliments in different methods. Like the note that she left inside of my lunch bag saying kind of things like, "Oh, okay, that's great," you know? Most of the time I like just, for instance, let's say I painted that. Just someone to walk by—"Wow, that looks fantastic." And kind of like, "I didn't know you could do that. Wow, that's great."</p>

<p>Love: Yeah. And this is what keeps that excitement, the juices flowing. Okay, so that would be one form of acceptance. What's a second thing she could do—this would be totally different than the compliments—that would say, "You know what? We're different. I disagree, and I really respect your opinion, even though it's different than mine. Or I respect you or accept you. That that's okay that we're different." How could she show that or let you know that? Can you think of another way?</p>

<p>Dave: That's a tough question. I don't know, I guess, it's hard, I mean...</p>

<p>Love: Let me give you some examples.</p>

<p>Dave: For example, I mean, me being a guy, I'd be kind of, "Okay, here's a rose, it was great, you did a good job," right. But in the opposite position, what do you do, you know? It's like, you know, buy a guy a pound of candy because he did a good job, or...</p>

<p>Love: Right, that's true. That's true. What do you do that? That is a very good question. What's the guy counterpart to bringing a rose or buying a box of candy? What is the counterpart? What is the... This is very good. What says "I love you" to you? Because that's the traditional female role—bring a flower, bring some candy, do something... But what says "I love you" to you? We know that compliments do it. We know that acknowledging what you do. It could be anything about her encouraging you to spend time alone. Or her giving you that 30 minutes when you come in from work so you have a transition, you know, knowing that you have shift work, letting you sleep... It could be pragmatic, it can be romantic, it can be sexual, it can be touching, it can be any of those things. That there's a difference between you.</p>

<p>For example, my husband, where it's real clear that he's much more sexual than I am, so I know if I want to make him really feel good and included, I play to his hand, which is I make a sexual innuendo or I make a sexual advance. Now, if he wants to make me feel good, he cleans the garage. Or, you know, he takes my car and gets it cleaned. And that's just how we're different. So you're bringing up a very good point. What is your love language? And that's something ya'll can talk about. And it might be, you said, "I would love for us to have some quality conversation and communication," and that might be, that's a lifelong detective job, to really be watching. And what do you think says "I love you" to him? You might know better than...</p>

<p>Kathy: Oh, I think what you just said.</p>

<p>Dave: I'll agree.</p>

<p>Kathy: And I agree with you, I'm the same way. If he cleaned the garage out, that would make my day. We did the, when we did the bathroom and we bordered together, I'm still just elated since Sunday because the bathroom is done, it looks beautiful, we did it together. Which is a big improvement, you know—we worked together to do it. So we went through the blood, sweat and tears. We laughed a lot. I mean, it was, you had to laugh because it's not fun.</p>

<p>Love: Okay, can we talk here?</p>

<p>Dave: That doesn't guarantee I'll get some.</p>

<p>Love: I was going to say, does it translate in the bedroom?</p>

<p>Dave: Ah, not really.</p>

<p>Love: You can tell that off-camera. But that's it. And you're really onto something because, see, most people show love the way they want to receive love, but you miss the mark. You know, like, she's doing pragmatic things for you and you're thinking, "Well, that's nice," but it would be like the candy. "Well, it's nice, but honey, grab me in the bathroom and drag me into the bedroom. You want to make my day? So that's the thing." And people often...</p>

<p>Kathy: Did I get that right, Dave?</p>

<p>Dave: Yes, you did. You certainly did.</p>

<p>Love: I don't think she...</p>

<p>Dave: You've got to put that down on paper.</p>

<p>Love: Get her to sign.</p>

<p>Kathy: Sign a contract, right?</p>

<p>Love: Exactly. But the thing, we've just come through half a century of egocentric culture, meaning, "If I don't want sex, why should I have sex?" The question is, what is best for your relationship? You know, my hunch is you didn't get up one morning and think, "Wow! Gonna paint that bathroom! Whoa! Make my day." That wasn't like how you did it. How you did it was, you know this touches your wife's heart. You know it touches her heart. You know it really touches her. And this guy is learning electricity, he's learning plumbing, he's doing this, maybe because you want to and that's nice, but he knows this brings you the tingle. And this the key to being together, is being altruistic or giving, because true giving comes out of fullness. When somebody is so generous to you, the natural response is not that you owe them. That's not what it's about. It's about a genuine giving. It's a genuine giving. And so that's what this conversation is really about, is how do we have altruism or real love in our relationship—not just, "Well, what did you do for me?" And I don't hear y'all saying that at all, by the way. The energy between you is really, really positive. Y'all have a wonderful, wonderful energy.</p>

<p>But so, okay, we've got to switch only because of time. Thank you, thank you, that was wonderful. So. What do you do to stop the communication, you know? He holds it in. He's not always truthfully honest, he worries a lot. What do you do, Kathy, that probably isn't helpful to y'all's relationship? In terms of communication. How do you keep it from flowing nicely, kindly?</p>

<p>Kathy: I feel like I ask a thousand questions. Because I feel, you know, maybe I didn't get the whole story, so it's like I keep probing for more information and more information. You know, like the thing about the bank statement. And it's like, "Well, what happened there? I'm having trouble using the ATM card. Do we have trouble with the bank?" And then he's like, "Oh yeah, I don't have the balance straight." And then I felt like there was more to the story, so it's like, "Okay, what is the balance?" Well, then all of a sudden I get, "Well, we went $25 below our balance so we're going to get a $25 fee." But I don't know if that stops the communication or, I guess I feel like I'm not getting all, you know, the honesty or the answers that, you know. I mean, it's us, it's not just your money, we're not part of this, kind of a thing. So maybe my probing and making him, I don't know, maybe I make him feel like a kid or something. The way that I ask.</p>

<p>Love: Now, okay, let me see if I got it. It's the probing, and you're saying, "I ask a million questions and I probe and if there's one piece of information, well, did we go below..." It almost sounds, now, is it like, is it an accusatory? You said it makes, it might make Dave feel like a kid. Is it like you're the parent and you're lecturing, or are you not believing, or...?</p>

<p>Kathy: Not believing.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah. Well...</p>

<p>Kathy: Not believing.</p>

<p>Love: It's like, I call it grilling. Sometimes I grill.</p>

<p>Kathy: Yeah, that's the perfect word.</p>

<p>Love: It's almost like you expect the big light to be up here, you know. In fact one of my favorite cartoons is there's a man in bed with the covers up over his head, and the woman is pulling the covers off his head and she has a high-beam flashlight, shining it in his eyes, and she's saying, "Is this a good time to talk?" It's like, no consideration for what it might be like over here in the other chair. And this probing and grilling. And my husband says that I bark orders. Somehow I...</p>

<p>Kathy: I'm the exact same.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah, you know, it's like I get... So explain to me, and to Dave, what goes on, what's going on inside of you when you start doing the probing. Like inside your gut or whatever. What's...Yeah</p>

<p>Kathy: Oh, I feel very upset inside. I feel like, you know, you start to lose trust because you're starting to feel that he's not being honest with me.</p>

<p>Love: Okay.</p>

<p>Kathy: You know, and I just felt like, since this affected both of us, that I should have been notified that this was happening, because what if I just went to the ATM machine and drew out more money? We'd be in bigger trouble, you know. And I guess I felt like, "Well, why wasn't it shared with me?"</p>

<p>Love: Yeah, okay. So. If you wanted to... I'm going to ask you, then, if you could sort of put it in a nutshell what you'd really like Dave to hear and understand about you needing information, or, "When I'm probing what's really going on inside of me," or... Just what would you like him to know about this, and I'm just going to get you to mirror it back. And since you had a good process going, why don't you just say it all and you just sort of listen, and then you don't have to say it back until we'll break it into pieces again. So sort of think out loud. I don't know about you, I tend to think out loud. So think out loud about this, and you can just take it all in to begin with, and then we'll break it into pieces for you to mirror. Okay. "What I'd like you to know about this is..."</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay. What I'd like you to know about this is that, when I'm asking for more information, that inside I'm feeling that you're not being honest with me. And I guess honesty is like number one in my book—that if you can't be honest with each other then how can you be married? Because along with honesty, I guess I feel like when I don't have the honesty, I start to lose trust in you, and that, can I trust you to handle the bills? Can I trust you to make out the bills? And it makes me feel very uneasy inside. A very uneasy feeling, I'm...</p>

<p>Love: So, "When I'm probing, I'm really feeling uneasy."</p>

<p>Kathy: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Love: Okay, let's start with that line and I'll get you to mirror that one back.</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay. So when I'm probing and asking more questions, inside I'm really feeling uneasy.</p>

<p>Dave: So what you're telling me is because of your probing technique, that you feel I'm being dishonest or distrustful.</p>

<p>Kathy: Yes, that's...</p>

<p>Dave: Is there more?</p>

<p>Kathy: No.</p>

<p>Love: "And I'm really feeling uneasy when I'm doing that."</p>

<p>Kathy: Right. I'm really feeling uneasy when I do that.</p>

<p>Dave: Uneasy.</p>

<p>Love: "And what I need from you when I start probing is..." How could he short-circuit this?</p>

<p>Kathy: Oh, and stop all the questions?</p>

<p>Love: Yeah, how could he stop... Give him a line or an action that if he did this, you'd just start to calm down. What could he do in those moments that would just start to calm you down?</p>

<p>Kathy: What he could do is just if I ask about it, give me the whole story.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Okay. So just...</p>

<p>Kathy: You know, just basically be honest with me. I mean, we all make mistakes. We... So we overdrew. We did a big boo-boo. That's fine. I mean, I can accept that, but I guess I just want to know about it. I want you to be honest with me, whether it's a mistake or not.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Hold on, I'm going to stop you there just for a second, because I think you heard that. She just wants you to be honest. Tell me, okay, because y'all are doing so well, I'm going to tighten the screw a little bit. If this guy were to be honest with you, now, first of all, how would he stop the probing? How would he stop it, literally? Because I don't know about you—when I get on a roll, I'm on a roll. Okay. So how... Would he like, say... How would he do that?</p>

<p>Kathy: Or just if he said, or even if you came home... Because usually he comes home and we eat dinner right away. After that, if you said, "You know, I really want to spend 10 or 15 minutes, because I really need to talk to you about our bank statement."</p>

<p>And that would be a totally, I mean, I wouldn't be defensive at all, and I wouldn't be wondering during dinner what it's about, but it would be like, "Okay, so he wants to share something with me, something that affects all of us."</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Let me see if I got this.</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Because this would be hard for me, so I'm just throwing it out here. So if he came home, and you realize, okay, that we're getting low on the account or whatever, so you say, "After dinner, I'd like to share with, just talk to you about the bank statement." Is that what you're suggesting?</p>

<p>Kathy: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Love: Okay.</p>

<p>Kathy: And the reason I say right when he comes home is because sometimes we don't see each other for two days because of the shift work.</p>

<p>Love: Sure. Sure.</p>

<p>Kathy: So that's why I'm...</p>

<p>Love: So you'd sort of put in a bid for that.</p>

<p>Kathy: Right.</p>

<p>Love: Now, could you wait during dinner? Would you really, I mean, would that be a, could you really wait during dinner? I mean...</p>

<p>Kathy: Yeah. Oh yeah.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. So you'd be patient...</p>

<p>Kathy: Oh yes. Because he knows how important dinner is to me.</p>

<p>Love: So y'all would have dinner. And what would be your fear around doing that? What would be your fear? That if I came home, do you even know that there's a problem with the bank?</p>

<p>Dave: I was notified through the mail.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. So as soon as you know that, what would be your fear of telling her right away?</p>

<p>Dave: Because I'd feel that what she had to say would turn on my defensiveness.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah.</p>

<p>Dave: So you know, I don't want to get into it, okay. And I don't need to explain piece by piece what happened if I'm not 100 percent sure what happened.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Okay, so sometimes you don't have the information.</p>

<p>Dave: Right.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Okay. So is that okay to say, "I don't have all the information?" Or is that hard to say?</p>

<p>Dave: Well, it stems back to the failure part.</p>

<p>Love: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>Dave: So.</p>

<p>Love: So you begin to see how this feeds into each other. So one of the things I might suggest... So what you're saying is, "As soon as you know there's some kind of a problem, come and tell me."</p>

<p>Kathy: Right.</p>

<p>Love: "And if, and one way to tell me is to, for lack of a better term, make an appointment, meaning, saying after dinner. Or sort of give me a heads-up on it to say, ‘Honey, let me just talk to you about it.'" How can you reassure him? What if he doesn't understand? You know, he gets it in the mail, he doesn't have it all figured out. How can he, what can you say to reassure him, knowing that he's coming to you, that's going to make, you're going to feel like a failure—"Well, I'm just telling you there's a problem and I don't have the answer." So what's your answer to that dilemma for Dave?</p>

<p>Kathy: Oh, even if he just comes to me and says, "You know, we do have a problem. I just received this yesterday in the mail, I'm going to..." And if he, like, has a plan, that I don't just, being, again, being honest with me, just saying, "I don't know why this happened but I'm going to need to sit down with somebody at the bank and figure out where we're going. If you could just refrain from using the ATM machine or whatever, for now, and the debit card, or..."</p>

<p>Love: Okay. Let me ask you this. What is it that you have a hunch that maybe you do that contributes to the defensiveness? If you look at y'all's patterns, because one of your fears is that, "If I do bring it up, we'll get into that old pattern and I get defensive," and then you tend to want to shut down, I think is what you're saying.</p>

<p>Dave: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Love: And then that just feeds into your fear, because my hunch is when he shuts down, you feel it. You start to get that resonance. You feel, "Uh-oh." And then that makes you want to come in and probe and question. So what is it you do? You said that "I do probe." What else do you do when he starts to tell you? Let's say he comes and says, "Honey, here's this bank balance, I don't really know but I know that there's a problem." Bad behavior: what is it you do that would cause him to be defensive? Other than probe.</p>

<p>Kathy: I would start asking... It's the probing. It's just asking and then maybe...</p>

<p>Love: Even though he said he doesn't know, you wouldn't take that for an answer, maybe.</p>

<p>Kathy: Oh, I would.</p>

<p>Love: If he said, "I don't know." You don't look... Okay. So in other words, if you did the roller coaster, you know, if you started asking... So if he comes to you, what you're saying is if he comes to you and says, "Here it is, I don't have the answer," you're saying, "Oh, okay," and you can let that go.</p>

<p>Kathy: No. He would need to, "I don't have the answer but what I plan on doing..."</p>

<p>Love: Okay. What if he doesn't know what he's going to do? What if he needs your help? How could he ask for your help?</p>

<p>Kathy: Just by saying, "I don't know what the problem is." If he could just say, "Maybe we need to sit down together and balance the checkbook together." Any suggestions.</p>

<p>Love: "Could we do this together?"</p>

<p>Kathy: Yeah, any...</p>

<p>Love: "Could we do this together?"</p>

<p>Kathy: Yeah. He can ask for my help.</p>

<p>Love: Is that okay? Because the thing I heard from you is that you really respect her opinion. I really got that. Did you know that he really does respect your opinion?</p>

<p>Kathy: No.</p>

<p>Love: No, I mean, I...</p>

<p>Kathy: No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Love: No, I would put money on that. I really get it. In fact, I started to get the impression a little that maybe you give it so much weight at times that you even question yourself a little.</p>

<p>Dave: I can buy that.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah, that's what it sounded... See, I think, I don't think you have a clear picture, quite, how much, number one, you mean to this guy, but how much, how important you are. Maybe you know that, but your opinion... My hunch is that you and I might be alike. We talk a lot and we talk out loud, never knowing that our words can be overwhelming. I think he takes you really seriously.</p>

<p>Kathy: Sounds that way. I didn't know that.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah, I think he really takes you... I think this man wants to please you, probably more than... I think he gets so much pleasure from pleasing you. Now, I could be totally off the wall, but... that you get pleasure from pleasing her. You want to make her happy.</p>

<p>Dave: To some extent. There are some exceptions where I'd rather do something else, but if I'm pleasing her, let's just go ahead and do it.</p>

<p>Love: He likes making you happy. Is that fair to say?</p>

<p>Kathy: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Love: Okay. And he really takes your opinions seriously. So part of it is being careful with your bullets, so to speak, because much as you have great ideas.... You have great ideas. So the key is when you're talking, and if I were to say, when you leave here, the mirroring is a great technique, but even if you just took turns, even if you left here, so that you could... You know, what, my husband is a head trainer for the University of Texas—he's like the football coach type guy. What we do, because we're real strong willed, we actually take a timer and like a two-minute drill, you know? I wrote this up for a little story. We do a timer and he talks two minutes, I talk two minutes. It doesn't matter, just so you each get to talk and the other one listens. Because interrupting will make you defensive. Withdrawing will make you anxious and make you want to probe. And my hunch is, it looks to me like you have such a beautiful... It sounds like you each came into this relationship with a little bit of image of, "Can I trust him? Can I trust myself?" It sounds like a trust is still... You know, you've just been at this a few years. How many years?</p>

<p>Kathy: Four.</p>

<p>Love: Four years. You know. It's a wonderful journey. So the way you build trust is you say what you're going to do and you do it. And then you repeat steps one and two. You just say what you're going to do and you do it. And you go through enough times of talking like this—we've talked for 45 minutes. You've gotten a lot... You've found out that this guy really, really... What you say is so important to him. You've found out how she says it is so important. You found out just by talking and listening, having this process. You know, you got the message across to her real well, how much compliments mean to you. And you got the message from her: "I need information. You don't even have to have it figured out. You can say to me, ‘Let's work it out together. I thought we'd sit down and talk about this.'" As soon as you know something, to let her know. Because what happens, the longer it goes on, you intuit it, then your anxiety goes up, and remember, the closer you get to that 95 beats per minute, then...</p>

<p>Kathy: We're off the wall.</p>

<p>Love: Then you're off the wall. Then all mature thinking goes out the window and then you're in fight-or-flight. Anything I can say or do as we sort of wrap this up? Anything that would be helpful for us?</p>

<p>Dave: Your coaching words to us?</p>

<p>Love: Right. Anything you'd like from me as we close this, bring this to a close, since our time is just about up?</p>

<p>Kathy: I don't know.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah. I'd love to hear from you, see how you work this out, and see if you can just use that simple technique of mirroring or taking turns talking, giving information as soon as you know, giving the compliments as soon as you have the slightest appreciation in your mind. Thank you so much.</p>

<p>Dave: You're very welcome.</p>

<p>Kathy: Thank you.</p>

<p>Love: I really appreciated your work. This is going to mean a lot to a lot of people. Thanks.</p>

<p>Kathy: Thank you.</p>

<p>Dave: You're welcome. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>END SESSION</b></p>

<p><b><u>GROUP DISCUSSION:</u></b></p>

<p>Carlson: Pat, is this a good example of Imago Therapy?</p>

<p>Love: Well, it's an example of Imago Therapy. I'm hoping it's a good example. But yes, it is typical of what we call the seamless weaving of the techniques in Imago.</p>

<p>Carlson: Can you explain what you mean by that?</p>

<p>Love: Yes. In other words, I started off with doing the mirroring exercise. Now, did I hold to the exact structure?</p>

<p>Carlson: It didn't look like it. No.</p>

<p>Love: No. And here's why: because I was really looking at the big picture, or the imago—of, "What is the image each of this person holds of the other?" So I was thinking systemically and giving a lot of leeway, for example, to Dave, who was sending. And I let him go on quite a bit. If you notice that, ordinarily a lot of times when I teach mirroring, you'll have a send and then you mirror back. And you know, I might be a little hard-nosed about it. But with him I felt like it was so important because he was giving valuable information. He was giving her new information. And even though I went on and on about it, it was very honest from me that this was powerful. Because what he had said was that "I collapse, that I do, I take your opinion and then I don't say anything and the resentment builds up." So he was doing what he was asking for. And I pay attention... My mentor, Dr. Ed Jacobs—I'll put in that plug for West Virginia University—taught me early on, "Always listen to the very first line out of the client's mouth." And I remembered that. They often will, the first line will often be a microcosm of their relationship. And so I was really paying attention to that first line, and he was saying that "Resentment builds up—sometimes I hold things in." Well, since he was letting it out, I felt like that was more important than the exercise, you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>Carlson: Sure.</p>

<p>Kjos: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Love: And I wanted to give them the experience, a different image, so to speak, of being able to talk without being probed and so forth.</p>

<p>Carlson: So that means that you don't have to do these things in their rigid, structured fashion each time.</p>

<p>Love: No. Right. What we teach in Imago is you learn the structure, then you get creative with it. So you saw me being very creative with the techniques.</p>

<p>Carlson: Where would you go next with this couple, if you were to see them?</p>

<p>Love: Right, right. What I might do is another exercise that I didn't mention earlier, and it's called the parent-child dialogue. Like you can really see that his early experience probably included being discounted and not having his wants and needs and opinions taken seriously. And so he expressed that, that, "I really, I do feel inadequate." And there's an exercise called the parent-child dialogue where actually he would just talk about what it was like being a little boy, and she would start to get the picture, an image of what it was like to be, perhaps, interrupted or shamed or blamed or criticized for expressing his opinion. And so he has terror—I was sitting close to him and you could actually see his chin shaking and his mouth quivering.</p>

<p>Carlson: Yeah.</p>

<p>Kjos: And I was so amazed that he was able to do so much. And I wondered how you felt you contributed to that.</p>

<p>Love: Well, I think I did, I followed his instruction. He said he liked compliments, so I gave him compliments. I listened to him. I mirrored him, which proved to him I was listening. I paid attention to him. I gave him more airtime in that session. Now, I couldn't do that session after session after session, because she would be angry at me.</p>

<p>Kjos: But I've got a feeling he must have walked out of there saying, "I didn't know I was going to do that. I didn't know I was going to say all that."</p>

<p>Love: Right. And when he's... And the structure, the simple mirroring, creates safety. Because she can't interrupt. First of all, I would have stopped her if she had. And also she has to listen, because she doesn't know when I'm going to ask her to say it back.</p>

<p>Carlson: So he was in a really scared to death of her in many ways.</p>

<p>Love: And you could see why. You could see why.</p>

<p>Carlson: So would we, would we hypothesize, then, that she's like his father or his mother, or his...</p>

<p>Love: That would be the familiar part. When I talked about the ABCDE, A is the negatives. You can pretty well, if we had them fill out an Imago Workup... And I always, this is a great little tool for therapists.</p>

<p><b><i>A. Think of:</i></b><br>
<b><i>Three Negative Characteristics of the people that raised you</p></i></b></p>

<p>Carlson: Okay, so A is the negative.</p>

<p>Love: A is the negatives.</p>

<p>Carlson: That you had in your early relationships.</p>

<p>Love: Early childhood, and you know, it probably included maybe criticism or shaming or blaming or interrupting or so forth.</p>

<p>Carlson: And what we B again? Could we go...</p>

<p><b><i>B. Think of:</i></b><br>
<b><i>Three Positive Characteristics of the people that raised you</p></i></b></p>

<p>Love: B is the positives, because my hunch is, you know, this is a guy who had somebody look after him, because he looks good, he's very attractive, he's bright.</p>

<p>Carlson: He's in this world.</p>

<p>Love: He's in this world, he's in this relationship. So you know he got some positives.</p>

<p>Carlson: Okay, what's the C piece?</p>

<p><b><i>C. Think of:</i></b><br>
<b><i>What you wanted and needed the most</p></i></b></p>

<p>Love: The C is what you wanted and needed the most.  And I think what he wanted and needed the most was really to be valued, appreciated—</p>

<p>Kjos: Approval.</p>

<p>Carlson: Validated.</p>

<p>Love: —and approval. Validated. And this is very common. And he was very clear about that with her. And then the D, by the way is the positive feelings of childhood.</p>

<p><b><i>D. Think of:</i></b><br>
<b><i>Positive Feelings of Childhood?</p></i></b></p>

<p>When you were happy as a kid, how did you feel? My hunch, part of his might be, "I felt loved or I felt competent or I felt smart or I felt right." I mean, he really wants to be right. You could see he felt insecure. Now probably the most important letter in the Imago Workup is E, which is, "When you were a kid, how did you respond to frustration?"</p>

<p><b><i>E. Think of:</i></b><br>
<b><i>How did you respond to childhood Frustration?</p></i></b></p>

<p>So like you said, "I tried hard." You could see this guy, he's learning electricity, he's learning...</p>

<p>Kjos: Yeah, I loved it.</p>

<p>Love: But I want to tell you, I was impressed. So he, you know, he tried, he tried. But part of his frustration is he probably gave up, is my hunch is, there were times when he was a kid he gave up. Because you see, that would be part of his E, is that collapsing is probably part of that.</p>

<p>Kjos: You know, it's he kind of kid who brings the A home and his mother says, "But you misspelled that word," or his father...</p>

<p>Love: Easily. Easily.</p>

<p>Kjos: Or he takes the car out and he comes home and he parked it in the wrong place, you know.</p>

<p>Love: Right. And this is one of the reasons why I said, "Well, is it that you want acknowledgment just for the big things like you got to paint a whole bathroom, or is it the fact that your hair's shiny today or your necklace looks good?" Because my hunch is she doesn't give partial credit. You know...</p>

<p>Kjos: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>Love: And this is, in many ways, I have to say a lot of females are guilty of this—that, "Well, you only get credit for the big things," or, "I notice what you do wrong, not what you do right." So I wanted to make a point that you give that partial credit for encouragement.</p>

<p>Kjos: Well, and he brought up something about the trim or something in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Love: Yes.</p>

<p>Kjos: He'd really finished the whole job.</p>

<p>Love: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Kjos: Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: So now you've brought up this female thing. What is this stuff? Women are supposed to be in charge of love and romance, and this is stuff about...</p>

<p>Love: Yeah, we've convinced you guys of that.</p>

<p>Carlson: About cleaning the garage? Where does that fit in? That doesn't fit into my image of anything.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah. Again, it's your love language. It's like, how... There's an Imago exercise called reromanticizing. And literally what the exercise teaches is, "How do I say ‘I love you' to you, and to you?" which is probably different, because we do tend to show love the way we want to receive love.</p>

<p>Carlson: You know what we need to do now? We have an audience that's been waiting to ask questions. They've been able to watch our video so far, our program. So let's get some questions from our audience, specifically about the video or generally about the theory.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: Well, I saw, I took so many notes, I saw so many things that would really be helpful, not only as a professional but also personally. And one thing that I noticed in particular is how you hook them into working in the session by asking them right up front what they hope to accomplish, which set the direction for the whole piece. And then you reinforced what they were doing by saying, "Okay, now you're doing this, and this is helping you get the communication, which is what you said you wanted."</p>

<p>Love: Yes.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: So everything was tied together in terms of helping them get their outcome, was really nicely done. A question I had was, you had mentioned before we started, as far as looking for things, about the fear that Dave had. And you started with him, and I was wondering if that was deliberate because of the fear, or what your thinking is on that.</p>

<p>Love: Yes, yes. The way I was visualizing their system is he gives her too much power and she takes a lot of power. Like she's, you know, it's like she was bigger than life. Now, because I'm female and because I could relate to her in many ways, I sort of pushed the envelope on that license a little bit, in that I paid a lot more attention to him, I gave him more time, I listened to what he said. I gave him compliments because he said that was important to him. I gave him, I reinforced him, I praised him, I supported him. And because he said he had a hard time expressing himself, I actually made, that seemed more important to me. So when he was on a roll, he was basically doing what he said he wanted and I thought, "Well, he's getting..." I was taught early on that successful therapy is when the person who pays the bill is happy. So part of, so that was always, I'm always thinking, "Well, what is it they're asking for?" And if they're getting what they're asking for, then we're... I'm not saying we're always on the right track, but that's something that I'm trying to do, is giving them a positive set about counseling. And so that's what was going on, that I felt like he was saying that "I collapse around her, and I often hold it in and then build up resentment." So as he was expressing it, which is what he was wanting, I wanted to support that, knowing—and I was getting good time cues, so I knew I would have some time for her.</p>

<p>Audience Member #2: Just a comment in regards to that, then, that your first compliment to him was, "You talk beautifully." So was that then...</p>

<p>Love: Yes.</p>

<p>Audience Member #2: You knew that then, to take that further along in the session.</p>

<p>Love: And also it was true. I wouldn't say it if it weren't true. I don't use the technique unless that's... The more I work with clients, the more awed I am by their wisdom and the inner wisdom of the client. And I feel so—it can move me to tears actually—I feel so privileged to be sitting in the presence of intimacy. I mean, I get chills. I really do get chills from it. So I wouldn't say that unless I really meant it. And I think that, you know, as I look at the review of the tape, you know, I'm just like so frantic. However, I do get excited about it. And because of that, I get energized, and it's also because, one of the reasons why it's tiring, it's like, you know, it's so intense. But I consider it such a privilege that I really did believe what he said was beautiful.</p>

<p>Carlson: Some people might say, Pat, that this really wasn't even therapy. I mean, you were really a coach, or you were running a mini-workshop, or maybe you were conducting like an orchestra.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: Is that right? I mean, is that what Imago Therapy is, is really education?</p>

<p>Love: It's a big, a big part of it is education. And I think what heals or helps someone is to have a different experience. What I'm always going for is the paradigm shift, which is permanent change. Once you get it, that I can talk in a way and I don't die, that I can express myself to my wife and I don't die, that's a new experience.</p>

<p>Carlson: I mean, you were talking for them and you were talking for yourself.</p>

<p>Love: Right. I was.</p>

<p>Kjos: She was very active.</p>

<p>Love: I'm a very active therapist. I'm, as I look back I thought, "Well, you could have chilled out," but then I think, "Well, 45 minutes," you know. And the good thing is... And by the way, I record my sessions and hand it to the client at the end, because I want them to be able to play and replay this.</p>

<p>Carlson: Well, these last couple at the end was just awestruck. You know, they didn't know what to do, what to say.</p>

<p>Love: So, and what we know about change is that it comes from the outside in—that a paradigm shift, second-order change occurs from external stimulation. And that could be from a different experience, a different piece of information. And I do teach a lot in my therapy, and I believe teaching is therapy. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: Going on what you were talking about with Jon, I noticed also you're very directive. Do you always, are you always that directive in therapy or is there like a shift or a change that occurs throughout the process?</p>

<p>Love: Yeah. Yeah. When something's happening, there are times... In fact, you saw me, if you watch it closely, there were times I even sat back. It wasn't as often as I might. If something's happening or something's working, I just sit back. My chair, my therapy chair is on rollers. Sometimes I even roll out of the sphere of the two individuals when they get it.</p>

<p>And so, but this was a first session, it was an only session, so I wanted to give them a lot of information, you're right. Is this a typical first session? I would say a little, but I would be more low-key, I'd be quieter. I'd probably hear more of their story perhaps.</p>

<p>Carlson: Slow it down a little bit.</p>

<p>Love: Slow it down. I would be like a third slowed down. But however, I have to say, I am very active. And I am, yeah.</p>

<p>Kjos: Well, it certainly, at least from what we heard after the session, was brief therapy—that the couples, both couples that you worked with found it very effective in that, you know, this was amazing, what we learned tonight.</p>

<p>Love: In a short period of time.</p>

<p>Kjos: In a short period of time. Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: And then having the tapes after then they could review what they learned. Okay.</p>

<p>Love: Yes.</p>

<p>Kjos: Yeah.</p>

<p>Love: I also want to say this. It's also my personality and my style. Like how I'm acting here doesn't look that different than on the tape, and I'm this way at home, whether I'm, you know... Maybe not early in the morning. So it's not a message that you need to be this way if this isn't your style, but it might give you permission to be more active and more directive. I think people come to us and pay us to have a different experience or get a different piece of information. So I'm just trying to give them what they're paying for.</p>

<p>Audience Member #4: Do you typically begin with solving a problem in a first session, or do you often do more of an assessment, especially as this is based in childhood issues—find out more about their families of origin?</p>

<p>Love: Yeah, thank you, I love that question. I used to always do an Imago Workup, and let me tell you what that is. It's the A, B, C, D, E. And the A are the negatives, the B are the positives, the C is what you want and need the most, the D is the positive feelings of childhood, and the E is the responses to frustrations. Now, let me tell you what goes. Once you get a client to fill that out... And this is what I used to do. In the intake, I would have every client, the two of them are sitting here, I'd have them fill this out. Negatives, positives, all those I went over. Then, here's what you write above those little characteristics. Beside the letter A, you write these words: "I am attracted to a person who is..." Trust me on this. If you've done the exercise and you're listening to this, it's powerful. "I am attracted to a person who is..." That's over letter A. Beside letter B, "But I want him or her to be..." So I'm attracted to the negatives but I expect them to be positive all the time. And then C, you write beside the letter C, "So that I can get..." Your heart's desire. And then beside the letter D, you write, "And feel..." You want to feel the positive feelings. That's what we all want. And here's a real important piece: beside the letter E you write, "But I stop myself from getting that by..." How you act in, like trying so darn hard, by getting angry.</p>

<p>Carlson: Right.</p>

<p>Love: Now, that's the Imago Workup. I would take that intake sheet, I would staple it to the inside of my file folder for the clients. That's what I used to do all the time. I've done it so much that I now do it in my head. I can pretty much fill out the Imago profile of this couple. You could too, after seeing them for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Carlson: Sure.</p>

<p>Love: But it, but I used to do it over and over and over. By the way, that is such an important intake sheet because you can predict what problems they're going to have, you're going to predict how they handle the problems. And you can do therapeutic magic because you have all this information. And you can also look at how you solve it. Because that letter C, for example, what you want and need the most, this is what your heart's desire is. If you want to know how to love your partner, send the message toward letter C. Making him get what he's always wanted throughout his life. So that's my usual. But you know what? It all comes out in the opening. It's a microcosm. And I've heard it enough that I don't need to write it down anymore.</p>

<p>Carlson: It's too bad that President and Mrs. Clinton didn't do this, because I think it really would have resolved a lot of things in their relationship.</p>

<p>Love: It really would have resolved a lot, and it can still resolve a lot.</p>

<p>Carlson: Right. For a lot of people, I can understand.</p>

<p>Love: A lot of it has come out. Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: Very helpful.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: I was just thinking as you were saying that, that after having gone through this kind of process, it would be an interesting tool to have at home. And you could even add the next letter, which would be, "And now my plan is..."</p>

<p>Love: You got it.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: So that, you know, you can self-evaluate and then put it into action in a relationship in a way that would be much more effective.</p>

<p>Love: Great suggestion.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: It's a great tool.</p>

<p>Love: In fact, one of the techniques, another technique you saw, is what we call the behavior change request. I was starting to teach them how to ask for what you want, and how to make it specific. It wasn't enough to say, "I like compliments." I wanted to get, Well, do you want the big ones? Do you want the small ones? Do you want it about how you look?" I was trying to be specific so that I can touch my partner's heart and I get loved the way I long for. Love is a response to getting your needs met. Love is what you feel when someone meets your needs. But the problem is, for me to meet your needs, I have to get information. I have to be an observer. I have to know what says "I love you" to you. And I also have to be willing to change that as your needs change.</p>

<p>Carlson: This was interesting as you did this, because it seemed like she came in thinking maybe he needs to fill this list out, you know?</p>

<p>Love: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: And you really disrupted the pattern, the habit that seems to go on. I mean, he felt very uncomfortable talking, and she felt just as uncomfortable receiving.</p>

<p>Love: Yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: I mean, her leg was going up and down and she was saying, "Come on, hurry up, hurry up, now it's my turn to talk."</p>

<p>Love: I work with a lot of therapist couples, and the therapist, they'll come in and they'll say, you know, they'll apologize for their partner. "My partner hasn't done therapy." Ends up the partner is often better, because the person you'll see that this pursuing, the pursuing person, when you're in the receiver role, the pursuer wants more contact, more closeness, more... This person who's more of a maximizer goes in and is always trying to want more. "Well, yes, you did 10 things right, but what about the 11th one?" Is watching, you know. The one that doesn't give partial credit. So that's the person that often doesn't take it in, and gets comfort by feeling like, "You're doing exactly what I want you to do and we're so alike"—you know, that fused position.</p>

<p>So when you're in the receiver role of the mirroring, you are confronted with separateness, and your anxiety goes up. So a therapist is great when it's not your partner sitting there, and you think, "Oh, I can do this." But when you have anxiety and you solve it by holding on or clinging or getting more information, then when you're in the receiver role, you are going against that old-brain pattern that gives you safety by clinging. Now, when you're in the sender role, you're being confronted by closeness. That's why you saw him struggling with his words—because he feels safe when he withdraws. Now, when someone's mirroring you, they're tuned into you. We resist the most that which we need the most. The very thing you longed for is what you are defended against. Because longing for it becomes a source of pain and your psyche creates a reality you can live with. And so the very thing I say I want... Like she wants information from him. Trust me, when he gives it to her, she's going to be like a duck on a June bug.</p>

<p>So, but the mirroring, you can't do that. You can't do that. When you're mirroring, you've got to be listening because you have to say it back. But it's also important to keep switching these roles, because she'll be a far more comfortable in the sender role because she longs for this contact, but the person who says they want contact pushes the partner away when he comes forward. See, what you've got to do, you've got to get pursuers—the one that's always wanting more—to shut up and avoiders to show up. So I mean, in a word, that's what I was trying to do with this couple.</p>

<p>Carlson: I mean, she was saying, "I want to work out the checkbook together." I mean, he would rather work it out with the IRS, you know.</p>

<p>Love: Right, right. So you could see it's, each one of us has a way of handling our anxiety that we learned early in life. And when someone makes a commitment, when you're in a committed relationship, that partner becomes the reasonable facsimile of everyone who ever wounded you or ever hurt you or disappointed you. They become the stand-in. And you start projecting on them. That's the imago. So the key is how you can experience being in their presence and having it be safe, so your old brain gets it: "This is safe. This is safe. This is safe."</p>

<p>Carlson: This is the best of times and this is the worst of times.</p>

<p>Love: The worst of times. Yes.</p>

<p>Audience Member #5: We were talking, even on break, that this couple seemed to be pretty high functioning, not really conflictual—though they don't have a lot of time to even talk to each other. What would you do, or how would you do a session differently with a couple that was obviously much more tense, maybe even had more severe, maybe abuse issues in the past or trauma issues in the past? You know, how would that be different for you?</p>

<p>Love: This is really the strong suit of Imago Therapy, because it really is therapy. And for example, the parent-child dialogue. All of the exercises are designed to create safety. Safety is one of the tenets of Imago Therapy. And it's really a paradox. It's taking a risk within safety. This is the key to passion, by the way, is, "I've got to take a risk, but I have to have some assurance that if I do take a risk, you're not going to kill me psychically." So that's why we use exercises. Exercises are structures that provide safety when the therapist isn't sitting there. And I don't ever assign... Like you might say, well, why didn't I make a homework assignment with this couple? Because I don't want them to try something I'm not sure they can do. I wanted to give them an experience in the short amount of time. But when I work with couples, the first thing I started doing by the way was extend my session length. I now see... I mean, you need at least an hour and a half. It's hard to work with couples. It feels unethical, almost, to do... I did not want to do regressive work with them. That would feel unethical to me—I have to be honest with you—because I see them for 45 minutes, to regress them. I mean, it was enough regression going on because here I am, the doctor, and I'm such a powerful person. I can be overwhelming. So that was regressive enough without me cathecting that in the client. So if this were a tougher couple, this model is perfect for it, because what we start to do is we start to delineate the past from the present. "Is that an image from my past, or is this a true image, reality love, living with the current partner?" So the parent-child dialogue, the container, are both exercises from Imago Therapy that are specifically designed to work with the dysfunctional couple or the couple that had such abuse issues in their past. So that's the beauty of this model: that it really does work with tough couples. Yes</p>

<p>Audience Member #6: Are there any couples that are not candidates for this kind of therapy?</p>

<p>Love: You know, what I would say to that is, work with the population that you are comfortable with. If you've never worked with a psychotic client, don't start with Imago Therapy. Work within your skill level. But what we have found is, in fact, I have had couples where they might even mirror one word at a time, it's so terrifying. And so it can work with a wide range of couples. And also, it's almost like doing individual therapy with the partner watching and the partner being a part of the healing agent. Because therapy might last, if you're lucky, a couple hours a week, or you know, if you have them in group, it lasts longer. But they go home to all these other hours. So you're really teaching them a portable model that they can take home and become one another's healer.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: When I was listening to Kathy as she was mirroring back, she identified what she'd heard as being called opinionated.</p>

<p>Love: Right.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: And I was thinking about what you'd said about how we create images, and I'm wondering if that's... You know, we come in with our own self-images too.</p>

<p>Love: You bet.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: And then that would also influence how the information is filtered coming in. And so when you would work with an individual or a couple, do you also look at those self-images?</p>

<p>Love: You bet. Your imago is also you. In fact, one of the techniques that you saw me use centered around ownership, which is a big... See, imago is about becoming conscious or aware, and relationship is the path. And so what... I'm really using my partner and using the strategies for me to become more conscious or mature or aware, and knowing what I project on my partner. In fact, I use it with individuals. Individual comes in, starts complaining about their partner. They only do that maybe once or twice because when they start saying, "Oh, my partner is so angry," then my standard question is, "How are you like that? How is your anger?" Because what you project is a part of you. I mean, the part that you fear the most you project and see in others. So the integrated, we introject what we see in our early childhood. Not only do we project it, we introject.</p>

<p>Carlson: So this sounds like a very good way of getting each partner to take responsibility for their role in how this relationship doesn't work.</p>

<p>Love: Exactly. Yes. Exactly right.</p>

<p>Carlson: Which is one of the very important and difficult things to do when we work with couples.</p>

<p>Love: It's very difficult. It's so easy to look at, for example, mirroring, and see it as trite or playacting. And that's why I said, "Do I expect you to go home and sit knee to knee?" But what we're really doing is facilitating differentiation. We're really getting people to manage their anxiety while they experience closeness and separateness.</p>

<p>Carlson: How important is it to drop these things like your pulse rate and your neocortex, and is this a big part of the biological connection?</p>

<p>Love: It is, maybe it's because I started out in the medical profession. To me, I am a skeptic. And so, for you to just tell me to do something, I'm much more likely to do it the opposite. So I'm a little bit rebellious, okay.</p>

<p>Carlson: That's more than a skeptic.</p>

<p>Love: I'm a little... So I want to know, what's the proof? What's the research? What is the biological predisposition? I want to know scientific facts. And to me, the more we know from fact, the more truth we know, which is the title of my new book, The Truth About Love. The more we know about it, to me that carries weight. I'm not inclined to do something just becomes someone tells me, even if they have a degree after their name. So I want to know. And I love the visual of the 95 beats per minute, because I know when I get over that 95 beats, when I let my heart rate get up, Nelly bar the door. I mean, it's not a pretty sight.</p>

<p>Carlson: It's over.</p>

<p>Love: It's over. And I also know how the brain works, that the, literally the neocortex is flooded by the midbrain—the reptilian brain and the amygdala actually floods the neocortex with neurotransmitters. You can't be rational. You will not, cannot be lucid when you're under threat. So. I could go on and on about that.</p>

<p>Kjos: One of the pieces that I wonder about with this couple was, I think he got a great deal of satisfaction about being able to do this and talk to her in this way.</p>

<p>Carlson: Have an ally.</p>

<p>Kjos: And will they be able to continue that, and how do you build that in?</p>

<p>Love: Yeah. To think that I did anything permanently for this couple... I wish I could say, "Oh yes, they'll walk away..." My opinion, it would need a lot of follow-up, a lot of support. Because I didn't give her a lot of support. I'm very aware that the next session I would need to build rapport with her, I would need to support her. She would need to get some more things. I mean, I heard toward the end her saying, "Well, yes but I really want you to have an answer." And that was his fear—that he would have to have it figured out. So that would be a piece I'd need to work on. There were a lot of unfinished pieces here. Best case scenario is I would hope that him being able to express himself and her hearing him say that "When I'm being quiet, it may be that I'm fearful," and maybe that little piece is another way to look at his quietness. But I think that they would need a lot more experience of having safety going against their defense, before there was any permanent change. Maybe, at best, I gave them hopefully a positive set about counseling. But the good thing is they'll have the video and they can watch it over and over. And I, it did influence how I worked with them, knowing they were going to be able to watch this. And I would have worked more slowly. I would have worked probably a little more patiently. But I was very aware of that.</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: I noticed you used a lot of self-disclosure, both, you know, in your interaction with Jon and Diane and also in the session.</p>

<p>Love: Yeah.</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: Is that typical of imago therapy, or is that your own style?</p>

<p>Love: It's not typical of imago therapy. It's more typical of me at this stage in my profession. When I was, in the very beginning, I didn't do that. But when I sit down with someone now, one is we were videoing, I was the "expert," and so what I was trying to do was build rapport. I might not do that with another couple. It's not typical of me. But I know that I can be scary. I know that my title can be scary. I know because it's videoing it's scary. And so I wanted to... And I never do it unless it's the truth, by the way. So it's a part of establishing rapport. I don't always use it. But it seems like the more status I get from whatever, writing books or making tapes or whatever, is I'm more inclined to do it, because we're all just humans. We're all just people.</p>

<p>Carlson: Once we get to be grandparents we take on that role, we can do that.</p>

<p>Love: I do, and my age was to my benefit because I'd been, you know, this is the one profession, the longer you live, the more authority you get. And so I have a lot going for me because I'm almost 60 years old.</p>

<p>Carlson: Wait till your hair turns gray, you know, and then...</p>

<p>Love: Not as long as they make products. No, I love gray hair. I wish I had beautiful gray hair.</p>

<p>Carlson: Questions.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: I did think, though, that there was a hopefulness by the end, you know—that even experiencing that in this one session at least helped to create a new image that something else better could happen, and that there were some instances of surprise, especially for him, you know. Just the thinking about it and the changes that I observed in his physiology. And as far as your sharing of yourself, what I saw from that is that opened the territory for them to be able to be more expressive, especially when you brought up the sexual thing. And then there was laughing around it, but the realness of that came out.</p>

<p>Love: Yes.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: And just by you being genuine helped that to happen, I think.</p>

<p>Love: Well, I think you're bringing up a good point that reminds me of another reason and rationale for doing it. If the purpose is therapeutic... If I'm just telling my stories because I like to hear my stories, but I have a strategy in my mind for telling the story, I have a purpose in my mind for telling it. When I was trained, we used to have drills, and my professor would stop you and say, "Okay, why are you doing what you're doing? Tell me the theory behind what you're doing." So I just, at all times, we had to have a rationale for what we were doing. It's like, people often say to me, "Would you ever cry in a session?" My rule is, you can cry if your client cries, but you've got to stop first. Because there are stories that I hear that move me to tears, and sometimes I get so happy in a session—like earlier when we were talking, when I think of the privilege of our profession, I get moved to tears. That's who I am. But I'm not doing my own therapy. You know, I'm not telling my story because I want to show you that I want to talk about myself. It has a strategy to it. And story is the oldest way of helping people—telling stories. People love stories. Now, if I am taking the focus off the client and putting the focus on me, that's not therapeutic. But if I'm telling a story to establish rapport, to make a point, or to give permission, that's therapeutic.</p>

<p>Audience Member #7: We all work with couples that are stuck. And they come in and it's the same issue and the same issue. This couple, it was amazing how quickly they seemed to get unstuck. Do you do any preinstruction with couples or any... </p>

<p>Love: No.</p>

<p>Audience Member #7: They don't know what to expect when they go in.</p>

<p>Love: No. No. In fact, someone asked earlier, "Do you want to know the background of the couples?" I don't, personally. I don't want to be biased. And I start every session the same: "How can I be of help?" And so it's like we're starting with a clean slate. And yes, I do take notes, and yes, I do have a treatment plan, and I have a model in my head. But no, I really want... Because it's a microcosm. Everything they say is illustrative. That's why when people say, "Oh, well, I don't want to talk about my childhood," no problem. It's all the same stuff. I mean, your childhood is sitting here with you. So I don't care if they talk about their childhood or whatever. It shows up right here in the room. So I don't have a need to talk about it, but if they want to talk about it and make the association, fine. So I don't need a lot of history. So clients who come in, that's why I do consulting. You know, I want to... I do talk more, because I've heard the stories now for 20 years. But for him, I wanted him to talk because that was his need, and that was what he asked for—to be able to express a difference.</p>

<p>Kjos: Well, and what she got out of that, I think, was an appreciation of his vulnerability, which will change somewhat the way that she deals with him.</p>

<p>Love: Yes. Yes. And if we went further, she would hear how that vulnerability is linked to the childhood, and that is often a paradigm shift. "Oh my gosh. That's what it was like for you as a little boy. Now I understand when I probe what that reminds you of." Then you start to have an honoring of their behavior, instead of feeling so defensive.</p>

<p>Carlson: Well, we're nearing the end of our time together. Do you have any final comments for our studio or our viewing audience?</p>

<p>Love: Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: On Imago Therapy, on your work?</p>

<p>Love: Well, you know, the longer I live with it, the more I believe in it, and it really is about becoming conscious, to try to take ownership with who I am and know that I do have an impact on you. And the bottom line is, if you want to be a lover, find out what says "I love you" to your partner and give it as a gift.</p>

<p>Carlson: Well, you know, I'd like you to wish both you and your husband lots of clean garages, on that note.</p>

<p>Kjos: And remodeled bathrooms.</p>

<p>Love: That's right, that's right.</p>

<p>Carlson: And would like to thank you for being a part of our shoot and helping us to reload our psychological armament, to use more pats and more love to help our clients. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Love: He's trying really hard.</p>

<p>Kjos: He really is working hard.</p>

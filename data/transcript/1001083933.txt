<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<P><B>DR:</B> So-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s fine.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Back to you, how are you doing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think I’m doing okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> A little more stressful you know, [NAME OTHER] is in the car doing her nails right now.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She came down because [NAME OTHER] was coughing last night and having some, she just has these panic attacks, she’s been, I said you know, I don’t know when to schedule this; you need to call this gentleman you know, do something.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We talked about deep breathing and you know, she just- I don’t know what to tell you.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, it’s just, its, its-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So her panic attacks are getting in her way [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah they are getting in the-her way.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And they have been for maybe a month or two. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She was doing better before that and I don’t know what um, you know, um, some body else suggested to me perhaps hypnosis?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, I’ve known some people who’ve tried that, it can work. Hypnosis works EMDR can work sometimes for people-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What is that?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s a, it’s called un-movement desensitization and reprocessing, it’s a technique developed by a woman psychologist at [DEIDENTIFIED]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And it sounds odd but it works and… </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> They find some way to cause, um, sensory stimulations on one side of the brain then the other. And it really means that they would have you watch the therapist fingers and go back and forth?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now, they have all kinds of uh, lights that go back and forth they even have head phones you can wear where you get alternating tones in one ear…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And the other.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right, I think I have heard of that-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and it really could help sometimes kind of get through layers of consciousness, to get to things that are underneath?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I’ve had a couple of people with panic attacks have those and it stopped their panic attacks like in one or two sessions. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Do you have anybody besides, that does that?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, there’s actually a guy [DEIDENTIFIED] he’s like one of the national trainers or expert.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> His name is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], you want me to write that-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Name down for you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Could you write that down because-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think that [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] are both gonna have to do it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I know you think you’re seeing more members of the family but the two of them feed on each others panic attacks.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’ve said to [NAME OTHER] last night, my father used to keep saying, you know, paraphrasing it something like, I think everyone is crazy but me and me and I worry about me sometimes. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Sure, so he’s a real good man, he’s [INAUDIBLE] since he trains therapists, he knows what’s good in the area.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Perfect, okay. Um, yeah, we need to do something-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, um, I am passed the age of you know, more kids, more dogs, more you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But, you know, I never, yeah, we just laugh about it but at a certain point, she’s gotta get a life. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know? She doesn’t have much of a life. She’s doing day trips she loves-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And um, she’s going to class very sporadically which we had discussion about that, you know, she needs to get into the art school next year. She needs to take that test she’s put off for two months. You know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Entrance exam, is it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I don’t think it’s an entrance, I think if you’re breathing and have money, they’ll take you at the art school.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I don’t think it’s, were not talking [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, so she, she wants to interior design, which is great-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, um, she just needs to get after it and put an application in.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know? So, I’m siting here pushing-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know? So, other than that, I don’t know what to tell you, I think that’s probably the biggest stress in my life.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. So, yeah, tell her to call me if she’s-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. You know, um, you need to keep moving her. You know, this is, she just has way too much free time. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well, if she’s [INAUDIBLE] someone that kind of moves her own pace-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, at her own pace, trust me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Trust me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, [INAUDIBLE] I don’t know what to tell you, she’s probably a much happier child, then [NAME OTHER] will ever be, but we got to get her moving just a little bit-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I understand. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Light a little bit of a fire.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t want us to be working when I’m a million, you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I know, I understand, yeah. Yeah, at some place you gotta kind of get going on her own, momentum-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Doesn’t she?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly. We got her up to [DEIDENTIFIED] she has an apartment and she rented a place between my house, [NAME OTHER] house and the family she baby-sits for who she really likes. You know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, its so, she has three sources of support-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But she’s got to keep moving.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m very frustrated. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But not depressed, it sounds like, You’re not getting down to [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I do not get depressed.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I had lunch with a girlfriend of mine who is, you know, tell me all, and then I just, I truly don’t cause I wake up and you kind of say-well, you know, you can either be depressed or, you know, you can keep, and I know this is simplifying, I just am not a depressed person. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good, that’s great.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yep, and you’re sleeping well?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I am. Now, last week you may kill me, last week I was down to the almost the end of my pills. I thought, I am depressed about my weight.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So I took two, I’ve been taking two; I had just a few left-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve been taking two-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’ve lost two pounds since last week.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And it could be all in my mind. I know that you’ve told me that that’s a side effect.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It can be, yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I can be. But it seems like I’m less hungry. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it can suppress appetite.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, whatever it takes, you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But it-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t want…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, go ahead.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but I don’t know if that’s the appropriate thing but its, its just you know, I gotta, I’m I was over two hundred pounds, I mean I had to do something.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, the only problem with that, all the weight loss medications, is it doesn’t last, um, you, you get [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] at least get me going?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well, yeah-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I’ll try it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, you had said that I could take two-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You can.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Before.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And [INAUDIBLE] it’s not a high dose or anything.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s what I’m saying, could I try two for a while and see if it you know, I mean I have a, believe me, I would never do this to myself. I didn’t gain any weight over Christmas and stuff, once I lose weight, this is it. I’ve never been heavy in my life.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Eight years ago. This I would never ever do its just I can’t seem to lose it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And how much you weight now [PATIENT NAME]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I weighed this morning I weighed one ninety eight.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, that was home?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that’s at home naked. There’s not even a sip of water in my mouth, you know, we try and get as skinny as -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, I understand. Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Of course you know I’ve never weighed more than a hundred and fifty pounds in my life.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, and I just, [INAUDIBLE] diet, and my metabolism shut down and-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I’m thinking also, did you get your thyroid checked in the last-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Six months or year?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because that, if you want, I can even write you a slip for it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you can just take it wherever you want to go.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, let’s do that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Because that is a common cause of weight that won’t come off. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And do they just send you the results and then you call me?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes. Um, do you know where you’ll go probably to have it done?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I have Blue Cross, Blue Shield, do you know where that would be?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Unfortunately, I don’t. Because they change contracts every year sometimes two-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Insurance companies do. So I would just give them a call and ask-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Which lab can you go to?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ll call them. I’ll call my agent and just ask where I should go. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Let’s see, </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I’ve had a lot of my patients where they’re telling me their on thyroid medicine and boy they look pretty chunky to me. So, admit, you know, I can’t see that’s it’s just probably gonna melt it right off of you.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Not-well, it depends. If people are hypothyroid, meaning you don’t have enough thyroid and they get on it slowly they can start losing weight cause it does speed up some metabolism.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh does it? Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. Now the only thing is even if your results come back normal, the lab tests, you have symptoms, some people can still benefit from it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But, the question is do you have other symptoms besides weight gain. Do you feel fatigued a lot, more than you think you should?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, some days it’s harder to get up and get going than other days, but you know, I’m also [AGE] almost [AGE] so what do you attribute you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, we’re not… </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Do I want to [INAUDIBLE] or you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes. So, so you have enough energy to get through the day though?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I do. I do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you colder than other people, do you think?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Used to be but since I’ve gained this weight, I just sweat, I’m just hotter than heck, you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I used to always be cold. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I was, I had my thyroid checked when I was probably in high school college area to, they said I was at the very, it was like four point two whatever that meant.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that’s interesting. And have you had checks since then? No?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t remember.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, because they also changed the range [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Did they?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Used to be like from zero point five to five was considered the normal range, some of the labs are coming down to like zero point five to three. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, the people that were three and above, now are considered to be underactive on thyroid and sometimes take some extra thyroid hormone and feel better.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that runs in my family so it wouldn’t totally surprise me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s worth checking so that’s a simple thing-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> To get fixed. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Do it this week.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then they’ll just call you and you can-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, they usually mail me or fax me the results.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Depending on where you go so-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. That’s great. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And there’s three tests TSH, T4, T3, the T4, T3 are the actual thyroid hormones? TSH is called thyroid stimulating hormone, that’s what comes from the, the Pituitary Gland-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Down to the thyroid?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And it’s kind of a indirect measure of thyroid functions so-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay, okay, now do these have to be fasting?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Nope, any time of day is fine.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, I can do that. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay? And then it’s just a-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> As soon as I get the results I’ll give you a call.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And if you-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’d be great.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, if you have the draw done and it’s been a few days and you haven’t heard form me, call me, let me know where you had them done and then I can call.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> To help get them sent.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s not a problem, I mean, you know, we’ve made it this far.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Um-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I was even listening to one of my patients one day tell me about a lap band and I said to her you can’t be that desperate.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That sounds like a lot of pain and suffering and money.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hopefully there are other options.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve thought about hypnosis, I’ve thought about you know, I think once you hit fifty, I hate to say this, but you just, body just kind of and I don’t know there’s lack of desire to continue to diet or just your body shuts down-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Your metabolism changes not just how much, how many calories you burn, but how you use them changes too. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I remember sitting at a funeral with my cousin who’s a psychiatrist in [DEIDENTIFIED], he works at [DEIDENTIFIED] and teaches at [DEIDENTIFIED]-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And he said, [PATIENT NAME], you either have to start exercising more or smoking.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, great.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He was kidding me, you know? He said it raises your metabolism.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It gets harder.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He was kidding me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, um.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I hope you’re appetite is pretty stable?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you know, last week, and I don’t, I think I’ve, maybe with these pills, I’ve just psyched myself out. Two pounds is not a lot in the week, but I seem to have you know, cut down a little bit. I’m not eating as much and I’m also trying to be better about what I eat. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, it may be all in my mind, but you know, whatever it takes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, how about focus and concentration?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m at about the same; I don’t notice a whole lot difference one way or the other.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so it’s good during the-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it’s fine.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] day.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. You able to stay on task, you’re not get easily distracted at work?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, no, you know, at work I just, but you know, this could be factor of my age or my personality. I’m doing a project, I walk into another room and I see something that needs to get done, the laundry folded and then I start folding the laundry and I realized I forgot what I came in for. But I think maybe that’s more function of me, you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, all right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean it doesn’t disrupt my life; it just doesn’t get the tasks that I went in to go look for [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Any anxiety that’s out of the ordinary for circumstances?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, you know, [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Several people say, you know, including [NAME OTHER] and friends, you know, you never seem to get upset about some things, but I think I do I think I just you know, work it through my mind maybe-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I think so.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, I [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, are you doing anything for fun these days, any shows or anything? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, they don’t start ‘til April.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I go out with my girlfriends a lot, um, you know, I mean I have a ton of girlfriends who either their older, they’ve been married a thousand years and they don’t, their husbands don’t mind them going out to dinner. See, I haven’t hit that faze in your life when you get to a certain, you’ve been married for forty years, you know, you can go out with your girlfriends and your husband will fend for himself type thing?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, you have kids at home and stuff like that and other ones are widows or divorced and I’ve got a ton of friends. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know? More girls, but that’s okay. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Great. </P>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like it’s fun.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we have a, we have a good time.</P>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s why she didn’t get it checked. I, I, you know, my sister and I are just going back like every month-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Grouchy and crotchety and you know, we have all the ladies from [DEIDENTIFIED] and I never thought he was a racist before, but you know, some day I’m going to come, I mean he’s not bad they, he’s kinda cute crotchety but-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, some day I’m going to come and his mouth is gonna be duct taped.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And he’s gonna be duct taped to the wheel chair. But we’ve got somebody that comes in that you know, uh, she takes care of him every day for four hours, gets him dressed and gets him going and-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And he still lives home?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, he’s in a care center and so is my step mother, my step mother who’s supposed to be dead is doing fabulous and playing bridge-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Holy smokes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I guess I don’t understand Leukemia.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, um, you can go either way, you know?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, the doctor in the summer gave her two days to two months and then the end of August I way laid him and said okay, you know, what are you thinking? And he said three months, so I said you know, so you think she’ll be dead, dead in the next twelve months? And he just looked at me like you know; don’t you get [NAME OTHER]?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And, you know, she’s had, has her teeth cleaned, we’ve had her eyes checked, we’ve had gynecological appointments.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We’ve gone and cleaned up their cottage, that’s what I did in November, um-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm, just keeps going.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> She’s just pluggin’ along.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s amazing. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, you know, I think she’s probably more tired but she’s a fun one, so I got one on the second floor and one of the third floor.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]. Doesn’t hurt her.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow. Keeps you busy.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Keeps me busy.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, good. It sounds like you’re doing fine.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I am doing fine, you know, there’s no choice. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I, you know-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You have a good attitude [PATIENT NAME], not every body does and some-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I know and I think that that’s more of uh, you know, I mean I realize other people have problems and I don’t know what to tell you, I just it, you know, I feel sorry for them because I just you know-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you don’t let things get the better of you either, that makes a big difference, some people-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, and I think some of things over whelm and I just can’t imagine doing that, you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, so, if I can keep the boat afloat, my house is still being worked on.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh? What are you doing to your house?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, we’ve been renovating it for the last year or two years.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Or whatever it’s going so, they say, do you get lonely, and I said are you kidding? With dogs, kids, and workmen at my house, I have moon lighters. But-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Boy, oh boy.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It- my life is full. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t want anymore. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, work going fine?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Every things fine.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good, good. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m mad at [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] because they won’t give me more vacation days, but other than that, you know, I’m giving them the evil eye, but other than that, we get along great, you know. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, how long you been there?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Eighteen years. And, and the girl, the full time girl that’s there, I missed your daughter yesterday, I was-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Working down at the other end and um, she gets twenty days a year and she works five days a week, I work two days a week and I get four days a year. Does that sound right to you?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-mm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Personally, no.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you. And she is a thirty two year old who’s been a hygienist three years, you know? So, I’ve been giving them the evil eye and you know, they don’t wanna buck up, but I’m going to stay after it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know? They’re not happy with me. I mean not to the point of firing me or anything-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But you know what I’m saying?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And think they can buck up and give me two more days off? You know, twenty versus four?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I don’t know how they came to that number.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because she is a full time hygienist and they don’t have to pay a part timers, they don’t, their not forced to pay part timers like they do full timers. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She gets health insurance and um, </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, twenty days whether personal, sick, whatever I get four days you know, for personal, two days, and there’s something wrong in this thinking. So, um-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That they didn’t just do a proportional thing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I’ve worked in that office before they did, they tent to be a little cheap. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I, they’re probably the most honest [DEIDENTIFIED] out there, I-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] you know? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They’re the most, that’s why I never quit, because they are the most quality [DEIDENTIFIED] I’ve run-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Across, the most honest [DEIDENTIFIED] I’ve run across and-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s hard to</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, Ill just continue giving them the evil eye until they buck up, you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The guilt-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, they’re great. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They’re just real quality guys.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I know, I know.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Every time I go in there, I see more psychiatrists in that office than I see at the meetings usually.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> See, I, my seven o’clock is always um-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER], yes. I always see [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Who else?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Seven a.m. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] who else?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> His wife, [NAME OTHER] some.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Huh. I can’t remember, three or four of the-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Psychiatrists in there-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah [NAME OTHER]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] yep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, [NAME OTHER]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, [NAME OTHER] I think there?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, he goes there. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And [NAME OTHER]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, [NAME OTHER], yeah so-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He sees two other psychiatrists. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] group probably, so-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I mean they’ve all been patients forever. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Plus we have half the doctors there, even have, this is the funny one, we have an Orthodontist who is the worst orthodontist, you see his ads on TV, the worst Orthodontist in the entire state I think.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe could be Nation. And he’s come to us for years and he wonders why we don’t refer to him. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Hello? He still comes to us, even though we don’t refer to him. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, you’d think he would at some point, you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Figure it out.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Figure it out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, no, I’m fine.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good, you’re doing fine. So just keep doing what we’re doing you think?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Or try the two?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] do you mind me staying? Otherwise I’ll cut back to one a day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If you want to try two and see its okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Is that okay?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> As long as you didn’t have side effects.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I’m fine.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Any problems, again just realize that the weight loss effects over time may diminish or go away because you may develop tolerance to that dose. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, I’ll just cut back and save money.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, yeah that-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I was hoping for quick, something to get me started, you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. It used to be used as a weight- the stimulus used to be used in the weight loss medicines that they just found out they typically don’t work, there is one that they use still for weight loss, they’ve used it on long term called Phentermine. You ever heard of? In the old days, a while back, they used to have this Fen-Phen thing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It was half the Fen-Phen thing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um, and it, it does help some people, but the problem is, even with it, over time people tended to get a tolerance to it so it stops working, so-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It doesn’t keep the weight off unfortunately. I wish there was something better that they’d come up with but, haven’t, you know. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You ever hear anything about that Hoodia or whatever it is Hoodia?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I have heard something, I don’t know, isn’t it a root from Africa or something?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> A root from Africa.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know if you’ve heard anything-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’ve read some of the-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Tell me about it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I read an article and it sounded interesting but I didn’t, I don’t know that it’s available in the coun-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it’s available.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I, but I don’t know anything, you know, more than what I’m telling you.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What I read was that I think some one like the bush men or somebody chew on it when they going out for days. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, they don’t have access to food, it keeps them going still?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s about all I know about it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, they’re all skinny in Africa anyway.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. So where’s [NAME OTHER] now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She went back to [DEIDENTIFIED]. And um, she’s still struggling but she’s put applications out to, she’s trying to get a scholarship to [DEIDENTIFIED], she’s been accepted to law school there and-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She put at [DEIDENTIFIED], that’s where she went under-grad. And would be nice because then she could help with my dad.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Also [DEIDENTIFIED] she’s been accepted but she went to Africa, and then she’s also put an application in for the head of uh, human rights group and in [DEIDENTIFIED]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But she thinks that might be a stretch. She’s being mentored by a former ambassador to the UN, for Human Rights of the United States, so-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, um,</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She’s high powered position.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, so I have one child who’s into human rights, and the other child, I can’t get out of [DEIDENTIFIED]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know? If I could, what’s the difference here and have a couple you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know [PATIENT NAME], I just had this conversation with a friend who uh, went back to [DEIDENTIFIED] went to high school?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And one of my old coaches was still there, he’s just retired for thirty years. He was just a few years ahead of me in high school. And he said, [PHYSICIAN NAME], he’s got three kids four grand kids, he said one thing I’ve learned being a teacher, a coach, a father and a grandfather is that can only do so much with you’re kids, you can, you can try to influence them but you cant control them, he said you can be the same parent to all of them, they’re going to come out completely different-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, totally.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He said, you know, you just, you got, he said, the thing you got to do as a father, he said you got to just let go of thinking you can control the outcome of your kids, because he said, you cant. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, totally.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And uh, he said, you know, you just do the best you can because I see kids form great families and one family that turned out all different kinds of ways, he said you know, a lot of it’s up to the kids and what choices they make and-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Totally, you know, totally, at least they’re not into drugs, alcohol-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, aggressive sex, um-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> With any of those things, so I have to be grateful for you know that. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> There are a lot of kids out there that are really struggling right now, it’s just to survive and can’t even be on their own.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, no, and I realize that and I’m very grateful and that’s why I try to, I feel very sorry for a lot of these families with kids with you know, I’d say [NAME OTHER] probably told you about her brother who her half brother who’s manic depressive and-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, he’s, you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, they, she’s been a support to [NAME OTHER] up in [DEIDENTIFIED] and then the step, my step son is just right off the, I mean, he’s crazy.</P>

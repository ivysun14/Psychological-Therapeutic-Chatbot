<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok, so what I really need today is, to have by the end of today, some kind of plan. It doesn't have to be a very good plan, but like I've, that's what I really need to do, um yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, well, I'm glad you told me what you need. That's good, um, and I assume you need a plan to deal with your work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know it's not exactly necessarily always the point of what we're doing here, but like, I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just, I've been, I feel like I'm just drifting into inevitable doom and I'd rather kind of walk there. Um. (laughter) [00:00:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok. Um, now uh, it's good you tell me what you need, it will help. So, (pause) like, I guess tell me a little more about the parameters so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, so today is not my day. I, I um, completely bit it in the parking lot after class. Like I actually like fell down, rolled, tumbled over...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my gosh, is that like you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yes. (laughter) I think I'm wearing these shoes out, such, like I fell on the sides of my feet, I think I'm wearing them out such that they're a little bit rounded.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Gotcha. Gotcha.[00:01:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually I don't actually fall down. But um... So I, so what worked for me at William & Mary um, was sometime in the last month or six weeks is to go through and just do like a day to day schedule and say like if I do this on this day, then at the end everything that needs to get done will get done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I am in kind of a really different place where I will write myself down a schedule and then I just won't do it. Um, and, I guess feeling that the, the kind of pressures that the semester comes to an end and close is like, you know, it's kind of beating my sense of crisis and also my sense of like, just, being completely useless and not being, not doing anything, um. [00:02:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, um, is a two tiered approach required? I guess here's what I have in mind. Like on one hand it sounds like that sort of organization can be helpful really. You go through, okay, here are the things I have due, here are the due dates, here is how much time each one will take and if I kind of back myself into how much I need to be working over the next however many weeks and what I need to do each day, I know I will get it done. And as you say, that being done before and when you can count on yourself to work that's very helpful. [00:03:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the problem is I can do that myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, like I know I can do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine. (laughter) Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but what I can't do right now is get to work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Get to work, yeah. And as we were talking about yesterday with the one paper, my impression was we were talking about things that were pretty close to why you're having so much trouble working on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like that, for example just like as a thought experiment, you know if your advisor came to you and said you know, I rethought it and I was totally wrong, that's a great way to go, I think you should go with just what you wanted, like you would probably then be able to work. [00:04:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like in other words, it, it feels to you as well that you know, we were kind of pointing at the thing that makes it difficult.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like as opposed to like just generally feeling so awful that you can't do something, it's related to a specific issue between you and he.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, um, it does although (pause), in some ways like, mm, it's like it has gotten to the point that my sense that uh, nobody believes in me and I should not believe in myself is totally independent of any actual feedback that I'm getting. Um, that, and so, you know in some sense if he came and said, "No, I think this would be great, go ahead", I don't think that would actually fix anything. Um, I'd like to think it would. [00:05:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the reason why it might not is that your own faith in it might be, and in yourself might be undermined to the extent that you couldn't actually do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like that you feel so worthless, and that what you're doing so worthless you can't get started?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something like that yeah. I'm sorry this is really throwing me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I, you know I mean my, uh, my work is my life in a lot of ways and I've never (exhale) it, it's not, it's just a combination of I'm too afraid to do it and I don't care enough to do it. Um, and I don't understand why I don't care about it. Um, because I also really really do care about it. Um, like I, I, (exhale) I feel like I, I feel helpless in a way that I'm not used to feeling helpless and I feel pretty helpless a lot of the time. So, and I say like I need to have a plan and I don't even know what that would look like, or, you know I have no reliance on my ability to carry out any plan. Um. [00:06:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are, are you, are you also afraid to like, a set of scenarios where if you can do this much, here's what you do and then here's how you deal with the consequences and then if you do that much here's what you do and that's how you deal with the consequences? I mean is that more the sort of plan that you are looking for?</p>

<p>In other words like if you can work at ten percent you get this done and then you, you know take an incomplete for this and for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you work at twenty percent you do this and that. Is that the more the sort of plan you are looking for? Or are you just looking for something to hold onto called a plan?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much that. Um, yeah (pause) (inhale) Uh, I, I don't, I don't know how to be helpful, I don't know how to tell you what I'm thinking, um, which is also not something that happens often. Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you um, (pause) what I think you're conveying to me, like more with your gestures than with words, is how very frustrated you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:08:52] Yeah I keep working at, ok; this is how I'll deal with the rest of the semester. And so that means that I need to do this, and then I just don't do that thing. And ok, so this is how I'm going to you know, deal with not being able to work. So I will need to take it slowly, and I'm gonna file, and I'm, but, ease my way into it and I just don't do it. Um. You know, it, (pause) you know, a lot of that is undoubtedly that I'm a fairly lazy person, but I've always been a fairly lazy person and I've always managed to get it done eventually. Um, (pause) but, (pause) I feel like the part of me that is capable of sustained work is just turned off, um and it's faded. [00:10:02] (pause) [00:10:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, (pause) so, yeah, and I think, I think you're really scared you're gonna kill yourself over that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well because, you know, I don't know to what extent you are interested in or uh, I don't know; give credence to the medical side of things. But so, another part of this is I am off finally the last mood stabilizer, the lithium. And I have noticed that I don't, overall my mood is better, but it is definitely way more up and down. [00:11:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. No I take this very seriously.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, but it's not, it's not like the lithium it was helping, in some ways it was making me worse because it was making it harder to pull out of bad spaces. Um, and it didn't keep me from falling into depressive like moods? But I'm back in this place where, one hour I've forgotten that this whole last year has happened and then the next hour I'm you know zero to suicidal in ten minutes. Um, and, and that's scary. Um, and it's, required a whole different way of handling my moods than I have been using. So I have to sort of think how I'm gonna cope.</p>

<p>Um, and, (pause) and yeah, I mean, (pause) I feel like I've, I mean maybe part of it is that it's I'm really scared that I'm gonna kill myself (tearful) it, it makes it a lot harder to do the work (laugh) because well it's not going anywhere in the long run.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhmm because you're gonna be dead. [00:12:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um (tearful), and you know, if I don't kill myself, I which, I mean, I don't want to, but I don't have any hope that I'll be well enough to do anything. So it's, uh, you know, how do I make a plan to kind of pick up the pieces and do the things that I need to do to value myself and to get better and to, (exhale) you know, live the life that I want for myself when I have no faith that that life is ever going to come. And when I'm really kind of convinced that that is never gonna come. [00:13:46]</p>

<p>Um, you know, I mean, and one of the, in an argument with James several weeks ago, I can't remember which one it was, but, I think the thing that he said that like really hurt my feelings was I never, I would have never seen you just lay down under something like this. I've never seen you just give up. And, um, several hours later when we both cooled down and we're talking it through, I'm like well you know it only took me a year to lose hope. Um, you know a year of like this constant barrage, um, (inaudible at 00:14:31) (laugh) um, how do I get that back? [00:14:38]</p>

<p>Um, (sigh), you know I know that the way to get that back is just to do it, you know, is to just to be a part of my life again. Um, and to do the things that I care about and to do the things that I value and to, to live according to my values despite you know however I'm feeling. I just can't, I just can't do it. Um, (sniff), you know and then it disappears for hours at a time and I think I'm just making this up. You know how is it that at one time of the day I have nothing on my mind and at another time of the day I'm convinced I'm gonna be dead in twenty four hours. Like, how does that happen? (sniff) [00:15:57]</p>

<p>(exhale) So I can't even tell myself that I have the ability to do the work because I do, you know, I have that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:16:08) it's over it's so confusing it's frustrating. Um, some of the uh, it certainly does like have a cast of you know, changing of medication and getting used to those and figuring out what meds are going to do and getting some, somewhat regular or respectable state of things. [00:16:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I know it takes a long time,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you also have got to survive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean, also, I feel like I've exhausted most of the classes of medications that there are out there. I think Dr. [anonymous] is a little bit stymied. Um, uh, you know there's always (inaudible at 00:17:13)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ask her that, ask her if she stymied or if she's not sure what to do next because you um, should be sitting with that worry on your own. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, uh, like who in her field (inaudible at 00:17:32)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean we've talked about like, what is the next thing to do, what is the next thing to try? And she um, I think is, is, saying well ok, let's go back and try the SSRI's again, um, which is, is, what I, I mean the only thing I really took is Prozac up until here, and it's unclear whether it was really helping or not. Um, it's certain that it was not helping enough; um it's unclear whether it was doing anything. You know, so, it, so that's just, it's just not something I can summon a whole lot of optimism for. Um, but like yeah, like I trust her, I'll try it, it's the only thing to do, so what are you going to do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also think that, (pause) um, I mean it's um, I'm not sure how to (inaudible at 00:19:03) but I sort of see it the other way mostly as far as your moods and your ability to do your school work. You're saying um, you're mostly focused on the way that your mood affects your ability to do your work and you're terrified that you know, this is how you're going to be mood wise from here on out and that's gonna be that you're never gonna be able to do the work consistently that will allow you to have the kind of career that you want and that you had a vision for yourself, I think. [00:19:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not so much the career um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (exhale) You know I'm, I'm really afraid that I'm just never going to be able to work again. Like, that I'm never going to be able to have a career, um, or that I'm never going to be able to have the, this is not the only career that can be fulfilling for me. But anything I do has to be intellectually challenging. [00:20:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:20:26) that you're wedded to this particular career path or that you're wedded to having a stimulating fulfilling career that involves regular work on whatever you're doing and you're concerned that you know, this stuff going on with your mood and emotional life is going to blow that apart.</p>

<p>To me, no go ahead...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, I guess I'm thinking a lot the other way around that it seems to be that work is, has for awhile has been one of the main ways you've coped and felt like life was worth it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I've it's, that's all I've got to offer you know, that's what I can contribute, um, and not so much life is worth it, but that I am worth it you know I am worth life. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And does, in some way like, um, I imagine that it's clear to you, and I don't mean this critically I just don't know how to say it, but there's something neurotic going on there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I know (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like you know, obviously the time scales are out of wack here I mean that you can you know, like you want to die if you haven't been able to work in a week or a few weeks, and so that has bearing on the rest of your professional life, when I think it's more about, um, making you feel like you really have something to offer for now. Or not, you know what I mean, like you get kind of global about it, in other words... [00:22:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what you're saying is that the actual impact of the last semester is actually going to be somewhat small.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying. Yeah, that's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but that that's not what's important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not how it feels to you, day to day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um and a little bit of that is because I've felt that I have started out mediocre here and have kind of slowly slid down. And most of that is just irrational. Um, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's always the next project that I'm working on will determine my entire worth, it's always that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, which is totally untrue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know this. (laughter) I know this, and yet I do not believe it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure. Um, uh, (pause) but, this is, I guess it when we're talking about it in a sense is like the way it feels like the bottom is dropping out. [00:24:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I guess I had the impression that in the past being able to work is kind of like a handrail or like a big part of the floor underneath you would be a better analogy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, it's not there anymore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, I think it's terrifying and I think, I'm not saying it's a bad idea to write a plan and maybe we'll be able to come up with something. But, my impression is like; you're saying you're looking for something to hold onto.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very much so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, certainly in the longer term, I don't know about the shorter term, it seems like part of the questions is, and you know, I'm sure you already have a lot of thoughts about this, why you feel like your work is all you have to offer of value.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have thought about that a lot. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:25:23) cross your mind. But...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, it, (pause) yeah it's kind of like, how do I see this unhealthy frames of mind enough to get me to a place where I can actually start dealing with making them go away. If that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry say that again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just try it again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How do I, uh, you know I know that the way that I can construct my place in the world is not a good one and not a very healthy one. Um, but in order for me to be kind of stable enough to start to deconstruct that, I have to get to a place where I am stable, which involves buying into that to some extent. (pause) [00:26:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Honestly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, it may not be this way for you but I think the way that it often is, is that you need to feel like you're not alone in doing that and that there are other people around that are uh, with you as you're trying to put the pieces back together. I think what it requires is like some stability in relationships often, not necessarily in, um; you know your functioning situation. (pause) [00:27:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like having, go ahead...</p>

<p>CLIENT: The problem is, that I feel very stable in my relationships, I feel extraordinarily lucky in my relationships. But even those in some ways like I feel very stable in them, uh, but it's based on to some extent, some kind of internal balance sheet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, where I'm doing the right things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, where you're protecting your relationships to some extent from how you're feeling and what's going on with you. I mean, I'm again, like, I think you said James has been there, most especially, James and other people as well like in really fantastic ways, and I'm not saying anything else. But... yeah, versus that you also, you know what I'm saying, that you should have done otherwise, but like, uh, there are things going on with you to do with this that can't be brought into the relationship as fully as you feel them. [00:29:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. I don't know that I, I don't, eh, it's not that I can't talk about them, it's that we're never going to deal with them in the same way. Um, you know because I, like I talk with James as freely as I do with you, and more so. Um, uh, but the way that he see, can see to solve problems is, is how the problem would be solved for him, and that's not the same as how they're going to be solved with me and that's where the disconnect lies.</p>

<p>Um, and so the complicating factor there is that over kind of the course of our relationship, I have adopted a lot of the ways that he solves problems, and found them really really helpful for me, but it doesn't work always. [00:30:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and, you know I guess I've just been thinking about those a lot, in terms of being in therapy with you actually, um, and that like it's really really easy for me to trust people and kind of open up to myself, it's very difficult for me to rely on people, um, because you know... everybody in my life really loves me and wants the best for me. I don't have a whole lot of people who are very good at it. Or I haven't historically. Um, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good at being reliable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, good at knowing what the best thing to do is. You know, so, I certainly believe in the purity of people's intentions, um, but, (sigh) it doesn't mean that they're going to be helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah, and I have no doubt it will be a mixed bag with me as well. I hope to be as helpful as I can, but I'm sure there's, I know that there will be a lot that I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It will be ok. Um, [00:32:08] Yeah. (pause)[00:32:54]</p>

<p>So, I, where do I go from here? (pause) [00:33:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, (pause) well, let's talk about it a bit more pragmatically, or as closer to being logistic about things. So, what do you have to get done? You've got the paper for your advisor, which is like a twenty page term paper, what else have you got?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, another twenty page term paper, um that I can take an incomplete on and I probably will because I haven't even started. Um, and then an exam. It's not much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When's that due?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In two, like a week and a half actually on the last day of classes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok, and have uh, are you concerned about uh, like being able to study enough for that? [00:34:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Under normal circumstances I wouldn't be. And the, it's two days of hard work. Um, but I yeah, I just, I don't, I don't know how to predict myself at all anymore. Um, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right and when's the paper due?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even know, it's I mean, presumably at the end of the exam period, but you know, at, at William & Mary there was like this very strict rule with incompletes. If you didn't turn in the paper by a certain date in the next semester that you failed the class automatically. That doesn't seem to be the case here; they don't really tell you anything. And I, I definitely have, I know of people who have taken longer than a semester to finish an incomplete. I don't want to do that. But, I don't, in some ways it's kind of, if I don't set a deadline for myself I know I'll never do it. Um, but, yeah. [00:35:31] Yeah it's really not much. [00:35:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And um, you're out of town Wednesday through...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Through Sunday. Um and I can, I can be working at some point during that time, but I'm visiting family and so forth. Uh, it's this beautiful irony, my high school asked me to come back and give a speech at the cum laude service. Did I tell you this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so. Talk about the intellectual (inaudible at 00:36:17) it's going to be exciting. Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you ok about doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The speech? Um, well you know I feel like a fraud but it's not actually about me, it's about what they need to hear. So, I wrote my speech, I like it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok good. And um, so I got the part about this, how great, uh how much pressure are you feeling about getting things done while you're away?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it will be easy for me to forget to do stuff while I'm away. Um, and then I'll really freaked out about it when I get back. Which is always the case. [00:37:08] pause [00:37:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, how it seemed to me yesterday as we were talking about the paper, which sounds like the main thing is, (pause) like the, you seem to be stuck in trying to reconcile your own and your advisors views of what you should do right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I, I have, I have scoped out the way out, I just haven't quite reconciled myself to doing it yet. Like, I know what I am going to say, I just you know, haven't gotten to a point where I'm ok with saying it yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it that you don't like about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, uh, it's not what the paper could be. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I assume it's leaving out some of the kinds of things that you are interested in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, I mean there's always going to be leaving out most of what I am actually interested in... [00:38:43}</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cuz this is sort of just like a, what's the word, like a, like a (inaudible at 00:38:52) like your first foray into (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah something like that. Um, yeah, I, I just don't think I'm going to do it very well. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They way he wants you to do it, you don't think you'll do very well? Or do you mean you won't do it very well according to what you want from it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that the, uh, kind of (pause) I think that the best compromise that I can come up with still will just be not a (inaudible at 00:39:29). Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you probably, like, you mean not that good in the sense of not being that worthwhile for you or not that good in terms of not that worthwhile to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, a more objective sense, not being a terribly good piece of scholarship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh..</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I rationalize that there is no actual thing as a objectively good thing of scholarship, but I still think that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure, and there are probably, like probably conceptual differences that people have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to do something that's not very good scholarship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have to believe in it when I start. Um, yeah. [00:40:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you do. (laughter) I really do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it's, yeah, you know, it, I started trying to write original scholarship when I was fifteen; it's not even my first essay. I never got the part where you were supposed to repeat what other people had already said. Like, uh, I didn't realize that that was what they wanted out of me until I had already graduated high school. Um, and then I was really upset about it. Um, (laughter) (inaudible at 00:41:29).</p>

<p>Um, (pause) yeah. And you know, realistically if I can get into it, I'll, I'll get caught up with it and it'll work. Um, (pause) you know, if I, I've plowed my way through doomed projects before; I've just never had quite so much going on while I do it. You know it's never been that important to me. [00:42:32]</p>

<p>(sigh) (pause) [00:42:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I don't, I don't imagine you like it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (exhale) (pause) I don't know, I mean uh, it's, I don't, I don't know how to do it. Um, it feels like lying, I don't know how to. Um, (pause) yeah. You know, all of which is just, all of which is surmountable it just requires a kind of greater summoning of mental effort on my part. Um, and I, (pause) it's like those reserves aren't there right now. Um, [00:44:15] (pause) (inhale) [00:45:19]</p>

<p>So this is probably is not actually very helpful, but I guess I've convinced myself it's not really that I need a plan, or that you've convinced me somehow. Um, but, (pause) [00:45:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I agree I don't think that that's what would be helpful or that I could come up with a plan today that would make much different. Um, [00:46:08] (pause) [00:47:08)</p>

<p>It's reminding me of your question to me last week, um, (chuckle) which I actually talked you out of needing an answer to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're pretty good at that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which, may be (inaudible at 00:47:29) um, I think in both instances you are looking for something from me that you could hold onto. That's probably more reflective of something you don't feel solid about in yourself. Or something that you feel quite vulnerable around. And...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely agree in the latter case, I'll have to keep thinking about the former case, but I've yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're also, letting me know something about what these things are like. You know, um, uh, like, like what you're probably trying to figure out some way to think your way through. You know doing your work in a way that will make you feel safe when you know, that feels totally overwhelming and like impossible to get any traction on. [00:49:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, I suspect there's a similar feeling with your advisor actually, I mean I think this all seems very, it may be that I don't know enough about the specifics, but it all seems very um, like much in parallel or like I intuitively imagine this to be like in parallel like what you're looking from me in the way of help and what were are looking for and got or didn't get from him in response to what you wrote. I guess, what I have in mind is (pause) you didn't get anything from him in his response to what you wrote that made you feel any more solid in what you were doing and I think that's probably what you wanted from him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you then feel like you have to then generate that on your own. I think, I think you have a fantasy that he didn't give that to you because you don't deserve it or you're not worth it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. You know and that one interaction I mean you know is kind of reflected in myriad ways that the school operates, or that my department operates. Um, yeah. So that there just is no solid footing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. If I was really gonna go big with this, I would.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine that like, there is something about fathers and daughters going on here, I mean that would [00:51:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know (inaudible at 00:51:52) laughter. Um, probably. Yeah. Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a one out of two chance. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean we can you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean there is definitely something going on, I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're sort of getting a little further away from it. I, but I, (pause) I do think you are kind of putting yourself in his hands in a way that you know, that didn't make you feel held at all and then you're just like falling with the project and, I think it's a little like what happened here, yeah today we went looking for a plan or last week when went looking for an answer for the question, like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although last week actually was fine. I mean I didn't feel disappointed at the end of the day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's my impression as well. I think the way we wound up talking about it seemed to be enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhmm. Yeah, and in time it's a lot more important that I ask a question than I got a satisfactory answer. Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You should call me if you need to.</p>

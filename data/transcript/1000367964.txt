<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) When I was coming here tonight I was thinking first about sort of how, the relief I felt when I finished proofreading my paper and almost the feeling of that now it's out of my hands and I could sort of detach myself from it.  And it made me think, although the more I thought on it, the more I'm not sure it's a parallel but I, I thought immediately of the reaction I often have to saying something, that before I've said it here, seems to be terribly hard.  And then once I've said it, unless it brings forth other ideas that I don't want to say, I feel almost a relief too.  (Pause) And I think this is really, in a way, picking up the thought you put out last, yesterday when I agreed but I then said I wasn't sure whether I should or not, how much I really thought about it.  Because now it seems like I'm feeling the process of both when I did my paper and any paper and, and when I'm thinking about things before I say them, of trying to judge what the expectations are and what the reactions will be. (Pause)</p>

<p>Because just, when I was thinking about my paper, after the initial relief of having sort of completed all the little tasks I'd set out for myself, I began to think again, well, I wonder if I really did say everything I wanted to say or if I said it clearly.  And then I almost start the whole process over again of worrying about it.  (Silence) And I think just about everything I do, I have this feeling that there's a right way.  Because often when I'm here, sometimes it'll just sort of fleet into my mind and won't really bother me but other times it will really depress me for the whole time I'm here, the thought that I, I'm not good at this and I can't go through analysis in the right way and I'm not responding in the right way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What do you imagine constitutes the right way?  What is the right way and how do you think about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I, I think I think of it more negatively, that I'm not sure what it is but I'm not doing it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: In an extension of your sort of general view of yourself that you don't do anything right.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  And I suppose sometimes that feeling comes when I'm, when I'm trying to avoid saying something.  And sometimes it comes when I'm having a day — well, I suppose it's all the same thing.  I'm not aware of avoiding anything but I just can't seem to get involved in anything.  Because I think of times when I've felt particularly involved in what I've been saying or the ideas haven't been ones I've resisted to the extent of not being able to say them at all, and then I won't have this feeling.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I just began thinking about, uhm, the way I've been teaching since vacation and how I just somehow am letting the class be a little more chaotic or it seems chaotic.  And I'm not making the children be as quiet or demanding quite as much from them in, in that kind of a way, and sort of feeling, I can't seem to do it because I can't see any point in doing it.  But yet, on the other hand, I doubt my do—, acting in this way and I think, again, I'm not teaching in the right way.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just realizing too: I was thinking about something else and there was no reason I didn't say it right away except my general tendency to think whatever comes to mind out and sort of work out why it came to my mind or what relationship it has to what I've been saying so that I don't sort of flounder around when I'm talking.  And I suppose that's 1 idea I have about the right way to do things here.  And if I feel I'm just floundering around and, I don't know, just somehow missing the point of what I really was thinking and what I say, then it will bother me.  I suppose in the back of my mind is the feeling that you're having to listen to it and you must be thinking, "How can she be so stupid not to be more direct in what she's saying or specific or, I don't know, just get to the point?"  The thing I was thinking of was my reaction to a notification I just got from the University that I couldn't register by mail because I have something, I guess, a book out from the library and I had it overcharged, overdue charge.  And, uhm, I knew nothing about this.  And the only thing I could think of was this summer they made a mistake on thinking I hadn't returned a book I had.  And I have since assumed that had been taken care of.  And so my feeling right now is that it, this is their mistake, not mine.  And it just infuriated me last night, partly because I hate registering in person.  Because it, you just stand on line after line and, I don't know, they seem to make it as difficult as possible.  But also somehow, just because I had done the right things and they made a mistake and I was having to pay for the mistake, was what was really bothering me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Eh, you said that, uhm, you had to think this out first before you said it, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What do you imagine would have happened if you had just said it without thinking it out?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I probably would have said exactly what I said.  Because when I started to say it, I kept thinking, well what was it I was trying to think out so I can say it?  (Pause) And when I mean thinking it out, I think I mean not only just sort of generally seeing the relationships of that thought to others or — I think I'm trying to sort of tie everything together too.  And as if I'm, almost as if I'm writing a paper while I'm here and everything has to relate and make sense.  But, well, I mean, it's part of this, I was, I think, actually working out what words I would use when I talked about it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: It occurs to me that this is like the, uhm, issue that you, ah, forgot at the end of the hour yesterday.  There was a parallel I had drawn that you were trying to recall and couldn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I think, it, it, that was strange because I, I think there is a, a similar thing.  Because when I started to say something about the parallel I hadn't thought it out and then I stopped to sort of think it out.  And it was almost like it just slipped right from my mind or from my grasp and became vaguer and vaguer until I wasn't even sure any longer what it was I was even thinking about.  And I could just feel it leaving.  But maybe it was, it was leaving my mind because, in trying to work out what I would say about it, I began to think I can't say this or I don't want to say it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And, ah, the parallel had to do with, ah, your controlling by, you know, talking or not talking, by being quiet.  And that's what you're describing now, the kind of way of keeping control over what you say so that you understand its implications before you actually say it.  So, as you say, it won't sound a certain way that you're afraid it'll sound to me. (Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It's funny how I react, too, to your making a statement like that.  And, and it was a part of this that I was reacting to when you drew the parallel on my controlling or not controlling what I said.  And I think you were relating it to my controlling or not controlling intercourse with MSCZ.  And it's almost as if, well, what you're saying I already knew in a way.  But yet you are putting it in terms I hadn't thought of.  And then I think to myself, well, if I already knew it then why hadn't I thought of it in those terms.  And sort of, what's the matter with me that I couldn't have seen that too?  (Pause) And then it, and that part bothers me to the point that I almost stop thinking about what it was you said and how much more it might clarify my own ideas.</p>

<p>ANALYST: As though, if I say anything you don't already know or, or that you already know and didn't think of, either one, that it reveals some inferiority on your part?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I guess that must be it.  I, I just am aware of feeling mad at myself.  Sort o—, well, combination relieved that something I'd been struggling with and sort of vaguely understanding you have said in a way that I can understand it better.  But also, frustrated with myself and angry at myself.  And then I just lose track of what you said because right now, if I had to repeat what you just said a minute ago I couldn't do it.  And then since I said that I'm beginning to (laughs) remember it.  (Sniffle)  (Pause)</p>

<p>But this whole thing of the way my memory works and things that I know perfectly well are right there and I can't recall but yet I might recall in another minute, it's somehow, I, I just can't accept it and sort of say, sort of the way you did last night, "Oh, well, it'll come back."  I just get more and more tense about it and frustrated and I'll just sit there and try to remember it.  And sometimes it makes me feel really frantic.  I don't know why it does.  Well, part of it might be that if it's something, for instance, to do with a thought I had on an activity for school or something I had to do for school, I'm afraid if I don't remember it I'll never be able to think of it again or that what I do in its place won't be as good.  But it's also just a part of this is something I should be able to control.  And sort of, if I keep applying myself then I'll be able to control it. (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about, uhm, something I read recently in one of the books on art.  The author was treating different possible blocks to free expression and fears and so forth that a child might have.  And one of the things she was going into was the fact that children will give certain attitudes to adults that they think they have toward their work which adults may not have at all, or other people, anyway.  And I was just thinking that sometimes after I've said something that I think is significant, that somehow seems to be a summing point, it seems to me that you will sort of take a deep breath and, almost as if you've been waiting for that.  And now that it's come you can relax too.  And it just occurred to me then, well, I should try it some more and see if you keep doing it, if it really is true.  And I realized that this is probably an instance where, whether or not it's related, I have it fixed in my mind now that it is.  And it's almost, I take it almost as a sign of approval or that I had finally gotten to the point that you were waiting to hear. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I'm not sure how often I feel that way but I certainly reacted that way right now.  (Silence) And earlier I was thinking, the fact that I'm so often frustrated at not saying things the way I want to say made me wonder why if I have this great interest, I haven't learned to use vocabulary better.  Obviously it must have something to do with sort of, being unable to think of the words even if they're part of my vocabulary, or being secure in using them if I do think of them.  I, I think that's often it, I revert back to words that I know are right even if they aren't very expressive.  Or else, I'm just afraid I'm not saying it very well anyway and then of course I can't, I just can't even think.  And I was thinking how so often here I'm so sensitive to any of the noises.  And it's probably partly just because it is so quiet in here.  But if I'm at a party or something I'll just feel my, I must be losing my hearing.  And again I suppose it's because I'm so afraid of what I'm doing myself that I can't concentrate on listening too. (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I'm not sure but it almost seemed that when you didn't breathe deeply after I finished saying that about listening, that my mind immediately went back as if, well, what didn't I say I should have or could have.  But it all happened so quickly I'm not, I'm not sure if I'm making that part up.  And there's something, too, about having said that about hearing you breathe deeply and then your not doing it.  Somehow I get the feeling of some sort of control.  And I'll feel ag—, a sort of quick feeling of pleasure that I can control you to this extent and then I feel guilty that I feel that way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But the idea pleases you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  It's happened other times too, probably about other things.  But whenever it does come up I always feel, well, the word, perverse, comes to my mind.  It's sort of, it's kind of a nasty type of pleasure.  (Pause) Or else, there's something wrong in me that I can feel it.  (Silence) I think there's another aspect too.  I'm so vague that I don't even really know what to say about it except that in a way, however much I think I can control what you do, the feeling is that you are in control here.  And so sometimes if you change what you do because you know I have a certain feeling about it, it makes, I don't know, it makes me feel good that what I felt could be important enough to cause you to change what you did.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you have something in particular in mind, other than the breathing that you mentioned?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I'm not sure.  I just know I've had that feeling before.  But just now when you asked that, it came to mind the time when I was wondering about when you, when the time was up your saying either, "Your time is up"  or our time's up."  And certainly afterwards, and I think before too, but anyway, afterwards, you said, "Our time is up."  And it, I think, I don't remember now but somehow it seems to me that in the beginning of my coming here I said something about appreciating it when you didn't ask me a question when I was quiet and that you waited or that somehow I had given some reaction that caused you to (stumbles over word) to wait.  And then I appreciated that.  (Pause) Sometimes I think though, probably changes that I think occurred didn't occur at all but it's my, the way I'm feeling about it.  Because if I think about sa—, having said something, I can't remember having ever said anything.  (Pause) Or way back, I think there was a time when you did something, made a noise that made me think you were picking your nails.  And after I said something about it, I don't remember hearing the noise after that.  Maybe I just didn't notice it but it seemed that you had stopped something. (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, it just all comes from a feeling that I generally have, that what I like or I don't like doesn't really matter.  (Pause) And this feeling about myself is, just thinking about my art class, giving me a lot of trouble there.  Because so much of what we are doing there is based on what we as individuals like or don't like.  And I just, I don't know, it's almost, I can't even allow myself to know.  (Pause) In fact, it affects how I react toward just about anything and form opinions or the fact that I don't form opinions so much of the time.  Or if I do, I will hardly allow myself to realize that I do.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose then that takes me around to why I so often feel there's nothing I can say in conversations because either I don't have confidence in my opinions or else I haven't even allowed them to form.  And so much of what people talk about do seem to be just based on their opinions or reactions.  And it's only in, on the subject of education and that type of thing that I seem to really have opinions now.  And even there, with all the thinking I've done about it and all the experience I've had, I'm very uncertain and sort of feel, well, I really don't know that much yet.  And, or just not trusting the judgments that I do have.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

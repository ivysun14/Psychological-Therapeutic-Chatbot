<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, what's up?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I got [INAUDIBLE].  You probably already heard about it, it's somebody stold a computer out of the [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, no, I haven't heard of this yet. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think that's the one that I was supposed to done the, um, when they called and asked me to go work at district. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And do the rural route counts. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have a feeling that's the, probably the group that, well, what is our information, personal information doin on that computer? </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And how much, what's there?  Well, your name and address or Social Security? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> um hum. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I got one of these from something.  I mean, there's nothin you can do about it. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.  That was weird is I just had it.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Although, although, uh, the one, I never heard any more but the one that, uh, yknow, my information was on, they offered to pay some service for a year to protect your identity -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, really?  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Somehow or monitor for it. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, this is -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So I sent back, yeah, I'll take it.  But I never heard any more.  I guess they're doin it, so maybe -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I hope so. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They'll do that. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's [DEIDENTIFIED], though.  That's what happened at the [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Not surprising to us, is it?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not by this, well, what's weird is I just had identity theft done to me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You did?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> On my credit card, yes.  It's about -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe it's related.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The same time as this.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, maybe you should tell them that.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they said it was stolen on 16th of, my charges are November 12th and 14th. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it was for a Hertz rental car.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And some type of card thing. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe you should -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But they're -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Tell em. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I think I'm gonna have to and see if there's related at all. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Cause you -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Cause that's all I need.  But why, yknow -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Cause maybe it was discovered the 16th or the 20th for, so they received noticed on the 21st, that doesn't say it happened the 21st. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] all but -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your things.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it has the Social Security on that cause the, uh, I'm one of em that was in that, on that computer.  Why would I be on that computer to begin with?  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it says Social Security number and personal information.  But it's just weird that, thank goodness I look at my charges and everything because I went -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I never asked for this.  No.  I called immediately and I contacted my bank and they're watchin my account.  And -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  This -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't call the, I didn't know to call [DEIDENTIFIED] for anything.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.  I mean, you wouldn't. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And stuff.  But this thing I, I went now what?  But this one came from [DEIDENTIFIED].  That's what amazes me.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where were the charges, you remember?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, a Hertz rental car. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, here in [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, in [DEIDENTIFIED], huh.  Hm. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think this was here in [DEIDENTIFIED].  But they said, um, they can call and get it, more information on this, A S G.  But it's interesting because you go in the back and it gives you all the stuff, what to do for a free credit report and pull your credit report and contact the [DEIDENTIFIED] if you think.  And I had just gotten a credit report that says that my credit is excellent. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, maybe they'll, uh, contact em and say uh, say you got, yknow, somethin you can do, uh, to protect my identity here and - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they made this trip -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe they'll do what they did with me. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was through AAA.  It was, already have it. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Oh, you got that stuff now?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So I cancelled the card anyway, and I asked to renew, give me a new card.  They said it's gonna take two weeks to get it, then I get two cards. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Two, two different numbers, you mean?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, the -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Oh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Same number but two cards. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't need two cards, it's just me.  Yknow, I don't have anybody else charge on my cards, no. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I learned that the hard way.  And, um, cause the [DEIDENTIFIED]'s trying to, anybody who filed bankruptcy under the new law, when [DEIDENTIFIED] changed over to now the new [DEIDENTIFIED] credit union -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They're going back in their records of anyone they lo, took a loss on bankruptcy and they tried not to, um, they're tryin to get my money.  They're saying that it didn't get written off, there's nothing showing on my thing.  And they were trying, they wouldn't cash my Workman's Comp check or anything. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They're [INAUDIBLE]. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They wanted their money.  And I said no, you guys, that was fifteen years ago or more. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not.  No way. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So what did they say to that?  And they -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I end up havin to go to the head guy on, um, [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The boss, and tell him I want this straightened out, cause I was flagged. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's havin a bankruptcy -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Fifteen years. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they want their money now.  So they're going back to their old customers who used to have accounts with em. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They must -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they're collecting, tryin to collect on it. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they said there's some type of lukehole, they're gun, may be able to do it.  I said that's not, huh uh.  Once you file bankruptcy, that's it.  They're not supposed to come at you. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So that started the ball rollin, because I couldn't cash my check.  I couldn't put it in the bank. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In my own account.  So I said, okay -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you go to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Let's get this -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Another bank or -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Let's get this straightened out.  And he explained, he says plus there's, the letter I got was some attorney, and they say I owe three thousand and some dollars when it was only a thousand. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, cause the attorney put on two thousand for himself, probably. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I went over there and gave him, I said is this the attorney you use?  He goes, no. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I said then where did they get my information and what is this about?  So he kept the letter and, and, uh, I mean, I said I want my original back but you could make a copy. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I said I want you to contact this man, say I have nothin to do with that.  Just because I have account before when I first went in the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then I filed bankruptcy, they went back that far.  But they said under the new law they can go back and do it and try to collect.  So I warned [NAME OTHER], even though she's got a different -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, thing, don't be surprised.  And she hasn't received a letter like this.  I talked to her yesterday.  I just went, of course my stuff is on there.  Everybody knows who I am.  I'm the -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Considered a whistle blower. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, are ya?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think that's what it's about, cause they said why did you go to the union for everything?  Why'd you tell [NAME OTHER] everything?  Hey, he's there to, supposedly to protect me.  The union was supposed to protect our rights and they sold me out.  And the current union president really sold me out. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, this guy they got now, hm?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, they did a, put a new -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] somethin?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He's awful.  Hm. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He sold me out, totally, and, uh, that's why I was able, they were able to make me a clerk [INAUDIBLE].  I'm not getting the money I did as a [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I mean, that wasn't right. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I lost grade, everything.  My brother wants me to find out if under the Workmen's Comp still, uh, oh, [NAME OTHER] did finally send a letter to, uh, Department of Labor, like you filled out. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, good. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Finally.  But it was, I've never seen such a stupid letter in my whole life. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What'd it say?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing has changed.  Yes, we still treatin her for this, um, injury.  And it didn't say I couldn't go to work.  It didn't say I could go to work, it just said nothing has changed.  And I went and saw her yesterday, and I told her my neck is locking totally now.  And I said the headaches are gettin worse. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And when they lock, the pain shoots up the back of my head, the neck.  And the result is I can't turn my head.  She said, well that's, you know that's the disc and that's, that's to be expected.  You've got pretty, and he says, yknow, I got, um, degenerated disc disease. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she said you know it's gonna get worse.  But he put on there periodic injections.  They have an out.  Every time they tried to go for the injection, they won't approve it.  So I just have my morphine and the Avinza.  It's just the morphine and my Norflex -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now you're -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> For the spasms. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now you're takin, uh, the Effexor, right?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The Effexor. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 150, and the Ambien. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, okay.  You take Xanax much?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I still take my Xanax.  Um, this last script you had was only 2 a day instead of the 3, so I went down to the 2 a day. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you want for 3 a day?  That's, that's all right.  Well, you might need more sometimes?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'll just give you a new one. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, my brother is doin better about it but, about what's he's doin but at the same time, he, they're both dying to see me.  And they're shocked, work, at, uh, [NAME OTHER]'s office how much weight I've lost. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, good. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Cause I lost another four pounds. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Ooh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In a month. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Very good, during the holidays. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  I done, I did not cheat at all because I'm not gonna be a diabetic the rest of my life, if I don't have to.  It's down to 110 and 100 and even lower now so -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I did go to a hearing doctor because I'm finding.  I am having trouble with memory loss, um, where I can't, I can look at a word and I don't know what or I can say a word and go on the computer and try to type it and it won't come to me at all.  It just, like it's gone, totally wiped.  And there's times when, um, somebody, they ask me a date on something and I can't remember anything whatsoever.  They said, uh, the hearing guy says I have nerve damage in both ears now. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's that from?  Don't know?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's not sure.  He says it could be, possibly, I told him I had two blows to the head. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, he said it could be my depression medicine.  It could be my medicines I've been on for long term.  That might be cause, might cause it. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I never heard a that [INAUDIBLE]. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Me either.  That's why I just went huh?  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But he said you can go for now, cause people will call my name, even like in our, or say you're from this to there?  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't hear it. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He said my left ear is worse than my right.  My left side.  Well, that's where my neck catches too.  But he said I'm gonna need hearing aids in the near future, to really consider, to get more -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Get it -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Clarity. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In your head, yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I just told him, I'll hold off for a while.  I said, let me see how I'm doing and everything.  But I still have the ringing in my ears, which I figure that's probably one of the medicines I'm on.  And I notice I'm more, huh, you know how you, there's, have folders and they clip, the old folders?  I was in -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Paying my phone bill and checkin them because my phone bill keeps going higher and higher, but the viles keeps going chi, up.  And I'm supposed to be on ninety nine dollar plan, supposedly. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A hundred seventy one dollars. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What the hell is that, did they tell ya what?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, he says the ch, they charge you for everything and now there, there's state taxes or something on, all these taxes on everything in the world. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There are a lot of taxes on phones, yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it's ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's, yeah, I know. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, I got the TV, the Internet and the phone. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, so they probably tax each one. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yup. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> More than once, state and federal. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yup.  And I just went, I can't afford it.  Why does it keep going up?  I said, I've yet to have a ninety nine dollar bill. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But they don't tell you you got to pay for the boxes every month. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, they're thirteen bucks for the -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For the box. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> HD TV box. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we don't have that so, all right. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have the oth, regular -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No wonder -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Ones. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They want you to have it.  Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I have the regular ones, the smaller boxes in the bedroom, so I'm gonna take the one out of [NAME OTHER]'s room and put it in the, take, um, put it in the, um -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Main one. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Living room.  I've got one in the bedroom.  And, um, I just told em, I said, I can't afford the hundred and seventy one bucks, so they sai, gave me a number to call.  And I'm gun, the guy was supposed to taken it with him cause I can't lift that to go give it back to em.  They, I have to take it to em.  I said why, when there was a guy here?  Cause my Internet box went out. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All a sudden -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't have Internet.  I've lost, two phones already have blown up. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is Verizon or [NAME OTHER] or which?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Verizon. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Cause we have Verizon, yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Cause I've had them for years but, I mean, good grief. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, see, you're payin, I'm payin thirty nine ninety nine, which was nineteen ninety nine for the, uh, Internet, so it's gone up twenty bucks, cause it was for a year. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then but the whole plan thing -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Was for two years.  And it hasn't been two years and it, it's going up so high, it's unreal.  So I've got to get with them now.  I'm gonna complain to em and tell em you're gonna have to put me on a different program then. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Then I bought Norton, the new 2008 Internet, uh -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Protection, you mean?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yup. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Where it does all the suites and everything.  It does, has a firewall, has all of that.  They're payin -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we have that -. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Individually for it -. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now.  And [INAUDIBLE] -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you got to have that or you will get identity theft, yknow?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um hum.  Definitely.  Cause I don't need it.  Cause they said they believed mine was on the computer, possibly. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The charges were done on the computer.  Somebody hacked in and, that's what the guys, told me he thinks that's what might be, cause I said I haven't rented a ca, Hertz rental car in, I haven't rented a car.  Why do I need -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> To rent a car?  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Wherever, it could be that thing too. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, which would be in true if it is, then that shows that they rented a car to get out a town. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe, yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it could be whoever stold it.  It's possible. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  If they could, uh, the cops could go to that rental car and s, to find out who rented it -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's right. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That'd be good. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they u, I got a letter from the F I C A, the F I C, and they're investigating the claim itself because of, um, they took off, I, like I said, I, it was my AAA card of all cards. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hm. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I have still a balance on it. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A good size balance on it from before, from -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I had a guy sent his computer back, his laptop to, I think Hewlett Packard to fix, get it fixed, and somebody took all his information off of it while it was there. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Then they sent it back to him.   But then his, yknow, charges start appearin on his charge cards. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> See?  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll tell ya. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um hum. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I never put my, uh, credit card on the Internet, never.  I don't care what they say it's safe or, um -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll call em on the phone and do it. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Give it to em but -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Even that I don't trust. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I don't either. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Cause I hear a click every time.  So you know it's -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You are -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Givin it to somebody, yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's right.  Exactly.  And I just went -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is interesting.  I get credit theft.  This is the second time now, in the last, that's why I had to go to a P O Box cause they stole mail out of my boxes. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they caught, the postal inspector caught, it was three little kids and a parent.  He was settin the kids down the street, get the mail, and he was up the street waitin for em to come back. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And they caught him?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They caught him.  It took, I mean, they got, like, almost from my street, from the bank [DEIDENTIFIED] all the way out to almost the light.  Every one of those people were affected. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Including the apartments on [DEIDENTIFIED] and stuff. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, hm. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But he made a mint. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That man. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's why we watch anybody that comes down the street, cause I, I caught a guy in a, long hair on a bicycle that didn't belong on the street, and he was going to my neighbor's mailbox -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Lookin in it. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, jeez. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I said, excuse me, what are you doing here?  Who are you?  So I'm not afraid to confront. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What's [INAUDIBLE] cause she's 87 years old. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you don't touch a mailbox that don't belong to you.  I'm not stupid. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now we've been watchin cars comin down late at night cause we have quite a few houses that are empty on the block, and we're a cul de sac. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Dead end street.  And their windows are so dark, and it's unreal, so it's hard to see but you can get a tag number. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, see, my dog was, had been going nuts at one o'clock in the morning.  Somebody has been around or something has been around. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I heard feet running. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Then you're probably right. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And my dog was havin a fit so, yknow, of course I'm gonna go find out.  I have my large flashlight, metal flashlight that I could use.  I do have mace and I do have a gun -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's how that football player got killed, yknow?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's right.  I look out all the windows.  I make sure.  The first thing I do is I hit my flood lights on, on the outside.  Cause I don't keep em on all the time cause we have a -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I, I had a couple of them.  They didn't work real good. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, really.  So I'm gonna have to have that taken out, but at least it does come on and it does that side where the, the house that's not, what they were doin is breaking into the house.  There's windows busted in the back of it and I had, I went to my neighbor and cause they, we now have some of the neighbors that are work, walking late at night -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> On the block to make sure -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, good. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But there is, huh, one house on the block that he has a wrecker company, wrecker thing and he's got, I think he's into dr, heavy drugs or he's got a shop in back of his house, illegal shop. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hm. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Cars.  He's bringin these cars -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> To his home. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Chop shop, that's what that is. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's exactly what it is.  And I know there's, there's FBI or somebody that's up at the end of the street just sittin there, watching down the street. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, well they'll get em.  They take their time.  Yeah. </p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Belong there. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  And when he has a party, the whole street.  But he's also, he's not only doin that but I think he's doin drugs too because every car has, is so darkened with the windows, and they're all Mercedes, uh, BMWs, Ferraris. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hm. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They're cars that, and he only drives the, he has older cars. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I watch all these cars, him bringin em through the night, cause he speeds down there to his house. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you could hear it because the, yknow, the truck goes boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  Yknow, and there goes a new car on the bed -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, see, we have a body shop at the end of the street, and I know the guy comes me, picks up the metal.  It's an old black guy in the morning, real early in the morning.  The other day I was walking my street, that's how I've been losin the weight, and, uh, just walkin my block -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Itself, uh, besides havin to go to doctors, up and down stairs and all that stuff, but he was sound asleep, crashed out, waitin for them to open.  He was there, I guess about five, five thirty, cause I walkin around five, five thirty in the morning. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, God. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I couldn't sleep, so I walk. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know you lose weight [INAUDIBLE]. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh huh.  And I told him, I said, that's what I been doin.  But you see, I, we've got a handicap guy, um, he's got a little, parents in their eighties and stuff.  Uh, I don't know what his age mentally is but he is so in love with me, it's unreal. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, God. </p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's because his parents go.  Well, I notice his parents take off and go to the legion on the weekends. </p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, a lot of—basically what we talked about on Monday is even less conceptually creative (ph) in my mind than it was then, and so it's kind of fuzzy—gotten a little more fuzzy, so I just, like, feel bad just to, you know, quit (ph). (laughs). But I feel (inaudible at 00:22) talking about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does the fuzziness relate to feeling bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, just—I've been feeling badly about myself and things have kind of taken a down-turn (ph). Like, this was, like, yesterday. I had a hard time getting going this morning. But it's not like there's new information or new stuff, I just feel —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, James and I have been talking, and he's still really hurt and pretty clear about that. And we kind of talked about (inaudible at 01:09). But (pause), you know, I think we're OK. [00:01:22]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I feel like what—in some ways I think that what we're talking about on Monday, in terms of my being really anxious about therapy itself and how this is working, and what is happening and, you know, who you are and what you are doing in this. It's part—and maybe not the largest part of a larger anxiety about how do I talk to people, how do I trust in reality—but that's the point that we can get to. So (laughs) [my answer's like] (ph) yeah, let's talk about that. I do want to know. I don't know. [00:02:32]</p>

<p>I mean, a lot of my anxiety is just that in the last few days, everything I do or say or think, I second guess. Like, am I really doing this for the reasons that I think I am, or is something else going on? And that's just exhausting. (laughs). And then I second guess this, I think a thing and it's, like—this is why I find the post-modern literature irritating. (laughs). But, I can't get out of it. It (pause)—It feels like it would be deeply wrong to try to—not to try to understand. If that makes sense. [00:03:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it would feel deeply wrong not to try and understand —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Myself, yeah. And, you know, people in general, I guess.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want me to go over some of what we were talking about [last week] (ph)? [00:04:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, please. I was actually to going to ask you that. Again, I wanted to ask you, but I don't know if that's what I'm supposed to do or if I'm allowed to. I feel like, I'm—you are not trying to make things mysterious—I realize this, because you have told me. Which doesn't mean that I don't make things mysterious for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Why do you feel] (ph) like I'm trying to make things (inaudible at 05:06). (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, maybe.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>Can I try transference?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I—I remember, I was sort of trying to think of how, like, the best way to (pause) go at that. [00:05:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, this is what you're saying. So, when I ask you a question that has to do with psychology, you do that, you pause, and you really frame—think about how you're going to frame your answer very carefully. Which, to me, implies that it would not be beneficial for me to just go away and read a whole lot about psychology. But I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. So, the reason I am pausing and thinking carefully as how to frame things is not because I'm worried I'm going to tell you more than I should. Or that I'm going to tell you something that is going to be bad in some way. It's because I'm trying to find a way to pull together something that is a bit didactic, that will, you know, give you something to hang on to about how this works, that are kind of, you know, intellectual or conceptual, that will—I'm trying to figure out how to pull something like that together with what's actually going on here between here, like, what the issues are as I understand, that are in play. Like, I think what I'm going to proceed to say is something in conceptual about what sort of transference is like, and then something hopefully—that illustrates that with what is going on here now. Because... [00:07:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I understand that conceptually much better than I can see it between us. I mean, I can see aspects of it, but it's hard for me to kind of (inaudible at 07:59).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, well that's a lot of what there is to do in this sort of treatment. And also is why I feel like it's sort of important to tie the conceptual part into the sort of —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Experiential?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, like live issues right now in part. So, I think I was going on on Monday about, like, projection and projective identification in part because you sort of alluded to both, and I think they're related, but not quite the same thing. And, I mean, so (pause) they're both forms of production, which is to say attributing some quality to somebody else—maybe it's an emotion, maybe it's a judgment, maybe it's some other aspect of their character—for reasons that really have more to do with you. [00:09:12]</p>

<p>So, (inaudible at 09:14) example I gave is like sometimes when a little kid is, you know, really angry, they feel like you're really angry too. You know, like, you sent them to their room and they're furious, and they think that's you're really furious, and they're scared of you because you're so mad, but really they're the one who's mad. They're just—like, it's just all flying around in their head. I mean, that's sort of one example (inaudible at 09:39). </p>

<p>You know, another one is—this is probably familiar to most of us—is, like, I know you're generally comfortable giving your writing to people, but I imagine there are times when you have a whole list of criticisms you think the person will have of what you've written. That clearly has at least as much to do with what you think of what you wrote as what they will actually really think. I'm not saying you—[00:10:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tend to not to give my writing to people until it's in its close-to-polished form. Because I get really irritated when they catch things that I already would have caught. Like, I know better. (laughs). But (inaudible at 10:18).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, my point is sort of like, the way you make the list of—this is more like, you write something, you give it to somebody, you know they're going to give it back to you the next day. In the interim you think, "Oh, they're going to think this is wrong, this is wrong, this is right, and that is wrong, and overall this is crummy. And probably because I'm lazy. And probably that because I really should have, you know, spent those two hours that I spent watching the movie writing this." </p>

<p>And, you know, so you kind of imagine this sort of critical, probably punitive, response from them. Which of course turns out to be nothing like what you get. So, you know, to the extent that you really give that over to them as projection. Because you've done this a bunch of times. You sort of, like, realize you're anticipating that response, and you feel like, "OK, but I know that so-and-so really isn't going to do that." But, you know, part of, like, maybe when you were younger, or maybe with some parts of it, it's harder to know who your—what belongs to whom. Do you know what I mean? [00:11:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely understand that. the distinguishing between which dimensions are yours and which dimensions you're attributing to other people. And which dimensions are actually other people's. And kind of growing into a greater understanding of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So to the extent that you're making a mistake about who's or what's—like, about what emotions or whose you're projecting. See what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. And another example would be —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got it, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 12:09) example of that. This is all a projection. Now, one form of projection is called "projective identification." And that (pause)—think I have to (inaudible at 12:34) projection first. Projections always have to do with kind of trying to manage feelings that are difficult to manage. Like, the act of unconsciously giving over a judgment or feeling, or an attribute to somebody else is always a way of trying to manage something that's difficult to manage. Like, with the angry kid who's being sent to her room. It's sort of obvious, you know. Or with the self-critical student, that paper that they're waiting for a response about. Like, I guess that's also kind of clear. [00:13:25]</p>

<p>So other kinds of projections that are actually pretty different are projections where you demean somebody else. You know, like, thinking very critically or harshly, or whatever, about somebody because they're pathetic in this way or that way or the other way, when in fact, there's something about them that's like something about you that you don't like either. So you kind of criticize and condemn, that's another (inaudible at 13:53).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I recognize that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, but I guess that the additional (ph) part that I'm trying to make now is the part that is a form of coping, or a form of defense—those are the same thing, really. Where there's some feeling that is very difficult to manage, and so it's being managed unconsciously in this way. You know sometimes you can become conscious of what you're doing, but the mechanism itself isn't unconscious. Even if you know you're anticipating a more critical response from somebody than you will get, the fact that you're doing that in the first place is not something that you consciously decided to do. Does that make sense? [00:14:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That says that even if you kind of track down, or come to realize the projection that you're creating, it doesn't necessarily make the projection go away. It's still—I mean, then I guess maybe a separate issue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but it's related (inaudible at 14:47).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I find that it doesn't make it go away. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 14:52) the fact that you didn't consciously decide to project it there in the first place. That was an unconscious maneuver. (inaudible at 15:00)? (inaudible at 15:04), you're actually suddenly pulling somebody—you're actually doing something to the other person, to get them to act out the role that you've assigned to them. So, you know, sometimes people who are arrogant can make the people around them feel just sort of small and crummy about themselves. And, you know, sometimes it can be subtle. You realize you always leave interaction with somebody feeling shitty about yourself in some way. And, like, it has something to do with the way that—they're not just projecting a demeaned version of you onto you. They're not just seeing you as less than you are, but they're sort of treating you that way. [00:15:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In a way that makes you feel as though you are that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I think I see what you mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It can be very subtle, and it can be very, very powerful, where (pause) (inaudible at 16:16) clear how it can work. Like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is similar to or, you know, encompassed—or does it encompass the ways that, like, families will often, you know, assign a role to each member of the family? And then each person will kind of reinforce that role being played?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like—yeah, I would say the heart of it is really what each person is kind of made to feel, even more so that what they are led to act out. [00:16:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I mean in my mother's family, her younger—her second younger—you know, there were four kids, she was the second oldest—the third was a sister, who was kind of assigned the role of the fat, stupid one in the family, by their mother. And I, you know, I think she spent of her life thinking she was fat and stupid, you know. And it's—she's a counselor. (laughs). I think she's got a good life, but she's still a little (inaudible at 17:34) (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and you can see how, you know, maybe she was less intelligent than her siblings, and maybe she wasn't. You know, it could just be that for some reason it was important that she was seen that way. [00:17:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was really important to my grandmother that she have that role. Something, and I don't really understand what's going on (inaudible at 18:02).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, and then clearly, when it gets to the point that it really becomes something, like a deeply held belief she holds deeply about herself, because she was treated as that, particularly if it wasn't true. Yeah, that's like the same thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it definitely wasn't true. I mean, she's not like all of the siblings, you know, very, very smart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So yeah, that would be an example. So that brings me to sort of ongoing developmentally (ph), which is like what you're referring to. It also operates at much shorter time scales, like interaction with somebody, where they're kind of getting you to feel a certain way, often without your realizing that they're doing it. That's sort of the tricky part of it, like—[00:18:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I notice this most—I don't know if this—it counts, but, like, that feeling of, this person made me feel this way and I didn't realize how it was happening—what I read in magazines. I always, like, I don't read woman magazines anymore. I haven't for, like, five or six years, because I realize I always feel about myself after putting the magazine down. And, clearly, they're just—that's what they're trying to do. (laughs) Just, like, you would feel like crap. This is stupid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's—that could be one example. And so, usually—(inaudible at 19:36) magazines—with other things, that's actually—usually points towards—it's projection in general relates to trying to manage feelings, (inaudible at 19:48). That sort of thing, like ramification, relates to trying to manage feelings that are usually more primitive and more difficult to manage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean by primitive? It came up in a lot of the (inaudible at 20:04).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. It's not a very good word. But what I mean is, like, more less-organized, usually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Less close to the surface? [00:20:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Less close to the surface, sort of. I mean, it can erupt, but it can dwell less close to the surface. Or, with, like with a contact (inaudible at 20:30) that way. Like, (pause) the thing really sets you off, to the point where you really have no clue why, but it really sets you off—that's more primitive. The thing where somebody does something and, you know, you kind of overreact, you're (inaudible at 20:51) but you're pretty sure you have at least some clue what it's about, or you would have expected it, or it's not way, way out of proportion. That's less primitive. Fixing where somebody—where it's, like, surprising, way over the top. (pause) Very difficult to have any kind of (inaudible at 21:13) understanding, that's more primitive. [00:21:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay thanks. I just—I (inaudible at 21:17) different meanings of different contacts (ph). That's why I asked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, and transference is a word that's used potentially to refer to a patient's projections and predicament (inaudible at 21:36) over the course of treatment. I mean, it can sort of be applied more loosely than that, but that's kind of what it means. And those can be things that are sort of more ongoing, such as your worrying about hurting me, which I think is kind of an ongoing worry that you have. Or things that, you know, come and go in the course of a few minutes as we're talking about a particular thing. Like, (pause) I don't know. You know, yeah. [00:22:26]</p>

<p>Yeah, and these are (pause)—you know, transference is something that's kind of like the proverbial (sp?) elephant with, like, the tail and the leg. Like, it can be looked at from all, you know, (inaudible at 23:00). it can be viewed in all different sorts of ways. Like, people talk about transference as, you know, reveal it as—sort of relate it to historical patterns, like, these sorts of projections and (inaudible at 23:18) develop, you know, early in life, generally. And —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's (inaudible at 23:25) that I was like, "I'm not sure about that." (laughs). That's just me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, your aunt, if, you know, she were in therapy and she sort of kept having the feeling that her therapist thought she was stupid and fat, and kind of critical of her in that way. Like, you know, you can kind of see how that would relate to, you know, with always trying to show, like, how smart. Like, I would probably come at it like, "She's trying to show how smart she is. Or she seems kind of silent and withdrawn." Or something like that. And you determine over time that it's really because she always felt the therapist saw her as this way. Oh, look where that came from. [00:24:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And to be clear, I don't think that that doesn't happen. I just—there are several opinions voiced that that's the main aspect of it, like, that's really what is going on always. You know, it all goes back to your childhood. I just don't know—I don't know. (inaudible at 24:22). (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, there's also that—as in the transference of the sort of primary point of urgent (ph) treatment—you know, in as much as it relates to feelings. Any way of managing difficult feelings in the moment, when (pause). It felt like when it emerges it's always going on, but when it comes clear of how it's emerging, it points back to, you know, troubling feelings that are somewhere out of awareness. You know, they tend to be talked about. So, like, (pause) you're always trying to show me how smart you are. Like, what's (inaudible at 25:21).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 25:21). (laughs) Well, I feel like I do that, but I feel like I do that with everybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And some of these are sort of transferences (ph) sort of sink our relationships into therapy, and some are, you know, (inaudible at 25:38) necessarily more or less. So, there's the kind of habits that point to something important-in-the-moment aspect, there's the habits that point to something-historical aspect (pause). [00:25:59]</p>

<p>I mean, counter-transference refers to the sort of complimentary projection potentially on my part, and (pause) it's sort of like increasingly over the last couple of decades especially. Therapists and analysts are using the feelings stirred up in (inaudible at 26:38) sort of patients to determine what's going on with patient's home (ph). Like, I noticed I was feeling this way. Was that me, or was that the patient making me feel this way? If the patient made me feel this way, why would it make me feel this way? You know, what's being projected? Like, why would he treat it like that? What does it have to do with how can I bring it up in a way that (inaudible at 26:56).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how you feel, like, about—what you think about that, but this seems like it could be really useful to me, but it seems like it could really depend on the self-awareness, the (inaudible at 27:08) to the therapist. But, you know, every tool is a tool. [00:27:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So, I mean, it's subject to the ambiguity that (pause) any kind of interpretation in this social setting, or probably literary (ph) setting. It's subject to, you know. But, anyway, so, like, that's my spiel about (inaudible at 27:52) patient and transference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really helpful, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are other sources of data in a treatment. You know, like, A (inaudible at 28:14) transference, and B. Transference and inter-(inaudible at 28:21) transference doesn't carry the whole treatment, but it's a very important of it. So, yeah, that's kind of an active thing. And (pause) this sort of transference is felt, like, not necessarily in terms of a specific projection of a particular feeling, or judgment, or something. But more like kind of an air in the room. [00:29:06]</p>

<p>Like, you're worried about asking me questions about this works, or maybe other things. I think related to worry that's often in the air in here, to do with your not wanting to pull me into doing something wrong. Or well, in some combination, you're just not wanting to do something wrong, and you're not wanting to pull me into doing something wrong. And it's often (inaudible at 29:44) like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes sense. Because I both want more control over other people's actions, and less control, you know—I don't know. I feel like if I pulled you into doing something wrong that would be on me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I (inaudible at 30:10).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think you are also (pause)—I think you're terrified of your own destructiveness. And I think that seems to me to be why you work (ph) (pause)—are really afraid to know—like, to not know how this works, or to consider what you may do unconsciously, or to catch yourself as I guess you did, or we did, last week. Kind of rationalizing something to yourself a bit. I'm thinking about, you know what I mean —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pulling away, yeah. [00:31:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, I think that that was really disturbing because you caught yourself fooling yourself in a way that led you to act that felt very destructive to you. I'm not saying it was destructive, I'm saying anything (ph) that felt destructive to you. And the idea that you could do that and not let yourself know it, and in that way be out of control of it, I think that really terrifies you. So, (pause) and I think all of this, (pause) seems to me to point—I mean, what we were talking about before —towards like this feeling of fragility about other people and our relationships. That you're really anxious about and working really hard to sort of protect or [shore up in a sense or way] (ph). And, you know, those are transcentual (sp?). [00:32:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying, you know, you could never do harm or that you're completely being a weasel in every way, but I think that—I think there's a feeling about the fragility or dangerousness of a lot of this stuff that comes from you. And, yeah, I mean also—so I guess something I can say to that is that (pause) the most immediate example is your worry about asking me questions about how this works, or what you don't understand about it. Because you're really in a pickle. Because on one hand you're worried about asking me, because that might be the wrong thing to do. On the other hand, you're worried that if you don't know you're going to do something wrong. And you're kind of posed (ph) that way too, so that's a pickle. [00:34:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And again, I would think those relate to transference in that, at least (pause) the notion that there are things that are more right and more wrong, and the stakes from those, I think come from you. I'm not aware that I've labeled that or implied (inaudible at 35:05).
CLIENT: No, you're good at that. Well, when I say "good at that," I mean, I've noticed that you're very careful about that. That's way less complicated than I thought it was going to be. (laughs). Yeah, maybe. [00:35:34]</p>

<p>I just don't know. You know, most of what you describe is—I mean, much of it is stuff that we've kind of talked about, and much of it stuff that I, you know, like, I know I'm doing it. Or I know this is how I can kind of how I can catch myself, but it doesn't go away. You know, I have—like, I get really anxious before our sessions—not every time, but a lot of days. I don't know why, but I do. [00:36:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's probably very large of amount of this about you that we really don't know much about yet. We're quite early in this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, that's good to know. I don't—yeah, that's another—I don't know. You said several years-ish. I don't know what that looks like. I've never [done this] (ph) before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yeah, I know that (inaudible at 37:24).</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're much further along than any therapist or therapeutic relationship that I have ever been in. But it seems like those are, you know, psychotherapy is trying to do something slightly different. But the best thing I can think of, or the thing that it seems like it might mischaracterize it is—tell me if I'm right—it's kind of changing the symptoms, versus changing the underlying dynamics?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is what I want, but it's also very scary for me because then, you know, who am I going to be at the end of this? [00:38:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's always, always somebody that—one of you (ph) that hits you with the too scared, too scarred (ph), too something to be enough, for the (inaudible at 38:34).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, I mean for me, for better or for worse, like, moral questions aren't the questions in some ways. So, I mean, am I going to be a good person? That matters to me. [00:39:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that it's probably—I don't think that's actually a reasonable fear, I really don't. I don't know almost any people that I think are bad people, I really don't. Everybody, if you look at them hard enough, they're a really good person. But, not me. (laughs). But I do know lots of happy people who do lots of really, really shady things. And I don't want to be that. [00:40:20]</p>

<p>The other thing that comes to mind is that I was reading an interview with Lev Grossman (sp?), who's the critic and writer. His first novel I hated, his second novel I really like it. (inaudible at 40:48) I probably told you about it. So I was interested in that in this interview is that the question was about magic as a metaphor for creativity, or a link between creativity and depression. And so, it's basically saying, like, (inaudible at 41:11) are, like, all creative people are depressed. And he was kind of, like, "Ah, not really. But when I wrote my first novel, I was really, really depressed, and I used to worry that if I felt better, I wouldn't be able to write anymore." [00:41:28]</p>

<p>And I thought that, well, first of all, I've had the same worry. I mean, I stopped theater in some ways because in order to be acting well I had to tap into emotions that made me really unhappy. Like, I did my best job when I was a mess. (laughs). I was like, this isn't good for me. That was hard, you know. If had been better, I don't know that I would've stopped. But that's kind of [media predicament] (ph). [00:42:13]</p>

<p>But also that—just that I thought his second novel was so much better. And I find that I both write better when I'm happy, but I also—I lose touch with things when I'm happy. You know, I forget what it's like to be unhappy. That's all I ever (inaudible at 42:38). I'm less sympathetic when I am happy. I'm feeling as if I have less capacity for empathy, and I really don't want that.

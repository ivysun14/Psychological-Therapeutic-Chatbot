<p><b>DR:</b> So is [NAME OTHER] a girl?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Two boys.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Twins.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Remember you told us about your son?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] two boys.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I had forgotten.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.  They're little [NAME OTHER], what are you going to do?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got names?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He named baby A and I named baby B.  He named his [NAME OTHER] because his name is a duck hunter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I named mine [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now what's [NAME OTHER] got to do with duck hunting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's a, that's a [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  [NAME OTHER] what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She picked the middle name out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [NAME OTHER] after, [NAME OTHER]'s after his daddy and [NAME OTHER] is my daddy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's sweet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we're going to have a section?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Actually, they're -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Baby B, [NAME OTHER], he's been breach the whole pregnancy, but last week he flipped over -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Now they're both head down.  So they're saying that I could do it the natural way, so he'll get to cut the cords and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's neat.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So as long as they stay both head down between now and next Tuesday -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So A is already engaged?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah, he [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, he's been engaged the whole time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He's been engaged.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is awesome.  One week.  Your mother is going to be beside herself, you know that, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's freaking out already.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we just found out [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm surprised she didn't call you and tell you.  She's probably called everybody.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So tell me, how far do you live away from where they are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Uh, you mean from mom and dad?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right across the pasture.  I live at the bottom and they live across two cow pastures.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that going to be okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's fine with me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].  Yeah, we, they, they pretty much respect us -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> As far as -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They give us our privacy.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  At first they didn't, but they're doing better now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're getting all your stuff?  Your cribs and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stroller and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we got everything.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We got everything coming out -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Of our ears.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The clothes, I mean -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Everybody's been really, really good to us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whole room's just filled to the top.  Everybody's got -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Diapers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A bunch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get lots of diapers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'd be surprised how many two babies are going to go through.  It's, it's -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's ridiculous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe about, I guess about what, six a day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Serious?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Many more than that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You're going to have lots of practice changing diapers with me, honey.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot more than that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hmm, I didn't know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was trying to be funny.  I thought -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We're going to [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe four, you know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].  We're going to do nothing but change diapers for -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> A long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's scary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They don't like being wet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And they'll let you know it too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  You look good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm real happy for you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, I'm happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean you really don't look like you're dragging like you would expect.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hum-um.  I've had a really good pregnancy.  I could not have asked for a better pregnancy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you'll just have to keep this up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].  He's been real good to me.  He's been waiting on me hand and foot.  I couldn't have asked for a better husband through all this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You said that before.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's, he's maintained, huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He is really impressed me and then [NAME OTHER]'s been helping me too a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> His, while he's at work there's days [NAME OTHER] comes, 'cause I'm on bed rest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And [NAME OTHER] comes in and out and checking on me, making sure I got everything I need and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your mood been?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have?  You've been not getting sad?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh, huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?  Or worried or scared or -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Excited and nervous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't wait for them to get here, but I don't know what I'm going to do with them once they get here.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  First time moms always kind of feel a little bit overwhelmed and I can't imagine with twins.  Uh -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That must be -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think I know in the back of my mind everything's going to be okay 'cause we've got everybody to help us basically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  No one will know these children better than you.  Trust your instincts I will tell you that 'cause you'll have lots of people that are going to give you advice 'cause I'm sure they already have -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> During your pregnancy.  Do this and do that and -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Seriously.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and then you just say, thank you for the advice.  You don't have to say you'll take it or not or argue with them.  Say thank you.  You know it's kind of like when some, if you're feeling, uh, I don't know not particularly, uh, beautiful and somebody tells you that you are pure beautiful, you just say thank you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't argue with them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  So trust yourself.  Trust your instincts.  If you have doubt, ask him, but don't be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She'll come around.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just don't let the, uh, the other adults around you put a lot of doubt in your head.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, and they're going to try, see I want to breastfeed and everybody's trying to talk me out of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know what that's about.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They did try to do that with my, uh,  daughter in law too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even her father is still doing it.  The, the babies were born in July and are healthy as all get out and he still has this idea that the girl because she's smaller and was in the beginning, but, you know, gaining weight just fine.  Pediatrician and everybody, everybody's happy.  He says, oh, I can hardly wait 'til they get her on the bottle; we can put some weight on her.  I thought -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  It was so weird.  You know, the breast milk's the healthiest thing for the babies and they've not -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.  [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Been sick once.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> A half a pound bigger than the other one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> One's right at six pounds now and one's about a half a pound smaller.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So breastfeed.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can do that.  Get, where are you delivering at?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, now they have -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> The same man that delivered [NAME OTHER] is delivering our boys.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who's that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So they have, uh, um, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] there.  Have you met him?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, I don't, I think I just want, I just want [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  They have, uh, also have, uh, breastfeeding people that are specialists.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> The lactation -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Specialists, yeah.  So -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I am interested in that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So get that person to work with you when you're out there and get a, have them get you a good pump 'cause you'll need that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What kind of bottles did, do they usually [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Doctor Brown's or the Playtex?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have to get the ones without that stupid chemical in it, you know, about that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, they were saying that the glass, or glass bottles are really good to use too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can use that.  You know, whatever.  It doesn't have, they've got a bunch of bottles out now that don't have the chemical in them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What kind of, what do you mean chemicals?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Doctor Brown's bottles are good.  They, a lot of bottles have chemicals in them that aren't good for babies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Why do they make them then?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, why do they make cigarettes then?  [LAUGHING].  You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 'Cause they can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 'Cause they can.  [LAUGHING].  Because they can I guess.  'Cause they, you know, it's just a matter of time before all the cars got seatbelts kind of looking back.  That sort of thing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All cars don't have airbags still.  That, that stuff.  So, but, yeah, they do that.  But have them work with you and, and make sure you got their phone number after you leave so you can call because, uh, you want to talk to somebody that's not going to discourage you because it's hard enough.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard enough because you're going, going to feel my babies are going to starve because your milk doesn't come in the first day.  It takes a while.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's what I'm worried about.  Making sure that I can produce enough for the babies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you will.  You will.  You will.  You could have four babies and you would have enough milk because your body will -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And as long as I pump, he can still help me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.  Your body will, and, and it's, and it's pretty cool too.  You can have breast milk and other people can feed the babies and then they'll shut up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yep, yep, I think that's probably most, mostly why a lot of people don't want me to breastfeed 'cause they want to help so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But you're going to have a lot of people around and that's even more reason to breastfeed because they're immunity will be better -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, you don't, you know, have lots of, uh, wash, hand washed stuff too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have, set it all around your house.  So -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What the heck, [NAME OTHER] 'cause we got a lot of things to think about [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nobody touches the baby without it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anybody sick, they don't come in the house.  Anybody smoking they don't come in the house.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We, we already put a stop to the smoking [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right?  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to stop too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.  You should have seen him telling his parents, they can't smoke in my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She told my daddy -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He can't smoke in the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and, and really you're not even going to want to smoke in, uh, you know, right before they have the babies 'cause, uh -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't want your babies to have problems.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Yeah, so you'll have some challenging times, but you guys will be up for it.  You just don't lose it, okay?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But he's got lots of energy too.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just don't lose it.  Don't just get yourself all frustrated and you get these babies start crying and they won't be soothed for anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's nature.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they have a, babies have a certain, uh, um, decibel and a certain cry a certain, uh, way that it irritates you 'cause that, 'cause that's nature too so that you'll address their needs.  You know if it was a soothing kind of cry, you'd just ignore it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that, that's the way it does that.  So don't take it personal, just ignore it.  Get some headphones; go outside and scream.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's good advice.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You're going to need to get that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Headset.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got one of those little bed things you're going to sit beside your bed?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> His mama got it for -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Mama got it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Him.  It's a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a video.  It's like a video and a sound.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So you can see them and hear them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, monitor.  I mean a little bed.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, a bassinet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, bassinet, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean one of those little things you set beside your bed though -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That you can just leave, can lay them there?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We got a pack and play or [INAUDIBLE] playpen type thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we got a bassinet -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And we got a bassinet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That sits, you know, sits up high about this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you want one that she can stay in bed and take the baby like this.  Try not to get out of bed.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We have a bassinet that's, that's taller for him.  We'll get it figured out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Babies don't mind what they sleep in.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is why this last week my, my son was up with his twins and for some reason they don't want to be in the same crib now and they've only got one crib because they were in the same crib for the longest time.  They liked that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] both sleep in the same bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they liked that, but now they don't.  Um -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> How old are they?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, they were born in July.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE] now.  So we put one in a laundry basket, you know?  It works.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> My, uh, granny whenever my sister was a baby, the only way she could get [NAME OTHER] to go to sleep was to put her in a dresser drawer -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's the only way she'd go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's safe.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's smart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's pretty safe.  Yep, pretty safe.  The, the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Whatever works.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yep, and we'll figure out what works and what don't work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But trust your instincts.  Believe me nobody will know these children better than you.  Their stem cells, I don't know if I told you this last time.  You know stem cells are the original cells that we all have that are capable of turning into any other cell, you know, with, you know, your, um, babies when they're real little, you know, they have a stem cell that could turn into an eye cell, it could turn into a heart cell.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's the cord blood, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  'Cause you'll find a lot of in cord blood and those stem cells, um, from the baby are in you and they'll be there for decades.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's pretty weird.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's pretty cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Did they save their baby's, um, cord blood, did they bag the cord blood?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum-um.  I don't think, think so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.  We thought about it, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a lot of money.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's really expensive [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It really is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could donate it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's probably a good thing to do because if it costs you anything -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'd donate it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we thought about that, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Could help somebody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When they did.  Yeah, they're very expensive to do.  I'm not, uh, sure it's, what to do with that.  That, like I don't know what I'd do if I was having my kids these days, but it's nice you have options.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So when you're insecure talk to him.  You're going to feel like you can't do it.  You're going to feel like, uh, I'm a terrible mom and doing a terrible job; my kids are starving.  But they're not going to starve.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] stopping -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Turn around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They do lose weight at first.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, that's what, uh, somebody talked about the first couple of weeks they're going to lose weight and then they'll gain it back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  If they, if they gain their birth weight back by seven, ten days, that's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's pretty good, but they'll be weighing them all the time.  Your doctor will do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you've read some twin books?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.  Every twin, ever, everything probably you can read.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He picks on me 'cause that's all I ever do.  I'm just trying to get it all in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Knowledge.  But trust your instincts and get your rest, that's important.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I have been sleeping they put me on a, some, I've been having Braxton Hicks contractions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> They put me on medicine to stop that and that medicine makes me sleep -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Too much.  I can definitely -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Get my rest in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.  How's he doing?  Your biggest baby?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He's doing really good.  Um, we were going to try to get him off of all those medicines -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But we got him down to 1 Lamictal in the morning and 1 Lamictal at night -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And he's doing really good on that and he's scared to step down on the morphine [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 'Cause I felt better when I stepped down.  You know you told me to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Step down and I didn't want to go down no more.  I like being, I like feeling like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] it's a lot more energetic, ain't I?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For some reason.  I don't -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And he's happy and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Know why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's because you don't have the other medicine.  You still have it around if you need it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if you start getting yourself agitated or upset and irritable and moody, you can't sleep, take 1 or 2.  You know, the side effects is just tiredness.  Are you sleeping decent right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it really them don't kick in as fast -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As they should.  Now I'm not getting much sleep.  I don't go to bed until 12:30, 1:00 every night now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, take the Xanax to sleep then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> One Lamictal, 1 Xanax [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One Lamictal and 1 Rozerem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the Zyrtec.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  The other, other option would be 2 Rozerem instead of the Xanax.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two Rozerem?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What time, you think?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Would he be able to wake up in the morning?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He wakes up 5:00 in the morning [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wake up at 5:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it doesn't last that long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They don't last?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not like Remeron.  Remeron will last -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no.  No, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Rozerem just helps you go to sleep but it wears off real fast, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It doesn't wear off that fast.  It should last through the, most of the night in case you wake up during the night, but, uh, I've never had anybody tell me they had a hangover from it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not the kind of drug that people take, you know, you could take some of those drugs, uh, in an abusive way to get high and kind of stuff, but Rozerem doesn't work like that.  People that abuse drugs can take Rozerem.  They don't get a buzz off of it.  It's not -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not going to hurt me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Take it forever.  [INAUDIBLE] few of the Lamictal twice a day maybe for another 10 years or so.  Don't be stopping it though without talking to me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I need, I need a refill on the Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  'Cause that's a really good drug.  I mean it's good for depression, it helps with anxiety, and helps keep your mood even.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's helped him a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I'll get upset still, but -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, but you don't feel bad any more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sometimes get upset?  Of course you do, you're human.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And when there's, uh, you know, and I say I know it's exciting with the babies coming, but it's going to be stressful for you next week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you're going to be kind of, um, out in the wings and they'll update you as much as you need to be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] asked me to get on a schedule.  Try to get -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The babies on a schedule.  That's like number one important thing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, really running, running your house really, really rigid.  You know, this, well, I wish you all, you all the best and you've got your medicine.  I've refilled them here for you and we'll see you next time.  And get your sleep after the babies come home 'cause if you don't, you get mastitis, you get sick, and then you can't, then you can't breastfeed so much.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's when you get mastitis when you get rundown and tired.  So make sure you get your rest and you'll just have to tell other people that, look, this is our house, our babies, we're going to do it our way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We can [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep, laying down that rule.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think if you, your mother would back you up on that for sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> All right.  If we're, if, if we, if we tell her that's how we want to do it and that's how it's going to be, then she -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Respects, she respects it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's important 'cause you could tell her otherwise its', it's going to cause a lot of problems between the two of you and between you and her and them and whoever and -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I think it's hard for her but she does understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think she understands and she respects us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And she'll be actively involved anyway.  She'll get to see these babies a lot.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, that's true.  She's so excited and his niece or our niece, [NAME OTHER], um, his sister's daughter, oh, my goodness, she cannot wait for these babies to come.  She's [AGE] and she is so excited.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  She, she calls me tata and she says tata your belly's getting so big.  She's too funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can't believe how well you look though.  You look very good though -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For being this far along.  You got a lot of indigestion?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Lately the past month, it has been unreal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hurting.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I guess 'cause they're getting so much bigger and they're starting to push up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> See I can't hardly eat anything without getting indigestion.  So I'm taking Prilosec everyday and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] but I still have my problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.  That's awesome.  I'm excited for you.  You'll have to let me know how things go.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know.  I like babies a lot.  You might have to leave them for a while.  You can bring them by here.  I look forward to seeing though.  You okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you friends telling you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Most of our friends don't really have a whole lot to do with us anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't they?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think it's 'cause he's done a lot of growing up and they haven't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Time for new friends?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We've had, we have had some [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He worked a lot more hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been working a lot more hours.  I'm tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you and your uncle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think he has more respect for you now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I yell at him a lot sometimes when he yells at me.  I yell back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He's finally starting to stand up -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> For himself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then we fight after that.  He goes back in the office and I go my way and 10 minutes later, what's going on, you know?  Hey, how you doing?  It's weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think those days that, uh, you came back here to see me this last time are gone.  You know, you're losing it and having meltdowns 'cause you realized that you're a dad and you've got to be setting examples.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  Yep, yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you guys are going okay money wise?  You're not out buying a bunch of toys there?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It is funny that he's managing his bank account or our bank account and monitoring all the money that in, that comes in and goes out and doesn't spend really on hardly anything except for gas and food and I mean you, you'd be surprised.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't like doing that no more.  I used -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, about 6:30 or if I take it after I get to work about 7:30.  No matter what time like if I take it at 6:30, about 9:00 to 9:30 I get sleepy.  I don't know why.  But I if take it like 7:30, about 10:00, 10:15 I start getting sleepy and I'm working hard to getting sleepy -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the 17th interview. Seventeenth interview. Side one. Track two. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I fell asleep downstairs. That was the story.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Chuckles) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whatever it was. Ten minutes. It was terrific. (Chuckles) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She said you called me. I wasn't here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I went out for a second. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think she forgot or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She must've. Well I fell asleep. And she fell asleep. And-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She fell asleep too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. (Laughing) I don't know. So. Tells you how my day was. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tiring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think they won today. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One point for their side.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. One point for their side. Oh. I'll be so glad when it's over with. School. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you're really worried (inaudible at 0:01:08.5). </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) This is going to be a pain in the a**. That's all. You have so many things to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you can't get them done with 31 kids sitting in front of you. You know like records and transfers. And report cards. And just packing. And stuff like this. You just don't have any time to do it in. Not with them sitting there. Driving you out of your mind. (Chuckling) I should just keep them home. (Chuckles) Oh well. It was a nice weekend at any rate. [0:02:06.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was-you know we laid out on the beach. And attempted to go to bed together. Again. (Laughs) And at first I failed again. You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really kind of - you know. But it didn't bother me as much as it did before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As last time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really just said, "Well oh, f**k it. I don't really even care anymore. Just let me forget it." You know? So it just didn't even bother me. I just said, "Forget it." You know? (Chuckles) It was really strange, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was like it could happen but it didn't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Right. You know. At first, well at first it was kind of like it was really depressing. But then I just said, "Forget it." And then I thought to myself, "If it's me, then I just can't." I just said, "Well if I can't, I can't. And maybe I never will be able to again." But you know, okay. I just didn't even really - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't even really care. I just really didn't even care. So it was really no big thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then after awhile, we were sitting there and started all of a sudden getting excited and everything. You know? And it worked out real well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Like it didn't throw you that you couldn't. (Inaudible at 0:03:31.1)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. I was really, the thing that entered, you know like I just said, then I thought to myself, "Oh if I can't, what I am going be destined to be a homosexual for the rest of my life?" You know. And then I thought, "If that's the story, well that's it." I just don't even care. You know? I just felt like saying I didn't even care.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that kind of like the hopeless kind of not caring?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. You know just like wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just fed up with worrying about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. I was just fed up with worrying about it. You know? And that's what did the trick. (Chuckles) [0:04:07.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I didn't worry about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Were you feeling like making love when you felt (inaudible at 0:04:14.1)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what happened? Were you worrying about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I was thinking about it. It was on my mind again. You know. It was on my mind again. So I just said, "Pfft." (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about the time when it felt good? Was it on your mind? Or you just kind of were able to get-</p>

<p>CLIENT: When was this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When it did work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh! No it wasn't on my mind then. You know. It kind of just happened. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So kind of when it just happens and you really feel right in the mood and don't worry it-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. It was grand. It really was. It was really terrific. But like I just got to the point where I just said, "Pfft." (Laughs) But it worked out real well. It really did. And you know like, and then Sunday Tanya came by again. And I was just tired. We just laid down and all of a sudden you know, just laying there. I felt like making love. And just not even-it wasn't like something that I was thinking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Had kind of planned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Had planned. Yeah right. It was just kind of really spontaneous. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. And just laying there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is really, really great. That was really grand. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like not even-you hadn't been planning it or looking forward to it. It just happened being there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. It just happened. It just happened being there. And which was really kind of nice. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just really kind of nice. It really was. In fact, she was like, "Oh you didn't even have a drink. You were drinking Coke at the time." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she says, "Oh you know you always had a drink in order to relax yourself so you wouldn't worry about something. So you didn't even really have a drink. What happened to you?" And I said, "I don't know. It was just - "</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That must've really felt nice (inaudible at 0:06:03.2). </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was. It was really nice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No drink. Just feeling relaxed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah just feeling relaxed. [0:06:06.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) just kind of all of a sudden-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Right. It just happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To follow through on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Because I was tired. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like it's getting more of a relaxed thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. It really is. It's getting to be like just-(chuckles). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like (inaudible at 0:06:27.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. Just like anything. Really. It's getting to be more of a relaxed thing. And it's not like something that I'm going to like look forward to or think about or anything. Well if it happens, it happens. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is really kind of nice. I think she had a better time too. Because I wasn't worrying about it. A kid's therapist called me on the phone today. She wanted to know about him or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I started to describe it. And then I thought to myself, "Why if she really, why wouldn't she come in and see me?" I can't over a phone. You know. And just so many things going on. It was just like I can't sit down and think about what his problem is. [0:08:16.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was really unbelievable. I couldn't get next to him if I tried. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To the kid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's really kind of-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Messed up kid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what his problem is. In fact, I didn't-I don't know if his aunt or his mother. Someone said that he was going to a therapist. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn't think he needed to go to a therapist. I think he's getting worse since he's gone to the therapist. (Chuckling) Myself. I really do. In fact I, well I kind of put like, I said, "He's getting worse instead of better." In fact he was really kind of a nice kid when he came in. But since he's gone to this therapist he's really getting to be kind of something else. That was a mistake. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must've been one of those kind that can do harm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. He's really-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:09:17.7)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's really kind of a bright kid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But lazy. I mean like so many others. He's really got the potential to do a lot of things. Oh she wanted to know if I could get him into an advanced class over at Dixon. And I said, "I really have nothing to do with it. You know. That's a whole entirely different school." I said, "If you wanted to call them, you can go right ahead." It may, you know as far as keeping him interested, it may work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One time one of the other teachers reamed him out for something. I don't know if she hit him or whatever. But the mother came up and said, "Oh no he's under therapy. Treat him as a special case." (Chuckling) And I thought, "Oh Christ." And that's his problem is he's under therapy. The ones who should go aren't going. It's good to start while they're young at any rate. (Chuckles) [0:10:31.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get a sense like you're feeling pretty good today. Tired but good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I am. Tired. But good. Right. (Laughs) Tired but good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I remember a week ago you were feeling pretty down. (Inaudible at 0:10:43.5)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I was. Yeah I was really kind of down. But today it's a different story. (Chuckling) Yeah it was really a nice weekend. I enjoyed it. It was really kind of nice. We went into this-my sister and brother were home. And I was going to go over and see them but I never got around. Anyway I called her. And she said she was going to this party. And she said that the party was in the neighborhood. I said, "Who is it?" And she said, "Oh it's Chris Montgomery." And said, "He doesn't live on Cole." And she's says, "Yeah." And said, "Oh I work with his mother. His mother's a psychologist." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. And Sheila's a good friend of his mother's also. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Tanya's mother. And she knew Chris also. So at any rate. Tanya and I, and Justin, we went over to this party. And we walked in and there was like a foyer. And we went through the foyer and he opened up the door. Like the strangest smell. Tanya says, "Do you smell it?" And I said, "Yeah it's really weird." (Chuckling) And she says, "Well, you know what it is?" And I said, "No." And she says, "It's pot." It's nothing I ever smelled like pot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well they had the incense and the pot going-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mixed together. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mixed together. And it really was an awful smell. (Chuckles) It was really bad. She didn't want to stay. And I said, "Okay. Well let me go see if I can find my sister." And yep my sister was there. With my brother. (Laughing) My younger sister. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought this was younger sister.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My younger sister who is-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I was thinking your older sister. [0:12:23.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No no. Not my older sister. My younger sister is 20. And brother is what, 23. But he had kind of centralized the location where they were all smoking pot in the bedroom. And then in the kitchen where my sister and brother were they were just sitting around. </p>

<p>And so I grabbed her. I said, "Do you know what's happening here?" And she said, "No what?" And I said, "They're smoking pot." And she said, "Oh. That." And then she said, "Well." And I said, "Well like you could get busted." Well. I said, "Okay." And I went and saw Tanya. It really didn't bother me. It bothered me that she was there. It really bothered me that she was there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:13:19.9) didn't want her to be involved. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I didn't want her to be involved in it. You know. My brother, I knew he smoked pot. (Laughs) But her, I really didn't want her to be involved in it. And then I thought well I'd stick around. The reason I probably would stick around was because she there. (Chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, the protective brother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Just to watch out for her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just to watch out for her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She could be involved nearby but you kind of wanted (inaudible at 0:13:44.9). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. But Tanya and Justin said, "No we're not staying. We're not staying." And Tanya said, "Fine. If were smoking pot or would like to smoke pot or whatever. I wouldn't mind staying." She said, "But I'm not going to sit here and take a chance of getting busted." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really, it's kind of a waste. At that point. And I said, "Yeah you're right." So I went along. I went out. But really-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really bothered you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it did. It really did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your younger sister being there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it really bothered me that she was there. That she was involved in such a thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't-I never really was exposed to it that much. At one, a couple of parties. There was like one person who was smoking pot or something like that. It was no big party. [0:14:30.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was really weird. I don't know if she does or she doesn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. But it kind of bothers you to think of her mixed up with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah right. Yeah. It really does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:14:44.9) smoking pot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really does. My brother I know he does. It doesn't really bother me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:14:52.2) feel protective. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. (Chuckles) Yeah it really doesn't bother me that he does. But when she does it'd bother me. I don't know. Oh one time after she was over at my place with a friend of hers. And her friend goes to Southern. And she was down there visiting. And her friend says something about they were smoking. And her friend was smoking pot and she says, "Oh you wouldn't even have one." Or something like this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that made me feel kind of good that she wouldn't even smoke one. But maybe she's, since then she's changed. And that same day, that same morning, I had to go to the Art Institute. They were having a textile exhibit that the woman sent me a note she wanted to see for my classes. So Tanya was downtown so I was waiting for her on the steps. And there was this guy who was out there talking to this girl. And you couldn't sit down. You can't sit on the Art Institute steps.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean they don't let you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't let you sit down and wait on the Art Institute steps.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because everyone meets there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. I gathered that after awhile. (Laughs) After leaning there. I said, "Can I lean?" And he said, "Yes." (Chuckles) So like this guy was talking to this girl about he was going around last night with, I don't know, [Darvon] and bread pills and all this stuff. And trying to get rid of it. And he said he couldn't get rid of it. The best you could do is like $60 a night. And all this stuff. And carrying on. And how he just couldn't stand it any longer. It was such a meager existence. [0:16:30.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he threw it all away. (Laughs) And he was really, he sounded very sincere. But I presume he was high. And I just felt so sorry when he came off of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: After he threw all this stuff out. (Laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That things would really be kind of bad for him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then this other guy approached him. And he said, "No sorry. You're going to have make another connection." And all this stuff. I thought, "Wow that's really bad. That is really bad." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah kind of that whole way of life just (inaudible at 0:17:01.2). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just like, "Wow." And then to walk in and see your sister at a pot party. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's kind of like that just getting really involved in drugs and those things becoming a way of life. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And being (inaudible at 0:17:12.4) that that might happen to your sister really kind of (inaudible) you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To see her there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Of course I'm a little puritanical in my way of thinking. (Laughs) But I don't know. It's just something that - I don't know. But I imagine if your whole peer group is sitting around smoking. Then I imagine you would too. And I probably would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess. But you're doing it because of an external pressure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:17:45.7) may be worried that she might get caught into it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Right. But I don't know. Earlier it was something else. But yeah this guy was talking about the number of people that hung out at the Art Institute. And how-I think he was on a trip with some guy or something. It's really sad. It really was. It was really sad. You know you hear about it. And you read about it. But just to really hear someone talk about it. It's really something else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there it is right before you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:18:20.0) story in the papers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. I don't know if I would try it or not. I'd be afraid I'd fall into the habit. [0:18:28.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make it become a way of life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Because it just wouldn't be-If I tried it and liked it I'd probably do it again. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't think I could really hack that. (Chuckles) That would really be a bad way. They say, "Try it. Try it." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who says?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everybody. You know they say, "Oh you gotta try it. You gotta try it. You gotta try everything once." (Chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh to see these kids. Unbelievable. And they were kids. Well to me they were kids. Like 18 or 19 years old. Sad. I was just thinking. (Inaudible at 0:19:39.3) mother. And his mother's on a trip to Florida. I don't didn't know if she was going to come home today or not. But I know that smell is hard to get rid of. (Laughs) And I can see his poor mother walking in. It's like that-what is it? I don't know what the saying. Anyway, she being a psychologist (laughing) has more trouble with her kid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just unbelievable. Like the plumber that won't fix the sink. It's-(laughs) It's really sad. Really sad. The kid is adopted. And he was on a kick where he wanted to go out and find his real parents. Really something else. She's really a sweet woman. But that's her problem. She's too sweet. [0:20:34.7]</p>

<p> The first thing I thought of you can justify anything. Like say for instance-oh they always say if it were your sister you wouldn't want it to happen. If a girl got pregnant. You say (inaudible at 0:21:15.6). But if it were your sister. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like that's always the criteria.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah the criteria. Yeah your own-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you want your sister?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would you want your sister? Would you ever do this to your sister? And I always thought, "Oh well if it's my sister it's her life." But then to see it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really a different picture. It really is. But I tried to think it out and say, "Well. She's an adult. She knows what she's doing." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But my parents would die. They would absolutely die. I think they have suspicions anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That she does? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Just by the fact of how old she is. Just by the fact that she's 20 years old and away from home. (Chuckling) I remember her sitting around and my brother was talking about it saying that he did. And I think my mother almost dropped her teeth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) You didn't. Well he was over in Vietnam. I mean, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:22:23.7)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Cheap as hell too. But-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. There's something in there. I kind of really sense there the whole (inaudible at 0:22:49.0) that party kind of really made you feel real uncomfortable. Not just about your sister. But kind of like way of life. [0:22:53.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seemed like how she could into it maybe kind of scared you too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I could see that happening to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then it was like a choice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Either I would stay with her or go with Tanya. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like [then you were] (ph) torn.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. And I thought to myself-And Tanya said, "If you want to stay, stay." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, "No that's all right." But I really did. But then I thought about it. Well brother's there. My other brother's there and he would never let anything happen to her. So then I kind of justified that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As long as he was there that she would do all right. Nothing would ever happen to her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I thought, Christ, she's gone all year anyway. (Laughs) She comes home. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One night yearly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Right. Really. It was really strange though. But Tanya was saying you know how you could walk into a party and like if you don't know anybody. And if they're all sitting around and they have their-they come and they see friends they haven't seen in a long time. So it's like little cliques. And you really don't know anybody. So just really don't talk to anybody. But walking into this party was like, "Hi how are you? Hi. Hi." They were all so high. It was unbelievable. It was unbelievable. Really unreal. But I am going to call her up and ask her if she smokes pot. (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really does worry you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am. I'm going to call her up and ask her if she smokes. Just for the hell of it. At least if I knew that she does or she doesn't. [0:24:58.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least then I wouldn't have the question mark in my head. Oh and today they were talking about this summer school that they're having at the school. And the librarian had said that she was asked. And I said, "Oh." (Inaudible at 0:25:51.4) I said, "No I wasn't asked. Nobody in the sixth grade was asked. Nobody in team six was asked." </p>

<p>And she said, "You weren't?" And I said, "No." And she said to Sara, "Did you apply?" And she said, "No." And she said, "Did you?" And I said, "I sure did." And she says, "He didn't ask you? Well if I were you I'd go in there and find out." And I'd thought about it before. Like going in there and asking him. "Why didn't you ask me?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. It kind of disturbed you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Really. It was kind of like why didn't you ask me? Then I also wanted to tell him that-which I don't know if I should tell him or not. That adjustment teacher who's working there this summer has worked the past five summers. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're only supposed to work two summers.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if you work more than two summers you can't work the next summer. But she's worked the past five summers. And I hate her. I don't hate her but I just by the fact that she's so d**n lazy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'd call the union. I really would. And I was also going to ask him if he was aware of the fact that the teachers can only work two summers in row.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that if there were a teacher in the school that had worked the past two summers and was going to work this summer I was going to get on the phone. But then, and I was in the office and I started to go in but he was on the telephone. I was going to wait. And then I thought to myself, "You're rated. He rates you." [0:27:14.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in order to receive tenure you have to have three years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least excellent grade. I've got two excellents. So (inaudible at 0:27:26.6) third one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want to-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I thought to myself if I go in I might blow it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I was-I then I thought I shouldn't really care. And I'm thinking about myself if I really should. Because I really wanted to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To teach the summer-</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I didn't want to work this summer. I just wanted to ask him why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was it me? Is there something that I've done that you're not going to ask me? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ask me if I wanted to work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You wanted to ask but you didn't want to risk (inaudible at 0:27:57.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I didn't want to risk the fact. But then I thought well, what the hell? I don't know. I may still go in tomorrow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd really like to say something to that fool. (Laughing) Before he leaves at least.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is this the principal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah he's really an a**. Really an a**. Every time a kid does something wrong and you take him up to the principal, first thing he asks him is, "Where are you from?" Who cares where he's from?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where's he from. (Inaudible at 0:28:37.3)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Well in other words he presumes that he's transferred from another school and he's a bad child. He's not from this school. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:28:44.8)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And even. Where are you from? What difference does it make? (Chuckles) Where are you from? But I was lacking in self confidence though I think too. To get up and go in there and say this to him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. [0:29:13.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really it's something else. It's like, the woman I work with, Kathleen, she's got more gall than anybody I know. Really unbelievable. I mean he's afraid of her. He really is. And he wouldn't cross her because he is simply afraid of this woman. But she goes in there and tells him anything. And really just-she's throwing a ni**er fit. Just goes in there and tells him straight to his face. (Imitating principal) Yes yes yes. And it's terrific to watch. And she gets, oh if he ever lowered her rating, she'd-Oh God. (Chuckling) He is really afraid of her. It's unbelievable. I think she's getting a kick out of it though. So you know she was saying, even as you were brought up, and she's not teaching her kids to turn the other cheek or anything like this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I thought, "Hell. This is the way that I was brought up more or less."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like you don't do anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't react that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't react. Or don't question. Just-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go along.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go along. You know. Which is really kind of rotten. The way to be. It really is. And it's very difficult. At least for me to get out of that-call it a habit I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Kind of just acquiescing. Giving in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Giving in. And stuff like that. It was really something else. Even younger afraid, like getting in fights and stuff like that. [0:31:15.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I can't remember-my brother and I used to fight constantly. But that-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that was within the family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Like you just didn't fight. Yeah. Oh yeah we-or if there was a fight it was my brother and I against whoever it was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because we were both small. (Chuckles) It was, we used to kind of stick up for one another. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When we were very, very young. But like after-it's like you just don't. Which is really kind of lousy. In order to really to win, like when I go in the principal's office, I said don't go with an arrogant attitude. Because right away he's got the jump on ya. (Laughs) Of course then I thought thinking about him maybe it's best to go with an arrogant attitude because once he finds out that you're in an arrogant attitude he'll back up in a corner. Then you've got him. [0:32:45.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The games people play. They're awful. (Laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The one who comes on strongest pushes the other one around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. And thinking back the only time that I really-times that it really got to me and I went in and really-One time last year I didn't have a doorknob or something and a kid got her hand caught in the door. And I just-oh I was so pissed. And I was really-and I went in there and really blew my stack. And I had a doorknob the next day. And every time he comes around he checks my doorknobs to see if they're all right. (Laughing) That really bothers me. Not really saying what you feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah kind of when you see yourself-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Afraid to say what you feel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. When you see yourself kind of acquiescing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah right. Afraid to say what you feel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really like even this lazy adjustment teacher came up and said that she wanted a list of the people who were passing. And I said, "What do you mean a duplicate list?" And she says, "You know. Two. With a piece of carbon paper." And I said, "Yeah. Uh-huh." Well and I felt like saying, "Well listen you've got their names. You can write it." I've got these kids in front of me. I've got all this stuff to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to be able-</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could've said that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Just to say that. Do it yourself. I'm not doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you really couldn't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Well but I think I'm going to do it. (Chuckles) I may not say I'm not going to do it. But I'm just not going to do it. And let her worry about it. Because see she's getting some static from the school where these kids are transferring to. [0:35:03.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they have to have their records and everything for next year. And they have to figure out regrouping them and everything else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And setting up their classes. So she's the one who's getting the big hassle. I think it serves her right. I could throw a thorn into her side. (Chuckles) It's kind of (Inaudible at 0:35:23.6). If you have any of these extra boxes, save them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh the ones that I may use and I promised them to someone else. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you know what you can do. If you get here early, because that building next to here closes at five. Is what I've done is walk through the building. (Inaudible at 0:36:04.8) that building. They usually have them stacked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Walk through the building?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know the new one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The entrance is up the block. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Now can you get through this building and go up?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know you can walk. It connects but you can only come back through this building. To get into that building-</p>

<p>CLIENT: You have to go outside. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Where that funny statue is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Okay. You go into-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today might not be a good day because they're dedicating that building today. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's probably-see they're moving. What they're doing-every time I've gone in there I've seen them around the halls. You just have to go to a different floor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Where no one is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well, no. I don't think they mind you taking them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well if the movers plan to save them but it's usually the movers aren't around. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That may come back and collect them sometime. But they're not there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Because I could use it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you moving or - ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No for the class. (Audio loss at 0:37:00.4 to 0:37:10.2). Either you pack it or you forget it. It'll just be gone. So it's just like. I'll have to go in the next time I come by. There was an article. It was in the daily news about this building. [0:37:29.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This one right here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No Sun-Times. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I know. But this building right here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. The new one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Yeah. It was in the editorial page. And how the colleges aren't getting any money. And something about the reason that-seeing that they need this college here. Number one because the community needs the college. Or else if the college isn't here, the community would just fall apart. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they are able to get the money in this way or something like that. Really I didn't read it that well. But there was a bit about it. Something about how the NYU is getting the money and nobody else seems to be able to get any money. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah they're not-they're getting maybe more than other people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:38:19.2)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. Right. Yeah. How many more do I have left? Sessions?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After today, three. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh is that all? Wednesday. Friday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Monday. Great. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They also-and then after you're done they want to test you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do they? When? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it will be shortly thereafter. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh that will be kind of a hassle. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's the last week of school. That's kind of like really kind of busy. The week after wouldn't be bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well yeah I'm sure they (Inaudible at 0:39:15.1). </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like the week after the first week in July. (Laughs) Those tests took a long time. I'll have to ask them about the results. Like the first one. [0:39:30.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the one I took like starting out. They gave you a whole mess of tests. And I thought it would be interesting to find out how they could tell about me by just taking these tests. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which? I know that two groups. I don't know which is the first. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were they tests like where they ask you questions or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh there were a lot of them. They were just - -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorting cards.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorting cards. And asking words you had to make into sentences. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just a whole mess of things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just interested in the test. That's all. I thought they were kind of interesting. Kind of long and drawn out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I know that it's a long - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You just really get a headache. (Chuckles) You don't even want to be bothered with it anymore. Oh so they've got to retest again. That's exciting. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't they tell you that when you started?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They probably did. I probably said, "Oh yeah. Okay." Fine. So like next week is record day. And-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All sorts of parties and things. The last week of school. And graduations too. A couple kids are graduating. Well at any rate, shall we call it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. [0:41:18.0] [end of audio]</p>

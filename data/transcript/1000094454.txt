<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Here's the goods; the check and actually some other things that Maria wanted. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, great. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So, can you get that her? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No problem; I will make sure she gets that tomorrow. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Are those envelopes mine?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like them now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are 15 there I believe, and if you grab that many that would be half way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. No, I think that is further than half way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Further than half way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So you had three.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Good well, the check in there brings us up to date because that is for $190, so we are square. And if that is okay I will just do it bi-weekly after this. Unless you have a preference?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, however you want to work it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You could care less. Your graduate stipend is equally abysmal no matter how you split it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh; that's true. So then I will expect the next one a week after next. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well, let's see. I read you're the manifesto, so I at least got that time in. As far as I know that was the only unfinished business that we had from last week. So I guess the floor is yours because I'm not quite sure what we are doing in here other than being mindful. So I guess my question is how does therapy proceed as far as practical affairs, like who talks first and what kinds of things are we going to be doing? I'm just talking off the top of my head but I can give you my impression of the document but that would be my agenda so far. Do you have a way in which you would like to move, or the way things should proceed? Should we take turns on who will go first or?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to talk about that, I did want to talk about that and tell you about that. You seem to be looking for structure here or the rules by which we proceed. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you did give me a handout. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it said that there would be rules, or that there wouldn't be rules but there would be advice and I would be asked to do things. And then there was something about discussions being blended from several different kinds of therapies and sort of a theoretical backdrop and there was the discussion of the practical applications of it and the continual discussion of the term mindfulness came up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, as I was reading it nothing would be brought up from last weeks address. It just seems like a very a historical sort of whatever comes in the first four seconds is what gets discussed that day. And there is no, "Tell me about your week." or "How are you doing?" or anything like that. Last week we seemed to have giggling so we had some material to work with but I come in sort of relatively without something at hand between us and I guess it is sort of odd because like basically if we are getting along okay then there is really not that much to talk about it is only when I pull something on you or some manifestation of our relationship. Seems like the theory is based on the idea that our relationship is somehow going to be a manifestation of our relationships with other people and so therefore as things come up with us, then of course, we are going to confront them boldly. And I guess what is not clear to me is what if we get along? Like it seems like he is sort of a nice guy and unless we are either fighting for the bathroom or preparing for a picnic or sort of the working together towards a common goal or fighting for scarce resources we are unlikely to get angry or it seems unlikely that we are going to get into an intrinsic situation so I'm not sure if I am supposed to talk about my past or what. So there is some need for instruction I think. I mentioned that it seemed sort of like the risk would be having something that is relatively disconnected outside world. Although I will give you credit I found this little skill useful this week. I went a practicing, as it were, and I found this little pugilistic stance very helpful. </p>

<p>5:57</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pugilistic stance?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. You know, sort of push, push, push. Don't be afraid go through the range of emotions and boldly go where no man or woman has gone before; or something like that or push ahead. And last week was definitely sort of good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you put it in a very combative context. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It seemed more like a fast racquet ball game. It was definitely sort of, yeah, like, "When you said this you meant this." "What is that coming from?" It doesn't' seem like a huge leap to call that pugilistic or combative, all be it in a friendly sort of way, I mean obviously we are not coming to blows but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it may be easy to see it that way. It is not that that is invalid or anything like that it is just interesting because I don't' necessarily see it that way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I thought, not to beleaguer the point, but it seemed sort of like I was giggling all week about the Cynthia thing. You know it just seemed sort of intergenerational with the, my generation sort of consumingly silent, just obey, obey, obey. And it seems like the gen-x'ers are sort of MTV, ponder every little thought, agonize over it, push, push, push, get away and that is sort of like. I mean having dated Cynthia I sort of generalized that thinking that, "Is this like a young thing?" Is this basically the 60's turned into this or the 70's? Or it was sort of like no - or the whole idea of processing everything turned into hyper openness or high school interactions Anyway, none the less, it did, like I said, it did prove useful. And I thought of it as kind of an interesting, it seems completely out of step from the sort of counseling I have done in the past where I get real in touch with my feelings but I never really got into any of - never did any training on how to handle situations. So on the one hand I feel like you are probably going to be the least likely to know how miserable I have been at any one time during the past week or two or how lucky I feel to have made it to work all days and not let depression get the best of me. I mean it is like, he sees me at 5 and at 5 I am okay. At 8 I was holding a gun at myself to get out of bed. On the other hand, you know, I like this sort of, you know, fear no evil and the automaticity (ph) of it. Which is speak, speak quickly and don't antagonize so damn much which is sort of my signature. It's to have six or seven dialogs going on at once and then choose from them which one I am going to heave out there. So, and at some point it is, - there were a couple times during this week where I just had to sort of (snap noise). I could have agonized and slipped even deeper into the ink and I just decided to - I just started rambling basically. I was thinking it and I was just going to say it and that was that. So that is it, three cheers. Not exactly the relief I was looking for although I didn't get my ass into trouble. I didn't slip one notch deeper into the ink. So, anyway, that is my -</p>

<p>11:02</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you have a lot of reactions to last week and to the thing you read and to wondering about what is going to happen for the rest of this therapy. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And some of them very contrary reactions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Contrary? I wouldn't have put it in those terms. I mean, no, I have said it as clearly as I can. On the one hand there is some disappointment that I will not be looking at this as a place of grace. And I am not going to think of you that way and I am not going to think of this place that way or at least that is my first impression that I'm am not just hanging on till Thursday because I will get some advice or insight. It is more like going running or something. My first impression of this is that this is almost like skill development or an introspection as skill development based on the assumption or something like that. And experiencing emotions and acting on them and discussing them as an acquired skill. I mean I'm not getting into Meta theory, but yeah. There is nothing that you may bring up here that I am not going to have an opinion on. Those are not strong reactions. I may have strong opinions but I am not bogged down by them. So I think the only strong reaction is just a general sense of disappointment in the work which is that basically everyone like to talk and nobody likes to listen and so great. I mean everything is sort of - the average attention span in New York seems to be about 3 minutes. </p>

<p>13:15</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So let me see if I got this right. Are you saying then that you have the same kind of experience in here because we go so fast and well last time it seemed so fast?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My impression is that it is of the same ilk. That like I said you are not - I assume you read my file and you know a little bit about me and that is kind of a past thing but we are not and I can't - I see it as a stretch to think that what we are going to - based on what I read it seems like, the really what happened in my week is really not going to be of much - what happened during week I did or didn't have responses to is going to necessarily, or it is not something that I am going to have to keep track of. My week is my business or my week is my responsibility and what is critical here is our relationship and how well we can or how well I can confront my feelings toward you. And with the first two sessions or three sessions I assume that what you see in the first few sessions of meeting me is how you assume I am with people. And so we have issues with that and as I get to know you then other issues come up and stuff like that. And it seems like that was the model that this therapy is proceeding toward. So as I said that seems very, sort of - on one hand effective for some things but not exactly historically oriented, you know. It is sort of a - I am looking for sort of wisdom these days having to do with the issues of lifestyle and friendship networks and who to choose and who can I trust and can I - for me as I said I am cynical at best about my capabilities of getting into a long term relationship. For example, you know, and - well, anyway, I am cynical about my ability to enter into a long term relationship and for us to sit here and to, for me to get better at, if I am confronting a range of my emotions and sort of dealing with them it may be a good way to keep from being depressed, but it is not going to, I don't see it, it seems like a stretch for me to think that is some how going to translate into things like civility in relationships or something like that. I mean, I am 44 never married, never engaged. Basically I am getting at this point where when I meet people they say, "What is your gig? Are you a gigolo or what is your problem?" That sort of thing, not quite there but it is starting to look anomalous. And I never thought that it would be a status symbol to be divorced but - So those issues don't seem like they will enter into this except all be it unwittingly. So that is my reaction; I am disappointed and the same sort of disappointment that I've felt about New York in general which is there are lots of people who do their own thing and it is all sort of individualistic. I don't know; maybe like I said, I should sign up for the ECT and reprogram me. </p>

<p>17:30</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm yours. Crank the voltage but keep the seizures to a minimum. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ECT huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a solution. I seem to be out of sync with everybody else. I mean, there seems to be some consensus at least that I am sort of self hood stuff. You know, doing your own thing. I do feel very out of step with, I mean less so each week, I think socialization is taking its or having it desired effect. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So each week since you have been here in the city; in New York? </p>

<p>PATIENT: After about nine months I seemed to be, sort of, getting it, you know. I started to get the fighting spirit, to not just be shoved around, both literally and figuratively. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll tell you right know, I keep thinking of things to say but I find myself torn between talking about your questions, about the model in general, or talking about what we are talking about right now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Talking about my reaction to New York and what a tough sided character who has no relations or?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem to be describing, and tell me if I am wrong, some sense of disappointment with what this may be about because you have certain problems you would like to address and you are wondering if that is ever going to come in here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Sure, who wouldn't? </p>

<p>19:57</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well in any case you seem to think that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really tend to generalize things. Sure, yeah, I have concerns, like I said this is unless Maria sends my receipt this is clearly going to be a couple of thousand dollar investment for me and I am still paying off loans and I have to sneak out of work early and go back at six and work until eight. So it is an investment. I could be jogging, I could be - this is a gamble. It is an investment on a number of levels. I think the key thing is that I am sort of embarrassed that I feel like I have what I feel is unfair to bring is my past conception of counseling in here. Where it was sort of cozy in that prior life and I did, I felt literally bathed and but of course that guy now what do you do when he move on and he is gone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are laughing but it doesn't sound like you-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's not funny. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: There is nothing funny about it. Yeah, the ubiquitous laugh. Yeah, it sucks and you know here I am spending all this time trying to finding another counselor and it is, you know and they are all not Harry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And neither am I. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I said, you are two for two. You have beaten every other counselor in New York that I have visited so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It strikes me that you remind me of that as if to, I wonder if you are softening the fact that, because we were just talking about how you might be disappointed in this and it is not what you expected.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am softening what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That the power of that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Power of what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The implication that you might be disappointed in this or -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh sure well yeah, who wouldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In other words you want to tell me, "Look I have real concerns about this," but you don't want to hurt my feelings at the same time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, quite the opposite. I'm - it's an expression of affection. Like I said, I don't compliment people or I don't find a lot of people smart and insightful and it is a pleasure to find people that seem to be awake. So on that I'm not sort of hanging on to this idea somehow that this is not going to be - I'm not trying to protect you feelings. </p>

<p>23:58</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You seem like they are your rules, so I don't' know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, see, I don't' know. It might be more me than you but every time that you, let's say, compliment me in that way, and don't get me wrong I certainly do appreciate the positive feedback, but every time you compliment me in that way I'm not sure what to make of it because it seems to come at a time when maybe we are talking about something not as positive. So I was wonder if you had any thoughts on it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am trying to be patient with this program, you know. I am trying to verbalize my own concerns, you are absolutely right. And I am starting to verbalize it. And so there is a certain amount of spontaneity and affection and it is like, "Hey, not bad." And there is, clearly there is a part of this which is like, I don't' have a lot of hours in the day or the week to waste, you know. I know, I'm 44 I take naps. I just can't. There are not many discretionary hours for sure. And so I'm kind of always, sort of, micro monitoring things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So are you saying then that you are, kind of, micro monitoring this process here too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, not sentence by sentence but again this seems normal to me to wonder. I said, or I promised I would be patient. I promised myself I would be open to new experiences at the same time feeling frustrated like, that in some ways I found sort of discussing the week and kind of thinking how counseling as sort of a friend or as more of a soothing kind of a thing. </p>

<p>26:56</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe you are micro monitoring and comparing that to what your experience was before in counseling? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, exactly. That is exactly what is happening and I didn't,' I - it would be nice to know that there is one part of the week where I am kind of going to be okay. Or that at least - Let me put it this way these are hard weeks and there is a lot of stuff going on and I am having to, or feeling like I am having to, do it all by myself and sort of getting to the point where I feel like there is really, somehow there is just a small if not zero number of people who I can call and sort of trot out what sort of problems that I am having and it is an odd thing to. You would think that counseling would be a place where, you know, if I were slipping into some sort of crisis that there would be ability to discus what happened on Tuesday or something. So, I'm not quite sure how I got onto this but. As I said though, I was surprised that I found the pushing of some use and I even found it of some use with Cynthia. When Cynthia would sort of push hard and get me to admit things. Cynthia was pretty sharp psychologically too, obviously no training but a good street fighter. So doing this seems - My impression of the first two weeks is that this is very likely going to be a valuable experience. And I am not saying that to reassure myself or to comfort you in any way. It just does seem like that is the case and I don't' know if, I may have a different conclusion in a few more weeks but that seems to be the case now. </p>

<p>30:00</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Valuable but maybe not in a way that you anticipated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I wonder if you have feelings about that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Pissed off, yeah, sure. It is just like I feel like part of me is angry at the thought of, okay, say part of this process is, or again, my impression of it is that, I read the document several days ago and so I may be foggy on the details. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, it seems like part of what is going on here is that there is, it is essentially, in many ways a self reliance where you trust your feelings. You trust yourself to go into the range of emotions more and that you become aware of them and you, sort of, instead of being frightened of them and going on the defensive mechanisms you confront them and work with them or something like that. To bastardize what was already a very short document. So okay, let's call all of that self reliance. So this is a self reliance thing? It's like god how much more self reliant can I be. I mean, I already do this; I do this all day long. I'm leaned on all day long and the ideas is about building relationships not about - I mean this is where the trick is and what am I going to do? The theory is that this is somehow going to help me make contact with others? And it is like yeah, I mean, it just seems a little loosy goosy to me to think about that. Now on the other hand maybe it might be true, I just - so who am I. And I do have, but saved by the bell, I do more self editing in an hour, I'm like the Army, I do more self editing by 6 am then most people do for the whole day. I mean, so who knows this may help. This seems worthy of further investigation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let's talk about the document then more directly because that is why I gave it to you so that you could read it and we could talk about it. And you seem to have questions about it so I don't' want to skirt those. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm laughing because it has been 35 minutes of skirting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, in a way were skirting them but in a way we were talking about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I agree. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you came in with a couple of questions initially to start today off right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, who goes first?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, who goes first; okay. This isn't something inherent in the model but it is my preference to, kind of, let you start the session. I think you're wondering about that and I'm not sure what to make of that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's fine, go ahead. I'm sure you read the paragraph all I read was the first sentence. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, but you are laughing so you had thoughts about that right away I think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh it was just this thing; I had all kinds of smart ass answers for that this morning before work, but anyway. </p>

<p>34:17</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't' want to share them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I thought, first of all I thought well it is your office so maybe you should go first because it is sort of like kids. Then I thought maybe we should flip a coin like football, stuff like that. But anyway, I had all sorts of smart ass retorts. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you know sometimes it can be uncomfortable to - there is a little bit of pressure going first I suppose. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Especially when there is no sense of, well do you want me to talk about what my goal is or my week or is it my mission to talk about my defense mechanisms. There has to be a focus to get the discussion started in any meeting. There is always some sort of motive for having a discussion, some sort of basis for a dialogue. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you may come in, like, "What do I talk about? What do I start with?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well if you are not clear I will, I mean if you are not clear about the directions as to - I mean you have to play; you do have to be a leader here. I mean, you do have to give me some sense of what we are doing here. And otherwise I will just do like what I would do with somebody I would call a counselor which is talk about what a crappy week I had or how - something along those lines. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the reason I like to let people start first is that I don't' want to impose my own agenda. Because what happens is, I find is what is most helpful for people is for them to talk about what is on their mind and even for me to ask a question about that sometimes sets a frame for what people end up talking about. You for instance have, you know, both last week and this week talked about how bad your week has been but kind of by why of saying that is not what we started with and that is not what we ended up talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Could you repeat that again; I'm not quite sure what you meant?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In other words -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, you are right, I did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In other words I kind of said it backwards and it is confusing. Let me put it this way, if you had come in and I said, "How was you week?" Then we would have talked about that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that didn't seem to be the most immediate thing because we didn't end up talking about that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And part of the prospective of this kind of therapy is that what is immediate may be as important or in fact more important than the other stuff that is still important to be thinking about but there is a whole lot to the immediate experience. </p>

<p>37:55</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And my problem is that Cynthia will not walk by the door here and you are going to get, or what may end up happening is, you will get a sample of, I will be really well prepared to handle those things that come up to mind at 5 o'clock on Thursdays but it seems like a admittedly some of the week is going to leak into Thursday and probably what is in my head but again I might be being too nit picky here. It's just sort of, if that is the assumption that we work under then that is fine. I mean, it does seem to have some uses. It was a good call on the (inaudible 38:54) and I did learn something about myself last week and I did use it within the three days and it was important. So, I will give, I will grant you some validity to this approach. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Even you have taken in twenty before you make any statements? Sure, of course I do, I mean this isn't a religion. I don't have to do everything on faith. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No but some seems to suggest that you still harbor a lot of doubts. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I harbor some. I'm fine, I mean, this is fine. I'm not bucking this. I'm not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See this is -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Believe me if I had doubts I would just stop. Okay. So, I am going straight forward. If I didn't like this I would be out of here. I don't have time to screw around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. See this is a good example of the process, see. You have some doubts, you have questions, that is what is most on your mid now, that is worth talking about. And some of your doubts are very apparent in the way you come in and you start asking questions. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this is good. This is, your right, it is good I am, I mean, I can already feel, I can feel a little more nimble at expressing my doubts about this process, which it is, oddly enough a process which is to get you to pay attention to what you think about or at least that is my impression. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And also to get you to pay attention in the context of, you know, the relationship between you and I. So for instance, I wonder if this kind of expressing doubts, especially this early on in a relationship, is something that you have done before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Expressing doubts early on in a relationship? Oh, sure. That is like my - of course, yeah, absolutely. Doesn't everybody?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know. Sometimes I wonder if a lot of people don't have doubts but then they don't say much about them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there is another problem we are getting into my opposite, for example, here I am much more - out there I'm a far bigger kiss ass. </p>

<p>(problem with audio starting at audio 42:12)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kiss ass sounds so negative; I don't know if you noticed that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I noticed it. No I, I mean, I have been described as water; I will take the shape of whatever vessel I happen to be in or near. I swear to god if you put me near anybody I will sort of morph into them. And after a while I just sort of, that is what I do. That is what I am hired to do. I got my present job because I am a constant diplomat and I don't every have to try doing it, I just do it. So for me to like come in here and be honest, you know, oddly enough the check makes it easy. You know, it's like I paid seventy bucks I have a right to have my say. But unfortunately that is not a normal situation. I mean that is not a negotiated - most interactions are not based on a contractual model. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At least not as explicit of a contractual model. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, the order is negotiated, but I almost always, to keep control of those situations, I am absolutely put what they want around them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mentioned that a few times so I want stop you this time and ask if you have noticed any ways in which you have been doing that in here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure I am playing your game. It's like sure, for 30 sessions or 27 sessions I can play your game. I may learn something from it and this is how I handle all relationships.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is kind of what I thought too. If you had described that to me </p>

<p>PATIENT: So great, I am in a counseling situation which helps me do what I do all over?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you know, I had noticed that you came in and you were very diplomatic about expressing your doubts on the one hand but, you know, diplomatically. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure, that's what I do; that's what I get paid to do. No, I swear to god that is what I do. That is what I do. There is absolutely no getting around it, it is the defining or one of the most defining characteristics of my interactive style just, I know. It is sort of an awkward situation. I have not other way to put it. I mean, I don't' know where to go with that but - . </p>

<p>46:04</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Had you noticed that in here before I asked about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hadn't quite brought it full circle, just, I mean that was a good point and I was almost going to give you three for three. But it wasn't' quite the zingers as the past two weeks. But that is good you are right. Sure, you have it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, I wish or I wonder if you are not doing it again. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Doing what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, saying that was good, not quite the zinger, but. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you going to try and make me non-diplomatic? I mean that was a silly question. You're right, I am, I do it all day long and I will leave here and 10 minutes from now I will be that man again. I was that guy 10 minutes before I got in here and I will be that guy, by 6:15 I will be smoothing everything just right. I meant that is and I am hired to do this. They give me I go in everybody in some department hates somebody else, I go in and I am the diplomat and I smooth it all over. This because I can do the 5 or 6 different things at once, be this to this person or this to that person and not put (inaudible 47:45). So I do this but it makes, you are right, you said it, it is problem in my personal life. Where all of a sudden I don't' know what movie I want to go to but I do want to pick one for once. And I don't - then I blow up and, yeah, so we date for three months and I do your thing for three months and I get pissed off and I do what I want. And A and B, I don't' know what I want to do because then I would have to think about that. I am doing it. You'll win the gold ring if you figure out - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See.</p>

<p>48:38</p>

<p>PATIENT: What, am I smoozing again? Show me a way and I will happily walk through that door. Show me at least a way out that I can inhabit once in a while and I will happily take that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we actually have to stop soon but since we are on this, this is actually a good example of something in the, that you noticed was in the little, I don't know whatever, brochure thing, the paper, that came up in there a few times, the idea of mindfulness. And the idea that in relationships people, and you know, all people do things automatically. But things that later on down the line or whatever can cause problems but they do them habitually and this is kind of what the mindfulness is about. We pay attention to it in here and maybe start to see different things about it as it is happing. So that is the idea of using our relationship as, remember I said, like a laboratory. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right; right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the idea is that some of these things are happening in here and some of them will happen out there too and so that is where it becomes helpful that kind of mindfulness. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That sounds good and I will - my one problem with it is, is this really a model of people who are stupid? I mean habituation. I mean does that truly characterize my relationship or does it just characterize the people who are on the fat side of the bell curve? I mean that's, so what are we talking about here? But I agree that there is a part of what I do that is a habit and I could use some mindfulness. So the bottom line is still, I think this is a good thing. </p>

<p>50:56</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, yeah I understand your concern of is it under the fat part of the bell curve and I actually want to speak to that. I don't, I hear what you are saying and I don't think - the theory behind the model is that everyone, no matter how bright or how dumb, does certain things habitually automatically. Part of the reason why not everything that we talk about in here is going to generalize to all your other relationships outside is because some of it is going to come from me too. What I do, but we are going to be focusing on your stuff but that is part of the reason why, in theory at least, why. Right? After all we are two people interacting, not just one so. So, anyway well you have to stop, but I hope that answered some of your questions. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, we have. Okay, so next week this time? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, we should, we don't have to do it next week and I know that there are some weeks that we have to double up? We haven't talked about that yet but we can spread those around a little bit. Maybe we can talk about that in a week or two.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I was thinking since later in the week is better for you but Friday is impossible for me we could try for a Wednesday, Thursday type. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but that seems -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That puts them right next to each other but -  </p>

<p>PATIENT: What about Tuesday, Thursday type of thing? Want to think about that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I could do some Tuesday's. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's better. It sounds like Wednesday, Thursday won't work out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I am flexible. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, so let's meet next Wednesday at 5. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay great. It looks like someone else is trying to come in. Okay, so I have that check and I will make sure that Maria gets that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, thanks, don't lose it. . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah; yeah. Okay, I'll see you next week, next Wednesday. </p>

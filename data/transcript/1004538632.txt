<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) One of the things that's wrong with the car is that (inaudible at 00:15) - we were - [by using it at a new job] (ph) - and it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... a new registration and, so, [he flew back] (ph). And going with him in the morning, [he dropped it in park] (ph) and I go to take the train to the station one stop closer and - there's this street that we go to, to take a light where we take a left, and you can really take a left from either lane but it's like left turn only in the left lane and some people don't take a left from the right lane. I mean, it's kind of an [asshole move] (ph) but people do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:42) Anyway, and so he's - there's a line of cars that's making it so you can't go in the other lane; like cars are parked....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The far right lane?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The far right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's one lane that leads into two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At a light.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. [00:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's cars parked on this side so that there's cars that are so far back in the left lane that you can't go to go straight in the right lane, which is empty. And he is an aggressive driver and I'm always telling him to calm down (sighs). And he was like, "I don't understand what's going on up ahead. What the hell are these people doing?"</p>

<p>So he's going to go in this - wants to go in this small space because cars aren't moving up. And I was like, "Are you - you're not going to fit." And he was like, "I got this." And, so, he goes and he's not going slowly. And I was like, "You're too close. You're too close." And by the time I said it the second time he had hit the side mirror of the car parked because he was trying to squeeze in between.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Now, you told me about him wrecking your mirror last week. Is this...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Oh, I did?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He hit something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I didn't know I told you that yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I'm still angry about it. (Laughter) I guess I'm still angry about it. Well, because it's one of those things that I told the guys at the garage like, "Can you replace the glass (inaudible)"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [2:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because we're not going to pass inspection and may as well take care of it while we're at the ....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why I just wanted to make sure, like I said, that it wasn't a second incident.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it was not a second incident.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been feeling really irritated - irritable towards him lately and (pause) he is - I think it has something to do with not - me not - I think I've mentioned before that I have a hard time figuring out how to communicate with him issues that I have. And I feel like, a lot of times, I do overreact to things. And, then, he tells me I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, which I do. I mean, in general, about things, like we've talked about - like going from 0 to 60 and all that. [2:55]</p>

<p>But I just - I don't know - I've just been feeling irritated at some things that I'm not sure how to talk to - I don't want to bring up the mirror thing again because, whatever, it was an accident. I told him he needs to be more careful, whatever. But, now, I'm - but then that makes me think, "Oh, is this going to be like how it is always?" Like I'm going to have to deal with - every once in a while, some stupid thing on the car, whatever car it is. And how do I approach that?</p>

<p>And I don't know, maybe I'm nitpicking but sometimes his reaction (pause) - sometimes his reaction to things, or the way that he says things in a conversation, makes me feel defensive for some reason. And I'll automatically go on defense mode. [4:00]</p>

<p>And (pause) God, now I can't think of examples but (pause) - I can't think of an example. Like this morning, (pause) - shoot, there was something that we had an argument about yesterday morning and I don't - I think it was so small that I don't remember really what it is.</p>

<p>Oh, it was about flossing teeth. So we have this - I have one of those flosser things that you can take off the little head that has the little floss thing in it and replace it. So we will both use it and just switch, you know - put - and, so, he was - I was like, "Oh, I'm going to put - Let's go over to (inaudible)." And we're about to leave and I had to [go to the store] (ph) (inaudible). And I was like, "Oh, I need to floss my teeth." And he was waiting for me to floss my teeth so then he could floss his teeth and then brush his teeth. [5:00]</p>

<p>And he was like, I don't even remember - he was like, "You're the longest flosser ever." Because I was taking - and so I immediately got defensive. It was like, "Yeah, because I'm getting in each side of my gums." You know, explaining how flossing works. And, then, also I said, "I have more teeth than you," which I didn't mean as a jab - because he (ph) doesn't have some back teeth because of all that dental work that - I can't - I thought I told you. I think I told you that he - when I met him he had really bad teeth because of having had a trauma (ph) experience as a child at the dentist and then his parents never took him back. So he had a lot of rotted-out teeth. I swear, I could have - well, anyway...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's possible you did and I don't remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Anyway, and so he - when we got together I was like, "You have to get this done. And it's going to be a big expense and the whole thing." But he had to because he had to get teeth removed...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, maybe I actually remember talking about it [and the expense] (ph), yeah. [5:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, (inaudible) - right, because of the bill. But, anyway, so he (ph) has some - not as many teeth. And I would even say that to anybody else because I have all four wisdom teeth. So I do have more teeth than a lot of people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was like, "Well, I'm getting in between each tooth and that's how you have to floss and I'm sorry. And I have more teeth anyway." And then he was like - and then I think I got even more upset because then he was like, "(inaudible) - never mind." - was brushing and I got even more irritated because I was like, "Why can't you just fucking wait? Like, what the hell is the - like, who cares how long it takes me to floss?" And he was kind of saying, "I don't care." And I was like, "Well, that hurt my feelings that you said I was the longest flosser ever."</p>

<p>And then in my mind this turned into a big issue, like, "God, is he going to give me a hard time about everything?" And I really did make a mountain out of a molehill with that. He was like, "Sorry, I wasn't insulting you. I was just teasing you because I wanted to floss my teeth and we're on a time limit and you were flossing full throttle." So there's that and that is making a mountain out of a molehill. But then there was another issue this weekend. [7:06]</p>

<p>We went to dim-sum - we were going to dim-sum with my mom and my brother to celebrate her birthday a little late; she wanted dim-sum. And he asked in the car - he said, "Oh, do they serve Mai Tai's here?" And I was like, "Probably, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't order a drink because we're out for my mom's birthday or whatever." And then he was like, "Okay." And then he got defensive. I got a little defensive because I think in my mind I was like, "What the fuck? Why are you even thinking about Mai Tai's?"</p>

<p>And I'm sure it wasn't because he wasn't caring - he doesn't care about my mom or whatever - the whole situation. I think it was just he was like, "Ooh, dim sum" - like brunch - like Mai Tai, you know, whatever. And thinking of a drink that would be served at an Asian restaurant, I guess; I don't know. But I got defensive because it was like, "Well, you should know better than to even think about that." And then he got defensive because he was like, "Why are you," - like, "Okay, you can - that's fine. I don't have to order a drink." But then he went on to say that, "But, you know, your mom - you care more than your mom does." [8:10]</p>

<p>And I was like, "That may be in other situations, like family get-togethers, where somebody brings a bottle of wine or some beer or whatever." I was like, "But in the context of going out to celebrate her birthday for her, I can tell you that she would care even if she didn't say anything or show anything. I can tell you that she would." And then was all, "How do you know? I think you're just too sensitive about it and you think that I'm attacking your mom by wanting to order a drink."</p>

<p>But it - I guess, it kind of goes hand in hand with a fear of him not being - well, I guess it goes back to the - what you had mentioned last week about me not really feeling 100 percent that he takes care of me. And I think that's one of the things that kind of made me think about that. Well, one of the things that makes me think about that. [9:00] And this week (ph) I've been just, kind of, thinking about how - I don't know, like questioning if I'm ever going to be able to - I don't know - talk to him about things that bother me without it turning into a fight or without me just getting super defensive every time.</p>

<p>Because it is really hard to talk about isolated issues in a larger context, if for all these isolated little issues, I'd have these little, really defensive, blowups. And it turns into a larger fight and then it - we're dragging it back up. When I wish I could figure out a way to approach things in the moment a little bit more calmly. So then it could actually be understood as something that's a real issue for me. And I think that part of the reason I have a hard time doing that is because I - its hard for me to determine what's the issue that needs to be discussed and what isn't. You know, like mentioning that I floss for a long time, shouldn't be an issue for me. And like a determining factor if our relationship is going to work long-term. [10:09]</p>

<p>And, I guess, that there's been some - I get annoyed at him for wanting to - he talks to me - he's like, "I think of all these money saving tips but you don't want to do any of them so I don't know." And they are things like make your own wine and grow your own vegetables. And I was like, "Well, you know, [the making their own wine] (ph) - I'm not going to because it's messy and gross and I won't - I'm not going to drink it." I was like, "If you want to do that, you're on your own, sorry."</p>

<p>And then he goes, "Well, what about one of those tomato Topsy Turvy grower things that you hang?" And I was like, "Sure, yeah, that'd be great. I'm good with even the little herb box. I'm down for that. That sounds good." Rather than he's saying to save money instead of buying dried or buying from the store. And then he says, "Well, those things are so expensive. I could make one." Oh, "Those things are so expensive and they're not reusable. I could make one. It's not hard." [11:04]</p>

<p>[In my mind] (ph) I was like, "What? Who cares if you can make one? Why would you exert the energy for something that might not work instead of just spending the $30 bucks on something that will work to complete your idea of saving money? It's not going to save money if it doesn't work." I'm like, "What the hell? Then you have to get materials." And he gets all these stupid fucking things to build around the house. Like, "I could make - "</p>

<p>He's talking about that we should get an air filter, which we probably should because it's just - our house is so big and there's so much hardwood and surfaces and there's two cats and constantly dusty. So I know an air filter is a good idea for our house but then he's talking about making it. I'm like, "How are you going to make an air filter?" Or making a - what the hell did he want to make? A solar charger - [12:00]</p>

<p>And is this going to be an issue that really bothers me for the rest of our lives or is it just one of his quirky little things? Also, I think the other thing that bothered me so much about this whole making bullshit is because it reminds me of my father. "Oh, I have this invention. Oh, I'm going to write a children's book with - I'm going to take rocks from Israel and carve a - put a - " I don't even know. All these stupid fucking ideas my whole life that he never did. And I think it reminds me of that. And I'm like, "Oh my God, is he similar to my father?"</p>

<p>And, I think, the other thing that makes me nervous about the whole not communicating thing is (inaudible at 12:38) a similar communicator to my father and the times of my - I think I told you last week how my father, literally, could not - can't communicate. And, so, I think that - actually, I just figured that out. That it's - that that's related to it, I think, because I don't want to marry somebody like my father. [13:00]</p>

<p>And I think that there's a whole, I don't know, whatever - girls finding a guy that's like their father; it's a thing, I've heard. Not on purpose or on purpose or whatever the case may be but I think it happens. And I'm like, "Oh my God, is that what happened?" And I don't think so. I think that (inaudible) does communicate better and at least he's not - he would sit down to try to make something and use materials from around the house or that he found or whatever.</p>

<p>He's collected a bunch of egg crates; he's collected a bunch of containers and stuff to keep them in case he needs to use them for something. And its whatever. If we didn't have the storage space, I'd say, "No, no hoarding crap (ph)," but we do. And it's out of the way and it's not a big deal. And he actually would sit down and [do it] (ph), whereas my father never did and never would. I mean, he wrote - he did some stupid books - like craft (ph) - you know, stupid bullshit like - (pause) so there is that difference. [14:00]</p>

<p>But, in general, I think that I've just been feeling a little on edge and [feel like] (ph) everything is - I am making mountains out of molehills in a lot of things in our lives right now. Yeah, I'm not really sure how to react to it, though. I don't know. I'm having trouble figuring that out in the moment. (Pause 14:25 to 14:57)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really sounds like you're working pretty hard. I mean, here over the last few minutes, to, kind of, lay it all out. [Tell us] (ph) all the things that you're frustrated about. Make it very clear what's bugging you and what you understand and what you don't understand. And I (inaudible) have to imagine that one of your frustrations with your father and something you worry about with (inaudible) is that they're so busy with stupid bullshit while you're so busy actually dealing with everything, that you're really annoyed because you're on your own with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's (inaudible) precisely. And that's always how it was with my mother. She was always on top of everything and he was always just bopping around like, kind of - You know, I (inaudible at 15:53). I know that he took care of things and he made money. It's not - but she was the one that did the billing and she was the one that made sure that we had our shit straight with school activities and buying us school clothes and doing all that stuff. [16:07]</p>

<p>And he was around for everything always; he's always been around. It's not (inaudible) that; it's just that he was very - he's always been very preoccupied with his own agenda. And that's, literally, just - that's his biggest issue. And I think that that's why he can't communicate and why he can't respond when I'm talking to him about things that are important because he is so preoccupied with his own agenda all the time.</p>

<p>That's why he's late everywhere; because he's working on something and he's not paying attention to time. Or he goes to check this thing out at this place but he doesn't come back - you know, whatever it is. And, yeah, I do - I do feel that way to a certain extent. And we had a good conversation the other day about - I mean, the whole money issue is complicated. I wish, retrospectively, that we hadn't had to combine things so quickly and - But it's more difficult to, kind of, separate things now. [17:00]</p>

<p>So what I - what we discussed the other day was making it so that the account where all of our money goes in and out of, we both have access to, so that he can - first of all, so that he can take money out when needed and get things when needed; it doesn't have to be only my card or using his credit capital and then paying it back from my card or whatever. And, also, he's going to take over the online payments of the (inaudible) account, which is one of the dental loans, that will be over in September. But to make sure that that gets paid and [do it] (ph) on the account.</p>

<p>And, also, we are going to check in twice a week to do what I do every (inaudible). I probably won't be able to stop looking at the numbers and making sure that we're all [set up] (ph) every day or every other day, but then him and I will check it. And he can do that whenever he wants, too. I just am not sure that he'll do it. He's not as hyperaware of our money situation as I am, I guess. [18:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (pause) when (pause) - (inaudible) part of what's pissing you off so much is him. What you seem to be doing in response is to be, in a way, maybe a little defensive, like demonstrating the way that you're on top of all of these things, that you are trying to include him, as though to let me know that you're, kind of, on it. And you're trying to change things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk at 18:48)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... what I've said carried the implication that if you're pissed off and if there's this thing that's difficult in your life, you really should be more on top of it, or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) Well, no... [19:00]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... let me know that you are because you're taking these steps.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, then, I wonder if, in that sense, there's something about what I said about what I thought might be pissing you off that makes you feel kind of vulnerable. In other words, "Well, if this something that you're upset about, (inaudible), and this is something that's making you angry, well, my God, you should be on top of it and dealing with it." When its (ph) possible that's part of the problem.</p>

<p>But, in any case, my main question really is whether there's something about my thought a minute ago that made you feel kind of vulnerable in a way that you then had to address. [20:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think that the reason that I brought up the whole - we had this conversation about sharing (inaudible) and stuff, was to, I guess, demonstrate that is something that I am addressing. I guess, yeah, I guess. And I don't - I think that - I don't think directly I felt like you were accusing me of not being on top of it but it definitely prompted me to say I'm trying to be on top of it because it is bothersome. It is - I am taking care of a lot of this financial stuff and I think that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there was something about what I said, specifically, that bothered you or made you feel a little worried or a little vulnerable or a little defensive or (inaudible)....</p>

<p>CLIENT: What did you say again?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) (laughter) I said you seem as you're talking to - in here, about these issues. You seem like you're working hard to be on top of all of it and to lay it all out very quickly and let me know what you, sort of, do and don't get. And the reactions that you're having ... [21:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... that you're [not thrilled about] (ph) (inaudible) -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that, from the way you're talking about your father and about you, kind of - in a way, sort of, dicking (ph) around a lot. I could imagine that you feel like here you are having to deal with everything and they're making noise about trying to help out but it's, basically, dicking (ph) around, or wasting time. That leaves you with everything and that pisses you off. (inaudible at 21:43)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think the other reason - the other thing about, kind of, laying out those things that are bothering me is because I'm trying to figure out how to react to them more appropriately and how to - and how to address them more on an emotional level than a list (ph) - like a pragmatic level. [22:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I understand. And (pause) why are you letting me know that?</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's partially letting myself know, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think you're also dealing at some level - I mean, I don't think you actually consciously think those (ph) but, I think, at some level, it feels to you like I'm either being a bit critical or saying things that make you realize you're not doing a good enough job, where (ph) you really need to explain why you're talking in the way that you are, or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, maybe a little bit. I think there's a part of me that wishes that I could come in here and have a solution - and figure out a solution. [23:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that's part of why I have such knee-jerk reactions to things in my life, is because I don't really feel equipped to - I don't feel equipped with a way to handle it other than just acting on my emotions. And I don't want that to be how I communicate with people in my life.</p>

<p>And, even, aside from all the stuff that I do and how I'm on top of shit and how I'm organized and all this crap - and financial stuff. Aside from that, it's - for me, its - I guess, it's like I've just been questioning things in my relationship. And I don't think that I'm questioning my choice of (inaudible) as a partner or our relationship overall. [24:03]</p>

<p>I think I'm just - maybe it goes with (ph) the fact that I do feel like we're getting more to a point where we could get engaged. We've talked about it and stuff like that. And, so, that may be why a lot of this worry is now surfacing. Like, "Okay, shits about to get real."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, I mean, if he proposed to me tonight, I wouldn't say no. I'm not going to say no. I don't want to say no and I want to say yes and I want to get married to him and everything. But I think that ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that raises the stakes...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... [on everything] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [We're going to need to stop] (ph), (inaudible)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but we'll talk more next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Background conversation 24:58 to 25:07)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, so, I have us on the 27th at 12:30, although I know we were going to, sort of, talk in the (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's fine. Let me just look at my little calendar real quick. (pause) Oh, wait - (pause) Okay, that won't work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let's see (pause) -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could do it in the morning or I could do ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about 9:30 in the morning?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's fine. Cool. All right. Good, so I'll see you next week, 9:30.</p>

<p>(Background conversation 26:12 to 26:23)</p>

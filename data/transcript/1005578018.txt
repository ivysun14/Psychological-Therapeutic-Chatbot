BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wanted to start by telling you that I won't be able to pay you until my first paycheck comes in on the 16th because I do have a job at GWU (ph?).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations! Nice work! Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. It all went down that week when we saw each other on Monday. That Friday I got a job offer from Walter Reed (ph?).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had already told me about Walter Reed, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So maybe that was Friday and Monday I had called first thing and said, "Give me an answer next week." They didn't get back to me until Wednesday. I had to kind of play that game of "give me one more day." I got a call from Bill, the head guy, and he said, "I'm going to be completely transparent with you. You're ranked number two on our list." My first thought was "Jesus, I'm always number two for them." [00:00:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But out of two positions, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. There was one position.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I thought there were two.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There were eight people that they were considering and out of those I was number two. Then he said, "This guy that we're trying to get ahold of, we can't get a hold of." Right away I started thinking, "Okay, it's a man. I know that they need male clinicians." There is so much politics that go into it, too. I was like, "Don't take it personally. They love you. For some reason - maybe it could have been an African American man," because we have an African American therapist that just left. He was there for years. Whatever. I was just crossing my fingers. This is a good sign. He said to me, "There are cases I might just tell you to just go ahead and take the job offer, but I have a really strong feeling that he might not work out so just give us another 24 hours." I did and they called and genuinely sounded thrilled to have me and I got calls from supervisors that work there - "so happy to have you" and everything. [00:01:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I'm really happy about that. But then everything that came along with that was very strange. I think I just diagnosed myself with adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression because I'm going through this weird period. I should be really happy and content. The days leading up to that, the three days I had to wait for GWU to give me an answer and I didn't know if I was going to say yes to Walter Reed, I fell into this depression where I was just like, "If a bus hit me right now I wouldn't care. I don't want to live." I went for a walk the day I got the job offer, on Wednesday or Tuesday or something. That was when you were out of town. I remember you said, "Call me if you need to." I was seriously considering calling you because I was like, "What is going on with me?" I went for a walk. I put on happy music on purpose and I walked all the way from the baseball stadium to the Square. It was a pretty day out. [00:03:01] I said, "Maybe if I'm active and I get outside . . . " I felt like crying. I had to fight the tears back and I felt so incredibly lonely. I was like, "Is this just because I'm freaking out because financially I don't know what's going to happen? If GWU tells me no, Walter Reed doesn't want to hire me until I get licensed and I'm not ready to sit for the test right now. I have no way to pay my rent." Everything just started building up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't realize that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They wanted me to get licensed, so that would have been a problem. I would have had to rush, rush, rush to do that. It's like I had no one to sit with me with that. Normally if I was living at home I would have my mom or if I was living with Kevin I would have Kevin. I'm not close to my roommate. My really good close friends are still in post-doc, so they're busy working and Brian is very unavailable. When he's with me in person, he's totally there and he comforts me, but I' haven't heard from him all day. He's not there for me when I need him. [00:04:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's not reliable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So I felt really alone through that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and then we didn't meet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we didn't meet so I said, "I'm going to give them a call." Then I started getting all these feelings like maybe you were on vacation. Who knows? "What's he going to do for me? Just to have someone to tell this stuff to will help, but then he can't do anything. What's the point? I might as well just wait another week." So I had issues with that. And then I received the call from GWU offering me the job. Then I got really happy, but what was interesting was that afterwards I started freaking out and getting anxious because I was like, "Wait - is this what I really want? This is permanent," even though it's not permanent. I could be there a few years or even a year and then leave. But I started freaking out about the commitment aspect. [00:04:59] I was like, "Wait, Melanie. Are you sure? You're going to go back there but it's not going to be the same. You're going to be in a different role. Your fellow post-docs aren't going to be there anymore. You have to get licensed now." I went to the HR interview and it felt really real. They were talking to me about background checks which, again, the background check part, I think, stirred something in me because I thought back to what happened with the drinking and driving two weeks prior. I started thinking to myself, "Holy crap. What if I had gotten pulled over that night? Here they are offering me this job and they're doing a background check. That would have definitely come up." I was like, "What are you thinking? This is real life now. This is adulthood. This is serious. They're talking to me about a 401k." I was like it's not a position where every year you're in a new position. I was like, "That's it. You're here. Are you sure you want this?" I was like, "Why am I . . ?" I was dying for this job. Why am I feeling like this? [00:06:05] That's what I've been going through lately and during the whole thing feeling very alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think about the position itself? What do you imagine it being like and different from the post-doc in what kind of ways do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was a lot of the questions that I got from the interview. How do you imagine it being different?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They asked you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing) [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:36)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then at the end I told them, "I don't know what's expected - I haven't done it yet - but this is what I imagine." And then at the end I got to ask them, "What do you guys see as the biggest changes between last year and this year?" They said, "Basically the responsibility. You're the one who gets to sign the pink paper once you have your license and you have to get used to that new role - that you're no longer a trainee. These are your colleagues. You're consulting with them. You're really getting comfortable with that role of you as a professional because the year after that, you're going to be supervising." [00:07:12] They give you a year to transition, which I love. I really appreciate that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I said, they were very great about making me feel welcome. I remember my supervisor had laryngitis and she was at home. But after I got the offer she called. She was like, (hoarsely) "Melanie, I'm so happy. This is the way it's supposed to be." Just 100% on my side. I felt really held, like they want me there. My sister came to visit; Sasha, the one that I didn't grow up with. The one that I'm not close to because she turned 21 and she wanted to experience night life in DC. Her first day here, Bill had said to me, "Why don't you drop by the office? A bunch of people want to change offices. Let's see which one you want. [00:08:06] It's according to seniority, but let's see what office you might like." I knew I wanted to stay with my old office. I didn't have to go in, but I was like, "It might be a nice way to see everybody again." I was not anxious about it at all. I parked the car when Sasha started walking in and, as soon as I saw the first people, they were open arms like, "Melanie, what are you doing here? Oh, my gosh." And everyone was hugging me. I broke out into an internal panic attack. Physiologically, it was panic. It was sweating like crazy, shaking, everything physiologically that you experience. But on the outside I kept my cool. I could have a conversation. But even my sister mentioned when we went and started touring the offices, she was like, "What's wrong with you? Let's go to the bathroom. You're sweating like crazy." [00:09:02] She said something to me like, "Relax. You're not being evaluated. You're a psychologist now. Calm down." I was asking myself, "What is wrong with me? Why am I a wreck?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what I'm hearing about it is that it is new. It's different. You're there no longer as a trainee, just like you were saying and they were saying that there's something about being in the position of psychologist, staff psychologist. It's a job. It's no longer training. The lines are a little bit blurry, but it's different and you're going to be perceived differently. You already are. You're going to be treated differently. Even that HR interview, right? They're talking to you about, "These are your benefits. This is how we're treating you, with a lot more . . . "[00:10:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why does that make me anxious? Shouldn't that be a good thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds to me like it is a good thing for you. In some way I'm sure you feel like it is. 401k sounds pretty good and all that (chuckles).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was eligible for it already. Normally you're not eligible until the year after, but they're counting my post-doc.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's more the anxiety that comes with growth and doing something new and different, unfamiliar. That's kind of what I was imagining. All that that might mean to you. I don't have a clear sense of what that means to you, of course. Maybe it's worth talking about. It's certainly a change. It's a job with a different set of expectations on you and responsibility. [00:11:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It all hit me in the face when I walked through that door and I saw them sitting around the conference table.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I'm saying. I think you're really registering all that - the gravity of that change. It's a significant one. It really is. It's very significant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess that's just normal. I just wish I could hide it better. Like before, I used to break out into a real panic attack and stutter and not be able to talk or have to excuse myself. That didn't happen this time. I stepped out in the room with them. I was able to talk, but you could see physically that something was off - like either you just went for a jog and you're hyperventilating or you're really nervous right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and regardless, maybe it took you a little bit by surprise because it was familiar in a certain sense, yet very, very different in another sense. The meaning of it to you, I think, is what really took hold of you. [00:11:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I start August 5th, which is Monday; in a week. It's a good thing, too, because I was getting . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When are students back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not until August 19th or something like that. They gave me the option. Bill said, "You can start anytime in August up until the 20th." But I need to pay bills so I said, "Get me in there as soon as possible." So August 5th was the earliest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And are there still graduate students or something that you see?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It will be slower and I like that, although they're not there when it's completely hectic. We have trainings and things like that, but mid-August. The new post-docs don't come in until mid-August, so it will be good that I'll be there first. And I get my office which, in my opinion, was the best office. It has three huge windows. I remember the post-docs and I used to talk and they used to say, "I think you got the best office." I really do. It's the biggest, three windows, it's familiar. [00:13:05] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the pay - I got the high end. They said it could be anywhere from $56 - $60, and they gave me $59. From $31?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. That was a 100% raise, right? That's pretty good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And that is not completely registering yet because right now I'm still tight because I'm living with the remnants of my last paycheck, which was given to me on the 16th of July. I have to pay rent on the first so it's still tight. Then my first paycheck won't even be a complete month because it will be whatever is from the 5th to the 16th. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They pay you bi-weekly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's the other thing that sucks. They pay me monthly, the 16th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you'll get it on the 16th?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On the 16th of August.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I get it. [00:14:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's when I can start paying some stuff. But I'm guessing it won't be that big of a deal anymore because I'll be getting more per paycheck. Before it was like scrounging, you know? It was a really little amount, like $2,000 every month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was horrible. (chuckles) It definitely hasn't all registered. I'm glad that I'm going to start working soon because I don't know if it was just because it's a transitional period, but I don't have money to do activities and keep busy and go out of town. I was going stir crazy. I was losing my mind and getting sad just being at home. I don't know if, like I said, would it be different if I had the money and could be like "let's go for a weekend at the Shore" or "let me go and visit my family for longer." If I had someone to be with, you know? Because all my friends were working; my roommate was working. [00:15:03] I found myself trying to stay home a lot or trying to do free stuff like take a walk or something, but I was just so lonely. I was trying to study and I just found myself sitting in my room, sleeping a lot. I've realized that that's my way of escaping. Like today, I had to go in and talk to the leasing manager because on the 1st, which is just a few days away, I won't be able to pay the $1,200 that I usually pay for rent. I had to tell her, "Look, because of this situation in between jobs, I'm going to be able to pay $600." I was ready with the two letters showing her when post-doc ended and when the new job starts. I felt ready to go in there and defend myself and I stalled. I knew that I had to do that a week ago and I stalled a whole week. This morning I wanted to go first thing in the morning and I ended up saying to myself, "I'm going to study a little," and then dozed off and took a nap. [00:16:05] Finally I said, "I have to do this," and I faced her. She was the sweetest, nicest person ever. She said, "I completely understand. This happens to people all the time. I get it. Don't worry about it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it filled you with anxiety anyway?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just wanted to go to sleep forever. (pause) It must be just the transitional period. I've been working with kids all year, going through transitions like this, especially a lot of the freshmen. I don't feel like myself. What's going on? That's exactly what I'm going through.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a big change. You're done with training.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A job in the field as a psychologist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. And a really good job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A really good job. What about that part of it? [00:17:06] I say that because there is this kind of looming specter of the trials, your father, your mother.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) It sounds so stupid, but as soon as you said that, the first thing that comes to mind is, "I don't deserve that." (pause) Why would I think that? Is my self-esteem that low still?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you say more? "You don't deserve that?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I still struggle with that thing like "I've fooled my supervisors." Clinically I know what I'm doing - or they think that I know what I'm doing; like I'm intuitive - or they think I'm intuitive and I'm ethical. Ethical? What about the drinking and driving I did the other day? [00:18:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I don't deserve this because of that." That kind of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:11). It's like a respected, good college. It's got great benefits. It's got really intelligent people that I look up to that work there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ahh. Yeah. And the background check - that made you a little uneasy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's the first thing I thought about. I was like, "Wow. I could have ruined my life."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's also like it reflects and gets at what we've been talking about - who am I and if people really know me. . ? If people know me will they really still see me as a psychologist? [00:19:00]
If they did their background check, if they really saw 360 . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At GWU, at the counseling center there, the culture is one that they're very professional. I've had a few supervision sessions with the two people that were my supervisors. They're very authentic and they've told me some private things about themselves, but for the most part the people there are not like that. They keep a very professional front and I remember my friend, Carly, who worked at Johns Hopkins, who was a post-doc with me, she always said that that was the thing she didn't like about it. Like with her supervisors, they happen to be people that are a little bit more closed-off, like you get to see just the professional self. You don't really know who they are as a father, as a husband, as a wife. [00:20:01] She was like, "I don't like that. I'm not used to that. I don't feel like I know them as people." For the most part, that's how the culture is there. Maybe there's something about that that puts me on edge because I know I have to keep a professional front and, if they found out anything, wow - that would be bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, now that I'm a staff psychologist, now I really can't think about any of this stuff that's really, really bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And you know what? I remember during one of my last supervisions with the one supervisor who I could tell her everything - the one that I had the panic attack one time because I felt like she could really see me - I said something to her like "I feel different." And at that time, I meant it. It was the last month of post-doc. She said, "How so?" I said, "I don't know. I just feel more adult. More and more often I feel like a grown up." [00:21:08] I don't know. I just do things differently - like stupid things - like try to go to sleep a little earlier, drink less. I remember mentioning specifically "drink less" because I was at the time. She said something about how, when you work with this population, you kind of have to grow up because college kids do really dangerous, self-destructive things like that. You hear about it all the time when they come in to see you; like sleeping around, drugs, alcohol - risk-taking behaviors. The way I kind of took that was that you have to kind of grow out of that yourself to be able to be a professional and to help them with that kind of stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you don't? [00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're a fraud. I mean she didn't say that, but that's how I feel because that's what came back to my mind after the drinking and driving incident. I was like, "What's wrong with you? You had grown out of this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ahh. Like it's a developmental thing or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was so self-destructive in college, I should have been arrested, dead; so every time I mess up and do something irresponsible like that it reminds me like, "Are you that still?" (pause) This is everything that's coming up now and with going back. It's going to be weird seeing the new post-docs come in and I'm not a post-doc anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I remember talking to the girl who was a year ahead of me who they hired full time, like they just hired me, and at the end of the year she told me, "Looking back, I wish I had gotten closer to the three of you because it seems like you guys are great people. But I was getting used to my role as a staff psychologist and so I kind of kept my distance and was keeping myself really busy and keeping myself separate." And I get that because she was trying to transition into that role. It's almost like right now I almost feel like, "Am I going to want to gravitate more towards the post-docs?" But I can't really because I'm different from them. I'm not a post-doc anymore; I'm a staff psychologist. [00:24:05] I don't know. It's just weird. It feels like I should gravitate more towards staff psychologists, but will I really feel like I'm part of the group?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of the psychologist group?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just transition; that's what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and a very important one. What's going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I went out with my sister I was able to behave - like nobody drank in excess. I was scared that that would happen because that happened to me with her when she was 18. I don't know if I ever told you this, but when she was 18 I took her on a cruise. We lived in Alabama. [00:25:03] This is the sister that I'm not connected to. I don't feel like there's much substance to her so I don't feel close to her in any way. She ended up meeting a guy and basically going off on the beach with him and leaving me all by myself. I ended up getting trashed at the bar by myself and getting really sick. She judged me so much and made me feel so bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For getting drunk. Yeah. And for getting sick. I passed out. When we got to the hotel room I just passed out in the hotel room in the living room and she took the bedroom. I remember so much judgment from her because she doesn't get it. She realized that our dad has a drinking problem and she's like, "What's wrong with you? Why can't you just control yourself?" She can have one or two drinks and she's good. [00:26:04] I had that problem always that I couldn't stop. It was never enough; so I was really worried that it would be a repeat. It's been a few years and supposedly I've changed a lot and I've come a long way. I didn't want to slip up and have her be like, "Ahh. You haven't changed. You're the same."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was kind of implicit in the judgment? What did she judge you about? Where were you left feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I was like our dad. She was like, "You can't do that. Why do you have to drink so much? Ugh." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was your dad like as a drinker?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very irresponsible. He used to get really drunk and then drive her home - because they were divorced - he would drive her home to her mom's house to return her because they had separate custody. [00:27:04] Or just get really angry and, if my grandma was visiting from Chile, he would take it out on her and start throwing things at her, pushing her, or he would be in bed passed out. My grandma and I would have to take his socks off, take his shirt off, put his pajamas on - a big child. That's how I was on the cruise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and it's interesting because I guess in all these ways you're kind of describing this behavior as childish in one form or fashion, like drinking and driving isn't consistent with a psychologist in terms of almost maturity or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then remember how . . . [00:28:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just thinking about what we've described, what we've talked about with the drinking is that it seems like there are plenty of times where you drink in moderation or even less, like just have a drink. And there are these times where you find yourself feeling almost like you want to take the governor off the engine and fly - just go as fast as you can. It just made me wonder if it's related in any way to some way of going into a place within yourself that's free from that kind of . . . it's a way to turn off that kind of "I don't want to think about this idea of whether or not I'm mature or not." There's something about . . . [00:29:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we used to talk about that when we were in the other office. I forget what we said about it, but when I was with Kevin and I used to drink like that or when I was with my parents, it was like a way to let a part of myself out that Kevin and my parents did not allow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't have anyone in my life anymore . . . or do I? Or am I the one who doesn't want to let other people see that side?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I was thinking that night with Brian had something to do with - I don't know what you were trying to show him exactly - but it seemed to have something to do with how much you wanted to be there; how much you wanted to go home to him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He finally forgave me, but it was so hard to take that judgment. He made me wait four or five days. He didn't want to see me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That judgment is really strong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said that I disgusted them. That was what he really thought of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to me that with Brian you've kind of always had to check yourself, including in a very concrete, very clear way you can't go to his house. There's somebody else there. And that's one night you could go. I know you guys were planning on meeting there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There. At his house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could just sit there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could never just sit on his footsteps.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right. (pause) [00:31:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how to tell when that's going to happen and when I'm going to be good. It doesn't happen as often as it used to. (pause) After I got the job he forgave me and we saw each other and things were okay. He didn't really talk about it a whole lot. I had to say "I'm sorry" in person and he got to tell me how he really felt - that he was totally disgusted with me. That was hard to hear, but I was totally disgusted with me, too, so that's okay. Then after I got the job at GWU, I asked him, "Let me know when you want to celebrate." He said, "I'd like to take you to breakfast. Are you free tomorrow?" And, of course, I got so excited because we never do stuff like that. [00:32:06] I got to pick the place and we went someplace in Amherst. He picked me up like a real date and took me to breakfast. We sat and took our time eating and talked and walked around. Then we were driving back to my place and I said, "What are you going to do with the rest of your day?" because it was still early. It was like 11:30. He said, "I have some stuff to do for school and some business stuff I have to do; make some calls." I said, "I'm going to study." He said okay, but maybe later I could come back. I know what that was for - to have sex. I thought it was very interesting how he had to keep it separate. He could have easily parked the car and come upstairs and done that, but he texted me later on in the day. He was like, "I just want to let you know that that was really nice today, just sitting with you and talking. I felt that that was really, really nice." [00:33:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That he kept it separate? He kept it separate, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like he didn't want to taint the date or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like this is one me and then there is another me that . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: That just comes over for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that really it? That's it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's how I saw it. He didn't end up coming over because something happened, like he got busy with something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you felt like . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like he had to keep it separate. Yeah. He wanted to keep it like a real date. He even joked at the end before I got out of the car. He was like, "Yeah, isn't it nice once in a while to be like real adults and go out on mature dates where we talk and nothing dirty goes on?" I started laughing and I said, "Yeah, it's nice to have that, too; but you know we can have both." I said something like that. (pause) [00:34:01] When I went over to visit him, his wife was out of town for a whole week after the drinking and driving incident. I did that right at the beginning when she left, so he waited four or five days and didn't want to talk to me, didn't want to see me. And then finally one afternoon - I think it was a Saturday and she wasn't coming home until Sunday night - he said, "Well, if you'd like you can come over - if you're sober - and spend the afternoon here." I had no plans and I decided to take my computer and I was just going to study over there and he was like, "I'm hanging up some stuff in my office. You can help me." So I went over there and, when I got there, he was on the phone doing some business stuff. He does all these trainings, all this teaching stuff. I could hear him on the phone doing that and . . . not much conversation. [00:35:02] It's strange. It was the first time seeing each other, so he was still a little "delicate" is the only way I can put it. I had to be on my best behavior. I knew I had to kind of earn him back. That's how I felt. Then he started showing me some pictures he ordered online and he was going to hang up in his office. Then the phone rang and he said, "I have to get this. I'll be right back." He went all the way to the other side of the house and I heard his voice go up in pitch, so I knew he was talking to his son. He was on the phone for like five minutes and I asked him, "Was that Logan?" He said, "Yeah. He wanted to tell me about some alligators or some turtles or something." I was like, "Yeah. I could tell. Your voice went up in pitch." It's just so weird because there I was, sitting in his house, and they're on the other line. [00:36:00] Then it got dark. We were just doing stuff in his office looking at pictures and we started watching TV in the living room. It started getting dark and I asked him, "What do you want to do tonight? Were you planning to just go to sleep? Are they coming home anytime soon?" He was like, "No. Not until tomorrow night." I said, "Do you want me to spend the night?" and he said sure. I said, "Okay. Let me go home and get some stuff, walk the dog," because I think my roommate was out of town so I was walking her dog for her. So I did that quickly and then came back. When I came back it was 10:00 and he goes to sleep pretty early. He was ready to go to sleep. I was paying attention to little details. This is going to sound so stupid, but I'm like "Why am I so in love with this guy when not everything about him is the way I would want it to be?" [00:37:02] For example, when we were sitting there watching TV and stuff, I was kind of bored. There wasn't much conversation going on. He was sweating all day because it was during the 100� period and he only has those window units in his room and in the living room. When we were hanging up the pictures and stuff he was sweating like crazy, getting the pictures up. I think he ended up going to bed not showering. I think he took his shirt off, thank God; but I was totally disgusted. I was raised by very OCD parents that take showers when they wake up in the morning and they go to sleep at night. I remember my mom always saying the most disgusting thing would be for your partner to not respect you enough to bathe himself before he gets into bed with you at night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? [00:37:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I was like, "It's one thing if you're clean, but you were sweating. Go take a shower. (chuckles)." I had taken a shower when I went home, just because I'm OCD like that. I was like - whatever. He didn't stink particularly but I remember we got into bed and we kind of cuddled and I remember being a little grossed out. I remember thinking, "Why do I worship this guy? He's disgusting." I couldn't understand that. He didn't want to be intimate. I almost felt like I had no right to get intimate or try anything with him because I was there to earn him back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. You mean for the misdeed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But then after half an hour of just lying there, he initiated and did it very roughly and that's when he told me how disgusted he was with me. [00:39:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh? What did he say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was like, "Do you want me to really tell you know how I felt when you came over that night? I felt that you were fucking disgusting. You disgusted me." He just kept saying that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he said something else like, "And you're a disgusting slut. Look at you, coming over here to fuck me on my wife's bed." Something like that. But I almost felt like I deserved that, so it didn't feel bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did it feel like? It felt kind of like just punishment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (pause) But I find it again interesting that we can only communicate certain things during sex - like he couldn't tell me that whole day that I was there at home "I was really disgusted with you." [00:40:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I was thinking how you were feeling this disgust towards him and how he didn't shower; and there's also the side of this boredom that you felt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just trying to figure it out. Why? Is it just chemistry? Is it just something . . ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about that? I'm curious about the watching TV together, too. What do you notice about the boredom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's funny because I always want to do stuff like that with him; stuff that I don't get to just go to breakfast with him or sit and watch a TV show. It almost seems like most of the time when we get together, he comes over and we're intimate. That's what we do. So it was nice having that, but it didn't feel as nice, I guess, as I had imagined. [00:41:08] We were watching a show that I'm not particularly interested in. It's some new show that just started. I think it's called The Bridge. I was looking around the room and I was like, "Oh, my God. I'm in their house. There's a picture of his wife up there. I think this is where they sleep." Supposedly she sleeps with the kid on the couch. It's a huge pull-out thing in the living room and there I was cuddling with him. He did even stink a little at this point and I remember joking with him. I was like, "Can you put your arm down?" (chuckles) We had a little laugh there because he purposely put it up more towards my face on purpose. But there wasn't much interaction, much conversation. [00:42:00] I remember even taking out my little iPad and starting to play whatever that game is. Did I tell you my parents got me an iPad as a present?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so they've never given me a graduation present - high school, college, internship, anything. And I got home and they got me this. I've never owned anything Apple, so it was a really nice gift. So I remember getting bored and starting to play a little game. He even teased me and made a comment like, "You know, I feel really disconnected when you're playing a game and not paying attention to us watching the show together." I was like, "Oh, I'm sorry," and I put it away. But he's just quiet. It's almost like I didn't even have to be there, like I was an ornament or something. Like "I'll use you when I need you." That's almost what it felt like. [00:43:06] (pause) It confused me. Why is it that I have these feelings of attachment towards him if he grosses me out in a lot of ways? (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think there is definitely a lot of power in the sex. You feel a real strong connection with him sexually. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the communication that goes on there is very powerful. What I was thinking is that there is some level of intense intimacy in those encounters of a certain nature. [00:44:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In the morning it was the same thing. We woke up and I think I went to go brush my teeth and, of course, he didn't. (chuckles) He was sitting drinking coffee and watching TV and I sat next to him and, again, it was the same kind of silence. (pause) He started getting aroused and he put my hand on him and then he stood up, took my hand and took me into the bedroom to go do it. That's what I mean by being an ornament, like I'm just there so he can use me as he sees fit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you find that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) [00:45:03] It's so weird and it sounds ridiculous, but it's like when I'm with him I feel like his pet. You know how he calls me pet?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We were there on the couch and he was petting me or making me pet him and then "okay, I'm ready now." It doesn't feel degrading. It doesn't feel like I don't want this. I don't understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something compelling about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel erotic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's not much communication. It boggles my mind that after four or five days of not talking and him being so angry with me, finally I thought . . . I kept texting him. I want catharsis. I want you to be angry like this with me, but I want you to say it to my face. [00:46:03] I want to be able to hug you and say "I'm sorry. I feel horrible, even though you're still mad at me. You're allowed to be mad at me, but just do it in person." It's just so confusing that I go over there after all of those days and there is just silence. It's like there was catharsis through sex, I guess, but not talking about what happened or how he felt. But that's the way he is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, again, the really clear communication that goes on during the sex. In some way he feels more able to do it then. He feels more comfortable doing that and, certainly, he communicates a lot of his anger. [00:47:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's a lot of rage under there. So this coming week is my first week of work. I plan to do the same thing that I've always done. We get admin time, so I used to leave ten minutes early to come see you at 5:15 on Mondays. Is that hour still available for me? What I would like to suggest is . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to meet a little bit later that first week or two and see how it feels?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I could get here at like 5:25.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just because, like I said, they're very professional and stuff and I don't want to be seen walking out a few minutes early the first week or two. [00:48:02] So let me just try and figure that out and see if it's going to be a problem for anyone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe what I'll do is I'll sneak out five minutes early and I'll probably get here at 5:25.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll have the same insurance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So nothing changes? Same number and everything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I have the HR meeting on Monday, so let me find out and I'll let you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, congratulations again. That's awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. It's weird and awesome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice work. Nice work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next week. Bye bye.</p>

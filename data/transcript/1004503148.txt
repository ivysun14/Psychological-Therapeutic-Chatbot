<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could have just accidentally deleted it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It just has to do - a balance from December.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then there is one session, right, where you have to meet your deductible, and then after that it's just - I think we discussed $3 a session then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With your copay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great, okay. Yeah, I'll recheck my e-mail, and if I can't find it I'll just e-mail you to-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine. I just wanted to-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, that's great, thank you.</p>

<p>Hoo. Sorry, I'm trying to wake up. So I've been trying to keep thinking about, you know, my - I was trying to work out in my head this week what we were talking about last week, just my relationship with my dad's side of the family. And I just - (chuckling) - I start thinking, and then it just kind of stops. I get distracted or - I don't know. That's why I haven't really thought much further about it. [00:01:10]</p>

<p>I guess just the place I've gotten to is that their feelings probably aren't going to immediately change. And so I've been trying to think about, okay - so in these situations, you know, me going to family functions or whatever, they come into it with these set of feelings, I come into it with these sets of feelings. And the thing that I want to try to change is my reaction to things that they say or do that I take as hurtful. And just kind of accepting that their feelings aren't, first of all, more valid than mine, and that I don't have to let them - I don't have to let them bother me in this way that they have, because I don't think that they're more valid than my own feelings, I guess, is like kind of how I feel about it now. [00:02:30]</p>

<p>But yeah, that's what I want to feel like, but it's the actual feeling that I kind of get tripped up on. Just even like I booked my flights to go see my grandmother, and I called her and e-mailed her, and she didn't return my call or my e-mail. And so then I start taking it all personally and getting worked up in my head, like, well, maybe those aren't the dates she said that I should come and now she's upset that... And it's like, well, those are the days she said. It's like I know it, so then I like... [00:03:16]</p>

<p>Like I go on Facebook and I read on her Facebook wall. I'm like, oh, keep trying to get the reassurance that she wants me to come. And it's like, you know, I know she wants me to come, but I just can't help still acting out this need for her to tell me that she wants me to come. So I'm trying to let that - let go of that and just realize "You already know that. It's not something that you need for her to do." So yeah, I don't know. [00:04:07]</p>

<p>I keep forgetting that we're going to see my dad when I go down there. Like for some reason I'm not thinking about it, and then I, all of a sudden, realize it; then I just don't have really any feelings about it, which is unusual for me. I usually have like all these - I get really worked up and I get really anxious or I get really sad or I get... But I just don't really have any kind of feelings on it.</p>

<p>My brother said that he's - he's on different medication and so he's really calm, so I guess that kind of puts me at ease a little bit. I think, well, he'll be relaxed and probably not come around much. But I don't know what - I mean I'm happy that I'm not anxious or upset about it. I guess I just don't  - I'm not really thinking about it, which I don't know if it's good or bad but... I don't know. [00:05:12]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huhhh (ph).</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway, I don't know what else. Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I bought (ph) that muffin.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I'm really sorry. That's probably part of it. Umm, I don't know. I have nothing.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm frustrated because I gained three pounds. That's why I was frustrated. [00:06:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. What's frustrating about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I got one of those Groupon deals, so I joined a gym for a month, it was this month, so I was working out. I was working out over the summer, and then it stopped as it got colder. And then last week I went to the gym six days, six out of the seven days, and was doing - I tried new classes and doing my runs and exercising actually, instead of just being kind of the lazy bum, and I gained three pounds, so I was really grouchy about that. Not really grouchy, but I was frustrated. [00:07:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you feel like you were doing something, being proactive, and getting (ph) some of the benefits?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I like to see an immediate - otherwise, I get discouraged, and I'm trying not to do that. I think it's helpful, but I only have this membership for a month. Because normally I would have seen that and then I would have kind of watched (ph) them. Not given up, but I kind of would have said, eh, that's not working, and I would have kind of fallen off. But I know that I only have this 30 days to go to this gym, so I'm really trying to just stay on it. That seems like a really silly thing to talk about but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Because it seems so trivial, like not very important, like I'm wasting my time. It's like we only have another 45 minutes. I should talk about something more...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're aware of it, so that sort of feeling that the time is limited? [00:08:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess with my gym, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm. That was an interesting thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was an interesting thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why is that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, it's that you see the association between-</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the time, with being limited. I don't know. Maybe there's something to</p>

<p>that, I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Yeah, I get more like - if I know that I only have a certain amount of time. It's like what I'm doing with living here. I think that we could potentially be leaving, and then I start thinking - like I made a list of everything that I want to do before we leave here. So why haven't I just been doing these things before? Like why haven't I gone to a Giants game, you know? So I feel like there's only a limited amount of time, I get kind of - I've got to take advantage of it all and I've got to do it all. But I think that's kind of normal, I think. [00:09:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And - but how do you mean that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like it's something everybody does. If you feel like you only have limited access to something, you try to take full advantage of it. Like living here; if I don't take advantage of these things that I could do while I'm here, then that's like a waste of time. So is this totally separate now? But - well, maybe not. It's not that separate. [00:10:05]</p>

<p>My dad would always talk about age, and "Act your age" and "You're this old," and he would always say I was a year older than I was, and it used to drive me crazy. And so he'd always say - if I was 11, he'd be like "You're 12 years old. What are you doing that for?" And I would say - it was always this... And it's like you know enough to add me (ph). I know you know how old I am because you always are just adding a year. [00:10:36]</p>

<p>But it was always this awareness and "Act your age," and then that getting old came with this certain set of circumstances, like that you have to act so proper and rigid, and I hated the idea of getting old from the age of six. I was - I hated it, like just... And I feel like that's kind of what - I don't know. Maybe it's relevant (ph). But just this emphasis on your age and acting a certain way because of your age was always - I was always really aware of it and kind of, I don't know. Irritated me. And I had that same feeling when I got engaged. [00:11:31]</p>

<p>First of all, like, I'm not old enough, I felt like, and secondly, I have to act differently now in these certain set of circumstances, because now I'm going to be married and I'm going to be - you know, and you should act differently in certain ways, obviously. But, for me, it meant this whole other - like I had to become a different person, not that I ended up doing that. [00:12:02]</p>

<p>But when I got engaged, I felt like you're about to be an actual adult. And so in that it means, like, not being funny, like not joking, being very serious, and rigid, and not fun, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that's what being an adult is, I guess. I don't know. It was just like this thought that you had to grow up. And by growing up, that means being more serious and less - I don't know. I guess I was always just really confused about how adults behaved. They're always seems to be this power, but my parents acted like idiots. But all these other adults seemed to have it together and know what was going on and be more serious about life; you know, pay their bills and live in, you know, functioning households and go to work. And I think maybe, since I wanted that, I don't know, like I - isn't love (ph) necessarily more fun, but it looked like that's what you should do. That's happier, and that's like everything is more structured and cohesive and everything is just - I don't know. [00:14:09]</p>

<p>I just thought - I mean everybody thinks things are going to be different, but then living in my teeny little apartment and my husband going to school, I didn't think that I'd be having this kind of life when I was married and I thought it would be more like (inaudible at 0:14:27). And I'm not happy about it, but it was just the way I had thought about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you think it would be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Structured. And I didn't think that I would - I guess I thought I would be working in a job that was more serious, and that, you know, I never imagined myself supporting my husband and I while my husband went to school. I didn't think of these things. These weren't things that I would have just thought of as my...</p>

<p>I guess we would have lived in a nicer place and had nicer things and been more adult and grown up and not still... Going out on Saturday night, we would have our friend - you know, I'm talking about (ph) my husband - we would have had our couple friends over for game night and, like, things like that. [00:15:35]</p>

<p>Our life just seems so really early twenties-ish to me, which I'm not saying is a bad thing. I'm not unhappy with it. It just - I don't know where I'm going with all this. I just don't know where that came from with my dad, like that whole push on like "You're this old, you're this old," and he still would do it when I was an adult. "When I was married, I had two kids." You know, it's like "Thank God, I don't have two kids. Thank God." And also, you know, "When you were 22 and you had two kids, you were a bigger asshole, and you sucked." I'm supposed to live up to that? No thank you, I'll live up to this instead. I'm much happier with my 22 than your 22. [00:16:42]</p>

<p>But it like still doesn't ever - like he still says it - he'll say it to me or my brother - "When I was your brother's age, I had a wife at home and was driving a truck and doing..." Like he'll take... Well, he's not. He's going to school. He doing - he doesn't... Good. Good that he's not having - he doesn't have a wife at home and a bunch of kids. That's great. And my dad's family, that's not great. That's like "You should be living by this. We did it this way and this is how you do it, and then that's how it goes." I don't want it to go that way. For me, at least I mean.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it seems like one of the things you're talking about is the expectations, both your expectations of yourself and your dad and his family's expectations as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But like the expectations don't speak to anybody's - it's trying to say that it's speaking to your character, but it's not, really. What I think they think they're saying is you should be - you should have - I don't know. I guess have these things because that's how you show you're successful by - or that's how you - I don't know what that's supposed to be marking (ph). I just never - I don't understand what that's supposed to be like. So when you were 22, you were married with two kids. What's that supposed to say? That's supposed to say that you're better than me? Because I just never got it. [00:18:45]</p>

<p>Like it doesn't - I wouldn't have said "You're 22 and you're trying to..." It sounds so corny, but find your own way and do - you know, be a better person and kind of figure out what works for you. Like I think that's an okay thing to do at 22 also. I think that it doesn't have to be... Or in my résumé (ph), going to school and getting a degree, and like he cares about it (ph). I think those are all okay things to be focused on, but that's not something that's helped, you know. If you're not doing it this way, it doesn't count and it doesn't matter. [00:19:28]</p>

<p>But I started so - count the matter again when I got married and started to follow a similar structure, and then it was - yeah, so now it's like "When are you going to have the babies" or am I going to do this. And so it's like I'm now back on the okay path in their mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think what they think matters to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, of course. [00:20:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then why of course?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they're my family. And for some reason, the things that they think hold a lot of weight and what people think matters a lot to me, and I don't like that. I get really frustrated with how much I care about what other people think, but what they think definitely matters to me.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's - I mean I just - I get a lot of - I could get a lot of reassurance from validating what I'm doing by the feedback other people give me, and so - or just knowing that certain people will think that those things are good or bad or whatever. It's the whole reason that I, you know, would tell people for so long that once Chris was done going to school, that it would be my turn to go to school, when realistically that's not a financially good idea for us; it doesn't make sense. It's not something that, when Chris gets out of school, I necessarily even want to do, because what I want to do at my age... So then they were like - I would just tell people that because I knew that's what they wanted to hear. [00:21:32]</p>

<p></p>

<p>And I have so many women in my life saying, you know, "You need to go back to school and get a degree." And so I would - because I have so many women telling me that and saying this is something you should do when you - like you need to do instead of thinking about what I want to do, I was only listening to like I know I should do that. That is something that's really important and you know... And then I stopped and I thought about it, and it's like but I don't necessarily want that at this age and the direction my life's heading now. Like I don't think I necessarily - you know, for a long time I thought, well, it will help if I go back to school and I get a degree. It will help me to feel more, you know, confident and I'll meet - I can prove to myself that I'm a smart person and that I can do these things that everyone else has done, and I did see a lot of benefits to it. [00:22:44]</p>

<p>But just from - but then I think, well, that's going to cost us tens of thousands - so much money to do, what? There's not even something specifically that I'd think I'm really interested in. There's not something that I want to go to school for. So I'm going to go and do that just to prove to myself and other people that I could? I don't know. [00:23:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think you feel you need to justify your decision?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because I need to have a reason to make that choice. I feel like there needs to be a reason behind it; don't just go willy-nilly and just go because people are telling me that that's something that I need to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but I'm saying why do you need to justify it? Like it seems like you go through a whole thought process about why it's a bad idea, which is like you don't really want to go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it seems like you have to justify your position.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I do. I do feel like I have to justify my position. Because if I just say I just don't really want to, then it sounds like - it sounds like all these expectations people have, not only for me, but just people just have, I'm not living up to, and like I have to have a reason to not live up to that. There has to be something more there, I guess. Yeah, why isn't it that I just say - I just don't - I don't want it. I don't know if that's okay. [00:24:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it seems like somehow you feel that other people can set expectations for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think people do have expectations for the people in their lives. I think that Chris's mom is one of the women that really has been very vocal about that. You know, she thinks it's a good idea for me to, when Chris is in school, to go back to school myself, and she earned a degree in something. And I do feel like her expectations, I mean, are valid because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, you know, I'm married to her son and I'm not - I feel like the idea that I won't ever contribute in a very, like, typical sense is something that she or other people could see as, you know, a weakness or lazy or... You know, because in all honesty, if Chris doesn't get a job after law school, there's not much I can do to help, and I have a lot of guilt about that. [00:26:32]</p>

<p>And then I feel like, well, it's valid for her to think that I should go - and not that she's ever said this to me or even necessarily feels that way - but it's valid for her to think that, "Well, why isn't my son's wife taking, you know - why isn't she going to school and getting a degree and getting a good job? Why is he..." Even though it's our business and what we decided on going into our marriage was something different, I still feel like other people will have these thoughts and feelings and "Why isn't she contributing her end?" [00:27:19]</p>

<p>And the thing is the only person that that should matter to - well, the only two people - are me and Chris. And it doesn't matter, but I still get upset about it for whatever reason, because I care so much about what people think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you have some thoughts about yourself, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I feel that way. And I think, you know, the me-not-going-to-college thing is always - like I've always felt - had a lot of feelings about it. But it's always made me feel less than - whether it's - you know, because my friends are smarter because they went to college or, you know, they're going to have these jobs and careers and they're going to have all these things that I'm not going to have. It's always made me feel just less. And so I don't know where I was going with that. [00:28:31]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh - and it wasn't even until Chris that I always - I always felt like - I always thought I was really just not a smart person and just - you know, like what did I have in my life to show me otherwise? I didn't - I wasn't successful academically. I didn't have that golden magical college degree that apparently now marks an intelligent person, and I didn't have anyone in my life telling me that I was smart. [00:29:09]</p>

<p>And then when I started dating Chris and, you know, he's a very smart guy and did really well in school and is just more interested in kind of like academic type things, and I couldn't kind of keep up with him and I couldn't hold my own in conversations. And then I had him telling me that I was smart; that's the only time I've ever thought that and felt like that. And even then it was just - it was only validated through him. It wasn't - I mean I just wouldn't ever think that just on my own. And I think that if it weren't for him I still probably would really not think that about myself. [00:30:01]</p>

<p>And so even though obviously I have - I do now have more confidence in thinking that just because I don't have a college degree, that doesn't mean I'm an idiot. That doesn't mean - I think that I can still learn things on my own and teach myself things that I am interested in on my own. Even though I have that confidence now, I do - it does kind of make me a little upset that the only way that I got that was because Chris told me. And not told me, but like showed me; that I wish I could have just had enough confidence to see that on my own and to...</p>

<p>And just this feeling that I have to prove it to everybody else now. That, you know, my friends will say stuff all the time like "I mean he must be a smart guy. He went to college." And whenever they say things like that, I get frustrated. Just because somebody went to college doesn't mean they're smart or not smart. And so I feel this need to prove to people all the time that I'm not an idiot just because I didn't go to school. [00:31:11]</p>

<p></p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think that's the implication?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. And whenever I'll say - just like I'll say "I didn't go to college." And they'll say it like, "Oh, no, no, no, not you," and they get really like... It's like, "Well, but that's what you meant. That's what you meant when you said, you know..." And I think that that's just what - and if I didn't care I would have - I guess I just wish I didn't care and feel this need to prove... Because it proves itself. If you're a moron, you're going to prove it, unless you're not; then people are just going to kind of figure that out. No, you don't need to... "I read this book and, like..." "Oh, I only visited this reading program or..." You know, you don't need to shove it in people's faces. If you just are, then people will see that and know, but I lack that confidence sometimes. And I hear myself saying things like, "Oh, well," and being kind of like a know-it-all, just to kind of prove that I know something.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're conflicted about this, because on the one hand you think, you know - you know, you think those sort of standards are kind of, you know, skewed. [00:32:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On the other hand, you feel like you do need to prove it, I imagine, because you want to live up to those standards.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I feel like a (inaudible at 0:33:09) I guess.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I do feel - because I do. I think the standards kind of - at least a lot of people in my life live by is that you have to prove yourself kind of academically to be smart, not just that you - there could be - if you - it's like such a - it's like a surprise and "Oh, yeah, they're really smart (ph)," but even though - they didn't go to school. They think it's a surprising thing. I think that's kind of silly, but I think that I'm in the minority in thinking that. And honestly, I didn't think that before Chris. Again, like I didn't think - I did think that way, too, so my feelings on it are kind of new. [00:34:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But as you said, you feel (inaudible at 0:34:27) and how they didn't come from you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I feel like, just being more confident before, I could have just drawn that conclusion on my own. I didn't - I feel bad that I needed Chris to validate that feeling or to - not even validate it, but to have it and then I would say, "Well, yeah, I agree with that," and then to...</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I (ph) should probably just try to stop doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, what do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just trying to live up to these expectations that I don't necessarily even agree with and that, you know, just, poo, what am I proving and to who? Like what's the point? There's nothing like - there's...</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why does it matter if my mother-in-law thinks that I should go to college and I don't agree? Like that's just okay. That doesn't need to be a big thing I'd beat myself up over in my head. Most of the women that I'm friends with that are over a certain age, like in their 30s or 40s, are very - I don't know - like, "You need to do it." I think just because for them when they went, it was an independence thing, and so they're very, like, preachy to me about it and so I get kind of defensive. But just I don't need to be defensive about that. That's not something, that certain path that I want to follow, and it's not that - the end of the world. I can...</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I still really care what people think; that's the problem. Obviously everybody should care a little bit about what other people think; otherwise, you know... But the amount that I care is not necessary.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't know how to change that, I guess. I don't know. I feel like that is the biggest thing that makes me feel really conflicted about a lot of stuff. [00:38:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just my, like - you know, my concern for what someone, no matter who it is - in some circumstance it goes back to something someone else would think or... I feel like that is what trips me up a lot and I get really conflicted about it. And I guess it's just because of - I don't know what... Like is it because, like, we had someone in our lives growing up who told us how everything should go all the time and we had to follow this chain of - you know, these - or what is that? I mean is it just - is it just because I don't have any self-esteem? I mean like why the fuck do I care so much? And I don't know, I think, where I'm turning (ph). [00:39:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it makes you sad or frustrated?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me really frustrated, like this. (Crying)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's to the point where when I'm having a conversation with my mom, I keep saying "Why are you making that face? Why are you making that face?" I ask people why they're making that face constantly, because I think something in their face is saying something about whatever I'm saying or doing. And 90 percent of the time, they're not making a face, they're just sitting there and listening, but I'm so concerned with what they (ph) think.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like before I say something, I think about - I mean I guess everybody does this to an extent, but I feel like I filter 80 percent of what I say based on what I think the other person's reaction is going to be, and I know that part of that is normal. You don't want to say something to be completely offensive to somebody else, but that's not really it for me. It's that I am just trying to tailor this image that they have of me in living in this-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Sneezing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bless you. But what - I mean, like, what is that, really? [00:41:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think - excuse me. I think all kids need, you know, a sense of like a validation and affirmation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To feel good about themselves, to feel like they have an image of themselves they can carry around with them that sort of gives them a sense of who they are. More or less, it depends on what other people think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just because I never got that I'm just always going to be looking for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why do you say that? Why do you say that? That's in how you're doomed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that what it feels like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, because the people that, like, you need that from, I never got it. I mean I needed it from my parents. And my dad did the opposite; he just called me names. And my mom, God love her, I know she wanted us to live up to - like I still can't live up to her expectations of me, or for me. And like I'm still always trying to impress my mom; it's pathetic. Like it's not normal. [00:42:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I don't know if it's pathetic. You're still desperately trying to get that affirmation and validation and I don't see that as pathetic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It feels pathetic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about it feels pathetic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I'm like - well, like I tell her - my mom is a big runner. She runs marathons and she's really - and she's very body-conscious. And so I'll tell her, "Oh, I feel like a great run and all," and like I'll tell her I ran faster than I did, just because I want her to tell me that it's good. [00:43:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why is that pathetic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm a 28-year-old woman lying to her mom about how fast she ran (chuckling). Like that's pretty silly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're looking for something you never got, and what you got was so essential for - to have a life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like - I feel like I need to just - I'm not going to get those things from her or from him, and so like I have to just turn it inwards and just be proud of the things that I'm doing for myself on my own, but that's still really hard for me. Like I just still have a really hard time being proud of what I have and what I have done.</p>

<p>And I - like just being proud of the fact that I have a - for the most part, most of the time - a pretty good marriage to a pretty great guy, and I think that's (inaudible at 0:44:03) really proud of, but I'm not, usually. Like there are so many things that I feel like I have done that I should be like - look, you don't need to act like my mom or my dad or anybody to tell me that those things are good, because I know they're - I'm proud of them. When (ph)? [00:44:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I'm going to need to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I always get going right at the very end, don't I (chuckling)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling). It's my time crunch, and then I start panicking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm. Well, so I will see you in two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Oh, that's right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, thanks. [00:45:07]</p>

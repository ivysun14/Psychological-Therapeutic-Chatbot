<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how you doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good.  What's new, anything?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm back home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's working pretty well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's going okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean we're taking it slow and, um, you know, we have basic ground rules.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One of them being, I don't, if we do have a tiff or, we don't really fight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, our problem is just we don't talk at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just kind of shut down to separate corners.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly.  So we're working on that and, you know, even though I still have my townhouse, it's off limits.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, no running and hiding.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's kind of one of our guidelines.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Complete honesty about everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, yeah, I think we're starting with the right foundation.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's going to take some time.  I mean neither of one of us are madly in love with each other, um, haven't been for a long time, can't expect that to just happen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Our hope is that when we get our lifestyle organized and everything like we want it and we're communicating like we want that, that will come.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's our hope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, we'll start liking each other because we're doing things for each other.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean we're setting it up like a business contract.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  [PATIENT NAME], I'm thinking there's so many different ways of doing marriages, too.  I had some friends from India and he was taking about arranged marriages over there.  They still do those and he said in India they consider our ways of marriage silly.  They call them love marriages.  They said in India they don't think that love marriages are very good, they don't usually last because they said it's inevitable the love is going to fade with time, that initial infatuation excitement.  They say if that's all the marriage is built upon then there's nothing left, whereas they think in that culture, I guess, arranged marriages are more likely to succeed because people have different expectations of each other.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's true.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it's interesting that, yknow, there are many different ways to make a marriage work and that's something you two are exploring, how can you make this work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, I mean we have these kids, we have this house, we have these bills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Let's work together like a team to get these things done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then, yknow, if there's passion there, if not then, you know, the question will be can we like this anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right is it acceptable to do or not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  As long as we're friendly and helpful and show the kids that we do have a good relationship even if it's not passionate.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We don't show them that part anyway so, yknow, some of it shows through.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But that would be, we'll see, that's all last.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the good, just keep an open mind.  So, how are your spirits doing overall?  Do you feel like you're doing okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm doing pretty good.  I am.  You know, I'm staying pretty level.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had a little hypomania, um, but I think it's, I think it's normal.  I mean I shouldn't say hypomania.  I've had a lot of, my son, [NAME OTHER], is racing motocross and this season he is just stomping everybody.  I mean he is just rocking and to me that's a lifelong dream for me and I never did it.  I mean, I never could, I never had the success he's having.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it's extremely exciting.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, you know, it hasn't interfered with my work and it hasn't interfered, it's interfered at home a little bit but [NAME OTHER] is onboard with it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, it's something we're both really excited about.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it's not an issue like it has been in the past.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so, yknow, I think it's okay to have uptime.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely, as long as they're productive and not counterproductive.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, for example, you're still, you're doing fine at work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.  And are you sleeping okay at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I sleep good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The only problem is I'm still having attention problems.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Trouble focusing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just, just, I'm concerned about it at work because I miss meetings and - you know, it's not because I'm thinking about something else, I'm just not, I'm more spacey.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME] does it feel like this is something new since you've been on medication or is it something that existed even before the medication and just hasn't gotten any better?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well it, um, I was like this years and years ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then as I've been on medication, you know, it's been not as much as a problem, but since I've been on the Lamictal I feel so much more like myself, my old self.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Unfortunately, that's part of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not having the mood swings, but the focus is still an issue.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I gotcha.  Well, there may be some other things we can look at to try to help with that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We had talked about the stimulant because my son is having great success.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> With which one?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's using Adderall.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Short acting.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, kind of on an as needed.  His is pretty well needed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you know, his is different than mine in the fact that he gets hyper.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, so, and I just zone out.  It's kind of funny because I'm quite peaceful and happy.  I just don't remember things and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I've been weaning off the Effexor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how's that going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not great, not terrible.  I'm down to the 37.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I tried to go without it and had some pretty, um, I wouldn't say severe, but moderate withdrawal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  What kind of symptoms did you have?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I get, um, almost vertigo.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my lips are numb and my eye movements seem to, and that's part of the vertigo, you know, if I round a corner or something, it seems like everything's, not spinning, but just not quite -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what about your lips did you say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I get, they feel numb.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Numb.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And so you went back on the 37.5 and that stopped?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm going to ask you about maybe going every other day.  I didn't know exactly what to do so I thought I would -  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.  You know, there are a couple of things that may help.  You can try going every other day, but for a lot of people what happens is then they feel good on the days they take it and crummy on the days they don't.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Another strategy is to take Prozac for a week.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The reason for this, we think, is we think the reason with withdrawal when they stop Effexor, the serotonin levels drop.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, um, it happens pretty quickly after you stop Effexor so within a day people feel all those symptoms you just described and more sometimes, and if you take Prozac, what it does is it supports the serotonin levels and Prozac is in your system so long it can take weeks it's effects on your system, for several weeks, and very slowly leaves so your body has a more gradual decline of serotonin so it doesn't cause withdrawal.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's one option to take Prozac daily for seven days then stop it and usually that eliminates the withdrawal from the Effexor.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That'd be great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You want to do that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, let me get you a prescription for a weeks worth of Prozac.  Actually, let me write for two weeks just in case.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But usually one week is enough, then you can just take it for a couple of days, like two or three days, then stop the Effexor and you should do fine at that point.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, that sounds good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, um. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's interesting, I've lost about eight pounds.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, from just not being as hungry?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I mean I haven't tried.  I've noticed that my appetite is just lowered.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh, over what period of time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Since I started tapering off the Effexor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that's been - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Three weeks?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's see, uh, when was that?  Um, the [DATE], it's been ten, sixteen days, just a little over two weeks.  Huh, because usually Effexor doesn't cause weight gain, but, uh - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I know when I started taking it is when I started having weight issues.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It did start going up, so maybe for you it does cause that side effect, that's unusual.  Huh.   </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you know, everything affects me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We're all different.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Except Lamictal, that's the one that's working.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's a miracle drug, I call it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I'm glad it's working.  I'll write this one for the Prozac.  And again, [PATIENT NAME], take it at least, probably two or three days, and the stop the Effexor.  Again, it should pretty much prevent the withdrawal.  You might have very mild, but it shouldn't be very severe at all.  If they are, let me know, because we probably would have you going on Prozac for a little bit longer, you know, maybe a week and then try to stop Effexor, but most of the time that prevents the withdrawal.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any questions about that at all?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, that makes sense.  I, um, yknow, and I could probably just go through the withdrawal but, you know, as you mentioned before, there's no need to have that unless, you know - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, nothing good comes from suffering, yeah, so if we can find some way to minimize that would be good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been on that for years, what's the point of rushing off of it was my thought.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly.  I was thinking about your appetite and weight again for a second.  Do you know how much weight you might have gained on Effexor?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Forty pounds.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really, forty pounds.  So how much do you weigh now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm running around 195.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What I consider correct weight is about 170.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, at my peak I was 222.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now that happened over, you know, eight years, so close to a year I gained forty pounds.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, I'm sure there's some other, you know, variables to that too, but that, I wouldn't say that's the sole cause, but it seems like my metabolism changes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or I should say it seems like my metabolism changed while I was on it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Well that's important to know because that's a lot of weight. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's hard on your system to gain that much.  Okay, um, you're eating okay now.  You're eating healthy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I eat plenty, I just don't have, mainly it's the sugars.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That I just don't crave anymore, like, you know, last night I went down to have a bowl of ice cream and I was like - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It didn't sound good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a good thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  How's your energy level these days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good, good.  You know, the, I want to do things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, the motivation's there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, which is important for me because it's my biggest, I mean when I'm down, depressed in the past, that's what was the worst thing because I'm a mover and shaker, I like to be doing stuff all the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, you know, like I said, the only problem is that I kind of bounce from one thing to the other.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm finding, um, over the past, probably since we went on the 300, that it's gotten quite a bit worse.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, but at the same time, I feel so much better, yknow - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That it's worth it for now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is.  I don't want to change it because I love not having the, yknow, hypos were the worst for me, or the hypers - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Were the worst for me.  It was the, the lows weren't that bad, but when I would get into, yknow, I'd just call it a crazed, yknow - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Whatever the subject was for the spring, you could just pretty much count me out for everything else till fall and, yknow, this spring, it's just great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good.  You're enjoying yourself?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I am and everything, you know, it's, in fact it's the opposite, not the opposite, but the way it should be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For me to be coming back into this marriage this time of year -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's just unbelievable to me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To be able to be rational and, you know, trying to make sense of this and do the best thing for the kids and all the things that a man my age should be doing, um, you know, not that I'm patting myself on the back, this is what I should be doing, but in the past it's not.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It wouldn't have worked.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This time of year, no way.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'd be in rock star mode we call it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh, okay.  All right.  What about any anxiety or panic attacks recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  I haven't had any panic for, oh, a long time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean when I first moved out I did but I think, yknow, that's probably somewhat normal in that circumstance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, the stress certainly is, it's intense.  What about, um, thinking about perceptual experiences, any experience of hearing anything that other people aren't hearing or seeing things that other people aren't seeing, anything like that?  Feeling unsafe like people are following you, anything like that recently?  Anyone hassling you or bothering you?  Okay, good.  Um, and it sounds like with your work you're able to, your focus isn't as good as you'd like but it's not to the point where you're not getting written up at work or anything like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm getting close.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?  Okay.  Like missing meetings?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, just Tuesday, my boss sat me down.  You know, they're happy with the, you know, my attendance, my attitude is great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, uh, I'll say procrastination is probably a big issue.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And yknow, some of it's procrastination, some of it's just plain forgetting and, um, typically, yknow, I'm wrapped up in something else work related and so my boss is like what, and once he understands that I'm not intentionally doing it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not like it's malicious, but - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But at the same time, it's still not good for our business.  You know, we need things done and we need them done when they need to be done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.  You know, [PATIENT NAME], if you wouldn't mind, there's a form I'd like you to fill out about ADD symptoms, an adult checklist.  You know, the symptoms for ADD are really designed for kids.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But so ask the symptoms of ADHD, it doesn't make sense to ask an adult do you have trouble playing quietly -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So several years ago the World Health Organization came out with this checklist that's for adults.  The questions are a little different; it's a little more helpful.  If you would like, just go read these and circle whichever number seems most appropriate.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Got them all?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me score that and I'll explain what it all means.  What's that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's kind of comical, some of them are written exactly for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Crack me up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, some of these are pretty classic so, okay, seven, okay and these days ADHD is broke up into three different categories or types.  There's one called primarily inattentive type, which is for people that have trouble focusing, concentrating, they're distractible.  The other is the hyperactive type where people can't sit still or are very restless.  The third is what's called a combined type where people have both and the questions here at the top relate to the inattentive type, the bottom ones relate to the hyperactive type and you scored 29 and 26.  Um, scores are 0 to 16 means you're unlikely to have ADHD on either of these; 17 to 23 is likely, and 24 or greater is highly likely, so you scored highly likely on both categories.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I passed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or I failed?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You meet the criteria, well it depends on how you look at it.  You meet the criteria according to this checklist for ADHD and just thinking, that's something we probably ought to address because it's probably going to help you function better at work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a hope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's my hope, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, I had been on the stimulants before and I, I don't know, I mean it seems like they make me more fidgety.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that's - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Here's another option, have I mentioned Strattera to you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah and I'm against Strattera.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What is it you don't like about Strattera?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It really messed up [NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It did, tell me what happened with that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He, um, I mean I don't want to sound dramatic, but it was, I felt almost life threatening to him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really in what way?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Malnutrition, he wouldn't eat.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?  That's very unusual.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He lost his hair.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because those are not normal side effects.  Normally, Strattera is less likely to cause appetite suppression than the stimulants.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he may have had some really unusual reaction to it.  Most people actually tolerate them much better than stimulants so let me just give you some options.  We can try the stimulants but then there's also the risk of addiction and worsening tics.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which is bad.  Strattera does not worsen tics typically. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It doesn't usually cause as many side effects as stimulants.  You can use it on an as needed basis or take it daily.  There's no addictive potential with it so there is that advantage.  Um, so it has some real advantages.  If you decide you want to try it, what I would say we would do is start you on a very, very low dose, first just to make sure you do okay with it and then we would increase those very, very slowly.  If you start having side effects, we'd stop it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I think in some ways it might be, if you tolerate it, you know, like most people do, you'd probably do real well with it, then there's the stimulants, there are some other ones that are considered off label uses.  I don't know if you ever tried, were you ever on Wellbutrin?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's an antidepressant that also is used for ADHD.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't remember if I was years ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, let me look at my note to see if there's any record of it.  That's another one that sometimes works for some people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, I don't have down that you ever tried it.  That's another option, then there are some other medicines that are sometimes used that are called atypical neuroleptics, um, I don't know if you've ever been on some of these.  Something like, I think you might have been on Risperdal.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Briefly, I'd have to look back and see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's sometimes used for ADHD as well.  Um, you know, there are some other off label medicines that we use sometimes.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Even some of the antidepressants sometimes work, besides Wellbutrin.  Zoloft, I have patients that take even 200 to 400 mg of Zoloft for their ADHD, so another option would be to try going up higher on the Zoloft.  It's not tested as much, it hasn't been used as much as some of these others.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's still an option that works for some people and it's thought, [PATIENT NAME], that one of the reasons that Zoloft works as well as Wellbutrin or Strattera is they all increase a chemical called norepinephrine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that's also what the stimulants do and one of the theories is if you increase the norepinephrine levels, for some reason, that seems to calm down the ADHD symptoms.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Strattera is the only one that's selective for norepinephrine.  Something like Zoloft also increases other chemicals like serotonin or Wellbutrin also increases dopamine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Stimulants increase a whole bunch of different chemicals; serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and others.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, um, again one of the advantages of Strattera is it's more selective.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It would be my first choice if you're willing to try it, but I hear your hesitation.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Would you even consider a very, very low dose?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I actually won't -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to sound -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's okay, you don't have to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not a trust issue, it's just, after what it did to him, I can't even support that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, and just so you know, what I tell you about medicine, just in general [PATIENT NAME], my experience over the twenty some years as a psychiatrist is anybody can have a horrible reaction to any medicine.  In other words, my dad almost died from taking an antibiotic that is routinely used.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He had sensitivity to it, it almost killed him, um, but other people, it's a lifesaving medicine for and that's true, I've had patients that, yknow, I'll give a hundred people the medicine, they'll all do great and then one person will have a bad reason to it and it will be horrible for them</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's, you know, there are some medicines that are more likely to cause side effects than others and every medicine has the potential to cause problems for some people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I think it's only a matter of weighing the risks and benefits so again if you don't want to try it, if you've had that experience with [NAME OTHER], I understand, I won't push you into it, but, um, even with the other medicine, we have to understand there's going to be some risks too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah.  My thought with the stims is what I didn't like about them, because I took Adderall and Concerta -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And first of all, I think I was on way too much.  I was on 54 of Concerta.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And 50, two 25 XRs of Adderall and that just, I think it was just too much.  Like, [NAME OTHER] takes 10s and, yknow, at a max of three times a day, usually two, and so I don't know, but I did notice a big difference in that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In those and, yknow, the addiction risk isn't that big of a deal for me because I don't like them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow what I mean, I could get physically addicted.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  That's the, the risks with the stimulants really are the tolerance which means they can stop working over time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or the dependence, which means your body physically gets used to them where you can have withdrawals if you stop them, but the dependence we can usually work with, we can usually taper people off of them so it's not a real problem.  It's more the tolerance is the bigger issue because they stop working, then what you have to do is get off of them slowly because you can't just keep taking more and more because after a while, even if you're taking a bucket load, they don't work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We do holidays with [NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yep, medication holidays are a good idea.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that way we try to reduce that risk.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so the things we could still try, I mean you could try something you tried before.  The other options would be something like either Dexedrine, which is an amphetamine or Focalin, have you used Focalin?  It's a modified form of Ritalin.  It comes in an extended release form.  Or if you want to try something other than the stimulants, we could try something like Wellbutrin, which is a non stimulant.  It works really well for some people with ADHD without a lot of the side effects.  There's no tolerance, no dependence, so that's alternative and, or to go higher on the Zoloft to see if that would do it for you as well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Zoloft I'm concerned about because I was on 150.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or 200 and I had really bad sexual side effects.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's one of the drawbacks.  Zoloft interferes with sexual function.  Wellbutrin does not, that's one of the advantages of it.  Wellbutrin might be a reasonable thing to consider just because you don't get some of the side effects.  It shouldn't worsen tics, no tolerance, no dependence, it doesn't cause, typically it doesn't cause jitteriness.  Possible side effects with Wellbutrin, there could be a little bit of appetite suppression sometimes, sometimes a little trouble sleeping, but not too bad usually, it's usually manageable, a little dry mouth, but typically that's about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is it something I can take, um, because like on the weekends I don't want the focus, yknow, to me it's what I've seen with [NAME OTHER] and myself in the past.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> On the weekend, I didn't even take it and so that's one of the, is that something, is the Wellbutrin something that's gotta build or is it short acting or - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Typically for depression it works better if you take it daily.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For ADHD, I don't know if it would work if you could skip on weekends or not, we could certainly try it if you want to and see if it's working, it could be something we could work with and see.  Um, it would be a reasonable thing to try.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's your feeling?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I, um - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, the other thing I'd like to check out with any of these stimulants, Wellbutrin, there is the risk that they could trigger more mood swings.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And hopefully the Lamictal will prevent that, that's what it's supposed to do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But there's no guarantee so you have to be really careful that they don't start causing you to flip or cycle more rapidly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that's one of the risks with all these medicines, it's not more with one than another, but I just want to make you aware of that as well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I'd prefer the short stims.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You want to try that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just for the fact that, um, the flexibility.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I had problems with it, I can, yknow -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just because I've had experience with them and I know that I didn't like the extended release because I didn't, yknow, it just - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Lasted too long?  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What we could do, if you want to, depending on what you want, we can try the Adderall if you want to try something you've tried before, depends on how it works or try something different, probably try something like the Focalin or the Dexedrine, those are other choices.  Maybe start with a real low dose and arrange so you can kind of -  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Work with it and see what works.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That sounds good because I know that I found more is not better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, and it increases the risk of tolerance, the more you take the more likely it is to stop working.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want to try something like the Adderall that you've taken before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What if we go with the Adderall 10s and let you adjust it, you know, from somewhere like maybe one to four a day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And see what works and then you skip it on weekends which will - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Like I said, it's, um, I'm a little bit skeptical with, yknow, it's not something I want every day.  I kind of like not having the focus on the weekends to be honest with you. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I really like the way I feel on just the Lamictal and, um, I like that, it's a very comfortable, happy, motivated way to live.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> On the weekends, I don't have to worry about my procrastination.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Well, [PATIENT NAME], the two biggest concerns that you always have to watch for, again, we want to make sure it doesn't worsen the tics.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then that you don't get psychologically or physically dependent on it in a way that causes problems for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So let's just keep an eye on those two things, but let's start with 10 mg.  I wrote for one to four each day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, you can take them, start with them in the morning, if you need another dose later in the day you could take a second dose around midday.  I wouldn't take it past 2 p.m. because it's more likely to interfere with sleep.  Let's try it and see.  If you have any problems or questions, you call me.  Does that sound okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That sounds good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, let me give you that to start with.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then let's leave everything else.  We talked about the Prozac and Effexor.  Let's not change anything else right now because that's quite a few changes already.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But hopefully that'll go smoothly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, now I do need a refill on my Clonazepam.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I assume that's going to be next on our hit list.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want me to write it out or call it in?  Do you have a preference?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Would you mind writing it? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I'm just going to go over there right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that way, let's see, and my Zoloft too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm out of refills on that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> These stims are a pain too because you can't refill them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I find it interesting.  I mean, maybe it's just my chemistry - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you know, they're so tight on the amphetamines.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe more people are likely to be excited about amphetamines, I don't know, but yet, yknow, I see people with a hurt toe and they give them forty Vicodin and to me that's just, that to me is the big issue in drug abuse right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But maybe that's just me, that's what I like.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, they're both equally dangerous.  I mean, I know of people dying from both, taking too much of both - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, so it's, for some people and everybody is different, either one can be really dangerous.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know my nemesis is opiates.  It's interesting, I haven't had opiates in months and months and yet, you know, honestly, if I was presented with the opportunity, I couldn't pass it up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, and that's one of the dangers with addiction, is it's just so easy to slip back into it.  I wrote for a month's worth of refills on both of them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that should carry you through for a while and then to reevaluate next time to see if we need to make changes there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any other questions, [PATIENT NAME], anything else you want to talk about before we set up another appointment?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I don't think - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That pretty well handles everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.  Get here a little early?  </p>

<p>NR: Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, no problem.  I was just looking to see if - </p>

<p>NR: Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And they're not.  All right, I'll be with you in a little bit.  All right.  So anything else before we set another appointment?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Life's starting to, you know, like you said, it was interesting, I pay close attention to our appointments and you had said early on with my decision, early on in Lamictal.  It was interesting how I had this phase of finally doing what I wanted to do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, that's remained, but it's interesting that I'm finding what I want to do is be with my family.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, sometimes it's good to find that out, yknow?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wouldn't change it.  I wouldn't go back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I could.  I would not change a thing because I learned a great deal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About, you know, not having control of the kids and I understand now what the losses are, not just the gains, the gains were pretty obvious, but the losses were something I hadn't really thought about.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, sometimes we don't know what we lost until we've lost it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I had somebody the other day come in walking on that foot and they said, you know, I just took it for granted that my foot was fine, but now all of the sudden that I can't walk on it, it's really a pain.  I think sometimes with our families it's the same thing.  When they're there everyday all the time, we take them for granted and we start to realize what it's like if they're not there anymore and it helps us sort things out, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just, I can't wait to get up and see them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The kids, yeah, it's been, I'm twice the dad I was so maybe that all happened for a reason.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe it's all for a reason, [PATIENT NAME].  Again, if it helps you be better in your own life and your family, then you, I mean you've taken that opportunity and made something good out of it, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think there are difficult times we all go through in life, everybody goes through hard times, some people those hard times kinda get the better of them and their life sort of starts to fall apart or unravel, other people, it strengthens them and they learn from it and it makes everyone's life better that they're associated with and I think that's what you're doing, making this into a positive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is and, yknow, I attribute it to the Lamictal letting me, allowing me to be me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's just changed my life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the good thing is that, you know, some people get on the medication and they don't necessarily understand the medicine is helping stabilize them and so they have a tendency later when they're feeling better to forget to take it or go off of it because they don't realize the benefits of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The good thing about you understanding and feeling the benefits is you're much less likely to forget or stop taking it and then have to go through a whole difficult time again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I've struggled for so long.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, to find this, it's just, um, yknow, it's great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you for introducing it to me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm just glad it's working and hopefully it'll, you know, usually when it works it keeps working.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, those no tolerance or anything like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's no tolerance with it and no long term side effects typically for most people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And if I get epilepsy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're covered.  All right, well good, let's, let's set up another appointment.  I'm thinking we should probably check back in another month or so if that's okay with you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, definitely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just to see how the Adderall is working and see how you're doing getting off the Effexor and, hopefully, that'll go smoothly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then kind of reassess and decide where to go from there, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That sounds good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so let's see, this is [DATE], so let's shoot for sometime in early May.  [DATE] falls on a Sunday so we could either try something that week before or the week after, do you have a preference?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, Fridays work really good for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If you have a lunchtime or -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've got Friday the [DATE] at one o'clock, would that work?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Perfect.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, believe it or not, this is my light day at work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're having a good day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Light day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, light day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, because we, I do all my production changes Friday morning and then Friday afternoon I'm pretty well - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They let us, they're letting us go at three today for [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Benefit of having a company based in the Bible belt.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.  There you are.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All righty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I'm just looking to see.  I'm not going to be out of town any time next month, well, just one weekend I will but they'll be someone on call if you have any problems and I think you'll know by then if you're going to have any difficulty either with the medicine or getting off the Effexor.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think any of them will be severe that I couldn't handle.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, at least the Adderall, we kind of know what to expect, you've been on it before.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the Effexor, you kind of know what to expect too, but, again hopefully, the symptoms will be much less if at all with the Prozac.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was going to ask you if you had another sample of the Effexor?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Of the 37.5?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For the next couple of days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's another starter pack.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  I won't shake your hand because I have a cold.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  I sure appreciate it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, well, if you need anything, give me a call.</p>

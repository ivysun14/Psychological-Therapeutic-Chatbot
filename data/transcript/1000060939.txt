<p>COUNSELOR: March 9, 1971, Client 0222-115 Interview #12.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Always feel fine until I hit those three flights of stairs. Ten minutes late. Almost overslept. Got in at six or seven this morning. Well the trip seems to have come off pretty well. Kinda of haywire for a while but once things got leveled out. I got there and nobody knew I was coming so I had a friend of mine, he and I were out playing around for about 24 hours before we ever ran into anybody else. It seems that during that 24 hours they had all gotten together and planned for me to show up that night and I walked right into the middle of their getting ready for everything. (0:02:13.5) (0:04:13.7) Started to say that I was really feeling bad about leaving Boise this last time. It made me kind of stop and wonder just why although I already had a pretty good idea if you stop and think about it. (inaudible @ 0:06:20.5) probably for the first time in shit since the middle of last summer I got to just sit down and talk with Jessica and just talk for a while. That made me think that there's at least four different people that I haven't talked to for probably close to a year and I just had a really good time with all of them for a change. That and things seemed to go right every time I turned around while I was down there. A friend of mine that was going to come back up here is a bass player and he auditioned for some group that he has just been desperate to get to join and got the contract as their bass player so he just went nuts. He had, he was feeling so good he left the same day I did and moved down to Elm City to play with them so he won't be coming up here but I have a feeling I'll be seeing a bunch more of him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it sounds like it kind of had, this visit had a school quality for you where other people are concerned and it really it's like a wrench to come back here where there really isn't anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like the first time that things have gone right like that for quite a while and it's kind of like once you're winning in cards you don't want to quit right in the middle of it. (0:08:05.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it feels a shame to cut it off because you don't' know what will happen the next time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether it will ever get started again. It was just an awfully good indication that some of the people that while these people for instance that I was talking to and having a good time with Carmen who is Jessica's best friend, she will be coming up and her mother and I got into a big war. Her mother wanted her to stay up here a week and I was jokingly refusing to put up with her for a week but of course she'll probably be here for a week. It's like people that I met a year ago and we all felt very close to and we were living in almost a commune fashion over at the place that I lived last year but as soon as I split we just never knew each other long enough to maintain that kind of relationship and during the last year the few times that we have been together is slowly building up to where we're now again feeling that way. We're real good friends and it's people that I've never known before, the only people that I ever felt really close to were people that I had known for four or five years and I didn't have anything to do with them anymore so it's kind of an interesting slow changeover. Another friend of mine, Stevie, my long legged brother, whose girlfriend is probably one of the most insecure people I've ever known, she used to be, her parents were even considering having her committed at one time and I guess she attempted suicide. She was all of fourteen I guess when we met her but they've always just clung to each other like riding out an ocean out there by themselves, scared to death to be without each other. It was really a good thing that Steve was a lot like that and when they got together they both were a lot more at ease. You can talk to people and they would never even done that before. I guess Julie was just probably the first time in her life getting use to being around her parents and enjoying it instead of feeling like the only person in the world. Her parents are super wealthy and I guess she just doesn't get along too well with that kind of society that they were bringing her up in although her father was originally quite poor and came from a poor family himself. Her mother died while I was back there and that really seemed like a shame that that would happen just at the point when she was finally beginning to appreciate having a mother. I was awfully happy to see that both Stevie and she took it awfully well. Stevie is the type that we used to kid him about being the first ordained minister, the Orthodox cynicism religion and he is just kind of that way. He doesn't like have any belief for hope or anything sometimes and he just sits around and sulks for a few days at the slightest little thing but he took it real well. I guess I feel like I'm still waiting just like I was last week but now maybe I have a little better idea of what I'd like to wait for. That and next week the paychecks finally start coming in at work so that I'll be able to start curing that in a real fashion instead of just on paper. (0:12:08.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I am guessing it must have been sort of reassuring to go back and to be able to re-establish those things. Like you sort of hadn't know where you were with all those people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, see it was more or less through Jessica I knew these people and now I feel like my friendships with them are established on their own basis. A lot of these people are Jessica's classmates. It's kind of strange while I was there during one evening I went out with some of the people that were in the old group that I used to run around with that when I turned on they didn't and we kind of went our separate ways. They eventually did but in a completely different kind of idea behind it and what they were up to. I almost enjoyed it but they struck me as the just drollest painfully boring people I've ever been around. (0:14:45.5) Oh, I knew that there was something that I was trying to remember, I was sitting here trying to remember it for about ten minutes. While I was there I called into Jessica several times myself. Her parents used to recognize my voice but they didn't give any indication that they did these times that I called and one evening a friend by the name of Jack called over there and he was the one that I was supposed to be when I was calling. So when he called her father answered I believe and handed her the phone and after the conversation he asked her what I was doing back in town. (0:16:36.3) She just said that it wasn't me and she didn't know whether I was in town or not. He didn't say anything more about it which I really seriously doubt that they don't know that she and I still converse but just didn't seem to do anything more about it. I've said before a while back that I have a feeling that her parents may just decide after a while that they've put enough shit on her for what they blew their cookies over last fall and just try to ignore the rest of it knowing that it'll only be another year before she's out of the house anyway and they just don't want, they don't want anymore trouble so the easiest way to avoid it they know is to just ignore it. It's looking like that may kind of be where it's headed. It could be interesting because Jessica is supposed to be able to get a job this summer and if she can work at all why between she, I and Carmen, who would be her roommate, (inaudible @ 0:17:47.1) try to get her an apartment and if things work out why then we may be able to fake it and get her a part time job so that she can say that's where her money is coming from and she wouldn't have to move back in for the last, she's got one semester more of high school. That's kind of a long shot. It would be another couple of months before we really find anything out on that. (0:18:22.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt relieved because it at least looked like some of the heat or some of (inaudible @ 0:18:30.6) checking up was calming down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even if there still doing checking up they just choose not to raise any more hell about what they find out. Although I did find something rather disquieting from Stevie the first night I was there. I mentioned to his mother, she and I were real good friends, I used to date her, that I would be going to see Jessica the next day. I didn't know if she was going to school or not because I didn't know if she knew I was in town yet. Anne said well for Christ sakes don't bring her over here which kind of startled me. I hadn't thought of it but she seemed awfully upset of the idea. She and Stevie started some really insane rap that I didn't understand evidently because I didn't know what it was they were talking about. About how Steve might get arrested and finally the only thing I could understand is that through Julie's father, who is a lawyer, they had found something about Jessica and I and/or Steve for which Steve was in jeopardy and I cannot understand it at all or maybe it's Steve and Julie that they found out from Jessica's mother and father but it doesn't make any sense at all to me and they refuse to tell me about whatever it was because they said Julie wasn't supposed to hear from it, from her father and she after her father told her told her that's something to be within the legal grounds and breaking the professional trust having it said. Well, at any rate went to Steve and then to Stevie's mother and pretty upset. It could be that they have the workings of charges pending against me or it could be that I don't understand how Steve could be in jeopardy of it in any route. I just don't understand that at all and I think it may have been just something they were saying to try and keep whatever it was from coming through. I've asked Steve's brother to check up on it and I have no doubt that they will eventually find out for me. (0:20:51.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's really puzzling isn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just can't figure from any direction. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wasn't even sure. It's something that you think may involve you and it's a legal matter?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. When her folks blew their cookies so bad last fall is when I mailed her a cap of speed. She said she had a finals paper and asked me if I could send her some, so I did. They just freaked out over it and it's possible that maybe they've given that to a lawyer. Or, maybe they decided that Steve was a doper because they've known him for a long time and he has shoulder hair length shoulder length hair for I don't know since he was like thirteen or fourteen years old but I can't understand that because I know that there was no mention of Stevie in that letter. Evidently, it has something to do with her folks with Jessica's folks calling Julie's parents. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you were wondering if maybe something were hanging over you (inaudible @ 0:22:17.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll just be awful pissed off if I find out that's what it is and they didn't even bother to tell me about it. Professional trust be damned. I don't need anymore trouble. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Like for you, it's a matter of survival and that stuff, that other stuff is I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Jive. No, it's not that I don't but the trust is something that Mr. Cameron has to uphold and for Stevie to be withholding something from me when we're friends like we are just hacks me off when it's not even his responsibility. I can understand if Mr. Cameron didn't tell me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, particularly since it might damage to you (inaudible @ 0:23:01.7) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Particularly since it obviously involves Jessica that I know and it involves Julie's folks and Steve and it came from Jessica's folks and something to do with legal procedures and Steve doesn't fit into that and I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I take it Jessica doesn't know either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I talked to her about it. She didn't know what's going on either but her folks did call Carmen's parents once twice and we didn't know that she tried to contact anybody else though but Carmen's mother has known about just about everything is going on for a long time. Like she's the one that's willing to let her sixteen year old daughter come up and stay a week here with me because she thinks it'll be a helluva nice vacation which it probably will be. (0:23:52.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's nice to have somebody have that kind of</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, she's just absolutely fabulous crazy about her but she had heard how Jessica's folks had gotten hold of all this information by ripping off her mail and all this kind of crap and she also knew how her father beat her, she also knew that he was an alcoholic, she's known how fucked up that family is for quite a while. In fact, when Jessica ran away from home for a week one time she put her up. Told the cops that she hadn't seen her. (Inaudible @ 0:24:23.5) Well, at any rate Jessica's folks called up over there and told her that they knew I was a dealer, that Carmen's boyfriend at the time was a dealer, you know doing all these horrible dirty things to their minds and to their bodies. She finally just called them about every dirty name she could and told them that if they bothered to call again, she'd have them arrested. Seems to have clamped down on Jessica's folks minds a little bit. They decided maybe they wouldn't try calling anybody else. (0:25:04.9) It's a visit like this that I really wish I could go back again. It's after a visit like this that I'd like to go back again but I've got a feeling that now the paychecks are coming in that I'm going to have a little more inspiration and I know that I'm not going to have another chance to make a trip that cheaply so it might be as late as June before late June before I get to go back but when I do I plan on taking a week's vacation and as much sick leave as I can save up and Jessica should have been able to manage either getting the apartment or being able to split the scene for several days at a time by then and we're all going to, there's about ten of us, that are going down into Texas to my folks cabin for a bit of a vacation. It's on a lake and has a boat and two cabins and 150 miles of woods before you see any kind of civilization. It's just a beautiful place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible @ 0:26:27.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh wow. Well, it's right up in the northeast corner in the foothills of the Guadalupe Peak. I grew up down there when I was a kid just every living moment. I was there for three day weekends every weekend of the summer and we'd go down at least twice during the winter for a fishing trip from the age of six or seven until I was old enough in high school that I ended up working every summer and couldn't go down. I just love it, crazy about it. So about ten or fifteen of us will probably spend a week down there. Tye pulled his supersensitive stuff on me again while we were in Boise and before I could say anything, even react to it, I had said something as usual and he just flipped off and accused me of being brutal to him or something like that, saying I was making fun of him. I can't remember who it was but I think it was Carmen, just turned around and gave him hell and told him how goddamned oversensitive he was and that was sure a dumb thing to do. It seems to have made an impression on him. I really hope that maybe he caught on what was going on. I had never mentioned it to Carmen so it seemed to be spontaneous on her part. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like she really knows the same thing.</p>

<p>(0:29:27.3) (0:32:27.4) (0:35:27.5) (0:37:27.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Must be a thousand things going through my head but none of them quite reach vocal level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's called threshold in psychology.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I always thought it was more like a stupor. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Threshold is the level something has to reach before it gets expressed or some such nonsense. You're saying it feels like there is a lot going on but nothing comes clear or there's too much energy to pick it up and formulate it or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, kind of a combination. It's like it's coming along on a such thin line of recognition to try to amplify it to a vocal level means I wouldn't be able to follow it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It almost sounds like it's best to leave it in its natural state.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that way I can follow it through and come to its conclusion and maybe go back over it if anything after if I can remember enough of it comes to a point of making an impression. Oh lord. (0:39:53.0) I'm super anxious to get out of the frat house all of a sudden. I've just been really happy I was there ever since I moved in there since there were people there that I was around so that I can have friends around here which I would never managed otherwise I don't imagine. I don't know. Some of them I just don't like too much anymore. Their getting on my nerves and vice versa. At the most I just feel like I'd like to be out on my own little more than a frat house. I want to have my own place again. Cook my own food for a change. Put on some weight. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something about feeling confined there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. A little bit of the feeling of stagnation but mostly I'm just, things are going to start happening especially through the summer months that I'd like to have a place of my own, that I could use the extra room, I could use the convenience and the privacy of it. It looks like there will be people coming up all through the summer. There's at least five people we know of right now who will be here the next four months. At least for a week each or some of them to try and find a job here and stay so the fraternity just isn't a very good place to be (inaudible @ 0:42:08.7) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like you don't need what you needed from it at first (inaudible @ 0:42:16.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I could take on the responsibility of finding friends or finding something to do, find something to keep me occupied without having that now and I had to put up with too many inconveniences for that which were worth it at first but they're becoming value, the two things are changing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm hearing that as being something, a positive development I'm not sure if that's</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel it is. I'm at least secure enough feeling secure enough now thinking I am that I'd like to take on a little more responsibility and I suppose it would also be kind of a ego trip because I'd like not only like to think I could do it, but if I could it would give me a great deal of satisfaction too as being a little more in control of the world around me than having to be so much floated along by it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Guess we better quit. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

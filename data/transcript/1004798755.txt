<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what seems reasonable about Monday? I mean, do you want to split it? Like I guess if it was... If you had just forgot it would seem to me like fair that I would charge you but it I forgot that wouldn't seem fair at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like splitting it makes sense because I really can't remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I've... It seems like the sort of thing either one of us could have done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you want to swipe it now or later?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll do it now while we're talking about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Otherwise we're probably forget? (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Right. Sorry about that. There we go. Okay. So... [00:01:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry (inaudible at 00:02:15)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's okay.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:02:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Clearly I need the new iPhone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>I think I'm having a crazy allergic reaction to (inaudible) So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's kind of cold out. So on Friday I saw my psychiatrist for kind of like an evaluation of like increase the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who do you see?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh that's right. I was realizing I hadn't talked about you're seeing anybody at the university but that's because you're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because they won't (inaudible at 00:03:49) at the university anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I know, I see a staff bunch of people who see people at the university but on the second floor. [00:03:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know. I got booted out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's very weird.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No it was very stressful because I had been seeing Dr. (inaudible) for forever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so like, "Nope. We don't take staff anymore." I mean, they might have changed again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's what happened but I'm not sure. (PAUSE) I'm not sure how some people have been able to (inaudible) continuously but because I see people who had been but also people who started more recently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No it would've, if he hadn't retired I would have still been covered.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they grandfather people in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then they (inaudible at 00:04:49) more recently (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's like two different doctors. Anyway. You were saying something about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:05:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who you like anyway right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I really like her. I (inaudible at 00:05:15) that I didn't like. I mean, mostly because she really wasn't interested in talking to me or treating me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So... It wasn't super awesome. (PAUSE) But yeah, I don't know. She's like nice and very chill.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And suddenly appeared on the day with an enormous multi-color dragon tattoo like right here. I was like, "Wow." So I had also asked her if occasional pot use would create problem and she was like, "No." Which was good because I was wondering if that was, you know, I thought I'd ask. But going up on Welbutrin has helped some. [00:06:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like I still don't feel great. And so her question was sort of, "Is it good enough?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's just a really crappy time to start dickering (ph) with antidepressants for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're already feeling crappy and because the time of the year?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I was actually like, "I am okay with the idea of good enough. I'm like, "Yeah. I don't want to, I really don't want to (inaudible at 00:06:57) further with it right now. And, you know, like it's okay." [00:07:00]</p>

<p>I wasn't really too concerned that I haven't, I haven't really thought about was sort of (inaudible) I've had some times like of just feeling sadly overwhelmed with sadness. And so that's reduced in frequency but still happens.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By increasing the Wellbutrin?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was, so to me that was the symptom that she was most concerned about. Like other than work difficulty and insomnia. Which, I don't know. I hadn't really thought of that as something. Like it concerned me but I was (inaudible) that would...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...necessarily concern her it that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, I imagine (inaudible at 00:08:03) "Oh that's too bad." [00:08:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not just sort of be a warning symptom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah like that was the time in the appointment where she just looked really concerned and wanted me to call her if, yeah, if it started increasing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I mean part of what I was thinking about was (inaudible at 00:03:29) by Friday. So on my mind... But also, I had one of my friends up for the weekend. And it had been like a little stressful leading up to it because it was like, "Oh God. I have to clean this apartment." And the spare room that we have has also been like a cat room for a while. So, you know, clean that out do whatever, whatever. [00:08:59]</p>

<p>And she was here visiting for this festival in the Square. Which is like weird crazy leftie marching bands. And it's really fun. (PAUSE) And so, you know, we did stuff on Saturday and the weather was kind of crappy so we, you know, we did morning band stuff and not evening band stuff and then Sunday we kind of got up to go to a video parade from, you know, the Square and then they play at the university Square. So I was like, "Yeah let's go. We'll find somewhere to sit. We'll do the parade." And so, you know, we ended up doing that and I just like suddenly felt like... I started feeling like I was really catching a cold. You know, sitting outside in kind of (inaudible) weather not the best. [00:10:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we ended what Angela and I finally ended up deciding that we would go up to my apartment, she would take her backpack and stuff and just kind of like (inaudible at 00:10:15) in the evenings she would like go to the Square have to carry a backpack around through the festival and stuff and just go home. And I felt really guilty about it and also sad. Like I felt guilty because I was like, "Oh. I just kind of crapped out mid like having you over for the weekend. I just kind of hate for you to have to haul around your backpack." But the other thing was like, I just, like I wanted to go. Like, I did want to go with her to the Square like that was something I was (inaudible at 00:10:59) enjoyable. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was just really really sad that I couldn't do it. And then also Saturday, another, another friend was up and we were trying to find a time to meet. And so we were like midway through texting a conversation and she stopped responding. So I was kind of like, "I don't know if this means..." Like she has a kid so I was like, "Are you busy with child? Are you busy? Like, are you blowing me off? I don't know. Stupid texting." (PAUSE) And once I was already in kind of an upset mood about not being able to do what I wanted on Sunday (PAUSE) like I was really full on thinking about, "Oh God. What if (PAUSE) you know, what if, like I don't know, she's annoyed at me or something?" [00:12:03]</p>

<p>My friend Christy, like, we've weirdly had this slightly difficult friendship for a really long time. And it's been one of those weird things where both of us are kind of aware of it and neither of us really knows why. But like (PAUSE) I don't know. Like it's occasionally a little weirdly combative or weirdly competitive but also not. Like, I just (inaudible at 00:12:49) interactions where like I feel like we just have this really competitive interaction except that I'm not really competing with you because... Does that make sense? Like, the energy or the feeling of the interaction is kind of combative even though I don't think either of us were intending to and the words aren't necessarily combative. And so... [00:13:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:13:17) feel about that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...in any way (inaudible at 00:13:21)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or for any clear reason?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:13:35) my kind of big theory and it's a good theory. Senior year of college, so I roomed with her and one other girl. And they were both super popular with all their male friends and I was not. So... Which (inaudible at 00:13:57) But it was very frustrating to A, be in a situation where, "Yep. All these guys want my roommates and not me." And... [00:14:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:14:09)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and it just felt kind of... It just... It was uncomfortable. And it wasn't comfortable I think... I don't think either roommate was very happy with that either. It was just like a weird situation. (PAUSE) And then I don't know like a little bit at various points post college (PAUSE) like I sort of heard from friends of mine from Christy that Christy was like, "Oh. Karen is doing all these awesome things and I'm not." And then I've had times where I've been like, "Christy is doing all these awesome things and I'm not." But we have never really talked to each other about it in any real way if that makes sense. [00:15:00]</p>

<p>But I don't know. Like I feel like weirdly both of us going to the convention which she actually encouraged me to attend for a while. Somehow that was neutral territory that kind of just... the weirdness went away. But sometimes like I get a little nervous sometimes. I'm like, "I don't want it to be weird again. So I don't. Like I don't feel quite as confident, I guess, in our friendship because it's had so many times of being really weird. (PAUSE) And then she e-mailed basically me saying, "I was really exhausted from traveling with a kid." (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) (inaudible at 00:15:53) actually it was just me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, "Oh okay." And so that was helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:16:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah that's kind of like (PAUSE) I don't know (inaudible at 00:16:11) problems. It was a situation where both of us feel like the other person was blowing... Like I felt like Christy was blowing me off and Christy felt like I was blowing her off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that like sort of... I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But (inaudible at 00:16:29) e-mail and then I calmed down. (PAUSE) But yeah that sorry... Both Sunday evening and like Monday afternoon like both days I just had this, I was feeling really sad and upset and also super immobilized. [00:17:07]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm finding myself thinking about what we were talking about last week to do with your, your mother and what was missing. (PAUSE) You seem to be talking pretty freely about the sort of emphasis and all the sort of ways you felt. [00:18:01]</p>

<p>Like both in here now and in some of the interactions you're describing like and I guess you haven't talked about it with Christy you said? Or Angela I mean? So sort of all... (PAUSE) I guess I wonder if you have maybe a more vivid sense of sort of connection or disconnection with each of them and are maybe talking about it a little more freely here than you might have other times, in part, a reaction to what we were talking about last week. I don't think I know that or I'm sure about it but I'm sort of struck by how it all fits. [00:19:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like I wasn't... I don't know. (PAUSE) You know, one thing that does kind of sit is one of the conversations I was having with Angela. We were going to the parade. So there were a lot of people on the Square and a lot of people involved in the parade. So like walking to see the bands was like, "Hello. Hello. Hello. Cute lady, hello, hello." And I was talking to Angela about, "So I'm moving in a couple of years to somewhere with more sunlight." And I was having this weird, like, missing it, like missing the Square before I even left. If that makes sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Preemptive nostalgia. [00:19:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which was, I don't know... (PAUSE) Like I've been having a lot. I've been thinking about what I like and don't about knowing these people whenever I'm walking through the square. Like there's lots of very fun things about it. And sometimes I just want to be an anonymous person like walking to the coffee shop. (PAUSE) But I don't know it was just kind of the first time I was talking to someone else about, I don't know (inaudible) talking about like preemptive nostalgia like... I know that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things you're not missing at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like (inaudible at 00:20:45) now that there are other places with sunlight in the U.S. that have like artist communities and all these other things. But I haven't lives with like, I haven't lived in one for fifteen years. So yeah... (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So... Yeah I guess also like, Christy and Angela they're both people that part of the way we keep in touch is through, actually a lot of the ways we keep in touch is through you know, blogging and like various other things. (PAUSE) [00:21:17]</p>

<p>So sometimes I think there's more (PAUSE) in person sometimes like has much more, like, emotional effect behind it than with other friends. Like there are people I don't see that frequently who I see and I'm like, "Oh, it's good to see you." (inaudible at 00:21:55)</p>

<p>And with them I don't know... These other people I know it's like kind of like (PAUSE) like I'm kind of like happy to see them and glad I'm seeing them and also thinking and, "I'm leaving in two days or you're leaving in two days." So it's like... I don't know it's always a little, it always feels a little bittersweet. Like I'm happy but it's ending. I'm happy but also like (PAUSE) we don't see each other frequently and it's really hard to see everyone. (PAUSE) And I think part of why I was feeling really sad was I just was, I was sad I wasn't physically up to doing more stuff. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>Like Sunday afternoon after I sort of packed Angela off I was thinking, "Oh. I wonder if I could just invite Christy over to my house. Like, I know she has a car and they drove up. And I thought, "No. I really can't invite her over. Like I'm just too exhausted."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's sounds like you're feeling sad all around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's a really like. It's a very sad ending to the weekend that started out very happy. Like, like Angela came over and then we also hung out with a mutual friend over there. I saw friends and I saw friends' babies and that was great. But yet the end of it was just really sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:24:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then also going back to like... Coming back to work today was also... Chet has been away on vacation and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, so it was the first time we'd really had a meeting in probably three weeks or four weeks. And it was super frustrating. Like I didn't mind. I was sort of like, "I don't want to do this meeting because they're always annoying." But... (PAUSE) I don't know. I felt like he was trying to turn my words against me or... (PAUSE) So what we were talking about was... He was asking about the workshop and I said it was really great but I don't see it happening at the university. This is just a poorly designed workshop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry Can we just back up one minute?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:24:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm realizing (inaudible) Do you know what made you sad on Sunday? I mean it like it... Cleary some of it was like a chicken egg thing with not seeing Christy and the way the conversation ended through text and then like not feeling up to do stuff with Angela and it was like physical stuff too but it sounds like what you're saying like you were feeling sad seemingly beyond about that stuff as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of. Like it more like it kind of came all together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like... (PAUSE) I don't' know. I just feeling really sad about both things, both of those all at once and then also kind of fretting like (PAUSE) is it going to be harder to visit friends of mine like... My Chicago friends, I always think, "I go to Chicago several times a year, blah, blah, blah. They can come up here. It's really close." [00:26:17]</p>

<p>And I was worrying, I was just feeling like what if I can't do that as well anymore? Like, emotionally or physically or whatever. And it's never really been something I've thought about. Like it's always so close. (PAUSE) Yeah, feeling sad on Monday was one that was more kind of odd for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not sure about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I was, I was feeling like very low energy and kind of mopey all day. And then in the evening, I was just sitting on the sofa doing whatever and I just felt like this overwhelming like I'm really sad that it's over now. [00:27:05]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>I don't know. I mean, it was kind of related to... (PAUSE) I mean some of it was related to not being able to see people this weekend. The other was just like (PAUSE) I feel like I get so, I get, I often get so tired that like I haven't put away my laundry in a couple weeks. So I have like Monday morning I couldn't find the jeans I wore the other day. Which (inaudible at 00:27:55) black pants and I have a shit ton of black clothing and it's hard to find. [00:27:59]</p>

<p>But then I just like felt really frustrated and upset about like I had all this laundry that I have to put away and then I couldn't find something. And it sort of then tumbles into (PAUSE) something which I know is a huge (ph) reaction. Which is I sort of like, "Oh, the laundry's piled up this that and then I'm like, "And then it's going to be an episode of intervention where it's like," Which is a horrible show that I regret watching ever." But... (LAUGHTER) (inaudible at 00:28:49) But I feel like, "Okay. So then they'll go from like some messy laundry to somehow like, "Well this is clearly a sign that you are not mentally competent." [00:29:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which like I'm very aware that's not, not like. That's not happening. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That has your mom all over it I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean from the laundry to the intervention to the not being mentally competent to just being sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But also once I'm sort of caught up in this and then like (inaudible at 00:29:31) it's really hard to be like, "Okay. Well how about I put away laundry for fifteen minutes?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is also like another (inaudible at 00:29:51).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:30:00]</p>

<p>It seems to me you're like (inaudible at 00:30:45) we were talking about. You were talking about some of the things you felt that often (inaudible). [00:31:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm. (PAUSE) I don't know. From how it feels to me. It feels the same. (inaudible) talked about showing (inaudible) how I feel about things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I don't think you're doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess. Like... (PAUSE) I don't know why. (PAUSE) [00:32:00]</p>

<p>I mean it's not conscious if that makes sense, conscious, subconscious...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes some sense to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't think I would have noticed unless you said something.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:32:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like you don't want that to be true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't want but I had a hard, I've had a hard time expressing my emotions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess I want to retroactively (inaudible at 00:33:27) were talking about things. (PAUSE) And I'm also wondering why... I mean, you mentioned like connecting it to, I don't know, talking about my mom. And it's to say because it doesn't, to me doesn't feel very connected. (PAUSE) [00:34:09]</p>

<p>But then there's also kind of like wanting relationship that I didn't have and wanting to be able to have more relationships with some people than I can have. (PAUSE) Or (inaudible)</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel like I'm (inaudible) like I'm (PAUSE) twisting your arm a bit to see things this way?</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Like I don't feel forced. (PAUSE) Like I feel it's kind of (PAUSE) it seems like in my head that it should feel more something, I guess. [00:36:01]</p>

<p>Like if I'm being able to talk about things more freely. I don't know. It just feels like it should be more momentous something like... (PAUSE) I don't know. (PAUSE) I'm also (inaudible) in my head that that is a change. (inaudible) something. Which isn't bad. I just you know, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're struck by it though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:37:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That may have to do with the sadness that goes along being clear about how things work or have been.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) And being able to sort of, being able to connect something with... Like feeling intensely sad on Sunday was really... (PAUSE) I don't know. Like it felt less, a little less scary (inaudible) [00:37:59]</p>

<p>Monday I just was spending like (inaudible) came back. I was talking to Seth, "I just like, I feel real... I just kind of like... I can't think. I feel really out of it. I don't know why." And then she ran down, "Oh do did a lot of stuff this weekend. You did a lot more than you usually do. You didn't get in your like Saturday nap." Which is true. And like, "You have to work tomorrow." And I'm like, "Yeah." I mean, those things that are true but I'm not sure that's, like that's the reason why. [00:39:01]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you have a, a reaction (inaudible) about not coming in here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes? After, like, after I got you text message, because I had been asleep. I was... I don't know. I felt. Well I guess I felt super incompetent. I think I told you but I don't know. And just worrying about that. And then sometimes I feel like part of being depressed is killing my short term memory. (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) tomorrow. Ow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just stood up funny.</p>

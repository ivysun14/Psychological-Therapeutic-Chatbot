<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Again no one knows who you are or who I am.  All right.  So, but just ignore that.  What I'm, let's get on track.  So your daughter looks beautiful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Things are going well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  I last saw you, are you pregnant?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I lost the baby.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many weeks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, six weeks, yeah.  It just, it wasn't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a loss though.  It's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, well, when I saw you [DATE] you were pregnant.  Your mood has been stable; still mild cycling; highest for two days with racing thoughts; appetite okay; sleep disturbed; not suicidal; somewhat disorganized.  But you were pregnant; bipolar; attention deficit; and actively cycling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But because of the pregnancy, the pregnancy kind of trumped everything at that point and we pulled back on the Xanax, we stopped the Lamictal, we maintained the Prozac and the Provigil though -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so you're on a 120 of Prozac and 200 of Provigil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Um, well, let me just clarify.  After I got, um, you know, I found out that I wasn't pregnant anymore -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When, when did you find that out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Within, I guess it was six weeks.  So I don't know probably, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So September or October?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, was that August?  Yes, from say very beginning of October let's say, I'm guessing.  Um, I decided, I mean I started taking the Lamictal again.  I mean it got, I had to wean myself off to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do, had you felt worse coming off the Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I noticed a little bit of a change, but, um, no, I wasn't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In, instability or depression?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I, I don't think I noticed anything markedly, you know?  I, I had a lot going on too, you know, and I, I wasn't, it wasn't anything really dramatic, but I did notice I think physically I was getting used to like, I don't remember exactly.  Um, but I, but I decided I, I wasn't going to stay off of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just went right back on it.  And what dose did you get to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I went back up to, um, well, that's the thing.  I never -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'd been on 200.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never quite went up to 200.  I only stayed at -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've come, I've stayed at 100.  Um, but just to clarify -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You went -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With the other two medications, I've been, well, all along honestly for a long time I've been taking the Provigil, I've been taking 2 pills of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So 400?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And like I said, I kept on running out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think you were on that before.  I just, uh, the last time I saw you, we wrote down 200.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know you'd been on 4.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Four, 4 beats 2, right?  Four is a better drug, dose for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It seemed to be.  Well, this is the thing though.  I mean I guess you can tell me, but, and I kept on running out of the stupid Provigil because I didn't have enough.  I only had enough for the 20 or the 200, but and then as far as the, um, Prozac, I was taking 3 and then I, like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Three of the 4 of these.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Three or 4 because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was around the time when I felt like I was kind of going more from taking in that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And does Prozac stabilize you or only lift you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you cycle more when you raise the Prozac dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't, I don't feel like I've been, well, I don't even, I mean it's hard for me, my cycling.  I mean I, I, I'm like, well, yeah, okay.  Um, a little bit.  Just a little bit though.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] energize, it gives me a little bit of energy, but it's, um, it hasn't been working so well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's not [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it disorganizing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no, it hasn't been at all.  This summer, this summer I told you I was screwing around and, on vacation -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and I think, did your father say the same thing or, uh, someone said -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, he was concerned about -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you were disorganized.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went, but I screwed up with the medication.  I stopped taking it for a little, not for a long time, but maybe, and then it, it, it definitely put me in like this cycle [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The cycles, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really felt that manicky kind of, lots of ideas and all kinds of stuff that I hadn't [INAUDIBLE] at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is probably, because Prozac's an antidepressant is supposed to make that worse, but I see this in a lot of people that Prozac -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can be a mood stabilizer also.  So I think in you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Prozac's a mood stabilizer.  Probably not enough.  You probably need the Lamictal along with it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's a decent mood stabilizer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  All I know is it's definitely been, let's see, in the last, since he was [AGE].  I think, you know, like for a couple of years there I was doing great, during the pregnancy, and then two years after and overall I mean, no, I'm doing much better than I ever was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Compared to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, how I ever was, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, we're going on 10 years soon, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> May, [DATE] is 10 years for us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean there's no doubt about it.  If I don't, and I know you've said this, but if I do not take my medication and I'm talking about the Prozac, immediately notice a big difference in just the way I, I function.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So you, let's get back to the Provigil point though.  You liked 400?  Four hundred is a better dose for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I haven't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Been, and then lately I haven't taken that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't, [PATIENT NAME] think about this.  You don't have to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't take that in the last two weeks though because I had run out, but now I have it and I just don't know what to do because I've been feeling more down sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you using any Xanax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take a half of a, uh, the one pill's that 1.0 or is it point, I take a half a one every morning and that's all I take and for a while over the summer I was having such trouble sleeping that I was taking 1 every single night and then I remembered you said that's when I found out I was pregnant, to cut that out immediately -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I haven't been taking the medication at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Will you need a prescription for that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'll give you the 0.5s which is a fairly small dose -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And just break and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And try not to use too much of it and the Provigil clearly you need 2, huh?  Lamictal, I, I would vote raising that a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And Prozac, let's see how you do.  Uh, what's your mood been like over this past month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'd say it's been kind of, I have to push myself, you know, for like, I mean part of it I guess is the change in the lighting and stuff like that outside, but like I, I've just really been having to push  myself it feels like the last couple of months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not that much energy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, not much energy.  Like, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You dragging much of the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm not, it's hard to put it to, I mean I'm not like exhausted or anything.  I'm just more, um, I'm just sort of like dull a little bit, you know?  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah.  I mean, you know, and again complicating factor is my hormones because then that screws up my whole month and I get all whacked out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's wrong with your hormones?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just with, um, um, it changes like, the sadness part understandably I feel more acutely sad when I'm about to, you know, like during, like I feel like the changes in the month which is like a whole other factor it feels like, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do your moods cycle with your menstrual periods?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they get at their worst right before you have your period?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I even sometimes during the mid month I start getting -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You do [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not feeling so, not so much crying, but just sort of like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of course, that helps that.  You, what we often do is raise the dose around that time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you tried that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I don't, I did try it, I did.  I, I tried, um, I mean pretty much I've been like trying, like it, like pushing myself to get out of bed and, um, like just like and I always know that something's not right when I start having a certain thought in my head where it will be like, um, I hate my life, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hate my life and I've had that more and I don't really hate my life, I mean logically speaking, you know?  I have a lot to be happy about.  Just, um, but whenever I know that comes up I know that something's not right in my brain, you know?  Um, but I have, yeah, I just haven't been feeling in, in the, really I don't have any of that.  My brain is just not like, it's just kind of dragging.  Like my brain is dragging -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not so much my physical.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're on a low end.  Uh, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's been like that for a while.  I mean I, I push myself and then I'm okay and then, um, I used to, I feel far from my best, you know, even at work, you know?  And just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you cry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, once in a while.  Not, not, not crying for weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's your appetite like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I think it's been more for the carbs and things like that, yeah.  The thing is I, that Provigil stuff definitely seemed to inhibit my, my, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Appetite, but, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So these two weeks have been worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think my appetite's a little bit more since, since I didn't take the Provigil these last, like I don't know, I get mixed up because my sleep, you know, and I can't figure out what's doing what, you know?  Like my sleep's still -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, what's wrong with your sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I've taken the, the Provigil which I took it all along, you know, the last really two years my sleep's been disrupted.  It, I remember years ago I used to conk out, man, the whole night -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's more like, I think I have like that, what do you call it?  You wait, you sleep a dead four hours and you wake up.  That's what's been happening to me pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That got a little bit better in September, October and not, so then I thought well, maybe it's the Provigil, right?  But I haven't been taking the Provigil [INAUDIBLE] 40s and I feel like, like to conk out like last night and then I'll like feel like this sort of, you know how you feel like, um, like restless -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like to move around and feel restless it's like almost like I feel like there's energy coming out.  I don't know how to explain it, but it's not horrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In your legs especially, restless legs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My legs definitely.  I mean I have this thing where I, this is not new, but I have to like lull myself to sleep by like going like this -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what time do you wake up in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty early.  Like 6:00 the latest; sometimes earlier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you ever get into bright light in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or what's the light like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, in the morning when I wake up?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's always dark?  Dark?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty much.  I just think that, it never used to have that seasonal, but I, I do think that affects -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that affects the sleep wake cycle -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it also affects moods.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I don't like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I don't like it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's not what you like; it's a drug.  I mean the light counts as a drug and you need at least 20 minutes before 8:00 AM of bright light.  If you buy a light box -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We went to Florida.  We went to Florida for a week [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you feel better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I felt okay, but I still had to push myself and, you know, I guess part of it's, you know, your, my situation and, you know, but I don't know.  It's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, what's going on between you guys?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It almost like it's the situation hasn't changed that much.  It's pretty much ongoing, but I think it's more, when I'm feeling more, I'm able to, to just, I'm just more with him quicker.  Uh, besides, I'm not having those thoughts about hating my life, you know?  But, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're far less depressed than you used to be, but you still have mood problems, but you also have life problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, you know, I don't want to confuse even though we can't help not confusing it, but it, I don't want to over confuse your mood problems for your life problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Um, but it's like, you know, you're in Florida, you know, you think theoretically you're off, you know, I don't know.  It's like I didn't really care, I mean I tried to be there for [NAME OTHER], but I, I didn't, I could care less about doing anything really, but I did.  I did the things, but, but whether I did or not, it's like there's not like any excitement about doing anything, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, that's pretty much [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You think all of that relates to your challenging relationship with him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It definitely has affect, you know, 'cause [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are things going between you guys?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's all right, you know?  We -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not getting worse at least?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not getting worse, no.  It's pretty much, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he making a little money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He is actually, you know?  I don't know what he, you know, but he, I mean she's been like spoiled.  She's in like seven or eight different activities, you know?  Ice skating -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Karate, gymnastics, dance, uh, you know, acting, you know, and some other kind of things, swimming.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So she has a lot and she's the kind of kid -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The only child syndrome, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she's the kind of kid, we're lucky that she's not like trying something she doesn't like and she's involved with everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She likes everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, um, I mean she, she's getting a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We're very lucky.  You know, she's smart and everything, but, um, the thing is, you know, like what he does, he, um, he pays for everything because I have the house, right?  I pay for the house, mortgage, you know, taxes, everything, except for cable, I pay for everything and then what he does, is he's been paying for everything for her and then that, and he likes that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 'Cause then he'll say well, what do you mean, I pay for everything.  You know, that's what he likes to say, but meanwhile -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What about me?  You know, like we're living in this nice place, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, but he pays for her schooling.  She goes to [DEIDENTIFIED] which is like a preschool [INAUDIBLE] franchise -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Type place.  So she goes there and he pays for her for that; he pays for all of her activities.  Um, you know, I have health insurance, but he is contributing more.  That's, he is.  Now how much?  I don't know, I never sat down.  He has to tell me that he makes, oh, I probably make more than, I pay more than you per month, you know?  Right.  Okay.  Two thousand dollars every three months and for taxes, you know?  But, um, you know, it's a good thing that he's taking care of her.  My feeling is that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a great thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If he didn't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good thing.  He could, men walk away, right?  And then you're stuck -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There all by yourself.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  In that sense, believe me, I'm very grateful, but he's like a helicopter  parent.  It's, it drives me nuts, man.  I, never until I'd really been with him did I really understand what it's like to, for these parents, work with people that have like very black and white, you know, like black and white thinking and rigidity.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, my God.  It's nuts.  It drives you crazy, you know?  That's what I'm dealing with.  Like a very like [INAUDIBLE], you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's an ongoing stress; that's everyday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean he could say, you know, but, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that, you, and you feel like that's using you up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It takes a lot.  It doesn't affect her because she's more adaptable.  It affects me like he always wants to put, everything's a time constraint.  I have a really hard, I mean I'm, how old am I?  I mean to change my life like that it's just, he -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of time constraints?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it well, like, um, let me give you a quick example.  Like he, he's on a schedule, right?  Okay, fine.  [INAUDIBLE] and I'm not always there for that because I work late or whatever, but I try to be, you know?  But like he has her going to sleep since 6:30 to read, you know, she took her bath, reading some books, and by 7:00 she's asleep and then, of course, she'd get up at like 5:30 in the morning or sometimes 5:00 in the morning and that's fine for him because that's what he -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And meanwhile, I have to get up anyway, but like a lot of times in the morning, I want to try to spend a little time with her depending on how early I have to get in.  I'll try to like play with her a little bit, but I'm saying, but then same thing each night, you know, it doesn't matter if I have to work a little late, um, I just don't get to see her then, you know?  I have to fit in to her schedule and it's all about her.  It's a little, I mean I'm glad that she's honored and I love her dearly -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, things will change as she grows up a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, she's not going to want to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She'll -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, she'll rebel against that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Especially if you ally with her and [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but then let's see how that goes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, you know, physically it's just interesting, he's a very strong person.  I can't, it's too hard.  [LAUGHING].  It's hard.  People, because you think well, why don't you stand up for yourself?  I, I do.  I mean I stood up for myself even coming here.  I didn't want him to come, but he came and he wants to put time limits on everything.  Well, as long as we're back by 2:30 'cause he wants to do something.  I'm like, you know, I wanted to do this and this.  I want to have a little freedom with my daughter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You should go to the, uh, museum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm going to go visit my brother and my friend, [NAME OTHER], just got a place up in [DEIDENTIFIED].  Like I want to have some freedom and it's never like a sense of freedom, you know?  It's like all these, like under box, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, are, are you guys still in a relationship or it's just, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, um, I don't know.  I mean occasionally I'm with him in a sexual way, but I really have, pretty much no desire to be and he, he, you know, and then he can have, again that's a problem.  That's something wrong with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have the desire for other people though?  Are you [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Flirtatious and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I have a friend, we've been good friends for like 15 years that I see every once in a while, but no, not really.  I mean I, my life is sort of devoid of, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Well, it's focused on your daughter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That may change as she gets older too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you remain this disillusioned with him, you may, that may push you to seek -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Companionship elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, then you got real trouble.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But then you got to figure out what to do, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The way it is now -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The situation seems to work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but it's, it's kind of a, I don't know.  Yeah, it's, I don't like it so much, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's not your storybook romance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I guess a lot of people have issues, right?  I don't like, I don't like having to live with them [INAUDIBLE].  Well, you know about these people that have, have this 'cause he's not the kind with the, with the, um, [INAUDIBLE] or anything that like, first day I moved in, right, we moved in, we had the movers there.  He took all these drawers in the kitchen, brand new kitchen, he put his stuff in the one drawer.  I wanted one drawer because he usually cooks and stuff and he took it like a conniption on me the first, like who's he to determine that he gets that drawer that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I can get no drawers?  Like this is how crazy.  I don't it doesn't sound crazy to you as a psychiatrist probably, but like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, it's, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Inconsiderate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I don't know, it's, I have no idea, but he would, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he makes you fight for every little thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everything.  Everything's a fight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So lots of struggles?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  And so I [INAUDIBLE] after our fight, but, um, yeah, I feel bad for her and just pray to God that she's normal through all of it, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Usually it's the woman who's that way, you know?  Usually it's the man who, that has your complaints.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I know.  Yeah, but that's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the [INAUDIBLE] with me too -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a little reversed there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I, you know, I have a career.  I couldn't imagine giving up my career, but at the same time, you know, um, I don't like that he, you know, he gets to, he gets to, he drives her there and drives her here and, you know?  And he gets a lot of bonding and that's another thing, you know?  He was born Jewish, but he's like, he's like a Christian, you know?  He like celebrates Christmas and those kind and I never even knew he did this.  Like I never even know he was so into, I don't care so much like how [INAUDIBLE], you know, but I just want her to know that like, I want her, I, want Judaism in a cultural sense, more like a nationality sense, so it's important to me, you know, but like I'm not the kind that's going to be like, oh, let's do this and that and everything.  So if I don't push for anything, it's not going to even [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't you get a menorah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah.  I am going to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But what I'm saying is that like I have to, it's, I know that this is not a com, an uncommon kind of situation, but it's just again reflective of like the struggle that I have to have with her being, me being a parent, you know, and having like a [INAUDIBLE], you know?  So that's not strange sounding -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I imagine [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So, but, but I see you getting more depressed.  You have some rest, restless legs; you have some carbohydrate craving.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your sleep is not great.  Let's say it's interrupted.  Any suicidal thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Feel hopeless or helpless?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Self esteem decent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I think it's affected some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's [INAUDIBLE] you don't feel like you're terrible.  I mean you have a lot of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You feel very, um, you know, like your mom by, by the work you do, by the positive -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, reinforcement you get from your work.  Things going well in your work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But like that's, that's important for me in a way.  Like if I didn't have that, that, that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, hey, thank God you have it, you know?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] more of an escapism too.  It's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you look at it as, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Almost like an external or superficial thing, but it's really not.  It's the core of who you are and it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You give yourself to your career -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The satisfaction, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, and you get positive feedback and people say you're good -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and so [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Things are getting a little bit better with the cr, you know, for 2 years there I was just like, I'm starting to slowly [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're getting your billing done and all that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying not to be concerned.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying to just do like a sliding scale because I'm so bad with it.  I'm telling you, I have such potential I can't tell you.  I could be doing a lot.  I just can't do it all.  I just can't do it all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] billing services.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] you just outsource the whole thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I'm not, I'm not like a, I'm not that smart to be able to do it all.  I mean I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your brother should be good at that too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My brother?  Oh, my brother would help me in a second.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He feels bad that I don't let him help me.  I just don't, I don't know.  Out in a way I just want to sort of do it on my own, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, okay, and, uh, and your brother's doing okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, by the way, he asked me if he could get just 7 Provigil 'cause I guess he needed, he ran out or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does he have the coupon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know what he's saying.  Filling [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?  I think I may have giving him the free -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said he just needs 7.  I guess maybe he has the, um, rep, I talked to him today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He needs a prescription for 7?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, prescription for 7.  That's what he said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  That's not a problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He, you know, I don't get to seem him but he seems to be doing better than he was.  I'm so glad he came to see you -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 'Cause I was really worried about him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I can't say anything about him, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, he -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wish, I wish you could, but I, I, you know, I understand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if he, if he'd let me, I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He would.  I don't think he would, he would care.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's, still, it's not, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, you know, I mean like he, he's kind, you know, he's a [INAUDIBLE], you know, it's just, I think things are going all right.  He's in this program for this principalship stuff now, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he's a, he's a smart guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's a terrific guy.  I, I like him a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I hope you look after, I hope you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wish he would meet someone; get, have a baby already, you know?  That's, that's a big loss.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wish I could prescribe some good luck.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know?  I -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Four refills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's what I mean.  Good luck finding the right person because, you know, it'd, it'd replace one of the meds with a little -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, with some loving -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a little strange what happened -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With some companionship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With that woman that he married.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, well, can you give me any insight to that story because -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's bizarre -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's bizarre to me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, all I can say is that I never of all the girlfriends through the year, that I used to be real close to this girlfriends.  I mean one of them is like a sis, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I never was really that close of her and partially just because of our busy lives, you know, and I didn't live real close to them, but all I know is that for years it seems in the beginning she was wanting to get married.  She didn't want to be with anyone and he was always like, you know, kind of slow with the commitment thing and then he finally committed and I guess he realized he did care for her.  He opened up in a certain way, you know?  I guess he got mature enough to realize, you know, that he wanted to have a, and so at the end, she just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just like flaked out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Weird, just weird.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But any, any sense of what happened?  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think she, I think she probably, well, my thinking is that me and a friend of his think that she met, I think she probably met somebody at work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She met somebody else?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he probably gave her a lot of attention in a way that, and then she was probably comparing that to the, you know, but I think why get married then if you're not really, like for me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To turn off that avenue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then who knows.  My mother, you know, thought maybe she -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Partly was thinking about it even before that and she just said, who knows, you know?  But I'm glad in a way he's not with her because she's, she's un, you know, inconsistent, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right?  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's always going to end better to end sooner -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, now with you, I think you like the Prozac but, but something's not quite gelling here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> My vote is to crank up the Lamictal a little more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But see when I was taking the 200 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm telling you I didn't feel any different than I do now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm, I'm, I'm fairly certain.  I was wondering whether like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does the cycling happen -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you pulled back on, on Prozac?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, the summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Prozac and the Lamictal was, I don't know what happened to me then.  I was screwed, I know I didn't take Lamictal for, like about a few days and it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  So Lamictal is helping -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stabilize you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we need the Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're, you're arguing that you're getting as much stability as you ever got and you don't need more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, I don't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have much room to go on the Prozac.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One 20 is like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But do you think if we switched to a, I mean I'm, first, I'm not saying I'll never go back to it because it's always been good to me, but do you think it would help to just flush some different kind of antidepressant in me for a while?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We could.  I mean we've done that, you know, and, and I've seen you for such a long time.  We've played that game and we always fell back on Prozac although there was a while where augmenting with nortriptyline was good for you.  Do you remember that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That might be a [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's another that, that works nicely.  It's an energizing one called Vivactil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but I don't want it instead of Prozac.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that's, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But why don't we add something, see if you do okay, and then once you're okay, we'll pull back on the Prozac?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  Or you can pull right back on the Prozac to 80, but no less than 80.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, pull back on it?  Because you're thinking that that is effecting my, why would I pull back on it now?  Are you saying -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, well, you want to trade.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You want -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're right.  Right, right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To trade, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I see what you're saying, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I don't want to trade so fast because I know we're getting something from Prozac.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think, you know, I'm not looking at, I'm not grazing, but I'm looking to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, you are.  Go on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, I want to feel, I, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You want to feel manic like always and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, like a normal person I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And just the longer I keep you well, the more you miss being a little manic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm not as functional.  I'm telling you.  I, I am disorganized -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not as functional now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I am not.  I have, I'm just so disorganized.  It's, it's, and I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe you need more stability.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a job that requires a lot of organization and I do the best I can, you know?  Um, but my, like something gives like at home.  I just have [INAUDIBLE] things and it's, it's partially because my, you know, I just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, is, is that depression though?  What you've bargained for is depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Part of it's depression; part of it's, I don't know.  It depends on what's happening with me.  Sometimes it's depress, I definitely have been depressed where I'd be happy to just, it's like embarrassing.  I could just like go and sit there and put the TV on and just be a zoner, you know, and I don't like that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then just fall asleep or something, you know, or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you need a, uh, Prozac prescription?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So I'm giving, starting you on Vivactil.  Um, I'm writing that you take 3 a day, but just take 1 a day in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's an antidepressant or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's an antidepressant, but it, it compliments Prozac.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's, it's almost like switching you to Effexor or Cymbalta or one of the ones that has no epinephrine in it, but the good part is it's energizing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So my brain might be a little bit more energized?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To, to juice you up a little.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 'Cause that's what I need.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, that's what you think you need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, but then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're al -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If it gets too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the risks are always cycling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if you cycle more, you've got to call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've got to call me.  The Prozac -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know exactly what you mean.  Too bad it's like that, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, at some point we get it just right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?  You think so?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's not been easy with you because it's a fine line.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean don't you think though a lot of these people and maybe they haven't, a different rhythm to it, but like a lot of people that, you know, contribute to, you know, the world in whatever way, you know, they have their periods where they're more productive, you know?  Um, I don't feel as productive lately, but, yeah, I feel, like I don't, it's like I don't get to use my -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think everything's influenced by your memory of mania.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now I'm not saying you should learn to live depressed, but you should be happier with neutral than you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, yeah, the hyper mania you're talking about, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Um, I'm writing for 2 Provigil a day and I'll write for Xanax -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I need [INAUDIBLE].  And I wanted to ask you, we never quite got to this point, but I guess it's not the time right now, but I was just wondering like I remember when I was on Ritalin -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was so organized like for a while.  I can't believe how organized I was like at work and I had steps and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And Provigil doesn't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Give you any of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It gives me energy, but it doesn't, it doesn't give me the, um, that thinking ability to be really -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it all goes to, but I also my jolt, like I have a jolt reflex, you know?  It did, that stuff did make me like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If gave you the jerky stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like if someone came in, I'd be going.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, listen we can always try Ritalin again at some point.  Uh, given the mood disorder you have, well, I mean Ritalin's good for your ADD, but given the mood disorder you have, we're safer if we can cover 75% of it with the Provigil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's far safer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's safer meaning -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's safer -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As far as not creating -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For two, two things.  It doesn't rev you as much into mood problems -</p>

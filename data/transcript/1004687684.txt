<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a better day yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I spent about 80 percent of it reading "Jane Eyre". So it's less that I had a good day yesterday than I lived Jane Eyre's life yesterday, but that was good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I checked my calendar like four times because I kept thinking surely — you know you get that feel of panic of there's some important responsibility that I have that I'm not doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just kept reading. So, I'm doing better this morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't have anything in particular that I feel like I really need to tell you about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. Well, what pops into your head?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have you read "Jane Eyre"?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have. It's been a while ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's actually usually a high school assigned book.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like that, yeah.</p>

<p>[00:01:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was the first book that I ever taught. It's a really fun book to teach.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's (pause) It's like symbolism right here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Pointing big fingers at it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so the students get it. And I was teaching all girls, so they all liked it, which I was kind of surprised by because it's really dense. But, yeah, it was a good one for me to start with. And (pause) I very much sympathize with the main character. That's — yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She winds up with this guy named Darcy, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No? Wrong book? That's not right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm only laughing because James was saying — because I was like, "I read Jane Eyre today," and he's like, "Yeah, I still haven't read anything by Jane Austen."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I couldn't tell whether he was kidding or not. It was written by Charlotte Brontë, but whatever. She's an orphan. She's brought up...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm thinking of "Pride and Prejudice".</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, everybody does. She's brought up...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I did actually read "Jane Eyre".</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think it's that bad. I have to reread books every two years because I don't remember them from one day to the next. I mean, sometimes I don't remember a book the week after I've read it. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:03:00]</p>

<p>Basically, she's brought up in a situation where just nobody loves her, and she can't ever do anything right. And then she's sent away to school. And it's turned into a good thing for her, even though it doesn't start out that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She the one with like a mysterious benefactor?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that "Great Expectations".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. No I'm confused in a different way. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'm not a big fan of "Great Expectations". It's a bit corny with the mysterious benefactor and stuff like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm going to stop guessing now. (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Okay. I'm sorry I have to laugh at you. I'm not really laughing at you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it fine (laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) If you figure like — it is my job to know British literature, or was at one point. (pause) Which was hilarious because I had taken one college level Brit Lit class before I got assigned to it so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... the whole year was me just trying to be two steps ahead of the kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm</p>

<p>[00:04:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd read a book, and I'd say, "Okay, this is going on," and then tell them that that was what I thought was going on. It was pretty fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. It's hard for me not to feel bad about spending whole days reading like that. Like I feel it's a good rest. It's a break. So this morning I feel better and ready to do things and so forth.</p>

<p>But (pause) you know I do have to do a lot of pushing things out of my mind in order to do that. It also feels like I just can't put the book down. While I could return into my real life, [inaudible 00:05:12] to do that right now and nobody [inaudible 00:05:13]. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>[00:05:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why I don't read very much fiction when I'm working.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I have to finish the whole book. (laughing) I mean I read fast, but a 350 page book is a day. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't really matter what else you might have to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it's — it's much harder for me to pay attention to those things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I did apply to a job yesterday. That was kind of — it was one that I'd been meaning to — Franco forwarded me. It's a summer, part-time position as a research assistant for somebody in school.</p>

<p>[00:06:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Franco had forwarded it to me five days ago. I meant to apply right away, and just every time I sat down to do it, I'd freak out. So yesterday I finally did it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. By this time the position is probably full. But whatever, I did it eventually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would feel much better about myself if I were working even 10, 20 hours a week. Yeah (pause)</p>

<p>[00:06:57]</p>

<p>Yeah, so this is the thing. I need to take these breaks, or maybe I don't need them. But I feel as though I need to take these breaks and just kind of detach myself from the world for long periods of time and immerse myself in other narratives. You know, it's like I'm not me when I'm reading, and that's a real relief. (pause)</p>

<p>But then there's this backlash that gets to be worse than the release that taking a break is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel so useless right now (sigh). (pause)</p>

<p>[00:08:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the backlash is hitting you now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and kind of periodically while I was reading yesterday. But it's more like it'll start hitting me today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if kind of accumulates. The more — you know my typical pattern over vacations is to say, "I'm going to take three or four days and just relax. And then I'm going to get back to work." What actually happens is that I take the entire vacation and I just read novels. And I feel horrible about myself.</p>

<p>[00:08:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I — I don't know why. Yeah. And now, even though — and I guess I've usually though that I feel horrible about myself because I have things that I'm actually supposed to do that I' not doing. But now I don't really have things that I need to be doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) But that doesn't sit well with me. (pause) Maybe I — I need to be looking for an apartment, and I haven't even started that. I just freak out every time I try to, or every time I think about it. It's like I start thinking about it and it's like, I know that if I go there I'm going to break down and so I just don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>[00:10:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I just feel worse every day about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like it's getting progressively worse?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (long pause)</p>

<p>[00:11:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like I need to keep moving forward all the time. You know, like a shark.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to run out of air if I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then the things, the tasks that I really should be applying myself to are just so overwhelming right now, and terrifying. And I (pause — exhale) I — the easy thing — or the logical thing for me to do would be to say, "Well, I do want to stay in Greek Bible [ph? 00:12:12]. And there is a lot that I don't know about that. And I have a lot of books just sitting on my shelf that I haven't read. I could just work on that." But I just can't do that.</p>

<p>[00:12:26]</p>

<p>I kind of can't really even think about myself as a student right now. I [inaudible 00:12:33].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Mmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. If I follow, that seems to be the monster lurking everywhere. How intensely awful and sort of, I don't know, I guess self-hating you'll feel if you take up any of these things there are to do, like those books or the applying for jobs. I know you actually are able to get that done most — or a lot of days.</p>

<p>[00:13:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or the apartment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But by this point, I have 10 or 12 cover letters written.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The days that I — a lot of the days that I am applying are days when I'm not really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to stay with it that long.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's like, "Oh look. Someone else needs an administrative assistant but wants somebody with experience. Well, I'll just apply anyway."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh) So (pause) Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you having like — I think that's what you seem to be — to freak out about is the self-hatred that's likely to — sort of come over you.</p>

<p>[00:14:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess indirectly. What I actually am thinking about is, "There's no way I can succeed in this. I just — I can't do it. I'm not going to be able to do it well enough." (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It being the job, or it being finding the apartment, or it being...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Finding the apartment...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or finding a job. Or — yeah — working on school work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause)</p>

<p>[00:15:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't end up going to the Greek Bible — or Greek reading group last week. This week they're meeting tonight. And I'd already made plans to meet up with somebody else so I can't, which kind of saves me that struggle of, "Am I going to be able to make it there or not?" But I really want to do it. So I've asked them to keep me on the e-mail list, and I'll come back in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:16:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't know how actually finding a job is going to play out because stuff that I don't care very much about, I can do really well. But as soon as I become employed somewhere I start caring about it, and then it... (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I start freaking out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So all of the things that actually look really interesting are, you know, correspondingly frightening things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Scarier. Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>[00:17:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel any of that you're — I guess I wonder if you feel like it's sort of — you're worried about what to say, or what to talk about, or what occurs to you to mention out of concern that it's, "I don't know if we're going the wrong direction or moving forward or not or something?"</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>[00:18:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to say. I kind of can't tell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not consciously feeling like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not — I mean — (pause) But I do — I guess I — I don't know — Part of me wants to say I choose my words carefully, but I don't. Because once I get on the subject I just kind of talk. (laugh) And if I think that something is important, I talk about it. (pause) I don't know. I guess I just don't quite know what I'm supposed to be doing? (laugh)</p>

<p>[00:19:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's not clear?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh you've been very clear. (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay (chuckle)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just still keep expecting things to make sense eventually. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:20:29]</p>

<p>And so I (pause) Anyway — I guess what I say is directed toward that hope maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm certainly as unguarded with you as I am with anybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I have no idea what that means because I can't be in other people's minds. I don't know how other people are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well except when I'm at a party, and I've had two drinks. And I'm way more unguarded. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Then I'm unguarded with everybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes that works out really well, and sometimes it really doesn't. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) Uh huh. Yeah. I don't have a sense of you being especially guarded, so much as you're more choosing your words carefully.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I want to — I want to tell the truth. And (pause) sometimes it's hard for me to tell what that is out of the things that I could say. (laughing)</p>

<p>It's very common for me to say something that I utterly believe at the moment that I'm saying it, and then immediately say, "No, that's not actually what I think." Or I guess when I think about myself and about why I am sick or why I feel so bad, there's this whole network of possible narratives that is in my mind. And I'm trying to choose the one that I think is truest.</p>

<p>[00:22:34]</p>

<p>(pause) Maybe?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you just don't really know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) That seems most likely. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) It sounds to me like you're (pause) somewhat invested in the idea that you could know somewhat and that (pause) it's more than that. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:23:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know the days when I — I guess face up to the fact that my life really does not make any sense right now, are really, really painful days. So when I'm not [inaudible 00:24:16], I don't want to go there. (teary).</p>

<p>I always kind of know that that's the case, but I really don't want it to be the case, and so (sigh) so I talk —(teary) I talk and I think and I act as though (sigh) there were a structure that I don't think there actually is. But I don't know how else to have conversation or function. You know, it's like chaos is just right outside the door, so I just keep the door shut. (laughing)</p>

<p>[00:25:18]</p>

<p>I'm having a good day today. I want to keep having a good day. Sorry.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, I'm going to put a note I'm re-routed (ph? [00:25:58]) at the moment, so I'm going to make one of those Achilles and the tortoise statements.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay (laughing)</p>

<p>[00:26:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You probably couldn't really say something that wasn't, in some important way, true. Like whatever you had to say would express honestly what your thought or view was, even if you, at the same time, didn't quite believe it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or knew it didn't make sense. It points towards something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really like that line "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) I forget who said it though. Yeah. No that makes sense.</p>

<p>[00:27:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in a setting like this, it is not necessarily the case at all that the things that make sense or cohere in the moment are the most illuminating or the most helpful. I'm not saying sense is bad...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but (pause) that whatever comes to mind and where that lead will relate to where you're at and what's going on with you, as much when it doesn't makes sense to you or doesn't seem right, (pause) as when it does.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I agree with that.</p>

<p>[00:28:27]</p>

<p>(laughing)</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to get there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I guess I think what you were saying makes a lot of sense. That you work hard. Your picking the truest things is a way of maintaining the fantasy that things make sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is very protective.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I suspect has been for quite a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Sharp inhale) Yeah. So go back to "Jane Eyre".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I really sympathized with the character and still do. And I think I first read it when I was 12 or 13. The main character, the first tenth of the book is her as a 10-year-old being raised in this house where everybody hates her. Nobody loves her. She's continuously abused, and she feels alone all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm</p>

<p>[00:29:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if I tell you that that really, really strikes a chord to me, I don't want to be unfair to my family in that way. Because that's not what life was like for me. It's just what it felt like. (teary) But it was what it felt like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it seems to me that each piece of that reflects something very important about where you're coming from. Most clearly, or most obviously, the way that the book struck a chord like that, also the way that you're really worried about presenting your family in the wrong light and probably being too critical of them. You worry about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that you perhaps are inclined to step away from some of what's so emotionally painful about both of those things by focusing on what was actually realistic and what actually happened. And though, it's all in there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And because — (sigh) I was a miserable, miserable child. But I was not an abused child. I didn't have a bad childhood. But I really did. I don't know why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Sometimes that happens.</p>

<p>[00:31:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Yeah. Clearly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) And then I think, "What does it matter what my childhood was like?" Another part of "Jane Eyre" is that Jane gets the fuck over it. She grows up. She forgives her family, her cousins who raised her. Like truly forgives them, and she doesn't have the same sense that no one can ever love her, as I do (teary). What the fuck's up with that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean — what — why should it matter what I felt like when I was 10? Because I am 26 and I have a really good life. People love me, and I know that they do. (teary)</p>

<p>But I still have to look for an explanation of why I feel like no — there's no way that people could actually love me. That's the closest I can find to one. But again, it's saying, "This has to make sense in some way." When I don't know that it does. (crying)(sigh)</p>

<p>[00:33:16]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Maybe it's just a problem with being and English major and a historian. I just live too much according to narrative. When you're doing history you have all of these pieces, and you have to pick them out and tell a story. That's what it is. You know that the story is not actually what happened, but it's the closest approximation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why I love history. (pause) I just don't — I don't have a way to make sense of where I am right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nope.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I don't' deserve the friends that I have. Nobody deserves that. Nobody can do anything good enough to deserve that kind of friendship. I deserve it probably as much as anybody else does. But — I don't know what to do with that.</p>

<p>[00:35:14]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel confused and guilty about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About the love and relation you have with the people around you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. About — Yeah. That they have for me. (pause) I don't — it's been particularly — the last few months it's been really hard to deal with. (sigh) (pause) It's just — it doesn't — it doesn't fit. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:36:57]</p>

<p>It's painful for me when people do good — do nice things for me. It doesn't fit. (pause) The thing is — and everybody — every other area of my life to everyone else, people want to hear an account of myself. They want to hear how I'm doing, and they want to hear it in a way that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I want to give that to them. So it's hard for me to say that's not what we're doing here, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I see. So...</p>

<p>[00:37:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that's not — that's certainly the way that therapy has gone for me in the past. And I don't know whether that's because it's been a conscious on the therapist's part or unconscious, or just my deciding that that was what they wanted out of me and trying to give it to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah I had wondered a little bit if your deliberateness and seeking the most true or accurate thing was all to do with the worry that I would see things or figure things out in a way that would make you feel vulnerable that wasn't as clear to you. But it sounds much more like what you're saying now. That (pause) it feels like a responsibility you have</p>

<p>[00:38:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or a burden.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't feel burdensome...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...necessarily. It just — (pause) I feel like this is how people expect to be able to help me, is for me to tell them my story in a way that is a story. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like that's kind of minimally what you have to bring to the table.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like showing up in the ER and not being able to describe your symptoms.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to be able to tell them where it hurts and something about how it happened and what's going on for them to know how to triage you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:39:46]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder (pause). I still wonder about the... (pause) You're speaking more to, I think, a feeling of guilt and inadequacy about not being able to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like (pause) I feel like I've told my story to a whole lot of people...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...over and over and over again. Starting from the beginning a whole lot of times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've told a lot of different versions — kind of whatever I thought was most...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... true at the time. And I can't figure out what's wrong with me (crying)</p>

<p>[00:40:57]</p>

<p>And I'm just not doing it right. (crying) You know, when I called you last week and was just in so much pain that I couldn't even articulate words, that's been going on since I was 8 years old.</p>

<p>I've been crying myself to sleep at night my whole life. And it always comes back. (pause) And every single time I feel like there's no possible way I can bear this anymore, but that is my — that is the story of my life. (crying) But it doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>[00:41:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible 00:42:00] past an hour?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I stopped believing in God because people would talk about prayer and how God would answer one's prayers. And I prayed for that to go away. (crying) And eventually I thought if God would create me this, like a fly with its wings pulled off, then that is not something that I can worship. That's when I was about 13 or 14. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:43:20]</p>

<p>You know — I've worked really hard to grow up. And I'm really proud of the ways that I have gotten to be able to have good relationships and have close relationships. That's something that I did. It's not something that I was born with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not something that I was trained to do when I was little. That's something that I chose, and that I learned. I'm really proud of that. But, you know, I still cry myself to sleep. It didn't go away. (pause) (crying)</p>

<p>[00:44:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I guess I think you're often working hard in here to try to find some way to tell me about what's going on, such that we'll then be able to really make sense of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that (pause) I guess I can't shake the hunch that there's some part of that, I may be wrong about this, that's also to do with your...</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it has to do with fear, you're probably right (laughing). I'm afraid of everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I had a vibe at the moment specifically. (pause) The idea of being unable to be coherent, or to know much about what you're saying or what it means to be a mess in that particular way, not a mess in other ways, which I think doesn't scare you so much interpersonally. But maybe in the sort of lost-your-head way, do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>I don't think you defend against or are self-conscious about being really upset in front of people you're close to or can be open with. But I guess I think you might be worried about (pause) not making sense.</p>

<p>[00:46:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No. That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) probably because of something about the vulnerability there, being like that. But which you feel, not so much of that as in terms of having a responsibility to be the right sort of participant in the conversation, who in order to be constructive must be coherent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have to stop for now, but we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>THERAPIST: This, is session number six, 1970, client number 0735-103.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm not up to sitting for an hour.

</p><p>THERAPIST: You're tired?

</p><p>PATIENT: I've been to visit relatives over the weekend. Caught a cold, someplace. I should have stayed in bed this morning. Can't think of something that I was thinking of the other day that I wanted to bring up. Now I can't think of what it was. 

</p><p>I don't know. Maybe I'll think of it later. I've got this theory of everyday in every way things are getting better and better at work. Should look at it from that way. (2:24)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Are you wondering about that?

</p><p>PATIENT: My line of work I have time to wonder about lots of things. Also good reason to wonder about lots of things. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I guess you're not feeling so clearly optimistic as you were last time I saw you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, not anymore, but not any less I don't think too. Just that things haven't gotten better or worse since last time. Let's put it that way. Still I have reason to believe that there's something just possibly something physically involved in this problem. And it seems like when you go to a doctor, even an urologist, you have to convince him that you have a problem. It's not from the standpoint where you go in and say here's my symptoms and they say, ah-ha here's your problem. It seems, like, more of a and now here's what the symptoms are. And then they'll say well, I don't know. Let's see here for you. If you look at it from this standpoint maybe there's a problem here and maybe there's not. (3:54)

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's so vague.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's so vague and I guess they have reason to be. Maybe they don't want to step out on a theory until they're sure the theory is there. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Because it's frustrating not to get a real answer. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm the kind of step out on a theory whether I think it's there or not. Most of the time let's be damned, but then a lot of times it upholds me. I tell my wife there last night that I still have this theory that it was, there was something, in my mind at least, wrong with the prostate gland. But if I could just got the doctor to, you know, convinced that there might be a problem there and then there was a part where you test for this problem at least then maybe I can make some progress. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You had to get it really checked out for sure. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, without spending a fortune on it. Unless the fortune comes out of somebody else's pocket.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Something that's been occurring to me here lately, I think this, is what I was trying to think of awhile ago, is the fact that each time I have one of these sessions set up for a particular time it seems like it's a little harder to get here. Now, the first I went in and I think with a really completely optimistic attitude and maybe that's turned just a little bit to pessimism now. And I let things maybe that wouldn't have interfered before interfere a little bit now. (6:16)

</p><p>Awhile ago there I was in my boss's office sitting there while he talked long distance to the Missouri lab and I really showed him by getting up and getting out there and on down here because on my way down I ran into traffic problems had to go the third or fifth turn and come back and...

</p><p>THERAPIST: I think I see what you mean, like, three weeks ago you would have been out of there with time to spare. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, in fact I would have left and hour and a half early just to be here, you know, on time. Seems like now I say well now it only takes about 30 minutes. I'll allow myself 30 minutes and then it takes 35-40 minutes and I'm late. So, it's got me wondering if there's something more working on my mind saying well this, isn't as important as it used to be. It's just circumstances. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: When you look at the way you are. What seems to be your attitude about coming? It looks to you, like, maybe you're getting a little less enthusiastic or a little less confident in it? Something like that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Now right offhand I can't put my finger on whether it's that or something else. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Are the sessions a disappointment to you in any way? (8:02)

</p><p>PATIENT: Let me think now. I wouldn't say they were a disappointment. I'd say that I was expecting some things that didn't happen. Maybe this, is partly because my wife told me the things that she had felt that would happen and after talking to you you find out that they're not going to happen. This, isn't a disappointment. It's just I wondered if maybe, you know, if being more thorough. According to her, there was going to be a physical involved in this and things like that, but now I see that there's not and maybe that's part of the reason why I've just turned to pessimism. Because I still have this faint idea that maybe it is physical and not all psychological. I think that part of it, you know, a great deal of it is psychological.

</p><p>THERAPIST: I guess, like, when were not addressing the possible physical side of it. It seems like less (inaudible at 9:19) going. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, to me and you have to attack a problem from all sides. And if we're attacking it from just the inside often just half of a picture maybe it just doesn't seem complete. 

</p><p>I'd like to be more aggressive than I am allowed to be a lot of the time. Just picking something out of the air. Well, from the standpoint of work, when I have a project I like to have complete control of the project and like I said attack it from all sides. Try all possible avenues and if the limitations set before the project ever starts it seems like (inaudible at 10:16) possibility of failing. Not from my own standpoint. (10:23)

</p><p>THERAPIST: And, like, I guess that applies to these sessions. Like, the limitations here. Like I'm not, like, looking into the physical side of it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I thought, I guess I had thought that there would be a whole, well first of all, I thought there would be a complete barrage of tests, you know. Psychological and physical and then there would be a panel of analysis, let's say, of what the problem could be. And then there'd be possible solutions tried and things like this, but it seems like we're sort of limited to a narrow attack. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean. Like, it's not only the physical stuff, but also not, you know, solutions and not trying things out. And, you know, not giving a real battery of tests. Maybe I should respond to some of that. Like, about the physical side of it. Like, you know, because we don't have any doctors on our staff, which you know. So that, you know, but by all means, you know, go get it checked out, you know. (11:54)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, like I said, the first time or two that I went to this urologist I was very disappointed because of his attitude more than anything. It wasn't his, the way he approached it or anything. It's just the idea that he gave it the, more of the idea that it wouldn't be a success than that it would be a success. I don't know. I like to go at things with an optimistic attitude. And when you go in there and the guy says well, it could be, but there's not much chance of it being and we'll check it out just to be sure and this can (inaudible 12:37), you know, but what the hell.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it doesn't give you quite the confidence of the worthwhile things to do. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Why the hell am I here if he doesn't think there's any problem then why should I be here. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I guess there was the other thing you said about trying out solutions and stuff and... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I felt that there would be some attempt to say well, now why don't try this the next time you and your wife have intercourse. Try such and such and all and I'd have to run home and say alright, here's what they said to try. Let's try it. And there isn't or there won't be anything like that.

</p><p>THERAPIST: If you had some ideas about something along those lines I'd certainly be happy to discuss it with you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think one of the ideas that has always been in my mind is the fact that my wife isn't completely receptive to me. Of course the more you read the more you find out that this seems to be characteristic of most marriages. There seems to be, for the most part on the part of the woman, it's oh, it's my duty. I'll do it, you know, but not any more than I have to. And yet on the other hand...(14:15)

</p><p>THERAPIST: It sounds like that's not the most stimulating, arousing, exciting kind of reaction.

</p><p>PATIENT: It doesn't stimulate you at all when you go home and, like I said, you go home and you jump in bed and she says no, not tonight. On the other hand, you read these stories in books and in my case it's even been verified about while the cat's away, the mice will play, you know. And you wonder while I'm out you go home and jump in bed and she says no. Why is it that when this boyfriend calls and says tonight, she says oh, goody, yeah? There's just something incoherent or something incompatible or we just don't match up. Like they say, I guess, the grass on the other side of the fence is always a little greener. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: But I guess when your wife isn't eager when you're eager, like that's one thing that really gets in your way. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, nothing can turn you off like an oh well, if I have to. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: When you're all eager and ready to go and all of this and...

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess, like, it's all very well to say, outline that and say that's a problem, but it isn't, you know, it doesn't seem very solvable. (15:51)

</p><p>PATIENT: Another thing that's always bugged me is the idea that to me it's a 50-50 thing and even from the standpoint of initiating should be the woman who initiates it once in awhile. And it just seems that it never has happened. Maybe it has, but to my recollection right offhand it just doesn't ever seem to have happened that way. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's like you always have to bring it up. You always have to suggest it. She never does and I don't know why. I guess if I were you it would make me feel like well she never initiates it, she can't want to very much. Maybe it would be sort of nice for her to turn you on for a change. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Boss came up with the idea today that I should run down to Missouri. So, the first thing that comes into my mind is well, can I take my, you know, I didn't say this, but to myself I said, let's see now how can I take my wife with me. I want to take her with me. Nothing (inaudible at 17:38) so much that I don't trust her anymore. It's just the idea I'd like to have her along, you know. And it just occurred to me that maybe I wondered if she had ever was in my situation would she consider taking me along, you know, on a business trip. (17:55)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I wonder if she's eager to be with you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm not, a couple of months ago when I asked her if she wanted to go. She said yes, you know, but I got the impression that she only was going because I wanted her to and if she had her druthers she'd just as soon stay home. It works in on the idea why would she take me if it was the other way around. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I see what you mean. Like, it didn't seem like she really wanted to for herself because she wanted to. It didn't seem like that at all. I guess a lot of times you end up feeling like she's not eager for you sexually. She isn't sort of anxious to be with you. She doesn't care about you that much. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's the impression I get. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I guess that has an effect on you too.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I went to great extent more than is desired, I guess you'd say. I'd like to be able to insist that I don't understand her feelings. I don't, maybe she does, but she just isn't portraying it in a way that I am able to perceive. (19:59)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you wish you could believe that you were wrong.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, maybe I even believe that I am wrong, but I can't quite verify it. At least I think I might be wrong, but I really don't have any way of verifying it or something. Maybe I'm just not able to understand her actions as well as I should. One thing she does that really bugs me is that whenever she, we rode with some friends over to Ohio over the weekend and she was telling them things and every once in awhile I'd catch her telling things that weren't really true. 

</p><p>But this was her way of doing it, you know. She has this way of making things more to her liking, I'd guess you'd say, when she tells them than they are. Like, she'd tell them about the job interviews I'd been out on and when I didn't really, you know, get a good response from the company, like, she'd make it look like well they really, you know, wanted me, but they this that and the other reason couldn't. And it bugs me sometimes the way she, well to me, it's just out and out lying. 

</p><p>To her it's just her way of telling things, I guess. It's not really a lie. It's just the way she looks at it and it's. When I, you know, I sit there and I know all the facts and everything and say well, not that's not true, but I just sit there and listen. It used to be that I'd correct her every time that she starts telling these things and they wouldn't come out just right and I decided no, just let her tell it the way she wants to. And if it comes back and hits her in the face one of these days, well then that will be her problem. (22:02)

</p><p>THERAPIST: She causes the problem, you know, let her cope with it. Kind of like it tires and keeping yourself up to make the effort to correct her. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I was telling her last night there on the way back to, I was talking to this guy, it's her cousin and his wife, but they're about the same age as my wife and I. And I was talking to him out and on the patio Friday night or Saturday night. Anyway, we were out there alone. We got to talking about and I said something about wanting to go play tennis, couldn't find anybody and I said finally ended up playing tennis with my wife. I said she's a lousy tennis player. 

</p><p>He used to know this girl who lived in one of the suburbs out here near us that he liked to play tennis and she was, oh young, 18 or so and real nice looking, hadn't been married very long. So, we got started playing tennis and after, oh, two or three tennis sessions or whatever you want to call it. Why, she called it quits and I said, to me, it seemed like her husband probably got jealous of him and this guy kind of confided in me and he was, he's the type that's, what I call overly religious, and you just very strict, you know, doesn't do their advents (ph) and very strict in his beliefs, you know. (23:53) 

</p><p>And he got to confiding in me and telling me that one time in the past school year, he's a teacher, or the year before he had this girl in one of his classes that likes to play tennis and he likes to play tennis and she was real nice looking. And they'd gone out and played tennis several times. He said of course I didn't tell my wife. So, I told my wife and I told her not to tell his wife because if ever got back, you know, she might not understand. And of course my wife takes it and says well, you know, she knew that things like this happened all the time and she took it and this attitude that she has about a lot of things kind of bugs me still. She likes to give the impression she knows so much. A lot of the times she really is operating on old wives' tale or something like that type thing. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Irritates you to see her take such a knowledgeable position. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess it irritates me to see a lot of people take this, I'm expert and I feel when you, even if you know what their background is, you know, you can realize that they're not that knowledgeable in that field. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: That's arrogant to you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's sort of a tinge of arrogance. I always look at things that I tried to or hoped that I'd do or something, but I look at it from the standpoint when I know something about the subject and I'm interested in learning more, but it seems like a lot of people try to say well I know everything there is to know about that subject and can't tell me anymore. You know, yet they really don't. (26:14)

</p><p>THERAPIST: It makes you feel like, who does he think he is? 

</p><p>PATIENT: This, is especially true, I guess, down there where I work there's a kid that has a high school education and when I came in he was a technician doing quality control work there in the lab and that was strictly his job. He got sent out to on an assignment maybe once or twice and it seemed like, to me, what I could tell that he didn't do such a hot job. And of course this probably is a biased opinion, but as far as I could see, I think, he went back to his technical quality control type work. 

</p><p>And then for some reason or other I hear about, oh, six months, a year ago somewhere back in there he got started on this one project and developed an air of I'm the only one who knows anything about this type of thing, you know, and kept putting forth this air and at the moment he's going to a lab and researching a line of a particular product, you know, that we produce. And it seemed like, you know, he's been promoted to a consulting specialist type position, you know. No, nothing official, you know. Just that he's assumed this role. 

</p><p>And about the same time he started assuming this role I immediately assumed a defensive where if they think I'm going to do his work while he's out doing what I feel should be my work. They got another thing coming. So, this has also been the problem where I work that it seemed like to me that that was a type of job that I should be doing, you know and they're giving it to this guy, to me, doesn't have the background for it. (28:31)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Bit daunting to see him do it when he doesn't even have the background.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and what really set it off was the fact that we had one of these machines that we bought from a company come in and we had them giving the project of setting it up and making it work and everything, which is just a matter of plugging it in and putting it together a little bit. And then we bought a second machine from the same company and I was given the job of setting it up and making it work and on and on. When it came in why I got the book and started trying, you know, to learn a little bit about it. It's different than (inaudible at 29:17), but not too much from what I had been doing. And this guy came along and said well, now that was his project, you know. So, I made it messed him up said here's the book so round it up, which was, as far as I'm concerned, it's handled. He wanted that job. That's fine. It's his. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 29:36)

</p><p>PATIENT: And so maybe therein lies a part of the story. I don't know maybe I was supposed to go with it and pursue it and shove him out of the way, but I'm the kind that if he thinks he's the expert. I'm fine let him be the expert. (30:05)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like, in retrospect do you think maybe I should have kind of stayed in there and fought for my space? But you don't want to do that kind of thing.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh no, get to the commercial and I'd rather switch than type. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I like your attitude. Well, okay if you claim to be the expert you do it.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think if he ever came to me and said could you help me out on this? I'd tell him where to go. I don't know I've gotten that several times. I come back from the lab say late in the afternoon and want to get my car unloaded, you know, before quitting time or maybe I have a truck even that has to have all this stuff unloaded onto the storage room and I have to go turn it in. And I come into the building and I ask him and the other guy that works with him if they'd come and give me a hand. Well, the other guy will do it if I ask him. This kid, well, I ask him and he'll just ignore me. 

</p><p>You know, he's just not going to do anything that would help me in the least way. So, the other day when he came in from the lab with his car all loaded and he'd like to have had somebody to help him I just completely ignored him, which I felt was what was due, you know. But psychologically I have removed myself from that place until such a time as I can get another job and go to it I'm just going to do what I have to and that'll be it. (31:56)

</p><p>THERAPIST: You're damned if you're going to sweat the people who don't appreciate you.

</p><p>PATIENT: What I have to do will be what my boss tells me to do. Other than that, forget it. 

</p><p>My mind goes from one subject to the next just instantaneously. I was thinking about this cold, head cold that I have and yet I feeling, you know, sort of physically don't feel too good. Yet when I go home tonight I'll still want to jump in bed and say hey come on let's have it, you know. Whereas it seemed like to me a woman with a, you know, a head cold or something would say, you know, no, not tonight, you know, just put it off two or three days. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but what happens to, like, the times, like, you know, everything starts up, you come home all eager, like, the scene ought to be set and then, you know, something happens along the line to mess it up. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Alright, the first thing that happens is, like I've said before, I think when I come home it seems like everybody, not only my wife, but from the kids, well I expect it from the kids, oh, you're home again, you know, so what? But even wife, you know, I come home and it's still her come and get me a kiss. I have to go pursue her and, you know, get the kiss from her. Through my own initiation. (34:05)

</p><p>THERAPIST: When that happens how does that make you feel?

</p><p>PATIENT: Like why the hell should I come home? Or when I come I'll just go onto the basement and sit down in front of my TV set and, you know, 30 minutes later when they happen to notice I'm there. Oh, when did you get home, you know? I told them not long ago that I used to look forward to her coming home, but I was there, you know, I watched the window and when I see her coming home I go to the door and meet her, you know. And now when I see her coming home I, oh, well she's home. And there for awhile I kind of forced myself now you just stay right here and watch your TV and if she wants to come in here and say hello to you after she gets home fine. If she doesn't then that'll be the extent of it, you know. Now I don't have to force myself. I can just sit there. She can come home. She can come home stark naked for all I know and wouldn't be any different. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well, she wants to see if she can come to you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've often thought about the idea of not, just not initiating any sex action for a period of time just to see how long it'd be before she initiates it somehow. Well, maybe I've tried it. I don't really recall, but I don't know if I can hold out that long. I have trouble holding out for three or four days. She can hold out for three or four weeks, I think. (35:51)

</p><p>THERAPIST: You wouldn't win a waiting game. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd go stark raving mad crazy before I got what I was wanting. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: What happens when you start initiating some sex? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Depends on how long it's been since I initiated it. How successful I was the time before. Whatever mood she's in. It just depends on so many things. It seemed like there's so much chance of it not coming to pass. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: There's a big chance that she'll say, oh, not tonight. Don't really feel like to. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: What happens then when she says no, not tonight?

</p><p>PATIENT: Disgusts me. I get frustrated, disgusted, wishing there was, wishing I had somebody else I could try out that I want to say well, I'll go see so and so or something like that. And sometimes I think if there was somebody else that I can say I'll go see so and so tonight my nightmare would come back. I really shook her up about four or five months ago there. I was feeling very depressed and I told her one day I thought I'd just not come home. 

</p><p>I had a few dollars in my pocket. I'd just get in the car and just go someplace else. You know, two or three weeks why she'd be wondering what might have happened to me I suppose. This upset her and she told me she didn't ever want me to do that. She wanted me to come home and say I was leaving you if I was going to leave, which from my standpoint is the fact that she just wanted to know I was gone so she could go someplace else. Not from the standpoint that she'd worry about me or anything. 

</p><p>Even if she did say that that was the way she looked at it she'd worry about me. Which is what I, whenever she asked me there once about two weeks ago that if I was going out of town next week? I said why? She just wanted to know. I said yeah, so that you could get something arranged if I was going out of town. And of course this hit her the wrong way and it was entirely the way I looked at it, but that wasn't the way she claimed that it was meant to be. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Is that the way you see it when she asks about your plans?

</p><p>PATIENT: It's not really from a concern for me. It's more from a concern for herself, you know, and what am I going to do and what can I do and things like this. And she gets perturbed when I look at it that way even if it does have a bit of foundation. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: And I guess you really resent it that she seems always to be looking out for what she can do.

</p><p>PATIENT: For instance, last night we're right in the middle of a sex act she came up with this whole so and so's out in Seattle. One of the guys that she had a dinner date with. He's out in Seattle. I felt like blowing up and saying well, what in the hell do I care if he's in Timbuktu or wherever. I just don't give a damn where he is.

</p><p>THERAPIST: You probably also and what are you doing bringing it up now? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Like that she was thinking more of him than she was of me when she should have been thinking entirely of me. It really deflates your ego fast. (39:55)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, here you are, you're having sex with her and she's thinking of someone else. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You, from the standpoint of a woman, do you think this, is typical of women that they don't completely enter into it mentally?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I guess, like, this kind of question is so abstract. Is that just the way it is?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, is this just typical or is it just her? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Is it just her and I'm I getting cheated? 

</p><p>PATIENT: The idea that it goes back to this joke that you ask if anybody knows the difference between a prostitute, a nymphomaniac or a whore, a nymphomaniac and a wife? And of course they'll say no. You say well the whore is the one that says what you're not through yet. And the nymphomaniac will say what you're through already. And the wife will say, you know, we just got to paint the ceiling in this room. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that's a little too true to be funny. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (41:42)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well, you end up being disgusted and angry and frustrated and... 

</p><p>PATIENT: And this idea of I'm tired. Well, we might, you know, so what I'm tired too, but that doesn't slow me down any or it doesn't make me less desirous of it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm tired just doesn't seem to be enough of a reason.

</p><p>PATIENT: Not from where I stand.

</p><p>THERAPIST: You must have very mixed feelings when you're starting to have sex with her with her half eager and half, oh boy I bet she's going to do it again.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Not that I've ever stopped and thought about it, but it's just that when you look back you say well, it does seem like you go into it kind of half torn heart. Is this time going to be better or worse than the last time? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but part of you is preparing for the worst. (43:57)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, like the saying goes expect the worst and hope for the best and what comes will have to be in between. A lot of the times it isn't. It's more on the, it's what you expected. 

</p><p>There was some kidding around done when I bought this car that I have now. The one before I had bucket seats in the front and there was a console down the middle, you know. Of course, she had every reason to sit on her side of the car so to speak. But I prefer her to sit next to me even to the standpoint where I made sure there was a little pillow that we could stuff into the console in the center so that she could sit over next to me and not be completely uncomfortable, but still wasn't very ideal. But anyway when I bought this car there was kidding around of the fact that I bought the old man's car, but there was also the idea that I went out and bought a car with a one piece front seat so that she could sit over next to me. And, like, yesterday coming back from Ohio I wanted her to sit over right next to me all the time, but then she had to fight with the kids half the time and that's another thing. That's another story there that I need to bring up maybe. Whenever I want her to sit next to me I have to make it a point to ask her or motion for her to do something to get her to come over there. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: She'll never do it on her own. (45:53)

</p><p>PATIENT: It seems like even without the obstacle of having to sit in an uncomfortable place in the seat why I still have to fight her to get her to do what I'd like for her to do, naturally she would say. But the story with the kids that's a different story. They get to fighting and she would seemingly just ignore them and let them fight and whereas I am quick tempered and when they start fighting I start telling them to be quiet and threatening to whip them and trying to whip them and even to the standpoint I might run off the road or swerve the car out of the lane on to something like this and then I get upset at her for not trying to make them be quiet. And it's just the fact that she's able to turn them off and not even hear them fighting and screaming and what have you. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, really annoying to you if she doesn't cope with them. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess it goes back to she's not doing her part. I guess I want her to completely accept my ideas and live by my rules and yet I guess I should realize that it won't be that way. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that's a second theory you take on it, but one of your views is why doesn't she do her part and the other is well, something, like, maybe, you think maybe I'm expecting her to go too much my way and do it the exactly the way I want it. Is that right?

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I said, I want her to be dependent on me, but yet independent to a certain extent. I don't suppose maybe that she's able to comprehend just what I have in mind or something like that. (48:04)

</p><p>THERAPIST: You're saying maybe you can get it across in a way that she can know what you want. I guess we should end for the day.

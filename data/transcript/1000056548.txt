<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client 0518/014, January 20th, 1970. Session number five.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was delayed coming here a little bit. I am totally transparent. I feel like I can really tell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you are transparent? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess so. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Last time I was here, I was forced to be honest. I brought you an apple.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, thank you, that is very nice. I would like it: I was looking for a candy bar.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have a little (inaudible 0:47) of cheese too. Have some of it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is really good cheese: doesn't look like it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are smoked. Do you like it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do sort of: it is real strong but it is not strong the way cheese is strong usually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it is (inaudible 1:21) flavors. How are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am still annoyed that Lisa hassled Elliot.  How about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel better this minute: I was feeling lousy when I was walking here. I don't know, I have been really volatile all day long. I felt okay this morning and then I have just been going up and down a whole bunch and then not being able to tell what is making me feel the way I do. An hour ago, I was just super-depressed. I was being really bad to myself. I was sitting there writing about how depressed I was. I was poetic but it always makes me feel about four times worse. I knew what I was doing and I knew I didn't have to...well, I didn't know I didn't have to; I was doing it anyway. And then I saw Emma as I was walking over here. We just had a nice little talk. She always makes me feel better. always. So that made me feel better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is a good apple.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it looks really hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm (eats apple). </p>

<p>PATIENT: I wrote myself a list of all the things I felt icky about when I was in the library, which is basically because I am so forgetful. I am also worried about that. 0:03:01.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About being forgetful, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is just like not being there at all for anything. But it is also very self-imposed because I will remember the day after. It is not like I forget completely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is just like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is just like I forget until it is too late.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is kind of a mess. It feels like: "I should have done that." Like everything is overloaded and messy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I actually figured that...I imagined that I had an appointment yesterday; I figured last might that I probably had one and that I had missed it. And then today: I sat through all of today and I wanted to call basically because I felt real bad about it but also just because I have this way of dealing with messes, which is to avoid them. Which, of course, isn't dealing with them at all - it only compounds stuff. I sat there saying: "Well, maybe it was today; maybe it is not until Thursday and I really didn't miss it again. I won't call because if I call I will have Mrs. (inaudible 4:15) really mad at me and I will (inaudible 4:17) she is mad at me again." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I am not picking up what you have been saying too well. I have been thinking about the way you are sort of disorganized in the library; and thinking about the way you felt guilty about the appointment; or should I have yelled at you; or was it wrong to be just kidding around. My head is full of stuff too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess if you felt really mad...you were kidding when you were yelling on the phone, except for that, to me, because I was really feeling guilty. "(inaudible 5:31) truly is mad. She is kidding; she is doing the best she can because she is not really supposed to be mad at me." Or something. It relieved me but I don't suppose it really relieved you since you were really kidding or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I was peeved yesterday and by today...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was lost with all the other things that are bothering you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not important enough to get...that is true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not even that it was lost; it was just "so what?" 0:06:05.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: But yesterday was just another thing down: "Oh f***, she didn't show up - it's a drag." Or something that is heartfelt. I don't know. I have this funny feeling that something must be going on that I keep on continually not showing up for appointments but I cannot put any of it together. I cannot seem to be just putting anything together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You cannot sort of organize it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have one class that I am responsible for finishing and I haven't opened a book for it. It is European intellectual history put into a graph and I really like my graph it is really high above the class and all these people are in it and I like graphing in class. It is a pure ego trip and makes me feel better. I haven't read a single thing and I haven't opened my mouth in class. I am not putting anything together and I know it is just hurting me by not doing anything. I think it is also intellectual too. What is that creak?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It jiggles when you talk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sometimes wonder how you can listen to anybody at all because it seem like you are doing plenty and you are involved in all these other things. I wonder how you can...and if it is even fair to you - to yourself - to try and put your self away - and all of your other concerns away - one hour at a time and try to listen to somebody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really, I think it is terribly good for me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So you can think about something other than your own worries?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, maybe - maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that does (inaudible 8:24) theoretical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is good for you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it is not just theoretical. I was going to ask you: "Is it all right with you when I am distracted?" But the, that sounds like, you know, is it all right with you: there is something funny about that. It really is: you are not imposing on me. 0:09:00.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess if you have chosen to be a therapist, then that is what you have chosen to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something more about that, like: "If she has all these worries is she going to be dependable?" Or: "If she is pre-occupied, is she really going to wish she isn't seeing me?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am sure that is (inaudible 9:39). It is really funny how if you ever look at any altruistic statement, you saying it always has to do with you. For a while, I was thinking: "Well, I am really concerned about Rene because she has got all these (inaudible 9:53) and she is really busy." And you were doing all these things. And also as you said that, underneath that, was probably that. My sister is gone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She is gone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She went to Brazil. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She has left you: you don't have her here anymore?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I have her in some way; I have her in my head. That means I have to move out of my parents house because I cannot stand living there without her. I don't know where to go again. I have also been having incredible dreams every night. I wrote one down the day before yesterday. They have all been real death-ish. The last one was about a crematorium but they are too confusing to be like...they are too complicated just to be nightmares. A lot of them I just t cannot figure out what is going on. 0:12:07.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. You have got a lot of emptiness and confusion and mess and upset. It would be spinning around really wildly if you didn't keep it down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I almost feel like I would rather have it spinning around in this funny way because somehow it just..being silent and just kind of sitting there and being unavoidably horrible. I cannot seem to get out of it. I cannot even seem to be moving in any way. Even I am just rolling around, at least I am moving. In this, I just feel like I am sitting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't follow you there. would you say that again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. I said that I almost would rather be spinning because at least that would be movement. As it is, I just feel like I am sitting and it is all a big puddle around me. I have all these intellectual things...like I can come in here and talk to you for an hour and tell you all these things that are wrong - and all of these things that I am upset about or that are happening - but I can't ever come to any conclusions that will take me a step further.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You go around in a circle when you talk. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I can tell you all sorts of things but I can never go anywhere with it. It is nice to tell somebody and it is nice that I trust you more but I still don't feel like I am going anywhere. I don't know how to go anywhere either. And I guess when everyone is home I get really depressed: it is like there isn't even anywhere to go. That is when it really gets bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes when I am feeling like that, I feel like screaming or making noise or carrying on or something. I hope you will if you feel like it. 0:14:54.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that is the thing though. I don't even have enough will. I don't even have enough 'something' to that. It is not calm because calm has too many nice connotations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is more like dead than like calm. Or frozen or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that is what I was dreaming about - dying. There is this one reoccurring dream that I have had. I had it the first time two years ago. I have had it sporadically ever since then. I had it about a week ago. Should I tell it to you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You cannot laugh until I go with it (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was laughing because I just understood the 4 o'clock menu (chuckles). I don't expect I will want to laugh at your dream.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, this one is a nicer one. Most of the other ones are icky. At least this one has some redeeming features and is interesting. But anyway, there was this big clock in the sky and it had really reddish neon numbers. It didn't have any hands at all, just numbers. I don't think I was in the dream, I was just watching it. It was all very passive. As I watched, the clock would turn; and as it turned a number would fall off and turn to fire; and hit this huge black pool underneath; and hiss for a minute and then it would become silent. And as I watched, the clock would slowly turn and each one would fall off, one by one; and turn to fire and hit this huge black pool and then hiss for a minute; and then it becomes hot until the whole thing becomes black; and then I just woke up. I don't even think I woke up: I think I just sat there and then I woke up. The first time I had it, which was two years ago, it didn't scare me but every single time I have had it since then it has terrified me. The first time I woke up...somehow I woke up and I was even calm. In any way... 0:17:55.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is something I have seen people do with dreams you might want to try: sometimes people tell their dreams over again from a different point of view. Maybe you would want to try that as if you were the clock. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I am a clock anyway. I am kind of saying it again over in my head but it doesn't feel that much different because I think I kind of knew that I was the clock anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it was a very subtle dream. The thing that was strange was that in the dream I was really aware that they were pressed neon - the numbers were pressed neon - and then they changed into fire. For some academic reason I have always wondered about whether neon would change to fire. But that is probably just a way of averting thinking about what it is supposed to be leading to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I don't understand what the dream is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't have any idea what it actually means but it feels like there is a whole bunch of death thinking going on or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I will tell you what: the first day was just time passing; going around, not getting anywhere. The lighting up and some fire for a moment and then having it die out until it is all gone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That sounds...I can always judge things by if I am smile or not. If I smile it usually means something. My sister always smiles when she cries. It is really scary. An incredible beam would be on her face and she is just... 0:21:04.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, weeping?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A-ha. The other thing that I wanted to talk to you about was this thing that - I guess I have already talked about it - this became weirder to me. I think it is for the same reason that I am not whirling or I am not moving at all and that is because I am not taking anything - nothing - even seriously. I am taking everything seriously but it is also really unreal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not really my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all this stuff isn't happening to really me. It is just happening to this something or other that is running around representing me but isn't me at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, like, I just got depressed for a couple of days ago thinking about that. One of the things that is really important to me is living with people my age and moving in, who I want to live with communally and semi-communally - closely to the people that I am living with. My first year here at college was terrible; living with this one girl; we really hated each other all year long. I could dismiss that because, so I had one bad room mate, but then with this thing - with Diane and those people - it starts feeling like: "What is it about me that I cannot live with people?" The thing is that I cannot live by myself because I keep on thinking it is not really me; it is who they are seeing me as. It is not really me they don't seem to get along with. I am just like (inaudible 23:21) my sister, I have been living at home. And last night she wasn't there. I just started getting (inaudible 23:28). I mean, I cannot do anything with this (inaudible 23:38); it is just a little bit weird and a little bit like that: do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am trying to see. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of frenzied but still kept out. She will just stay just the underneath. I keep on having to go to the bathroom all the time. Something had to be coming out of me. It wasn't anything productive. 0:24:02.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Little (inaudible 24:07) excretion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like something is scraping in you or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just know that I cannot live in my parents house anymore. I just really feel that I am in the wrong place but I am not being at all realistic about moving any place else and I can tell that inside I am starting to feel like I want to go back to that apartment and I don't know if it is for the right reasons or the wrong reasons. Even if it is for the wrong reasons - which I am a little bit suspect that it is. Some of it is because there isn't really any other place that I can find. I have looked at a couple of places and I have been enquiring and there is one possibility with one girl but I don't know her and it is a basement apartment. Her room is only big enough for a single bed: I can touch both walls with my arms spread out. It is really small. she has a boyfriend which means she won't be there a lot. I can tell by the way I am talking about it right now that I really don't want to live there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There has got to be a good place to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. The thing is, I am not even very upset about that. I am just not even taking any of it seriously. Like tonight, I will go over and sleep in a girlfriend's house; I will go sleep in Holly and Jen's. Tomorrow night, maybe I will stay over with Cathy but I cannot, obviously...it is only the second week. I need a place to stay and I need a place to live but I am just not dealing with it at all. I can keep on saying this but it doesn't make it...I am still hearing my voices out there. and the thing is I don't know how to put...there are two things going on: there is one thing that is real worried and there is one thing laughing as if nothing is going on - inside me. I don't know how to put the two of them together at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The part that is acting like nothing is going on: "Oh well, it will take care of itself. I won't worry about it now?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I don't know whether to worry about that. I don't know if that is a good thing or to think that is the dead thing in me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it is a good calm force or if it is really like...I start tripping out, having these evil beings inside me. I know that it is not a nice trip. I know that whatever I am doing is me but if I get stoned...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They become really real.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They become a whole lot much realer. And then, little things bring me up and down, like. Having a nice conversation with somebody will bring me up. Like when I walked in here, just like coming to talk to you, made me feel better. I didn't feel as crazy or as unhappy or anything. And having that nice talk with Jill - she walked me up half a block up here - made me feel better. But that is almost another way of dealing with stuff that is going on because if I was really...I just feel that there are all these horrible things that I am not dealing with. I just run around from one person to another person, hoping that each one is going to make me feel a little bit better; and make sure that I don't spend so much time alone in between. 0:28:10.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You now have time enough to really let it hit you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I think that is why I haven't done any studying because when I was studying I had a lot of time alone. I had hours to do and I haven't been doing any of that basically. Even when I go home: I don't spend a lot of time alone but I am doing things like writing letters. I mean, I never write letters to people. I am writing letters and I go home and listen to The Grateful Dead for hours in my parents' house. When I get into myself though, I am very kind of romantic and not dealing with anything level. I start wondering about John, which is another icky...which is another thing that I should deal with but it is really removed from all of the stuff that is happening in New York. It is almost a way of avoiding that. I guess in spite of that, I am also asking you for exercises to get me back together. I just want you to tell me: "Well, do this and do this; and brush you teeth and take vitamin D and..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs) Yeah, because it would be so nice for someone to tell you what to do to get you out of it. The, like, you wouldn't be sort of going around in your own circle. Like, someone would be setting you an interaction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible 29:39) for your appointment. And then, you are taking care of it too. I mean, I also got in touch with...for a whole bunch of months now I have not been wanting to be with one...I haven't wanting to be with a guy in any way. Like I wanted friends and close friends, but I didn't want a boyfriend. And the past couple of weeks have really been..it is like this funny thing that happens in your head when you are looking for somebody. It is just kind of a special kind of awareness as you walk down the street: you look at people, you know, and you catch people's eyes. I always do that, but in a different way. Also there is this one guy Alan, who I have this long history with or something or other. He is a good friend. He fancied himself in love with me two years ago. He is really special person. He is a (inaudible 30:57). I have been doing this fantasy trip in my head about him about a month. In some ways I think it is a good thing because at least I want to be close to somebody who loves me - that is a good thing - but it might not be for good reasons or something- I don't know. Like you just want somebody to be...The other thing, if I have somebody else to worry about, I feel a lot better because I wouldn't be...maybe it is the same thing about therapy. 0:31:36.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you have somebody else to worry about, the you can get outside of your own hassles for a while. Somehow they seem like lot lesser hassles between two people than between yourself and you. somehow they are more scary when they are just you and yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it gets weirder and crazier. For sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only thing that happens: I don't know how far I have followed it but when I am feeling down...like I know it is not right to pretend I am not down and run around and try to be...but I know that that only gets me feeling worse. But I also know that if I (inaudible 32:39) like getting down, then I just get abysmal. I t doesn't necessarily bring me out of it. And it used to. When I wrote lots of times - like I have a journal that I kept for a long time - when I wrote in my journal, in some way it would really help because it would crystalize stuff and as I was writing, I would realize...I would get insights on what I was writing about. Also just writing: a lot of times when I am unhappy I write well. so I get a little feeling of: "Well, I can still do something if it is being miserable on paper." But now I cannot even write. I have a (inaudible 33:46) to write but the thing is I am too scared to write in this funny way. because lots of times I write, I am not above water so that...but now I am just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are sinking, yeah. 0:34:03.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am afraid to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where can you go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really get scared by myself too. I obviously don't like myself when I am all depressed but I don't know how to change it. Everything I do seems so manual in this funny way. Like yesterday when I went down to the Art Institute thinking: "Okay, I will go do this nice thing that I really love doing." So I came down to make myself feel better. And I did: I really liked the paintings and I liked it when I was there and I walked around the museum again and I was all depressed again. The only thing is: in a funny way I am superstitious and there was this girl who I was in love with when I was in High School. Her name was Jen. I really emulated her and I really felt real sane and I felt like I was (inaudible 37:07) sanity and I couldn't understand how stable I was and she was really crazy and creative and she ended up spending all our third year in W3. She kind of hated me a little bit for loving her because she couldn't love herself. She couldn't understand how I could...but I was also the only person that she wanted to see...she wouldn't have any visitors but would be nice to go every day after school and spend as much time as I could with her. And in this funny and sick way I really emulated her sickness. 0:37:54.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wanting to be crazy and creative.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then by the time I got to college, I only saw her once. She had to move out to (inaudible 38:08) Her father works there: he is a professor in (inaudible 38:12). We started losing track of each other. I would try to find her and she would come visit me and she came and visited me in first year and she really liked it and she really liked me and she stayed two days in college; then she left. We didn't see each other again. I guess because I had lots of other people in my life too. Her kind of (inaudible 38:43) she had gone to Portland. And then yesterday when I went to the Institute to do this nice thing for myself...Jen and I would always go to the Institute together; always we would do it every Sunday. And who do I run into but Jen, who I hadn't seen since first year. She was incredibly thin: she has always been very beautiful but now she just looks painfully thin and totally nervous. She really wanted to see me again. I just got a very strange flash. Some of it was: "Oh good; here is this person that I have always..." That is another thing: why did I find her just now, when I am feeling really crazy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want to be any crazier!</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess she really scared me. She looked incredibly skeletal. The only thing was I was still attracted to it in an icky way. Probably it was: "Oh no, I don't want to get involved with anybody who is more f****** up that I am." she was continually throwing herself out in front of cars and slashing...I mean, I have never felt at that point and I don't emulate it, I don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there is something that is still...I felt this charge when I saw her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know: some sort of fascination with destructiveness?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, when I was walking here: just as I was walking by, there is a construction place and there are some planks - there is a platform suspended from that new building that they are building. As I walked by, I just kind of fantasized it falling - just kind of falling on me. And I left it, I was okay. "Alright, don't do that anymore!"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha, A-ha, A-ha. I have some sort of feeling for that but I cannot quite... 0:41:02.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have a feeling like you understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is now...I know all thee things but I still cannot do anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is all very well, you are saying. All this stuff - and I know all this stuff - but that it did in some way...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to be like this anymore, you know what I mean? I don't need it anymore. I don't want to be feeling f***** up. That every time I do something I think I will make myself feel better and get myself together - it often seems like it is a project.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not like something starts to happen and all of sudden some part of me starts getting itself together and I just start feeling better. It is like: 'Okay, Jody, are we going to truck on down to the Institute and look at all these pretty pictures?" And you always, like, do the face. "Are you going to go in and do your thing?" As long as I am tying myself to these things and making myself doing them, they are not any realer. And everything is unreal enough so that, you know...I keep on asking in this way of telling; I am asking you to tell me what to do and that is not fair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I also wanting you to say: "Oh, that happened to me and this is how I got out of it." But, also, this didn't happen to you so I cannot really rely on that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have had enough: it isn't productive. It is not getting you anywhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you think, I mean, does that sound real to you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean: "Does it sound real?" does it sound like...that you are making something up or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. What I mean is...all of sudden I was hearing what I just said and I being the listener of it instead of the teller of it. All of a sudden, it occurred to me that here is this person, saying how they are in a puddle and they don't want to be there any more and they cannot get out of it. It just seemed like that didn't make sense that if you want to be out of it you get yourself out of it somehow but that it must be ambivalent and I must in some way want to be sitting in it, otherwise I wouldn't be here. I also would like to (inaudible 44:32) myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know; maybe that is so. I don't think you are self-indulgently sitting in the puddle or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really feel I am either. But what do I do? Get me the ingredients (inaudible 44:54)! I also had an (inaudible 45:04) dream: well, I don't know if it was (inaudible 45:06); it was just...part of it was just a laboratory - like tubes and test tubes. I was frantically trying to make something and I didn't know what I was trying to make. I also didn't know what ingredients I was using. It was just incredibly frustrating. It was just basically this frustration dream. I figured it was also that I didn't take this biology course that I thought I probably should take but I didn't take it because I didn't feel like working very hard. It might have had to do with that too. But it just seemed like...also it made sense that I was trying to pull things together. I normally don't know what I am doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like you are trying to form yourself, make a life. Like, you don't have a recipe; you don't know what kind of person you want to be. You haven't any clear picture and even if you had you wouldn't know which picture. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I have more of an idea of what I want and maybe it is like a process of, not trial and error...I know more of what I want to be than how to get there. I guess I just want to be happy; I don't know how to get there. Happy, I guess, means to me things like, I feel like I am growing; I feel like I am giving to people, so I am able to take. 0:47:07.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like what you can do already, right? Being able to take and give: you do that already, right? Not really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, on some levels, yes; on some levels, no. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The level where it is like, you are really doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess what it also was is that I want people to take from me and give to me and I feel I haven't done that so much. I feel like there are people that I really love, and when I give to them they take so much - like Holly and Cathy. I guess I also want this special kind of intimacy with somebody of the bunch or with the family. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be really close; to be close enough.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is really funny: I also really want to be needed. When somebody calls me up and says they want to talk to you, it literally gives me this...you know, just super good feeling. That was the one thing Jen did that was part of the excitement, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That feeling was good and valuable because you can help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Do you get those kind of flashes?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh sure; sure. I was very pleased today that you were coming in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does Kyle tell you some things that you know? 0:50:01.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, yes. Sometimes I will start to say something and it won't be right or I am not taking in wholly the way that it is different. But sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I have this factually unfounded but some kind of thing that you know a lot of things that I was saying; that you have already felt them or your friends have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am a little leery of this: it sounds like...it felt like you are exactly like me. I am leery of it because I feel that about lots of my clients: "Oh, it really does sound like so and so." Even to the point of that I am similarly disorganized. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe you will start missing appointments! (laughs) I guess that is why I want you to tell me what to do because I have this feeling that you have already been through it so you can tell me what to do. But they are also the kinds of things that nobody can like tell you what it is. What do you do with the tapes? I just became aware of it again today: I had forgotten about it. do you listen to them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes, yeah. Ted Segal spoke to you about the research project...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure, I don't mind about any of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are just curious.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am just curious</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I give them to the person on the staff who is doing the research eventually and I listen to them if I get around to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have you ever watched yourself on closed circuit TV?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have on but I have never done that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not here - downstairs.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I meant within the building. That is such a weird trip because nobody ever really knows when they come across it at all. I never do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could you have let yourself be in a mess for a while and sort of not have to do something about it right away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is an interesting idea. I guess I have to because there doesn't seem to be any other avenue open. Yeah. It is very hard for me to do that because I start...First of all, I just get weird behind it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha, yeah, but it is hard to stand being weird.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess also, like, ever since I was a little kid, people would ask me what I want to be. When I was real little it was a ballerina but after that it was always to be happy. It is like it has been this pleasure principal has been the main drive of my whole life. It would upset my parents no end because they were both professional people and they wanted me to be a psychiatric social worker or a doctor or a lawyer. The thing is I cannot throw myself into my work at all. I cannot do my work. 0:54:27.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also, there is this stained glass window that I have been wanting to make for John - did I tell you about that? I have been making this stained glass window, or at least I have been trying but I haven't been able to think of an idea because I can't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like you are not working.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right - nothing is working. when you said that thing about letting myself be a mess, is it like, sit in the mess for a while and just maybe accept it because right now, all I am doing is beating my head against the wall. Maybe if Is it with it, then it will just start being less bad and something will break in a good way - like spring? I am asking for answers again?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know. I am sure you are asking for answers again - you want to know, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess...oh wow...I guess I am really being in a mess...oh, it just hit me...I am really worried of being icky.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because then if I am icky, then I am not lovable and being f***** up and nobody likes dealing with me when I am f***** up and my friends here - except for one or two exceptions - admitted enough to me that they wouldn't sit through my mess with me so I will lose them if I am not all fixed up. So I am going to lose myself on...let us see...because there starts to be two of me: the one that gets incredibly spaced and one that is just turning but cannot scream. Maybe that is why it is so hard to let myself feel icky. 0:57:16.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, losing people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is also very hard to get close to people if your...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Put like that, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: If you are split.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you cannot be close to them - they feel like they wouldn't want to be anyway. And then you throw it all together and you feel spaced.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right - you hit it! It is me that I should worry about: it is me being split, not the girl who loved me because I am...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you sense the hurt part, now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit. Then if I get into it all, then I start shutting off because then the hurt part...I have this image (inaudible 59:24).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, one of my images is probably that: fingernails screeching on a blackboard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like: "STOP!" Unless you were...where you waiting to say...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay! 1:00:13.3</p>

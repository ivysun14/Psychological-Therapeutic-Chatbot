<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, [PATIENT NAME], tell me how are you doing?  You can leave that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, right now I'm, I'm feeling focused as well, because I took my medication.  And, uh, that was about 6:00 in the morning.  And I took my medication, uh, didn't shower because I showered the night before.  Uh, I had everything lined up, my clothes ready.  Um, I did get into, uh, thrown in jail the other day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, someone told my, uh, called my wife a very bad name and I took offense to it and I knocked the person out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This was when?  Since I saw you last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep, 2 days ago.  And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where were you, what happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was in my house and the caretaker who happens to be, um, a very nosy body goes through all the stuff, she tries to get the power of attorney papers and all that.  Well, he, uh, told my wife to F off.  And I didn't take kindly to that so I knocked him out.  And he called the police on me and I said, "Yeah," you know.  I told them what happened and they took me to jail for assault.  But, you know, you can, you know, and the thing that started it was is that he was hiring some, uh, people to cut down a tree in our yard that we didn't authorize him to do.  And he was just screaming at my wife and I just said, "No, you can't do that."  And he didn't say, you know, he told me to F off and I said that was it, you know.  And that's, you know, that's the night that I stayed up all night and I go to bed.  Um, I didn't take any of my medications.  And I can tell a big difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you definitely tried to go off of the Risperdal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long have you been without him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going 3 days without it and I can tell a difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.  And why did you want to go off of Risperdal, off of 1 medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, because, 1 doctor, uh, actually a psychologist recommended that it has long term neurological side effects.  And, uh, I, I didn't do my homework then, but I realized that once I, uh, found out what the side effects were I, well the medicine's helping me so I'm still going to take it.  And, uh, he, they advised me to get off it, but I didn't get off it because that's, I've been through a plethora of medications, and I have not found 1 to work as well as, as Risperdal has.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you know now no to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you, now you'll have to go to court won't you for this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, no big deal.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever been in trouble besides this assault?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It's going to get thrown out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you mean it's throw, no, if you hit someone it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh he pushed my wife.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  And?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the witnesses didn't see that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How you going to prove that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I saw him push her, so it's going to be, uh, his word against mine.  I'm, you know, what would, uh, ignite someone's temper.  I don't, you know, I went out into the yard and these people are cutting the tree and they see me take him down.  And I put him down to the ground and I told him you apologize.  And then, you know, as soon as he apologized he got up and he called the police.  And he always does this.  This is not the first time he's done that.  He always threatens to call the police because he's not much of a man anyways.  Uh, he's not much of a gentleman either.  And so, uh, I already have an attorney, uh, you know.  And, uh, he pulled a gun on me before and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you mean?  How come he comes all the time around you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he locks his side of the house up, but we don't have a, he wouldn't open the door for a locksmith, uh, so we can have a deadbolt on our side so he can't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's the neighbor or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he's the caretaker.  He's been around for like 30 years in the family.  He's not related or anything.  Um, her -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He takes, he takes care of who?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who does he take care of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, my wife's mother.  And she's bedridden.  And she suffers from psychosis and, um, dementia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But then your wife, doesn't she have a drinking problem too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes she does.  But her drinking problem, uh, it's, well, it runs in the family let's put it that way.  But she gets things done.  She's highly intelligent.  Um, she's been diagnosed with unipolarism.  Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's on meds too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how long you've been on Adderall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh I just switched your Adderall.  You were on Metadate right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I was on Ritalin.  I was on, uh, I've taken almost every one.  I think Adderall works the best though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That was the last time we switch you on it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever been on it before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Might be that [INAUDIBLE].  And why, I'm just thinking, why did we change your Metadate to Adderall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, well it's because I took Adderall before and it worked better than the Metadate.  I was experimenting, because my sister, the 2 of them have, uh, their kids on Metadate and they said, you know, um, Ritalin, they don't like Ritalin.  And they said -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That was the doctors?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And so I said, you know, she goes, "[PATIENT NAME], with your condition you shouldn't take something that'll give you that much boost in case your on an, uh, on your manic stage and you take something that's, you know, uh, it's going to come out with you without a time release."  It'll put me in a, you know, with a, you know, it'll put me over the edge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So can you tell the difference?  This is doing better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is.  Um, I don't have a hard time, even when I take it later in the, when I, sometimes when I sleep until 12:00 I'll take it.  I don't have a problem going to bed at night.  It doesn't keep me up.  It maintains my focus, and it also -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I, well this is, I read that actually is, uh, part of antidepressant too.  It was used, I know Ritalin was used, when I read the instructions on Ritalin when I first took it, it was used as a, a antidepressant, a minor antidepressant.  And I think it is just because when you focus a lot better you're not constantly, I constantly think about negative thoughts.  And when I'm focusing I can just block out the negative thoughts and concentrate on what I'm doing at the time.  And, uh, it, that, the days that I, you know, I do take it, I don't take Adderall everyday.  Um, because sometimes I'm so manic that I don't want to take anything to accelerate my heart beat.  My doctor warned me about that.  She goes, "Don't, you know, do anything that would, you know, accelerate your heart, because in the long term affects it'll do some damage in your arrhythmia and so forth."  And, uh, so I take it probably about 20 times out of the month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.  So you've been on some of the other kinds of stimulates how many years?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ever since they, well, they put me in Ritalin when I was a child and all I did was cry.  And my cousin, when I got into, uh, college, uh, my cousin's a psychologist and she said, you know, I had typical ADD tendencies, which I did.  I was reckless, I always got speeding tickets.  I, I still do.  And, uh, you know, I, I act impulsively.  And when they put me on Ritalin I could focus better through college.  You know, I was just getting by on my memory alone.  I didn't learn anything.  I didn't try to learn it.  I just read the book and memorized it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he knows, uh, it's not like, you know, college is something hard to get through.  You, if you can memorize just anything they're not going to ask you any difficult, you know, questions on any test they're all just, uh, you know, A, B, C, D, answer, you know, either one answer A, answer B, answer C, answer D, answer A and D or A, C, and D.  And it's just you just memorize it, you know, you can get through with it.  And that's all I did through high school is memorize everything, and I really didn't get a chance to learn anything until I got on Ritalin.  And, um, once I did get on Ritalin I didn't get a driving, I didn't get a speeding ticket.  Um, I was happier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you finished -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> College and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But something happened one, uh, I would do a, uh, spell a psychosis and it could've been caused by the Ritalin, we don't know yet or it was the manic depression.  But see mental illness runs in the family and it was, you know, it's mental disease is considered taboo among ethnic people, you know.  And, uh, it's, it's very difficult to tell you you're taking medication for something, because people really don't understand the significance of mental problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I already spoke with my lawyer and that's my defense for it anyways.  I'm bipolar so he made, made me upset and I was on a medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you can use that to your advantage, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.  I don't know, it, it's kind of funny, something that is, is a disadvantage can work to your advantage.  And in this case it's, it's, you know, the, uh, the lawyer told me, you know, "[PATIENT NAME], you're defending your wife.  You got pushed.  You weren't on your medication at the time.  And, uh, you were off."  I didn't hurt him.  I didn't punch him or choke him or anything.  I just took him and threw him down on the ground and got down on top of him, pinned his shoulders to the ground and said, "You apologize."  And, uh, that's all it took.  Well he's always been afraid of me.  He's always been jealous, because like I said, uh, I, I don't know if you remember me telling you, if I did tell you or not, that he was once married to my wife, because her mother forced her daughter to marry him at the age of 17.  Her mother went to jail over it for kid, she kidnapped him, his, his mother died when he was 8 years old and she took him in the house and that's how she got the kidnapping charge.  So it's very messed up.  And, uh, the thing is is that my wife is depending, since she, uh, has her own problems she doesn't have a job, uh, and she doesn't even, she doesn't even try to get on disability.  And she's just waiting for her money, we got a $5 million property on the beach that her ma's going to will to her.  And it looks like, you know, she'll get it, but, you know, we don't know what this guy's doing, you know, with the power of attorney and everything.  And it's just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who has the power of attorney?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well they don't know, but it's my wife.  See she just took the paper and she went and had it, uh, to the deed's office and had it transferred in her name.  And so she has power of attorney, but if her ma found out she had power of attorney she would be upset with her, because she's so codependent on this, the [NAME OTHER] guy that it's sickening.  He'll the leave the room and she'll go [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER].  And anywhere you go -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because [NAME OTHER] is the guy who -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You beat up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And, uh, it's, it's a sick codependency.  And, uh, my wife said they have a suicide pack.  I, he, uh, um, my wife, she came out and said that once that she divorced him and she, she had left and she had it annulled, the marriage, and she, and she left for the beach that he tried to commit suicide.  And he's on all kind of medication.  He's on Tylox, all kinds of stuff that he shouldn't be on, because she's a heavy lady, her mom, and she moves her, he moves her when, you know, to change the diapers.  He picks her up, he puts a belt on, and he's claiming disability.  Now he has no disability.  Only thing he had was is that he had problems, you know, he, he's probably prematurely aged, but he should be out working right now instead of, you know, collecting, you know, every, you know, he has her debit card, the checkbook, he, you know, he does everything.  And, uh, that's when the, the whole thing starts.  He thinks he can take over our house, because her ma's paying for everything.  And he thinks since he has the control books it's a, it's a power thing.  And we're talking about a person who dropped out of high school.  We're not talking about someone who has, you know, there's intelligence in people who don't go to school, but this guy has no intelligence, um, well everyone has some intelligence, but his is at a, I'd like to see his IQ score, it's probably a 97 or something.  And, uh, he, he, he just gets in every family way.  Uh, the ex husband said, he called my wife that day 23 times.  Yeah, and he, and he called her daughters and said, "Look at your mom, she's nothing but a pathetic drunk."  And he's holding up the phone and we can't close the door because he has it locked on his side and we don't have it locked.  And so we had to put a deadbolt on our door.  Right now I moved out of the house and I'm staying with my mother right now with my wife, because we can't go back to that house, because it just, you know, being the, our temperaments that we have, um, it's, it's, it's just not a good situation.  I, I need a serene, you know, situation.  I like happiness.  I'm a, like I like Christmas stuff.  It makes me as a child.  I like to be, you know, have a good heart.  And that puts the worst in me when I'm over there, when I have to deal with that.  And, uh, I remember also reading, uh, I don't know if it's changed, but when I was in college and I was taking Ritalin it said do not take it if upset.  And now I have no idea why it said that, um, you might want, you could  probably shed some light on that if you remember that or not.  But it said do not take it if upset or angry.  And I know why now, because when I was taking it, um, when, uh, if I got upset it would make my heart race.  And, uh, it, it would, it would, I wouldn't be able to focus.  But when I'm in a comfortable setting and I do take any type of stimulant I feel more at ease and I'm at rest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.  Well Namenda can make your heart part, uh, beat very fast sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that could be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have a, a gage that I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I think part of it, I think I have a feeling, that you were off of Risperdal that made you more, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And any part of the bipolar came out too, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just help you stay on your medicine regardless of what -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was really surprised when, you know, I don't, you know, take [INAUDIBLE] like, and, you know, they have their purpose, but I think the purpose, you know, is for people who don't have such chemical imbalances.  I think people who are lost should go see psychologist, but if you have a chemical imbalance and you go see a psychiatrist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, counseling helps of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, you know, but, you know, I don't have a problem with my self esteem, um, I know what I'm capable of doing and achieving when, you know, at my, at my best.  And I know that I, I might have to live with this.  I know that I won't be, uh, you know, um, a person who's a Christmas vacation family, you know, where I just have this, you know, my nice little house, my 3 kids, my 2.5 cars, and, you know, 3 garages and so forth.  It's not going to happen.  I just have to realize I just got to take care, I would rather be happy in my life than live a modest, meek life and have to deal with the pain that I have to go through when I'm not on the medication.</p>

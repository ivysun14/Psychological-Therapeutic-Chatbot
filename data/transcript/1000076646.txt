<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today is Feb 1st, and this is Carrie's second session with Tyler. Where are we, where do we start? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I read this. And you know I didn't really - like is not the word. I found it interesting. I think that it's really hard to do. I tried to do so more. I didn't really even know if I was doing it wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, that's okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought it was-it was sort of like that Gestalt? I mean, trying to get in touch with your body. That sort of stuff. So. [About that.] (ph) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had a hard time getting into it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, I didn't know if it was it was focusing or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. Ok, that's okay. I took a note about that. [We'll go until time runs out, all right?] (ph) What you went through is not wasted. It took-it took me a bunch of times before I did that right. Because it all takes some doing (ph). </p>

<p>PATIENT: I see the-I think the idea is really good but this too-all too-I could tell it and you said you got caught up in image. You know what bothered me also in this is that it said -  Some people that go on for years in therapy and you know [by some giving] (ph) you're not going to improve or not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't do the citations (ph)? So you didn't do it, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well-what - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the feeling? How are you feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I asked you and I said Well I felt- no, I thought that if you thought I was going to be a bad (ph) patient, why don't you tell right at the beginning, and not go on for years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, I will. I will.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why don't they tell other people, too?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. And that's one man's opinion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I see. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think he's right, even. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he also said that for example that you only improve a little bit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, a little bit at a time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I thought he was talking about-the improvement is like just going a little bit with a metronome (ph) or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, don't take-the exact thing I wanted you to take seriously was not... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Was the focusing.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that (inaudible at 0:02:55.6) The focusing is [part of it.] The literature is-I don't think Kent's right about that. Frankly. I think he's missing a certain element. I wrote that down. And there's another thing-I'll do it with you, when the time comes. He needs an introduction to the focusing I think. He needs what I call a 'centering activity'. (inaudible at 0:03:22.3) We'll do that one-let's go on. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well another thing is like I-I shouldn't get this from asking you questions, because I feel like I'm bullshitting. Or there's some reason I'm doing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, you can bullshit too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Just one thing that bothers me. Last week when I said to you "What's that?" and you said "That's just one of my costumes."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. That's what it is. Well, what bothers you about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't know what you meant by it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I'll show you what I meant. I'll give you something to do it later. It's explained in here. And then you can bring this back to me, okay? But keep talking. I'll just include this in. [0:04:02.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I went home and I had a dream. Want to hear about my dream?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Dreams are okay, sure. Yeah, I'd like to hear your dream.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I dreamt that you were - you didn't really belong here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, true!</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's true, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that you were a priest that was trying to get me into your religion. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, Jesus Christ. Yeah, yeah, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then after that -  After I got sort of into it and stuff, I came here and you weren't here. I asked someone where you were, and they said, "We've never heard of him."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was my dream. Sort of freaky. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Want me to read it now or later? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Later, later. Unless that's an issue that's burning for you, you know. On my collar.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it just sort of-you know-like it-it just sort of bothered me, you know. Maybe that you kept on-that maybe this was a costume too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh it is. All of it is costumes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No I mean what you do here. No, it just sort of -  it bothered me a little bit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's an authenticity issue for you. "Who is that guy over there?" </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think there is a little bit because I, like I said, it wasn't all that I thought it would be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hm. And you thought it would be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought it would be horrible. I really thought it would be this horrible, painful thing. You just sat there like a little bug. And they watch you squirm. [0:05:37.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hm. As I recall, you were holding back some things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well at first I thought I was going to start crying because I was horrible the first... see I thought I was going to freak you out. The first time this girl gets in here and she's going to cry and that man won't know what...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I won't know what to do with you, right? I mean...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So then I called my sister, who's - and I told her, (inaudible at 0:05:58.7) "And then would you believe I almost started crying?" She said, "I cry all the time." </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wouldn't be an unusual event, you know. I think I could probably handle it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not really an authenticity thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's up to you. I mean, this point is to do what-to be yourself. Don't worry about what I'm - you know-I'll try and handle it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Where are you? Anything... You. What do you want to do now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: First I think I should save our power (ph) -what -  how I reacted to the last week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got out last time and I was just really angry at everybody. I just realized I was-everyone throwing shit on me and I had been taking it. And I got really angry. So then I went to this meeting. I was incredibly bored when I sat there, you know. They had this -  they gave us this sob story about helping this man's experiment (ph). </p>

<p>And I said I resented having approached (ph) by my emotions. I wasn't going to do it. And I just got so very defiant. Which was like I insult them. More like I think in a bullshit way. Not like right with the authority people there. [0:07:29.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you uncorked a little bit in there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It was really nice! It was-then all week I've been really happy. I don't know if it's because I can go back to my shrink now and make money (ph) if anything bad happens. But this funny sort of feeling, you know. Things kind of ... </p>

<p>Whenever anything sort of bothered me, like rules or-like I had this this-I visited this friend that I had gone to undergraduate school with and she's - her home is in New York-she didn't go back but-it's-she got mono. She's a senior this year. And we just started talking and what we were talking about really bothered me. I just sort of said "Well that's not you. Just because you don't think that way." </p>

<p>Well I said -  She was saying, she said when she'd been in Italy for six months. She said to me, "You know, Jennifer, What's going on? I'm been so out of touch for a while." And I said "What do you mean?" And she said, "Well, for example, do you... do you find that you have to sleep with someone on the first date?" </p>

<p>Well that was just odd now and sort of freaked me out. It's just so foreign to me. I didn't-and then I - you know I... She went on and I think ordinarily I'd start thinking about myself and saying "You know, Jennifer, really -  you're really out to lunch." But I didn't. I just said "Well let's talk something else."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that an issue for you? You want to talk about for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's a big issue for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Talk about it for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just-I think I have a lot of sexual hang-ups. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are they? </p>

<p>PATIENT: One is-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For example...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, one is virginity.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just not-I have a real problem here, I guess, because I don't know if I come across totally different but I just seem to find myself in situations. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People aren't that around you. [0:09:26.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but right off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right off. Yeah. That's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't understand what I'm saying when I say, "I don't even know you." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then this one guy said to me, "I just thought it was really right." He said "What do you think of it as some sort of big booty (ph) prize you hang over someone, at the end they get it?" Which wasn't how I thought I'd had... I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Let me see if I have how you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds to me like that's-you define it as a problem. I gather how you feel about it is two things at least. One part of it sounds to me like... you're very frightened. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's not a moral thing-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not a moral thing anymore. Anymore, it isn't-it used to be, probably. Maybe. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, but right now, you're just really scared. On the one hand. On the other hand, that's like something you want to do. Ok, but the fright is still a big thing. How do you go about it? How is it... you know... and what's expected of you? And what do you expect of you? That's a big issue. For you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then also, this is a whole third thing. I just didn't think it would ever happen to me but it really affect-I think it's been a bad thing now. To be a grad student, first year grad student, you're still a virgin. How can I say it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you say it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: "My god, didn't you date? What's wrong with you? Couldn't you ever have any relations?" I mean I really find it embarrassing some.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now I'd like to do a 'we' issue, okay, on this. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. [0:10:52.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going to warn you, about my values. My values that are going to seep in here. I'm going to try to deal with your feelings, okay? It's most important how you feel, your pace, and all of that, okay? Nevertheless I have values, okay, that are going to intrude here somewhere, and I might as well intrude them right away. And then, so you can see where my biases are. Is that fair?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's fair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we'd be kidding each other if we thought I was just going to be just neutral on this issue. My values-I'm for it, right? One, and two, it also feels okay to me that you're a virgin now. That feels okay to me, too. Two parts for me. One part is that feels good and I like the warm up of that. And the other part is, okay, (inaudible at 0:11:44.0). Can you help me with that feeling? Reflect that for me. Paraphrase what I just said. See if you want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Paraphrase what you said for you, or how I'm getting it in for me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For me. For my feelings. (inaudible at 0:12:06.6) Okay can we do my feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: One, you don't think it's horrible or strange that this girl is... a fink, or out of it, that she is still a virgin. And number two, you think that there's really nothing to be frightened (ph)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think there is something throughout (ph) that. That first part is right. The second is, there is something to be frightened in there. There is something you knew. I mean, that's okay. But there's more. Now I'm going to figure out what that part is about. How you want to go with it. I'm not putting down the fright. I'm not saying you shouldn't be frightened. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I know what I want. Are we going with you or going with me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you want to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Go with me.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know the fright-well first of all, a lot of things I think are involved with it. One, I think it was a moral thing. But not as-but not in a very strange way. It's so easy I think for them to-you're brought up a Catholic, weren't you [boom bang] (ph). But that has nothing to do with it. I mean because I didn't-I sort of had no-it hadn't - It had nothing to do with religion. I could never say, "Well those nuns instilled in me all the praying and (inaudible at 0:13:24.5) and shit" because I really didn't have that much contact with them. It was Sunday School and that was it. With my mother-I know it comes a lot from my mother and I've always had this feeling she sort of thought that sex was this little, a dirty thing. But unless there was this one person you had this really good relationship then with, legitimize through marriage and all that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me just ask you one question. I want one piece of information. Your brothers and sisters, how many? (inaudible at 0:13:55.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I asked you this week, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have an older sister. </p>

<p>PATIENT: An older sister. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Three years.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And a younger sister, two years. Now I'm really a virgin. And a brother, ten. And that bothers me right there. My youngest sister, just kind of went away, went on a tail. And now we seem to have a big hassle about it that I have a real...</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You, your reason. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and that-right there I felt like I can't discuss it at all with my younger sister because I just think she thinks I'm really... With my oldest, my oldest sister said, "Jennifer, don't let it worry you." And don't feel that you have to be pressured by what everyone else is doing and all your friends are doing. But I do-I really do feel that pressure, I guess. </p>

<p>So I guess-it really is sort of a mountain. It's really funny- I said something about last week, I think, about my mother. And that's that she never asked us who we're going-she never mentions who's the social part of my life at all. Ever. And it's really bugged the hell out of me. When I was in college, if I was going out and I was just really depressed, I'd call her. She would say idiotic things like, "Go to the library. Just get involved in a really good book." And she honestly thought that was the solution.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That (inaudible at 0:15:26.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I know that she really feels that she doesn't understand why everyone is so kind of fucked up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were feeling like really-like there's some inferiority connected with that, with you. That's been hanging with you.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's more that I think I'm really-I really-this other thing is-almost when I just have this weird-that maybe underneath it all I'm really a lesbian. Which I never even-I couldn't imagine thinking it before. But all summer, in the last couple of weeks I've seen these two movies where these girls all of a sudden realize they're l-And then I think maybe they're-maybe I'm abnormal, maybe I just don't feel frustrated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you had any sexual relationships before? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Yeah, I mean I have. No that's just - . No. Why are you asking for?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why would you ask me? (laughs) Where is it -  Is it written here somewhere on my forehead? Right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's another thing, I think that would help us move quicker. And that's like-something that we might have done last week, too, I thought. As a point, my feelings about each other. I think my - we have to do that before we can go further. It would help. You want-does that sound okay for you? Now that might be heavy for you. But would you like to start it? Would you like me to start?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You start because I don't know the questions. (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I sensed this issue last week. And if we had two hours I would... (inaudible at 0:16:56.9] 11:20. Now the -  I'm disappointed in a way, that I'm your therapist, for one. And two, that I'm in love with another woman, and living with her. At this point. Other moments, I'd like to (inaudible at 0:17:13.7) not you, but... And I'm sorry I'm seeing you in therapy because I love to work on this issue with people (ph) out there. But that's just fine. I'm very attracted to you. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's really nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm not going to do it. So. Sorry!</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) Can we have a [pause in therapy?] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry. Not going to. I mean, I'd like to. I mean I'd really would like to. But I'm not going to. It would be too risky for them. And then I'd get killed, professionally. I've got enough troubles. Professionally-enough troubles. I have a lot of troubles professionally. That would kill me right now. Lose my job, the whole thing. But I would really like to. If it wasn't for all that. I would definitely do it. I tried. [Now I talk like you.] (ph) Do you want to reflect me, for a few minutes? </p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean how -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd say how I felt?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, how do I feel? About you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think you feel really warm, and it's not completely wrong. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Attracted sexually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sexually attractive. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good point. And you-how are your - ? Now how do you feel about me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh well I-see I had a crush on you last week when I got out of here. So I said, "Should I tell him that because it - " I just really liked you. Because I just thought-the first thing is that you really sort of listened to me. But I just felt that you'd listen anyway, if we were out on a date. Or involved in a relationship, not just in here. I just want - when that's happening so little. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pain, pain. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I had this feeling that people just wanted my body lately. Guys.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pain. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because the bad thing. Before I got here, I never-in college I guess I just went out with all these 'Joe Collar' (ph). You know, like I just-I got involved sexually but only to a certain point. But I would always say, "That's because, Jennifer, you're not in love and you just don't really want to sleep with them." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, Jennifer.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I never also considered myself sexually, if - sexy, sort of. [0:19:19.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Two things. Two ways we can go now. One, about your feelings-all that pain and all of that. About-they just want your body. Or two, we can use our interaction as a model for the other interactions. For example, now, I mean I would have been of the type of guy with you who would want to go to bed with you in the first ten minutes. </p>

<p> Forget the first night. I mean, forget the first date. In the first ten minutes, I would've wanted to. So it would have been more important to me to be-to say how I feel, and have you understand me. And that could postpone it. That-I could wait. I could wait. I could wait six months for you. I would wait six months for you. But what would be important to me is I could respond to that in some way. </p>

<p>Such that-me, and, I know there's some- you understand me. I could feel very misunderstood going out with you. I mean, I wouldn't personally, but I think most guys will, because they wouldn't exert themselves to the issue quite as frankly as I just did. They would, just do all the maneuvers, and you would do all the maneuvering. And then afterwards you would feel "No, I didn't, and I feel bad but all he wanted was my body" And he felt all put down and impotent. And, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That  - - I'm saying is, part of what you have to do is get into how he feels. And I think you'll find under that there's more-of course he wants your body, but he wants - there's more. There's more, and he can wait with that. I've never seen a guy who couldn't wait with that. See what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but if I felt that... I would go to bed. I have-honestly I have felt I just don't think-that's all they want. And maybe it's because it's foreign to me, I haven't come through this thing where -  When we go to bed, you don't say, "If you want, if you want to go into a relationship after that." To me it's just that I - if I went to bed-of course want to go on with it (ph). </p>

<p>And I-I'm honestly not looking for permanent. And I don't want marriage for years. But I mean, to me, it's a commitment kind of. Maybe for a month. Maybe for three weeks. But it's not like the next morning, forget it. I don't know, wake up and don't know what do with yourself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm in a (inaudible at 0:21:37.3). My values are really going to jump in here really hard. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that is, for me, when I go into bed of a woman, that's it. That's one night, no commitment. Zilch commitment. I mean, it's like therapies. When I do therapy with you, it's when I do therapy with you, there's no-I mean, we're tied to 20 hour limit. But even when I do therapy ordinarily, I don't do it like we're doing it now. I don't do it 20 hours, guaranteed 20. Necessarily. [There's not a lot of point.] (ph) It's like, I'm going to love you for an hour and then if you want to get together later, that's fine. If we don't, we had a good hour. See what I mean? That's my bias. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's really selfish though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To who? For who?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of you for the other person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wouldn't do that unless they would agree. In other words, I mean to - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not-that's something that's explicit right from the start. That's something you can get into, and I get into. What I'm saying is that, that's a value you're going to run your nose into around here. And it's not like you are, already. And not everybody has it. Maybe most people don't. But it sounds like that's something in there somewhere. Well, let's take another tact. Let's take another tact. Is there a guy now you're going with or not going with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not going out right now. I stopped. I stopped-I said-see, I'd been going out with this guy, and he blew my mind, kind of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well (inaudible at 0:23:06.2) I'm not recommending that the next guy you see, when you run out of this office you go to bed with him. I'm not recommending that at all. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I probably couldn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's more important now to know what's in that for you. And not that it be moral ethics. You've got really strong feelings there. We could go (inaudible at 0:23:22.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should say that that's not true. Number one, I haven't met anybody I'm sexually attracted to, myself, lately. Since I've come back from Christmas. I haven't done anything to be in a, there's nothing. I have sort of my friends and stuff like that. And there's this guy that I was dating before Christmas and I just can't stand how he feels about women. Just attitude. I think he's an idiot. That was ridiculous. And that wasn't going to go. </p>

<p>What I'm-now I get to look at that-if it's not going to go anywhere, I don't want it because I don't need simple little dates. I have enough to do without being -something to do on Friday and Saturday nights. So what I am looking for in a relationship I guess, I haven't found one. So it's not true that I - it's true that I'm scared, kind of, but it's not that I wouldn't go out. </p>

<p>But anyway, so I had gone out with this guy and had gotten to this point, I honest to God though he was going to seduce me. You know I got-I was petrified. Then he said to me, "You know what's really wrong with you?" He said, "You're incapable of a relationship." He said, "No matter if I was perfect, you wouldn't - go to bed." He said, "You're just petrified of a whole relationship." I said, "What do you mean? The physical part of it?" </p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," he said. "Just the whole thing." Well I started crying. I thought that was horrible. I started crying. And so then, I never wanted to see him again. It just really bothered me. Then I felt like, you've got to say something like this. You know, you've got-so I called him. And I said, "What did you mean?" Well he was such a bastard on the phone. [0:24:54.0]</p>

<p>It was just horrible. He said all these awful things to me. And he is the one who said-he said I was a big fake, and he said that "What do you think it is-" He thought it was such a great image, pie in the sky. He said, you know. He would say-I don't know, he was just... But then I also felt he was a horrible (ph)-all these kind of - I felt he was a sort of ba-mean... I don't-I didn't like the sort of person he was anyway, before. I mean, then he just sort was-he was really mean to me. And I never said a lot of things I felt, like a lot of the-things I really felt. I felt he had a real lot of problems. And I didn't want to hurt his feelings by saying it. And the things he said-he was just so cru-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So-there's a message under there to me, and I think the message maybe is-"Look, I couldn't have gone to bed with him. Because look at what of a bastard he is. I mean, don't blame me for not going to bed with him." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's okay, you didn't have to. (laughs) Right? Is that part of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's to the-let's work-let's do some strategy thinking about you and your sexual relationships. What, like what are the alternatives? What do you want to do about it now? What alternatives? Let's look at it. First of all, before we do that, let me start. How old are you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: 22.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're not a freak, by the way. Being a virgin at the age of 22 is not that unusual. Right off the bat. That's not unusual. I'm sorry, but you're not a freak, nor-nor do I see any homosexual stuff in you at all. Zilch. Fantasies maybe. Tendencies toward action, zilch. Not in hundred years. You're like the last person I would expect. And I don't know-I don't have a bias about homosexuality. I think it's okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, well, see, I do intellectually, which is-what (ph) you know, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I deal with my gut, by the way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've never had a homosexual experience but I think it's okay that people do, maybe. [0:26:54.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I wouldn't know what - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But never let-that's not an issue for you. That's like, that's a ghost. That's not a ghost. Okay, like, now, what are you going to do about that stuff? That, you don't know that-I bet you freeze. You probably get terrorized. When this guys comes at you. I don't know if that's right. [But, I guess...] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, now I do, kind of, because it's like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get turned off, even, sexually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel also-yeah. But I also-it's like-I mean I'm like being so, kind of, not even thinking about myself. What-no, it's all a rationalization. The one thing I want to do is go to bed with someone. Really. And all this other stuff, I know it's rationalization because I'm trying to say to myself, "Jennifer, you're not abnormal. You're not-you just haven't met the right -" then I feel-then I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might be true. It might be true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well but I al-yeah. Well I kind of think so, then I think 'Why haven't you? You're certainly not an ugly..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not ugly, no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "...bitch." And people are attracted to you. And what's wrong with you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now before we go on a (inaudible at 0:27:58.9) so to speak, there's issues here that... In fact, you're thinking about this from the right now, in a funny way, from my point of view. You're thinking of it as all or none. As far as, I'm either going to thrall (ph) or not. And that's not the way it works, at least in my experience. It's like okay, why... </p>

<p>There's something-I hear things coming out of you like, "Okay, what I want is -in relationship with someone. It doesn't have to be forever. I'm not talking about marriage. I'm not talking about a lifelong commitment. But something. " But there's some-we're together in some way and it's warm, it's tender and all of that. We... and so that's not a- Some of all or none, we don't screw tonight and then we'll never see each other. That's fine. I think, in order for you to enjoy sexuality, it's got to be slow, I think. [0:28:54.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think you're right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's going to have to be tender, and slow, and what you have to do. (inaudible at 0:29:01.3) Strategy. Really get into how you feel and share that with the other person. You get into his feelings. With no pressure-it's like, maybe we wont' do anything at all. Maybe we'll just - maybe we'll just-take-maybe you'll just take off your blouse, and that's as far as we go tonight. Maybe that's enough for tonight. Maybe that's as far and safe as I'll feel comfortable so that I don't turn off. It doesn't have to be 'zap'. Boy I wish I could coax the doctors (ph) and do this with you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) (inaudible at 0:29:40.1) hard. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, it's a playing lesson. You know what a playing lesson is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A playing lesson.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too bad we can't do a playing lesson. I can't stand it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's a playing lesson?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Golf. When you are really seriously getting golf lessons, what you get is a pro. A pro on the course with you. And he'll actually play the game with you and instructs you as you go. That's a playing lesson.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I almost had one. Last year, this is really-no -  can I just tell you? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There was this guy that I had - that I had gone down on the [York pool] (ph) or something like that. And he-he came up and we'd gone down the Cape. Well, he was the most sexually experienced guy I ever met. I just really enjoyed everything with him. And we had stayed overnight in a motel but I didn't sleep with him. I just felt-see, I felt good because - and I don't know if that's guilt, fright, or immoral, that's what I don't understand. </p>

<p>But I thought, "How could you sleep with him, Jennifer? You really don't know him at all. You just sort of meet him in Chicago one weekend." This is like the second time I'd seen him. But then I decided that was ridiculous, and I was going to go to Chicago and stay with him for four or five days. But I didn't-how could I - I didn't know how to explain that to my mom. God. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're talking about another option. And that's a reason number one. Finding yourself a kindly dirty old man. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I look at him on, as really. So I planned to go down and then-we got our plans completely screwed and I had to return (ph) for New York. So I didn't. But that's-you see I looked at it almost like a biological experiment. Because I really liked him. I mean, sexually, I was attracted to him. [0:31:18.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fine. That's a very common way girls, you know, especially girls-older. Old women like you are still virgins. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, don't say that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very often they decide, okay now it' s time. I'm going to find somebody who I'm sexually attracted to, who I know I'm not going to have a relationship with and I'm going to and teach them how to do it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's sick though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I think that's a good idea, frankly. That's a strong bias of mine right. I don't know if it's a good idea for you. I'm serious. I really don't know if that's the right idea for you. Believe me, I don't know. I've seen girls to that. I've seen it be a reasonable alternative. There are three alternatives. One, is you don't do anything. Two is you do that. Three is you do squirrel (ph) with somebody else, in a relationship that you-that has a center, has a chance of going somewhere. </p>

<p>But that's just a first step right. First is I - you find someone you want to be with in life, and you're going through a life experience [with them] (ph). The other is finding yourself a dirty old man who is kindly and attracted to you. That is, for me, a second alternative. The worst alternative is go read a book. You know, I mean, your mother's solution is not the best one, all right? That's clear. But any of those. </p>

<p>Rule, axiom. And the way an x- the first axiom of mental health is that given two people, and given that they both know they feel in some sense. They can do anything with each other, any kind of interaction with each other. Short of the obvious damaging ones like punching each other in the nose. As long as they're both willing to talk about that interaction after it's finished, nothing's harmful. Anything can be a growth experience if it's processed afterward, talked about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, there aren't that many people who are willing to talk about it though. I guess you just got to find that out, sort of. It's funny, I just feel that in many ways, I'm sort of (inaudible at 0:33:17.0) and people are get-got scared of, and fun from. They won't even - they kind-sexually they're very experienced. But if-they just think I'm strange when I talk about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's too bad. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I also - maybe I rationalize. Because I find it that hard to talk-to me, that, like you said, it's the most comfortable thing. Going through and discussing it. But it kind of freaks them out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some, yeah, not all guys. Older guys would be less freaked out, by the way, I think. Younger guys have, in general, this is. Have more investment in just their own ego in terms of just balling you and showing how good they are. That's [not the fun] (ph) of it. Yeah, but for you, you're not into a technical friend, you're into a.. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure I wouldn't know. (laughs) How good or bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is a good time to bring up another issue, I think. I want to make sure-let's finish this one for a while, but not-before we do that, what else were we-more, more, do we have more on this now? Your feelings or anything? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. No. I was just really worried about it some (ph). Like that I was really freaky. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very. You can't get out of it that way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That was all. I mean, I guess there's nothing (inaudible at 0:35:11.9) It's good to talk about stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well, I have a recommendation now. Which is, the next time, I want to bring a third person in here, to help us. And given what your issue is, I'd like to bring in a girl. A girl therapist consultant. Who will sit there and say nothing at all until we ask her to say something. In other words, I want her to look at how we are with each other in order to see whether we're doing it right. </p>

<p>I mean I -  There are a lot of things I can do and not be realizing I'm doing, always. To check on me (inaudible at 0:35:52.9). To help me, more or less. And I also-I'll bring in-if I can, I'll get X. the reason I'm saying X is I want to check with her before I spill her name all over the world. Because she's working on the same issue that you were. Sexuality issue and the femaleness in that. I mean, when I mean sexuality I mean balling. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And she's working on that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is-this is-X is the therapist?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: X is therapist, is working on an issue for herself, which is-her own sexuality at the moment. She also happens to be a client of mine, and she's also been a-she's a colleague of mine, client, co-author, (inaudible at 0:36:39.0) of intellectual, we've done, we've done a whole number together. And she's very good. She's not as strong as I am. She's kinder than I am. She's more gentle than I am. </p>

<p>So I think she'd be very good at this point, if we can get her. Otherwise, I'll find someone else. But I'll find someone for next time. It's important to do this early before we get locked into a relationship. If we'd been seeing each other for 20 hours, it'd be a hell of a time to bring a third person. To find out what the (inaudible at 0:37:17.4) we were doing. So if you (inaudible at 0:37:19.1) to each other, we could do a case study. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you know, that's nothing. When I was re-tripping (ph), I realized there really is sort of a relationship. Because I just thought, that I had, you know, I had the (inaudible at 0:37:35.4) of a relationship with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right, we've done all right together. And it's - that's hard sexual overtones. But I like that, by the way. It's nice. It's frustrating, by the way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really would look [out the window at the weather], it could be worse, it could be boring for me. That's terrible. And you can't get away from-if we're going to be good with each other, you can't get away from your feelings about me. They're important. Always important to stay in touch with them. And to share that with me. Because otherwise it hangs there and you don't move anywhere. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know because that was why that thing about the costume really bothered me. I just thought I really liked you and then I thought maybe you were-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe I -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe you were-weren't honest, like you kept on switching around. I know, sorry. I don't know what it - (inaudible at 0:38:31.7). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I said, "Oh my God, why didn't he tell me he's a priest?" and I got really angry at you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me go ahead and give you what's not in there. My... I'm a therapist right? But what I am, more than that, is I'm a change agent. I'm seriously interested in social change. And I used to be a Catholic, at 25 I was going to be a priest. </p>

<p>But I dropped out of all that. And I studied that whole business thing. And I got ordained about three months ago. And the administration didn't approve. And the missionaries are [the new truth] (ph) you can have all the legal and benefits of being a clergyman. This counts, the whole thing. For ten dollars. And you have doctorate of divinity and you have your certification of ordination.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that's what they advertise?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. That's all it is. So the point of that is to rip that collar away from the clergy. In other words, discredit everyone from being clergy. Everybody can have those benefits. See, in other words, it undermines organized religion, is what this thing does. And I think it's worthwhile for undermining organized religion. </p>

<p>Not purists (ph), not people who are spiritual, but people who erect large churches with poor people's money. And drive around, put large rings on their fingers and [tail legs]. (ph) You know that's very funny. So like we're trying-what we're trying to do is-at least I am-I'm trying. Maybe I can ordain you. I don't know, I think it's possible. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's be great. [0:40:07.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you want-well you do that. If you want to ordain it, just send it in, if not, bring it back to me. (inaudible at 0:40:09.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I wear of those?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well sure, why not! I've never worn that. I've always wanted-one of these days I'm going to wear it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Wear it for me. I'd like to come in here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, maybe next time I will. If I remember it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's a little bit of fun. Another thing I want to give you. I'm sorry I don't have the other one. The other one is on the consulting. I want that, I want you to read. And then you can have this. But there's another one that I want you to get before next time, too. And I want you to check back with me sometime. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's-do you want me to come more than once a week?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want you to come when you want to come. Maybe we could do that now, since I'm walking around, fiddling. When would you like to come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to come more than once a week. Maybe Mondays and Fridays.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, I'm only in the, at the university two days a week. So that would be Mondays and Wednesdays. I would see a counselor (ph) twice a week. I'm seeing her Wednesday, for example. That would be okay for me. If you'd like to. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about 10:30? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Fine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See that's a matter of how often-how often is a matter of-We should change that, depending on. You have 20 hours, use them anyway you want to, anyway you feel. If it-and if it doesn't feel good to me I'll let you know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll let you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder why I can't get that paper. I want you to read that paper before you go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can come tomorrow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's being Xeroxed at this very moment I hope. What does Carrie mean? What does that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's funny-It was how I got it. They-see first of all, I... Once we're talking about names, I just feel like my name doesn't fit me at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (on phone) Hi, how would you like to be a consultant? No, - Wednesday at 10:30. I think you'd be excellent. Excellent. Yeah, 10:30 to 11:30. You know, like an hour. You remember therapy? You're a therapist, I'm a therapist and a consultant. I- we-I always remember. Yes, I have a client, co-client here right now. And we're talking about issues that I think you're working on also. That I'm sure that's-it's okay to say? It's okay right. You can be high on self-disclosure too, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:43:37.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, no shit-that's very good, we'd like to have you. Yes. Okay we'll see you at 10:30, my office. Right, okay. Bye. That's a good girl. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 10:30 Wednesday. I need longer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The question is Olivia Johns. And she's a fourth year graduate student here, and she's an intern here at that center. And she's done a lot of things with me. A lot of shticks. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's the prov-if there's three people who would be on that paper, she would be the third one. She's not-she's writing (inaudible at 0:44:26.1) with us too. Very good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, we-</p>

<p>PATIENT: While I be intimidated by her here (ph)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sure you will. I'll be intimidated too. That's the rule of (inaudible at 0:44:37.7). What's your name, I want to get your name. Of course. It is enough. The - we stopped the tape to take off a real name. Do you know how to do a disassociation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I do but that's not also what I really-I-not like it's a long time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: True, it's true.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right? Sure, long time. I mean, 22 years old, yuck, right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Will you cut it out? I'm giving you a hard time about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Plus anyway, did you know that people they're not sure if it means virgin, virgin, or young woman? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you know? </p>

<p>(laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, you know. We're going to have a good time next time. You don't have to feel guilt. Being pain is okay. I don't want to push away your pain. If I'm ever doing that, stop me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what bothers me? I just have such a good time when I come here. I feel like I should be gnashing my teeth and weeping and</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's okay too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...crying on the floor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See the point is-I want to make a very important point now. And that is, some people come into therapy and they push away all their pain. And everything's - they really push it away. They have a hard time and then the come into therapy and they don't, don't get in touch with it. That's one kind of person. Another kind of person comes into therapy who has a pretty good week and then says, - and then there's gnashing of teeth. </p>

<p>The point is, in order to please your therapist, some people come in and push all that away and have a good time. And some people come in and wear their-they create pain in order to see their therapist. And neither one of those methods are any good. So you can come and see me whether you're in pain or not. And you should come and see me the way you are, not how you think I want you to be. </p>

<p>Because you can see me whether you're in pain or not. We can spend our 20 minutes together whether you're-either way. So it's important to be right where you're at. Don't do anything that's-you already please me. You wrote me a nice diary (ph). [0:47:06.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I-I didn't put my name on it. It's funny, that thing. You know what I was going to tell you about that? See, I had it and sealed it. As soon as I got outside, I wrote what I wanted to put. But I-then I didn't mail it, I couldn't finally (ph) get the stamp. </p>

<p>But-maybe I should keep journal because my thoughts kept on really changing all the time because I kept on thinking about what had happened. And it really bothers me, different ones. Like I was really angry at you about that thing, because I said at first, "My God, how can we have a relation- honest relationship if he changes costumes." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm a thousand clowns, that's why. You have to see that movie, though, that's an assignment for you. Have you seen that movie? Cool thing.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I saw it once, a real long time ago. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: An assignment. I'll give you an assignment. What was I going to say though...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then you know, it just really was changing a lot. And then of course I get petrified before I come here. Like this morning I was scared out of my mind. I didn't have to teach, you see, this morning, that's why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I was expecting to see you in a skirt. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You promised some skirts.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) You came, like you promised. I like your beads. They didn't have school today. It's some -  Lincoln's birthday. I don't know what the hell it was. That's another thing that bothers me that I think that they're all sexually more experienced than I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All my kids.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They probably are. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I feel like "Jennifer, you are such a phony up there." One of them-a couple of them have really started confiding in me. Like this one girl. They all got the best report cards. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Reflect their-you're going to learn how to reflect feelings, don't you? You learn how to reflect feelings. You're not that good at it. Where's a wand (ph)? I got to get a paper for you. I can hear you.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Reflect -  feelings? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Reflect feelings. You're going to have learn how to reflect feelings. Your problem, if you have a problem at all is not feelings coming from you. You have a lot of feelings. Getting in touch with your own feelings, except under times of pressure, like when somebody wants to go to bed with you. That isn't you. What you have to do is that is keep trying to stay in touch with how you feel. So you don't feel dead from it, from the way it's done. [0:49:22.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's [one of] (ph) the most important times to have your feelings, isn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right. That's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean so-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, so you have to get with somebody who can hear your feelings. You've got to practice listening to feelings. You're not so good at hearing feelings, by the way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: From, from-hearing what you say? Or what I say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I say. You're not bad, but it's foreign to you. When I ask you to reflect my feelings, you say, "What does that mean?" </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not that good at that. That's - if I say you have a problem, the problem is-empathy. Not, what I mean by empathy is not that you don't know how another person feels. It's that you don't communicate to him that, like you really-feel like it-you know what it is for him inside. When you're reading that paper, what I'm saying is "vowel stage". You have to learn how to do the 'vowel stage'. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I-I guess I feel - </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's easy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... uncomfortable about.. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, you mean, it's so easy that you feel uncomfortable doing it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it's that-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Most people do. It's like that's so simple, why-how could that help somebody. I wanted a paper by the name of Wallen (ph). I had to get for you. I have to get it for myself too. I don't have it. (inaudible at 0:50:49.2) Feel like I'm going to sneeze. I'm going to take a note of that. </p>

<p>(music plays and stops)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a cool radio. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, you're going to give me another diary, right? Before Wednesday. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm going to put-I'll tell you what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: On anything? Do you want it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just what you did last time is fine. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or the hell I know what you want to respond to. You want to respond to you thing about a journal, a diary, or... If you want to. You know the book "I Never Found [a Sure Hoaxer"] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know the song. [0:51:47.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's a book. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The book came first. It's an important book. It's a novel-I mean, you don't have to read it. But it was somebody who was in therapy and did a journal, and published it as a book, basically. There's a few of those out there. You can do a book if you want. But all I want is whatever - one of our sessions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Carrie and Tyler. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Carrie's journal (ph). </p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I'll get you another-okay, continuation. We forgot to do the dream. Let's do the dream. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You - how-what it was. See I walked out side and there was a-you know, the Volkswagen?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There was that jacket.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is in the dream?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, this is in truth. [My life is] -this jacket. So then I went home so I-dreamt that you were some sort of ministry of this strange religion and you were trying to get people to join it. And you got me into a separate (ph) because I was just really attracted to you so I joined it. [You tried to talk me out of it] (ph), in your religion. </p>

<p>So then you just-I was wondering about it because I felt like we were discussing dogmas in the therapy and not, how I felt. So I said, "I don't think this is what therapy is supposed to be." So I came in and said I was going to talk to you about it. You weren't here, and no one had heard your name. [0:53:15.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the dream.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is the dream!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, now I'm with the dream. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this is-no one had heard your name. And I just had glimpses of what I thought you were-at one point you were on this big motorcycle with a black leather jacket on and a psychedelic cross and all these chains. You know like motherfucker on the arm and stuff like that. And that's what I had dreamed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was it, what is that cross (ph)-okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I-see then I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did that mean to you, I mean the cross on the bench (ph)? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it-it made me sort of angry, because I thought you were - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd been, you'd been... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Duped. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ripped off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, ripped off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, okay. Try to dream again. Try to-Tell it to me again from the point of view of something else in your dream. Tell it from the point of view of that jacket you were carrying. That's a good one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: From the point of view of the jacket.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah-as if it-in the present tense, as if it was happening right now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try it. If you want to, I mean. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So I.. I'm going outside and then I see-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, the jacket was here, though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh-now, now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're in your dream. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh right, well now I'm - I see the jacket now and it has the eagle on it. It doesn't have that cross. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, [from the cross] (ph). Tell it from the point of view of the cross. The dream. You're the cross. You're the cross now. You're going to tell the dream about this girl who, whatever.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. That's good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well here I am, just lying on this jacket. And this girl came up to me, and I could tell she really resented me sort of. I guess she resents me for a lot of reasons. One is that she thought I was - I (inaudible at 0:55:18.2) to the person who wears me. And number two, I guess the girl is sort of sensitive about religion. And she didn't like the cross being part of a costume so easily. </p>

<p>And number three- Yeah, because I just feel that -  sort of that-I feel that ambivalent about religion. About my religion. I don't practice it but then sometimes I wonder if it's because I never knew anything about it. So that's-this is going past again. This is going on what happened to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:56:00.3) Go on, go on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's-one thing I can't stand is when people just get involved with a rudder (ph) but they don't know what the hell it means. They fuck everything, or they read a good or new left, or destroy everything come the revolution. A Jane Fonda sort of attitude towards things. </p>

<p>She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. And I think here it's especially it's a very intellectual 'in', to be so down on religion. Because never until I came here, people just assumed I was Catholic because my name was Jennifer. And look at me-see I - I guess that just really bothers me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying something now that I think is a lust. It was your fear-you were turned by it. That was part of it. The other part was, was the (inaudible at 0:56:45.8). Who is that guy, what? Is he real? Or is he just modeling all of, all of that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, something like that. How can I trust him. It's trust in a way. How can I trust that guy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Plus it's what-it was so important to me because I was so struck by the fact that you were just kind of really listening. Just really caring what I -  me -  had to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. That's how I felt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that just really bugged me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is. Maybe you were being duped. Actually, I did feel that way. For a very-I still feel very in touch with you. Get out of here. What do you -  your hour's up! No. </p>

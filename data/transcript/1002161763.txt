<p><b>Bugental Commentary:</b> <i>Hello, I'm Jim Bugental.  I have been practicing, teaching, writing about psychotherapy for almost 50 years now.  You're going to be seeing two demonstration interviews of the kind of psychotherapy, which we call Existential-Humanistic.  What those two terms mean is important and so I want to take a minute to talk about them.  When we say "existential" we are pointing to the fact of our existence, of our being.  The difference between being truly alive and being on tape, so to speak.  When we're truly alive we are present to our lives, we're aware; we're in touch with the fact of our being.  Then the word "humanistic" that has to do with our conviction that each person has more potential for richness and fullness of living, for dealing with life issues than that person generally uses. In combination then "existential-humanistic" means an optimistic look at each person in that person's carrying forward is being.  </p>

<p>What we are about to see are two sessions of therapy with a client whose name is Marie.  Each session will be shown without interruption, but following the session there will be a discussion of what occurred.  The discussants are people who will have been in the room with us during the conversation.  Then we're very fortunate in that after the second session it proved possible without for-planning to have a de-briefing session with Marie, where she told us more of her own experience, and you will see that also.  Marie came to see me about a week or two before the first session because I wanted to make sure that the experience of being on camera would not be distressing to her.  Other than that, I had no other contact with her other than, you know, the casual contacts of getting set for the filming being the only other contact, and I have not had contact with her since.  The filming, important as it is to conveying our work, also makes an artificial situation in some measure.  For the room is full of other people rather than being the privacy customary in our psychotherapy.  But the client Marie showed a great ability to do her work despite that and I think will help us understand what this kind of work is like.  </p>

<p>The effect of having only two sessions on Marie and on me was I think considerable.  For Marie it meant that she needed to monitor how much she became open to the situation.  For me it meant two contradictory impulses.  On one hand, I wanted to do a lot of demonstrations of ways of working, probably being much more active than I ordinarily would be, make it a good demonstration.  On the other hand, I was concerned for Marie that she not be pushed too fast and I wanted to make it a good demonstration in a deeper way by showing what pace  is part of the way we usually operate, rather than pushing.  Nevertheless, I think what emerged does show a reasonably accurate sample of our work.  Now let's meet Marie.</i></p><br>

<p><b>First Psychotherapy Session</b></p>

<p>Bugental:  Marie, as you know, we have talked before briefly just to get acquainted.  We didn't want everything to be just like we've never seen each other before.  We've had very little chance to really talk in any depth and we appreciate your willingness to be here very much.</p>

<p>Marie:  You're welcome.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I think it might be a good place to start if you would just say a little bit as I told you, about some kind of issue or concern that we can explore together for a while.</p>

<p>Marie:  Let's see I have not given it so much thought, as far as focusing in on one, but something that is coming to play more and more in my life is the fact that my father is very ill and we had a life threatening situation due to this illness in December.  And so this is something that has obviously affected me personally and my family as a unit.  And we have a very, a very close family.  Geographically my parents are not here in California but they happened to be during this last trauma.  So that would be one very pertinent focus now.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Sure let's just talk about it a little bit.  How is it with you, you say it was in the past this life threatening incident.  How is it with you right now?</p>

<p>Marie:  I have by virtue of the fact that they are not here in California at this point in time - they left maybe 3 weeks ago - I have been able to get a little more distance on the subject and a little different perspective only because it is not something that I am encountering on a daily basis.  It's generally left me very sad.  I think it's inevitable that this illness will kill my father, but there is a certain amount of hope that he will continue for, you know, a number of years.  That may be a bit optimistic, but I feel that that's a healthier way to look at the whole situation.  But I think even more than feeling sad about this - because I had to go through somewhat of an acceptance during December - with the crisis is a matter of being worried all the time because they are 3000 miles away.  I'm as worried about my mother in this whole process as my father.  And so there's a sense of worry and anxiety.  It's kind of in the back of my mind all the time.</p>

<p>Bugental:  And it's there now?</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah, oh yeah, it's always there.</p>

<p>Bugental:  This may be a little difficult but see if you can just sort of tune into it so I hear how it is in you right now.</p>

<p>Marie:  Right this very minute it's under control, it's under control.  I think that is by virtue of the fact that I had a very positive conversation with them yesterday.  So, a lot of times after chatting with them it leaves one wanting for numerous reasons, but I think yesterday they sounded, both sounded upbeat.  And so in effect that was, you know, you can get off the phone and say, "phew! We're okay until the next conversation."  So as far as really searching myself I think that if I would allow myself to really, really, really start thinking about the inevitable consequences of this disease that I would get very sad once again.  But right this minute I'm okay on it.  It's something that I'm coping with alright today, right now.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yeah, you emphasized right now because it's the sort of thing you can't tell how it will be.</p>

<p>Marie:  Right, right.  I mean it's, you know, it's kind of an invasive thought.  I mean, if I allow it to, there are so many aspects to thinking in terms of my father's mortality and his inevitable death: There's how I will react, there's how my siblings will react, there's my mother's scenario.  And so there are so many different aspects to the whole thing not to mention the fact that, you know, it's my father.  I mean, I'm going to lose my father.  My mother loses a husband, I lose a father; it's pretty overwhelming.  I don't know that I've come full circle on that.  I did a little bit more where the emotions were overwhelming in December but I think my energies, I have taken the course where my energies, those energies are better put towards trying to come up with some interim solutions, trying to be positive, trying to help myself and the family cope.  I think that's kind of where our support system comes in.  It's more with understanding the emotions that everyone is going through on their own level, as well as my father's reaction to this whole thing.  So maybe that's our form or my form of coping with it at least currently.  But inevitably I know it's going to be something that will have to be dealt with purely on an emotional versus an intellectual level because it's going to be a horrible sense of loss.  I mean, I have both my parents alive and-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Isn't that sort of the case right now that there's both the intellectual and the emotional right now and you are controlling the emotional with the intellectual right now.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yes, I think that's very true, I think.</p>

<p>Bugental:  And that becomes a question that you and I need to confront.  If I help you go into the emotional more, will that upset something that's important to your operating, daily operating, or could it be helpful to you to explore it more?</p>

<p>Marie:  I don't know.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I don't either.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah, I really don't know.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I hear as you talk both in the words and in your whole way that you really made a lot of effort to keep it under control.</p>

<p>Marie:  That's true.</p>

<p>Bugental:  And so now if I begin encouraging you to let release that control to some extent how does that, what do you think about that?</p>

<p>Marie:  I am very torn about where that would lead.  I think that the consequences of that could be very positive and shed a lot of light on a lot of different things, but on the other hand it's like upsetting a balance that I have obviously needed to come to some sort of grips with as far as dealing with this.  So that's my honest answer on that.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I hear that.  Why don't you take a minute right now, if you can, do it out loud, but if you can't, to yourself and kind of see, because it's really your choice which direction to go.</p>

<p>Marie:  [Pause] And maybe I ask a question in response to your question and that is from your perspective and your experience is there always a positive end to exploring one's emotions?</p>

<p>Bugental:  The way you are asking I think you know the answer, don't you?</p>

<p>Marie:  Well, yeah. So I suppose-</p>

<p>Bugental:  I can say that more often than not if we get chance to really look through and feel through our feelings we come to the situation involved with better perspective.  That's not always positive in the moment, though it may be in the long run.</p>

<p>Marie:  Right, right. Well, it's taken me a long time to get to the perspective I currently have.  Only I think with the motivation being one of coping more than anything else.</p>

<p>Bugental:  It's a hard choice and I want you to really feel free to make it either way you want.</p>

<p>Marie:  No I think it's, I think under the circumstances that it would be a good endeavor.</p>

<p>Bugental:  That's very gutsy.</p>

<p>Marie:  Well, that's what I am saying now, so.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I understand.  Well let's make one ground rule that any time you find it too uncomfortable, you tell me that, and if we can't balance it out more comfortably we'll just stop, give you a chance to do whatever you need to do with it.</p>

<p>Marie:  Okay.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Good. Let's take a minute now for a transition.  Can you just go inside, maybe down here? [Points to gut, abdomen] See what's stirring after all this talk.</p>

<p>Marie:  The initial thing is fear.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Take your time now.  Fear comes first. Then</p>

<p>Marie:  Then a certain amount of acceptance, I think.  I think this process that you and I will go through is something that I will have to go through on some level at some point in my life, I think, to get the full perspective on this situation.  In general terms death is something that I've not had to deal with a lot in my life and I'm getting to the age that many of my friend's parents are getting ill or dying.  I mean, it's becoming more evident and it brings up a whole bunch of issues.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yes.</p>

<p>Marie:  But-</p>

<p>Bugental:  What does it bring up right now for you?</p>

<p>Marie:  I think just an overwhelming sense of anticipated loss and sorrow. In relation to my father it would bring up a lot of things that, "God I wish I would have, you know, explored that further with him," or this, that and the other, you know.  And I am not a big one on things could have been different.  I just find that kind of non-productive thinking.  I mean, I think that way, but, and I have my own set of regrets.  But I find it far better to kind of accept what's been and try to go forth.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Marie, can you sense there's a sort of rattled quality right now.  Usually you are very contained and controlled, and I think you are beginning to let loose just a little bit.  That's fine.  Just let that inner part, that quiet part speak inside you.  Just go slow.  No rush.</p>

<p>Marie:  And we're still trying to, I am still trying to ascertain what other feelings this brings out in me as far as deciding to explore this a little further.  I think senses of regret, anticipated loss, a certain amount of helplessness, too - helplessness more that I can't help my mother. And, you know, maybe one overriding thing that I did not hit upon earlier is the fact that there are going to have to be some very basic decisions made.  And although these decisions have been grappled with before it's kind of like it's inevitable, I mean, where people are going to live, and things of that nature.  So in another words there is potential for some major changes, some more major changes for everybody involved, everybody, me and my family.  So I think what it ultimately it does for me is I lose any measure of control, I mean, any control I've got over-I have no control over this situation.  There's absolutely nothing I can do about it as far as what's going to be the inevitable.</p>

<p>Bugental:  And control has been important to you.</p>

<p>Marie:  Oh yeah, oh yeah. Yeah that's-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Kind of a wry smile there.</p>

<p>Marie:  Oh yeah, that, that is definitely one of the ways that I get by.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Say a little more about that, getting by through control.</p>

<p>Marie:  I have my own theory on this.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Alright.</p>

<p>Marie:  As far as myself goes.  And I, when I say control I am talking in terms of self control.  And I feel as though that that MO has served me well because in the past I have been out of control and-</p>

<p>Bugental:  So you know the contrast?</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah, I sure do.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I noticed a minute ago when I reflected about control being important your whole manner changed for just a minute.  The careful face broke up into a grin, your voice had much more modulation and generally you have somewhat monotonic speech.  And I felt like I got a glimpse of the Marie in back of the public Marie.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah, there-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Can she talk any more?</p>

<p>Marie:  Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I would like to hear more.</p>

<p>Marie:  The subject of my father's death probably brings a very flat line to my emotions. I mean it's not that I'm uncomfortable talking about it but it certainly does not promote any real positive thoughts, so.</p>

<p>Bugental:  It summons up that control we were talking about, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Marie:  That is true, that's very true.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I think it might be useful - let's do an end run, so to speak - if you could let that, the Marie that's in back of the control, so the strong control, if you could let, get in touch with her, let her speak a little bit. </p>

<p>Marie:  Well, they're actually one and the same person, so that's okay.  I mean, I'm at least integrated to that degree, but one thing that I know and I have kind of experienced say in the last 6 years, 7 years is that I have been far less spontaneous than I used to be.  I think some of that and naturally I think the easiest way to explain that is just in terms of the restrictions that my lifestyle imposes, the demands of work, going to school, family, etc, etc.  But I do know it goes deeper than that.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Do you miss the old day in it?</p>

<p>Marie:  Oh yeah, oh sure, there was a lot less responsibility, or at least perceived responsibility.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I see, I see.</p>

<p>Marie:  Okay?</p>

<p>Bugental:  I see her in that smile that comes in.</p>

<p>Marie:  Oh and I still have a good time-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yeah?</p>

<p>Marie:  Once in a while.  But it's, yeah definitely, I take things a lot more seriously than I have ever in my life.  And I think that that kind of came as a result of a life change I went through about, I guess, going on 7 years ago.  And I quit drinking then.  And that was, that was major.  And I think one of the ways that I coped with not drinking was to become much more controlled.  And because it was an act of sheer will.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yes.</p>

<p>Marie:  At that point in time, so-</p>

<p>Bugental:  But you did it.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah I did, yeah I did.  And I think that the ways in which I coped with that had a natural spin into the way that I operated, period.  So-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Help me understand that a little more because I-</p>

<p>Marie:  Well, I think I'm going back to the spontaneity and the lack thereof, I think - and this goes just through my own way of kind of understanding this - that there was always a lot of internal and external pressure to do well, to do this, to do that, to do whatever, and to become the President of United States. No not quite, but I mean that could-</p>

<p>Bugental:  But pretty high.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, kind of sets the standard, and that imposed a lot of stress from the time I can remember, upwards.  So the one way in which I dealt with that is I drank and I started drinking not at the age of nine or anything like that, but I mean, I started drinking probably when I was 17, 18 and it got increasingly worse and it became my coping pattern and it was the way that I could do away with all of those external responsibilities for lack of a better way of expressing it right now.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Your hands are pretty expressive.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah that's the outside control versus the inside control.  But it went both ways because a lot of this was internalized and I would not point a finger to anyone. I mean, it's me, it's my makeup.  But drinking definitely did away with those constraints or restraints or whatever. But anyway it was not a healthy way to cope with it.  It ended up just getting worse and worse and worse.  And I made a decision to quit after a trauma and that's fine and it worked and- But to go back as far as kind of a full circle on that perspective, I think that in order for me to cope on a daily basis without what became my biggest crutch, I became very, I had to be very regimented initially and this regimentation was nothing that wasn't new to me.  You know, it was going to catholic school and wearing the uniforms and doing the whole, yeah, you know. So I mean the regimentation was nothing new to me but it was the most comfortable arena or way, I guess I should say, that I found to cope. And since that occurred or since that became kind of my way of coping-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yes.</p>

<p>Marie:  And way of living and so, I don't know, maybe it has gotten worse.</p>

<p>Bugental:  It seemed like you were kind of speculating or trying to estimate just then.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Can you let me in on, what was that like, what were you doing just then?</p>

<p>Marie:  What I was just doing?  I was trying to conjure the, my own head trip back then and just kind of see how I was operating and remember how I was operating, what my perspectives were and how it was kind of working out for me.</p>

<p>Bugental:  As you look back from today at that, what does that trigger inside of you?</p>

<p>Marie:  Oh, that poor girl. That's exactly� How did you do it?</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yes.</p>

<p>Marie:  That's exactly what it triggers inside me, I mean, that effort was pretty overwhelming for me.  Yeah. I don't think that- The amount of willpower that I had to find in myself was something I don't know if I would ever be able to do it again. I mean, I suppose because I did it once I can do it again, but that was-</p>

<p>Bugental:  But when you look back today at that time of change you have simply a real admiration for the girl who did that.</p>

<p>Marie:  That is, yeah I do, I sure do.  I sure do.  That's probably what I consider the greatest credit to me is doing that.  That was major.  I am darn sure that I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you if that, the other continued. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Your life really took a turn at that point.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah.  Yeah, I pretty much saved myself.  I was like on the, I think in AA they call it the "yets," it didn't happen yet. Well, I was like probably hanging on with one finger to totally "yet."  So it was about the last possible minute that things could have turned around, so.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Although you chuckle about it now-</p>

<p>Marie:  No, it's-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yeah, there's a lot of feeling.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah there is.  And I think I don't look at it at all on a humorous note but I have to smile because I'm happy.  I mean, you know I really feel-</p>

<p>Bugental: You did it.</p>

<p>Marie: Oh yeah, I am happy there, but I am very grateful that it did not go any further than what it did.  I mean a lot of friends of mine are in a lot of trouble, so, and a lot aren't.  So I think we all kind of, everyone had to make a decision.</p>

<p>Bugental:  When you said, "If I hadn't made the change." </p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah, bad.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Can you imagine what that might have been?</p>

<p>Marie:  Can I imagine what it would have been like?</p>

<p>Bugental:  I don't know.  I'm just curious what the inner experience was because clearly you had a lot of feelings about that.</p>

<p>Marie:  Well it would have just been- I don't know, to be honest with you.  I mean, when I laugh about it, you know, it's - and I shouldn't say laugh but - when I make light of it, it's like, hey, I would have been in jail or dead by now.  And, but in not such a light manner, that's the truth.  I mean, I think that I led a very double life.  I was a fully functioning- I mean, my drinking undoubtedly would have affected my career more sooner than later and it did on minor occasions but that's, let me put it to you this way:  I definitely got a handle on that before anything took a real nosedive.  But it was, but I forgot what I was saying, so I don't remember right now. I can think about it, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental:  That's alright.  Why don't you pause just a minute, we'll both pause and sort of get centered back and I'll do the same thing.</p>

<p>Marie:  Good.</p>

<p>(A Brief Pause While The Video Crew Changes The Tape Cassette) </p>

<p>First Psychotherapy Session (Continued)</p>

<p>Bugental:  Marie, there's no way we can pick up where we were, where we are now.  Why don't you just check in with where are you, now not just with the ideas, but where are your feelings right now?</p>

<p>Marie:  My feeling, let's see, I was just trying to in my mind regroup and connect and see how one subject kind of flowed into the other. But how am I feeling right now? Well I am feeling like I need to think about being spontaneous again in my life a little bit so, which is something I do get accused of, so.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>Marie:  That control, organization, not as spontaneous as-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Accused is not approved of?</p>

<p>Marie:  Right.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I see.  Do you feel that, too, or is that more from the outside?</p>

<p>Marie:  Oh, no, I feel it and I freely admit it. It just happens to be the way I operate and on some levels it works just fine.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I should think so.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Right.</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah, so, um-</p>

<p>Bugental:  And yet, there's, your eyes are falling, there's another side to that story.</p>

<p>Marie:  Sure, there is.  Because I think that one's freedom, or my freedom is actually curtailed to a certain degree.  But when there are X amount of responsibilities and things that need to be accomplished, if it's going to get done it's going to get done.  I do tend to, "overbook myself," you know.  I try not to say I will do 25 things and then consistently only get 20 of them done.  So, in other words, I try not to set myself up for a loss.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Do you know, you are telling me this with a little side glance of- What is it?  It's got a smile and sort of, rueful quality, is it?</p>

<p>Marie:  I don't know.  Maybe it's just, maybe I am just thinking that, "Ah, if my sister, my husband, my brother were all here, they would all be going, �she's saying it out loud,' right now" which is kind of good.  But, so maybe that's why I have-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Would they be surprised?</p>

<p>Marie:  Would they be surprised?  No, no they wouldn't be surprised.  But I think they'd say, "Good, she's admitting it," you know. So acceptance would be the first step.</p>

<p>Bugental:  So you're known in the family for your control?</p>

<p>Marie:  Well, the great organizer.</p>

<p>Bugental:  The great organizer.</p>

<p>Marie:  For sure, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental:  But by acting the great organizer, there's an impish-</p>

<p>Marie:  Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Marie:  I mean, I'm the eldest of four children.  I came about a lot of this stuff naturally.  And it's one of these things where if somebody didn't do it, there have been, I mean, it wouldn't get done.  So, okay I'll do it.  It's just, that's the role that I assumed by default and by my own volition.  So I think they both played a part.  And, you know, if you find or I have found that it is just an MO that works.  So, but what I have also found the older I get is that it's totally an illusion.  So, I mean-</p>

<p>Bugental:  What's the illusion?</p>

<p>Marie:  The illusion of control, you know, that everything's shades of gray.  So as much as I try to plan, organize and orchestrate something's always going to go wrong.  I mean something will always not to be a part of the plan.  So anyway, you know the 2 pages I got on the way over here this morning, they weren't part of the plan that I orchestrated for these 2 jobs that are going on.  So I think, I think that I have to work on - and I am okay on it, I think - that it's just a matter of being somewhat flexible and-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Your whole manner just changed and I had the feeling there was something that you are looking at, sort of chewing on-</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah, I was trying to figure out, am I flexible?  And there would probably be a pretty good debate about that within my family and-</p>

<p>Bugental:  How about within you're-</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah, I think I'm flexible as far as being open minded.  But as far as flexibility with my scheduling, I'm not very good at that.  In fact, I am down right bad at it.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I don't know what bad means in that context.</p>

<p>Marie:  It is not comfortable for me not to go about the day as I have a plan in my mind.  I don't relax very well.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Now that brings up the grin and the chuckle.  What's that?</p>

<p>Marie:  Well it's kind of- It's too bad, I think. It really is.</p>

<p>Bugental:  But the grin and the chuckle don't go with "it's too bad."</p>

<p>Marie:  Well, let's see. Maybe I should think about that. I don't know why. It is incongruent, I guess.</p>

<p>Bugental:  You know the association I had, that perfect people just cut class.</p>

<p>Marie:  Oh yeah, that's probably exactly right.  I think you have nailed it because that would be-that's it. That is true.  That is exactly right.  If I say I am going to blow off my afternoon and read a Ludlum novel, for example, there is always a sense of guilt that I should be doing something else, because there usually is about 1000 things that I could be doing that would be "productive."  So that's true.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Does that trouble you?</p>

<p>Marie:  Oh, I was initially going to say not as much as it used to, but I don't know. Which part of it?  I mean, there are a couple parts of it as far as troubling me.  Does it trouble me that I don't have the kind of time, leisure time?  Maybe, some times.  Does it trouble me that I feel guilty if I do just take a break?  Yeah, but that I think needs exploration.  I know that I've kind of come to a way of, not so much scheduling, but I do indeed allow myself some of that free time and that's something that I didn't do for a long time.  I mean, I think I did it to an excess when I was drinking.  I didn't do it for the first four years I didn't drink mainly just because that was one of the aids to help me along, okay.  And now maybe I am a little bit better about all that.  But I think it's something that I still have got to come to some sort of terms with.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I wonder if this is a thing we could talk more about perhaps next time.</p>

<p>Marie:  Sure.</p>

<p>Bugental:  And does this make sense?  Is it a good place to stop?</p>

<p>Marie:  Yeah.  Yeah, it feels like a good place to stop for me.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Okay.  I want to suggest, Marie, don't feel you have to do any homework. Let whatever happens, any thoughts and big views or anything just happen, but you don't have to do anything like an assignment between now and next time.</p>

<p>Marie:  Good.</p>

<p>Bugental:  And we will talk some more.</p>

<p>Marie:  Thank you.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Thank you.</p><br>

<p><b>Discussion</b></p>

<p>Bugental:  Working with Marie at the outset, I found that the current concern about her father's death would probably take us into things that would be more upsetting for her than I thought we wanted with just the time limitation.  And I was thinking about that when I realized that I overlooked the thing I keep teaching you all about: What's the leading edge of the resistance? Which of course was her control, so manifest.  And then when we switched to that, well, it gave us a useful area in which to work.  She was astonishingly candid, clear in her presentation, but the control was always there.  And sometimes she was able to let it down briefly, and I respected that given her history; she's done a splendid job.</p>

<p>Yalom:  Getting back, though, to the issue with her father: You made a point there of giving her a choice of whether she really wanted to work on that on an emotional level or not.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yes.</p>

<p>Yalom:  And she said she did and yet.</p>

<p>Bugental:  And yet it's been proved that it'd be better not to.</p>

<p>Yalom:  What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Bugental:  Well, she did see the value of trying to get into it.  I don't think she recognized at that point what it would mean to really get into all the things about her father and her family and so on.  And if we had a long relationship, open ended relationship to work with and we weren't on camera then I think that might have been a very fruitful area to plumb.  But since even though she said that she was willing, even that you may remember was somewhat conditioned.</p>

<p>Sapienza:  Yeah, I wasn't sure when she said that she wanted to do it what she really wanted to do.</p>

<p>Bugental:  No, neither was I. And so when the other opportunity opened, that's the much better way to go.</p>

<p>Yalom:  It seemed, though, you pursued that a couple of times to see that if she was able to work on a more affective level about her father and his illness.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I don't remember, yeah, that could be.</p>

<p>Yalom:  But you were saying that you made a conscious decision to move away from that.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Uh, huh. Particularly as we got onto the subject of her control, which did seem a very available area to work in.</p>

<p>Yalom:  My sense was you were fairly gentle with her and very supportive.  You didn't- You gave her a lot of support.  You didn't push her a lot.</p>

<p>Bugental:  That's true, yeah.</p>

<p>Yalom:  Can you say more about why you chose that approach?</p>

<p>Bugental:  I am very aware of being on camera, that this is going to be recorded, other people will see it. I would not want to do anything to make her feel embarrassed later or regretful that she participated.  We can teach enough without bringing that about.</p>

<p>Douglas:  I also noticed that you were quite willing to work with her in a timeframe that she brought up, about 7 years ago, and a lot of things happened for her And knowing you and your sort of predilection for emphasizing and coming out of the here and now, I was interested in that, how you came to be quite content to dally there.</p>

<p>Bugental:  But she was experiencing now, which was where I was going, even though the content was 7 years ago.</p>

<p>Douglas:  It seemed like you picked that up somehow that there was a wealth of feeling attached to that time frame.</p>

<p>Bugental:  And as we learned, it was a big emotional thing that happened 7 years ago and it is still going on, in a certain way. She is still very carefully controlled.</p>

<p>Douglas:  Can you remember what clues you saw that led you to see or intuit that, that might be really fruitful there?</p>

<p>Bugental:  I think, this is hindsight so I am not totally sure, but the thing that comes to mind now is that little change in her manner. I think I commented on it.  She had been almost monotonic, I was struck because when I saw her briefly beforehand she wasn't that monotonic.  She was clearly in control as we began and then something we talked, I guess when I reflected about the control, I don't know, it'd be interesting to see, but her manner changed.  There was almost a girlish laugh, her face became animated, her tone had intimation and so on.  So that I think is the thing that particularly-</p>

<p>Douglas:  Got you.  Yeah, I know that you really seem to pick up on that and use that as a theme.</p>

<p>Bugental:  And to recall it back to her from time to time.</p>

<p>Yalom:  Yeah, you picked up several times on her laughter, her mannerisms or her hand movement.</p>

<p>Douglas:  Less controlled-</p>

<p>Bugental:  And it wasn't under such tight control, so it gave us an opening, an entry point.  Yeah.</p>

<p>Yalom:  It seemed like you were able to do that in a positive manner, rather than confronting her on her resistance, on her control, you were able to point out the areas that she was, that were kind of breaking through that.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yes, right.</p>

<p>Yalom:  And you really joined with her in a positive way about that.</p>

<p>Bugental:  That's my effort, right.  And particularly this really is, quite aside from audience and camera, this is really the first interview. We had, what, 15 minutes maybe to get acquainted.  And in the first interview, I sure wouldn't confront her, you know, in an abrupt fashion.  And she cooperated, you see, that control was something she could let down, not drop, let down and then bring back as she need to but she was willing to.</p>

<p>Sapienza:  But once again for me it spoke to the respect that you have for resistance.  And the importance that Marie feels about her need to control and to intellectualize, that they were going hand in hand: your respect and her awareness for what she was doing and needs to do at times.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Marie provides such a wonderful example of why one needs to respect resistance.  She's remade her life.  And, sure, it's a resistance in some sense, but it's also a structure that's made for, uh, saved her life, one would say from what she has told us.</p>

<p>Yalom:  You use the word resistance differently than a lot of people. A lot of people use it as a resistance to therapy, and you can certainly conceptualize Marie's resistance on that level, her control being a resistance in the therapy. And yet you see it in a broader context.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Much broader, yes. Good point, Victor, because the resistance to therapy or to the interview that we saw was so quickly, she could lower that, but the resistance in back of that to being out of control which is not something just in this room or with me, it's clear that's part of the way she has learned to manage her life.  I don't want her to overcome that; don't want to have her feel it broken or something.</p>

<p>Yalom:  In the long haul, you want to address that.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yes.  Good point. If we went on for some time and she was able to and wanted to work further on it, I'd like to make it less compelled, that she would get even more choice about when she is going to be in control.  She hinted towards the end of our time together of some feeling that sometimes it was too much and that what her husband, her brother-</p>

<p>Sapienza:  Yes, her family was, would be glad to hear her say that-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yes.</p>

<p>Sapienza:  She had difficult relaxing or letting go of things.</p>

<p>Bugental:  But the fact she could say that already says that it isn't as tight as it might be if she couldn't.  She said it with humor rather than resentment, which another person might feel.</p>

<p>Yalom:  But there was, she was saying that they would, they would chuckle to hear her say it out loud.</p>

<p>Bugental:  That's right, to cop to it, right.  One thing that was so apparent with Marie was that she tends to strain all incoming through thinking about. Very seldom, did we get direct to the feelings first.  And that's of course the nature of the control.  It also means that I think Maria feels, and she showed this toward the end, that there is something more that she wants.</p>

<p>Sapienza:  How did you see that when she showed it toward the end?</p>

<p>Bugental:  Well, in her ability to criticize herself about it, in her use of sister, husband, so forth, in her manner with me.  She was able to, I can't remember the words now, but to kind of be more immediately personal in responding to me then she had- Before the break, you know, before we had the pause, I was concerned that that pause would make her go back all way up to tight control, and it didn't.  She functioned very well on a more open level.</p>

<p>Sapienza:  One of the things I was really, thought was so poignant in that session was this idea of this impish quality to her face and her voice and this admiration.  You pointed to her when the, I guess maybe there are two things I am bringing up: one is this quality that you picked up that she could really relate to, and the other is this admiration that she had for herself for what she had done and how she had used her, what you might call defense to get herself out of. That both those things were so poignant for me in watching you work with her. And the way, I thought that was the moment where the feeling was much more than the surface than-</p>

<p>Bugental:  I think you're right.</p>

<p>Yalom:  I found myself a number of times while watching it feeling being moved almost to tears, and yet it seemed that the affect was more restrained for her.  I am wondering what you felt during the interview with her.</p>

<p>Bugental:  After we got, found the avenue to work in so to speak, I was able to let go more I guess to the immediate process.  Before that I was trying to, now wait a minute, I don't want to push too hard on this death of her father thing.  What else can we do to have a good interview for the camera? And I was busy like that in a way that I prefer not to be but often happens.</p>

<p>Yalom:  But often it gets in the way of-</p>

<p>Bugental:  It gets in the way, right.  And if it, you know, that can happen with no camera and no audience, there are other things that can bring it up.  But once we found, so to speak, the avenue in which we can work I felt increasing admiration for her.  And I think that's the word, just appreciation.  By damn, she pulled herself up by her bootstrap.  There was just a hint about some trauma that precipitated the change.  But we all know, I am sure, from our clinical experience that there can be traumas and still a change doesn't occur.  Some don't react, respond, as proactively as she seems to have.  I had moments of curiosity what that was, but that really wasn't the point of it.  The point was that she used it to change this.  The other feeling that I had was almost a playful one, when I mentioned the impish smile.
 
Yalom:  And the kid cutting school.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yeah, the kid cutting school, I could tease her just a little bit to try to evoke that other side.  And she responded greatly to both.</p>

<p>Sapienza:  And I think that's important.  You evoke, you helped evoke the positive or the side that was- You know, we might think, well, she is telling us that she is sad and she is not showing it.  But there was this other side of her that is so important in this case which is that spontaneity in that little girl and that-</p>

<p>Bugental:  If we were working longer, again, open-ended, I would probably do something similar for her.  It helps to make the alliance stronger.  But we have had that kind of understanding, sort of almost our secret understanding, you know, that there is an imp in there. Then to come back to the sadness, we got money in the bank, so to speak.  Then to say, for instance, we might say, "When you think or how will you feel about your father right now, can you say what comes with it?" in a way that I wouldn't have said this early, and I hadn't said that and that's- When I would want to help her get back to the sad part, too, which we would need to do, we have something to draw on because we have had this, seen the other side, acknowledged the other side.</p>

<p>Yalom:  What you refer to is kind of giving the support, as well as balancing the support with the-</p>

<p>Bugental:  Confrontation.</p>

<p>Yalom:  Confrontation, right.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Exactly so, right.</p>

<p>Yalom:  It seems it's, when she would get up into her head a lot and intellectualize to give explanations for her behavior there is a part of me that wanting you to push her more, and kind of breakthrough that resistance kind of in a more traditional way of thinking about resistance. This helps me to understand more; you were really nurturing the kind of the support and the alliance so that such confrontations would be possible.  She wouldn't feel attacked.</p>

<p>Bugental:  That's the difficulty with first interviews and early interviews: building the alliance, the container within which confrontation can occur. You know, we've sometime said this support, the pressure and the back stop.</p>

<p>Yalom:  What's the back stop?</p>

<p>Bugental:  The alliance, the clients' feeling that we don't see them just as resistant, that we see more of them and that, the steadfastness with which we contain the readiness to be effected by that.  I think we don't always recognize how important it is to most clients to know that they can make us, make an impact on us, that we will change the topic if they need that, or that we will give them support if they need that or that we will be standing steady even if they assail us, that's also backed up.</p>

<p>Yalom:  I guess it's, to get back to what we talked about earlier in terms of defining her kind of resistance or that controlling part of her and seeing that even though you are saying you weren't really working on the underlying characterological resistance-</p>

<p>Bugental:  No.</p>

<p>Yalom:  In a sense you were because you were already labeling it and you were already talking about it and you were already making that a topic of discussion.  And just helping her recognize that I think is the first step.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yeah, absolutely, but it's from a high altitude.  We hadn't come down to the ground level with it.  We are just observing it, saying, "Oh ye,s we see it's there," and then later we would need to come down to ground.</p>

<p>Sapienza:  Well, I think that it speaks to when I am always amazed, and it reminds me all the time to do myself in my work is the pacing, the way that you right from the beginning stayed with her, didn't interject anything, didn't try to get it to go a certain way, but really looked for your avenue, but let her lead you to where that avenue was, and even with this resistance it's the same.</p>

<p>Bugental:  I think the thing that stood out for me most was the growing, her growing ability to let the other side, the playful, that feelingful side, and I suspect that this side also has the pain in it though we didn't get into that, but even in this short, somewhat artificial situation, she really showed movement along that.</p>

<p>Sapienza:  She did.</p>

<p>Douglas:  She even commented that she had something to think about now.</p>

<p>Bugental:  Yeah, right and she'll do it.</p>

<p>Douglas:  Right.</p>

<p>Bugental:  That's why I didn't want to give her any assignment to work on in between.</p>

<p>Yalom:  Yeah, because that would have been her tendency from what she told you?</p>

<p>Bugental:  I think, yeah</p>

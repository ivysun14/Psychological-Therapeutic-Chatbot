<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's all there is to that.  Now back to the question at hand, Michael Jackson.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is my opinion on Michael Jackson?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that, uh, it's been overpublicized.  I think there's too much media involved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and it's sick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My, my opinion, yeah.  My opinion, I think they carried it too far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I agree with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In fact, they was talking on the television, um, they [INAUDIBLE] think the bills, [INAUDIBLE] was 100, $100,000,000, or something like that.  Uh, they're wanting, uh, the people who paid for his, pay, pay for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> $100,000,000?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] something like that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Was that right?  Was that the thing they did at the, the Staples Center?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was something like that.  Now, [INAUDIBLE] you know, they're wanting the people to pay for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], you know what I heard today on the radio?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That they, that they are still planning on putting on a concert, a big show, and they're going to go on tour.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they're going to use a hologram and, like, project his image —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Onto the stage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then they're wanting to take his kids —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You going to go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To start, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're wanting his kids to be the Jackson Three or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can't believe it.  Exploitation, I would say.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before it's all over, there's going to be a big lawsuit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got, I got a feeling they, they're [INAUDIBLE], the dad was cut out of the will completely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He got cut out of the will completely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it'll be, uh, I think more people might end up, uh, you know, getting, uh, in trouble with this one, too.  With, with the law, because it's going to create a lot of angry people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus that, he owes a lot of money to the government, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Back taxes and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  He did spend money, didn't he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you know, we'll just have to see.  So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why does it upset you, though?  You think there's just too much of it on the news and in the papers and stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I, I get into the news.  I like the news.  I get it, my [INAUDIBLE] he's watching the news or, uh, health channel or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I li, I like to get a little bit educated more, like, well I am, but I'm more education than I do have now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've only got a third grade education, you know.  But most the education I got is the street education.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that.  But it's just something to do and that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  So which friend did you go with?  Who took you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], the guy [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.  The guy I live with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now what happened, um, was he in the hospital?  Or who was in the hospital we were talking about last time?  Someone went to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't think —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So who was the guy that went to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was this other guy.  He went to [DEIDENTIFIED], not [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] went down to see him there.  But there is another person, I, I, I told him about you and that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He want, he wants to try to get here instead, you know, in your —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When you, um, she has [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But her, but her medication [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's in, um, not [DEIDENTIFIED], a hospital out in [DEIDENTIFIED], or wherever it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  Yeah.  I went out there to see her yesterday, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that was nice of you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  She's, I asked her, I said, "Stop worrying about people.  Start worrying about yourself."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because you're number one.  She's very religious.  She says God is number one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, of course, I ain't talking [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Stop worrying about other people and start worrying about yourself now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is her doctor, and, uh, she wants to be away from there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Why is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess, because, I guess the medication is too strong [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.  Did she ask [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] to change the medicine around a little bit, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But I don't know.  I don't now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, why won't, you, you're the psychiatrist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I'm, I'm, I'm not, I don't really understand what she's talking about.  I think it's best, to me, you're a fine, your a fine, uh, psychiatrist as far as I'm concerned.  I think, I go over and said, "You ought to try [PHYSICIAN NAME]."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Well that's fine.  I'd like to be able to help out if I can.  Is she still in [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Or did she get out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  She's still in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's still there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's supposed to get out either today or tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that was nice.  How did you get there to visit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] took me up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a long ways, and, and that's all uphill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well that house, that house was setting up, that's all uphill going up there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We got, we had to get the wheelchair and that, man.  I got, when I come, when I left, I went down the, I [INAUDIBLE] going downhill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wonder if that's, you know, was that out, like, by [DEIDENTIFIED], like out, uh, by [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Or maybe you did go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  No, [DEIDENTIFIED].  Um, where's that hospital out there?  They have a, they have a, set, uh, thing there in that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it out by [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Or is it more south?  I don't know if [DEIDENTIFIED] has a hos, what, what was the name of it?  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, we, uh, what, what the, what a hospital you said it was?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well there's, there is one in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the one she's in.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And it's perfect to go up the elevators to, like, the third floor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  We went up the second floor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That could be.  Second floor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because it, that, that hospital, it hasn't got that many places to [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  But, but we went past this other hospital, in [INAUDIBLE] building, you know?  But it's east, east, you know?  That's going to be a t, tremendous hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And there's, and then there's a —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you know who owns the [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], I guess, has some rights to the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] is a private place now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I, no, no, I think, [DEIDENTIFIED] owns that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Person to talk to you [INAUDIBLE].  We haven't got that much in, in common to talk about, or nothing.  I like to talk about different things and stuff like that, and that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, the guy who was hospitalized.  What was his name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I can't think right now.  I'm —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's just a friend who lives out that way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He owned his house and that, and he lives in, in the back [INAUDIBLE].  The renter caused him to lose his house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, he, it, it wasn't the house you're in, though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  [NAME OTHER] wanted to bring him there to live, and I said, "No way.  That's your choice.  Me or him."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he said, "No.  I ain't going to lose you."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I got it.  So he was a, he approached [NAME OTHER] to go move in with you guys.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [NAME OTHER] knew him.  I talk to him once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I'll light up one without even knowing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel, [NAME OTHER], that you're getting enough rest and sleeping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I sleep almost every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you eating okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any changes in your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did, uh, [NAME OTHER] check your, uh, weight today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 200 pounds.  She said 200.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Okay.  What do you think, then, about your medications?  Do they seem to be getting the job done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  I think it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So do you seem like you do, you do better in the summer months than the winter, or not much difference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well in winter time [INAUDIBLE], there's nothing to do but set inside.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I draw a lot.  I can keep myself occupied for a little while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because sometimes people feel that they function a little bit better in the summer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm just, I sit outside and watch, watch the cars go by, and [INAUDIBLE].  And there's [INAUDIBLE] right down the road from us, and I can sit there an watch them loading, uh, trees on trucks or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's something to occupy my mind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I get an attitude, but it goes away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I get edgy, edgy and just snap at you, or something like that, you know, but it goes away.  We all, we have our good days, we got our ro, bad days.  And that's in anybody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  That's true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't care who it is.  Man, man, woman, or I don't care who [INAUDIBLE].  We have our good days, we got our bad days, and we'll make the best out of any one of them then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's the way to do it.  Does, does, uh, do you, do you talk to [NAME OTHER] then, about —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any, uh, of, you know, how things are going day to day?  I mean, does he seem to be a supportive guy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He should, he's, no.  He's so tired.  I, we, I like to talk about Michael Jackson.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's so tired of hearing about it, about all this stuff, about all, how crazy he was and all that stuff?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's so ti, tired of hearing about it.  And they still haven't buried him yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  They took his casket out to the cemetery, but they still haven't put him in the ground yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I didn't know that.  I, I would imagine they would be doing that soon, sooner rather than later, at this point.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The casket, you know what the casket is made out of?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Gold plated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that doesn't surprise me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Gold plated.  Yeah.  And tell you something about, grave diggers, they, they can go ahead and put him in the ground.  They have to have guards on it every, somebody digging him up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Boy, sort of, turned himself into, like, a mummy with the caskets.  [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  But the mum, the mum, the embalming fluids only lasts so long, [INAUDIBLE] underground.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well he always did have that infatuation with the with the, uh, the folks, you know, the Egyptians and the tombs.  You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Like I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pyramids.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But like I said —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe they'll put him in a pyramid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They'll build one out there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hear you.  [LAUGHING].  Was he that great?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I, you know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Depends on who you ask, I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're talking about, they're wanting the people to pay for the funeral and all that crap, now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I don't know why that would make any sense.  You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't catch it all.  Something about, um, the price, the price is over, overrated or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They didn't expect all that stuff and that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was, the little girl, his daughter, she spoke up, and all that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They weren't expecting all that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Those people, they were expecting more, there was more than they was expecting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It, it was, uh, interesting, though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well it [INAUDIBLE] the President.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're right about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then, then they, uh, talk, they were talking about the President was going to have the [INAUDIBLE] for him then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Want the truth?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, when was the last time you checked them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About four or five months ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you pretty good, generally about taking all of your medicine, and all that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I take all of that.  See that's one thing I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So don't you have a, you know, some way of checking your blood sugars, though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  I've got, um, um, one of the meters at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm out of tape.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well why are you out of tapes?  Can't you get some more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I need to get some.  Yeah I can get more.  I can get some, I can order some more of that.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But to me, it's too much, it's a lot of bother to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it is, man, but you might think different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I do think different, because I know that this —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It can really affect a lot of, uh, different body parts.  I mean, it can affect your brain.  It can affect your, you know, your, your kidney or your liver, you know, your blood flow, your heart.  All these things are affected when sugar diabetes are out of whack.  So I would recommend it.  Um, and you have the thing at home, you just got to order it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what you're telling me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I order it.  I order it, and he goes [INAUDIBLE] and picks it up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I've been out of medication, and sometimes I have to call here and have [NAME OTHER] order it for me, because I run, run out of it.  You know what I mean?  And my, you know, I'm, I got, like, three—month's supply?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I run out in three months, I haven't got no appointment with you then, then, um, I call [NAME OTHER] and she'll, she'll have, uh, she'll have you to call it in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're going to cut me off the medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're coming out with something new.  [DEIDENTIFIED] something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.  You have to be converted over.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, well yeah.  They will cut me off [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, um, when that happens, let's just make sure that we, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because we did have that one issue, I think, with your prescription for a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Effexor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which they ain't getting, they [INAUDIBLE] they cut me off this other one now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, just make sure you don't lose your benefits.  If you need to talk to somebody in the office there or something, when, when does that effect go into place?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In three months, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Well that's all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As long as, uh, my name doesn't come up on anything about what I'm taking, then, I'll be all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'll be fine.  There's no reason —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why it wouldn't.  And, um, you know, you're able to, um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm not getting no other medications, but the ones you give me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] gives it to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This has nothing to do with your insurance.  All right.  Um, but you need to get those, you know, you need to get your blood sugars checked.  How do you do it?  Do you just check the finger?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I got to get some tape for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, the little [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll be —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you have a script to do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you need a script?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got a new script.  I can get the down at the drugstore.  Well I have taken my meter in, and they'll, they'll set it for  me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you, do you need to talk to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] to get them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well can you  put that on your list of things to do.  I mean, maybe you can do that on your way home today.  Because I think if you procrastinate —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Call, call, call [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and ask him if I have to have a prescription for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's talk to [NAME OTHER] and see if she knows.  All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, I'd be happy to call the pharmacy so you don't run out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take my machine, I could go home, get my machine take it down there.  They'll set it up for me, because they got to, I don't even know how to set that machine up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you know the number to the pharmacy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  No, but you do.  You got it one time, remember?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]  I have to go back and bring that from home.  I'm scared to death of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  I'm —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Scared of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Looking here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm wanting to get them out of my possession, pretty soon, so you want them?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it CVS?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's Walgreens.  Walgreens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I'm, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE],  I'm scared I'm going to find out something's wrong with me.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That might be it.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  A Walgreens, [DEIDENTIFIED].  They're just test strips.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Just test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long ago did you run out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I been out of them for a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if you have them, you'll use them.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  If I have them, I'll use them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hang on.  I'll talk to the pharmacist.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We're not, might, [INAUDIBLE], so they could set it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you remember in the past if you've needed a script?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For those, have you needed a prescription in the past for them, for those strips?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't even worry about it, I don't worry about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What I do know, I take the medication you gave me, because I [INAUDIBLE].  I know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll see what they've got to say.  You probably don't know the name of that device do you?  That the test strip?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Next time I come in I, I'll bring it [INAUDIBLE] or I can have, I have [NAME OTHER] call me it in here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER], [PHYSICIAN NAME] here.  I've got a question for you.  I've got a patient here, [PATIENT NAME].  Um, I'm a psychiatrist, but I know he has diabetes, and he hasn't been checking his insulin, or his blood sugars, because he ran out of test strips.  Does he need a script for test strips, or does he just bring his machine in and buy them over the counter sometime?  Okay.  Do you have Medicare?  Do you have Medicare?  Yeah.  I, I think he is.  So, so do I, uh, can I, oh wait, he's got a Medicaid [INAUDIBLE] here.  [INAUDIBLE].  Oh yeah.  He's got a, no that Medicare other.  I don't know, I'm looking at his medications here.  Um—hum.  It says, yeah, that's what it says, other insurance codes, but there's nothing listed.  Oh, where it says Medicare number, there's nothing there.  There's a Medicaid number there.  Hum.  But at least in the short run, he can at least get them over the counter?  Okay.  All right.  Well I'll just send him there with his reader and he can figure it out with you guys.  All right.  Thanks for your help.  Bye.  Okay.  So, um, you can get it over the counter, and while you're there, you might want to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How much that going to cost to [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Show the lady your card, you know, your insurance card and they can figure out if you can, maybe bill it to Medicare, I guess.  I don't know.  But for sure you can buy them over the counter.  I don't know how much it might cost you.  Okay?  But do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can call [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But it sounds —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That's true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Calling [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But in any case the lady says she's got the test strips there.  You can go get them.  You can pay for them, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Seventy—five dollars is what they are.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that right?  Damn.  Well why don't you, uh, you know, talk to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and maybe see if a prescription would help.  Doesn't seem right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that, that, the pills I got yesterday —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I had to pay $2 for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See them things are, run up at 20 some dollars apiece.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's expensive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're in —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's also important, you know.  I mean you need to keep an eye on your blood sugars.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  So what else is happening the rest of the summer here?  Anything new going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wish I knew.  [LAUGHING].  But I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take it one day at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the only way to take it.  One day at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.  That's so true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Some, some people drive themselves crazy —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that's the only way to do it.  One day at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We never plan nothing, because me and my wife —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I was over there —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Used to plan our vacations.  We had some amazing, we planned on going down to our hometown —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For vacation.  And something else happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we never planned again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If we ever planned ahead, something goes wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It never fails.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It never fails.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I guess, it's a lesson learned.  So next time you plan something, you can anticipate —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We just, we would —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] vacation at all.  But we went there for a funeral.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right after [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.  Wow.  That doesn't sound like much of a vacation.</p>

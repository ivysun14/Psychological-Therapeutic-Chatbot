<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we'll set it, how about if we set it here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that going to be in your way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So anyway, I got a new addition to my lovely little family—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And one more coming.  I got a gorgeous little Papillon dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really, and you look like you have pictures.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Four pounds.  Yes I do have pictures.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long have you had it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, let's see, I got him, I spent the entire month up, up in Nebraska with [NAME OTHER].  They bought an, an old Victorian home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's, uh, it's got a lot of historical, it was the third house in, uh, not [DEIDENTIFIED] to be built by the, the man who did all the plumbing for the town at that time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, it's got some of the historic stuff still in it like the original tile floor in the foyer—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the original fireplace.  They took the stairway out, the front stairway out because they made it into an apartment upstairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But anyway, it's just a gorgeous little house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And big enough for the family.  Well, she told me a week and a half, two weeks ago, we're going to have another baby.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's exciting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING] and they're shooting for a girl this time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  When are they due?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She just found out, so she's right in the early stages or morning sickness and she's got—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, uh, and he's in Florida, NCO training [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Poor kid, every time she gets pregnant, he's gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's, I remember that from last time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so how long were up there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I, uh, helped them pack up their house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, they got it sold, and I helped them pack up the house and watched the kids, and then I made, uh, well got, got the kids all settled and went back home, and then I was up again last month for a week and a half, and made curtains for their living room and their foyer and, or little sitting room and, uh, for their kitchen, and going to go back up next month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really excited about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, stuff like that, that's nice.  It sounds like you two are—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get enthused about her house and, and I started making curtains for mine and it's taken me 2 months so far [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] there's something more satisfying about doing something for someone else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Especially your daughter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But anyway, she's, you know, she's excited about the baby and yet real upset too because my husband and her mother in law are just way down on it, and they just give her a bunch of crap every time she tells them she's pregnant.  You know, that's not fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, and her and her husband both planned it, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, she had her husband call my, call dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, why would she be afraid to tell me about it, and I says because she knew that you just shot a bunch of negative again, and she didn't want to hear it, and quite honestly neither do I, and that's where it's at.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How did he respond to that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I think it's stupid.  They don't need any more kids, and I says like I said, I don't want to listen to it, and neither does she.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's happy about it.  I'm happy about it.  It's one more for me to love.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I says if they can handle it financially, why not?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How are things for you at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's never going to change.  I'm never going to get him to change.  As long  as I can get away one, one week out of the month, and not have to listen to his thoughts and, and his not feeling good and that, and have a week away from him, I'm, I can handle it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do, do you guys have any good times together or things that you can enjoy doing as a couple?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, he, uh, if he's with his friends, he can gone for hours, but if we say, I'll say you want to go into [DEIDENTIFIED] with me.  Well what are you going to do?  And I tell him what I plan on doing.  No, I don't want to go.  And, uh, if I go in with him because he'll pressure me to go in with him, it's go in, do what he wants to do, always have to eat because all he thinks about is his stomach, and home.  And I mean we, it's a 50 minute drive both ways, you know.  We could be back home in 2 hours to 2 and a half hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it wasn't that fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I just go wandering off by myself and get lost for sometimes 8 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just doing my thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you, can you guys do anything together like a meal out or something like that that maybe is a little bit more potentially enjoyable for both of you, some middle ground?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He won't plan, he won't plan anything.  I mean I'll say why don't we go do this.  Well, we'll see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I don't know, we'll see.  I'm not, but last 2 weeks, he hasn't been feeling good, so I mean, you know, he just doesn't want to do, I finally took up a new habit, playing computer games because at least I can sit down and start that, and if he yells the dog needs out or something, I can put it on pause and go let the dogs out because he's, he'll let the dog stand there and suffer for 5 minutes or a half an hour before he'll get up and let him out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's kind of, it's kind of sad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes I feel so empty when I'm there, you know, just because there's this, you know, like a friend of mine called and, uh, she has emphysema.  Well, not emphysema, she's got lung problems, but it's not from smoking, and anyway, she has her oxygen she has to take with and that, and sometimes her kids can't always take her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she called out of the, you know, clear blue sky not knowing if I would be willing to do it or not and asked if I could take her up to get her blood test for her doctor's appointment, and I said well sure, no problem.  Well I wasn't even gone 2 hours and he was all upset because I was, why are you taking her?  Why can't her kids take her?  And I said because her kids are busy and she needs to get this blood taken before she goes for her doctor's appointment, and I says I don't mind doing it.  Well it seems kind of inconvenient, doesn't it?  I says nothing's inconvenient for a friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and we ended up going shopping.  Well we got home and we were going to sit and have lunch together.  I wasn't there 3 minutes and the phone rang.  The dog was going crazy and, and I had to get home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you, did you go home or did you spend some of your time there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I, I sat and visited with her for a little longer, and told her we'd have lunch next time and, and, you know, I went on home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I didn't want to listen to him when I got home, and she wasn't, she was tired anyway, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, it was just one of those things.  It was easier for me to go ahead and leave so she could get her groceries put away anyway, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, you know, normally I would have stayed, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, the dog was getting a little antsy too because I had the dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, the dog was getting antsy and driving him crazy.  The dog, if I leave for 3 minutes, I come back and he's got tears running down his face, and he misses me, and he does go hyper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He, I was going to ask you can I bring my dog in sometime with me when I visit or do they allow that?  He's 4 pounds and he has his own little purse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bring him in that and bring him on in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, the, uh, yeah, the, the, as a general rule, the issue that they say is, you know, that it's a, somebody should, they, they want to make sure that they're up to date on their shots and all those kind of things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  I carry that with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.  Well, you got that anyway, and besides the fact of, again—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's got his rabies tag on, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, I, uh, because I travel so much between here and, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nebraska, I carry the papers with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, that's fine.  And like I said, for a spontaneous visit, uh, you know, and have them with you, it's not going to create an issue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, uh, I just didn't, well I want you to meet him because he is such a little character.  He barks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He sounds like he's brought some real joy to your life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh man, I get up and walk 2 to 3 times a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wasn't even exercising before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he's just, I love him.  He's just, uh, my little sweetheart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you sleeping at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah I have been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you think you get for hours on average do you get?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anywhere from, anywhere from 6 to 12.  It depends.  You see him?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oops, I bet I hit the button again.  I did.  All right, hang on a minute.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And tell me again how many hours are you getting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anywhere from, um, 6 to 12.  It just depends.  I have some days where I'll only sleep maybe 4 hours, and then other times I'll sleep forever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's great.  Oh, that's great.  I like them dogs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, he's a little Papillon and you know, the thing of it is is, you know, as in, uh, oh, there's, um, when I was in [DEIDENTIFIED] with, with [NAME OTHER], uh, he called and told me that these people had this dog that they were going to get rid of, and he was real little, 4 pounds, you know, and it was a Papillon and I says, he says they're going to take him to the pound.  I says he's not going to the pound.  I want you to go get him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's, I says I've wanted one for a long time, and I says if, if they can't take care of him and it's too much for them, then you just go get him, and, uh, oh, here we go.  I got more of him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As you said, these are grandkid photos.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I go more pictures of the dog than anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, [INAUDIBLE].  Do you, how do you feel like you're doing just kind of mood wise day to day?  Are you getting any sustained periods of lows?  Are you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I get low once in a while, but nothing, you know, not weeks at a time, not, um, not days at a time, just once in a while, just everyday lows, you know.  This weather is kind of getting to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, it's, it's gloomy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and, and it kind of gets to me, and, um, over the last couple of days I've just felt like of empty because, well I just don't, you know, I get bummed with my husband and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I can't help that, and I can't help the way he is, but, uh, you know, sometimes it's a little—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Makes me feel empty because he doesn't want to do anything with me, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ever of that intensity of life isn't worth living, those kind of feelings at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  No, I've got all kinds of things to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what you said.  I understand from where we've been, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, do you have, have you had any periods of, of those, those kind of those hypomanias where you go days with markedly diminished sleep and you're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do have a lot of those.  Uh, I, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long do they last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh they can last for weeks sometimes where I'll go and just, you know, 5:00 on the morning I'm finally going to sleep, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When's the last time you went through one of those cycles?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how long did that one last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, about 4 or 5 days maybe, you know, just weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you get in any trouble at all through that time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Spending more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Spent more time sleeping through the day, but, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No problems.  I'm still able to function.  In fact, I've been functioning better I think this week.  I'm actually fixing meals, you know, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And not resenting fixing the meals.  Um, you know, uh, I finally decided well if you don't like the way it tastes, fix it yourself.  I'm going to eat it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do those episodes, at this point, cause you distress?  I mean do they, are they, you know, some people can get to those hypomanias where they're, they're not necessarily a bad thing.  They're different.  They're a change, and other people really it's, they're still doing things or they're more irritable or they're having a difficult, more difficult time in terms of just kind of their functioning because of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The only, I get very irritable at home.  I, I guess I do snap at, at [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does that happen during those times, or is that independent of those times?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Those times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those times.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Those times, yeah.  I, I do, uh, I do get, you know, and I can tell when, when, when they're hitting me that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and, uh, but the dog has been helping me, me with, control that because if things start getting to me, I, and he's sitting there wagging his tail and whining and getting excited about going someplace, I mean I just pack him up and we go.  Last night I walked with him.  I walked, uh, well over a mile one way, walked down to [NAME OTHER], uh, to go visit with a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A friend in the rain [LAUGHING].  The poor little dog got cold, but he's the one who led the way [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so I carried him home in my coat, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How you doing with smoking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not.  I'm still smoking like a chimney, you know, maybe worse than a chimney.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Last time I talked to you, you were down to about half a pack a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm back to a pack.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it doesn't seem like the Wellbutrin has made a whole lot of difference one way or the other?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No I stopped, I stopped taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long ago did you stop it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, about 2 months ago.  Maybe I have increased because of it, and I just didn't realize it was really helping.  I don't know, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, one of the other things that, that I guess I, I think about [PATIENT NAME] is if, if we would, um, if we would look at a medicine like, um, Lamictal, which isn't anything that you've taken before, but it is a little bit more of a mood stabilizing medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That would be wonderful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my moods do change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well that's what I was going to say, and like I said, and I can appreciate within, within a range, the reason why we haven't been as aggressive with those since you've been off the Depakote is that, you know, that, that they stay in a range that, that hasn't gotten you, you know, truly to a point of, of huge disruptions, but I understand—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That, uh, your ability and those factors too at home.  I mean I, I know that goes beyond just your illness in terms of why it's there, but, uh, I know that you've told me before that he's just not somebody that's likely to go to any couple's therapy and, and put a lot of energy into working on this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh no, and he's not.  I know he's not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and so I guess that makes—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He resents me coming here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I, and I know you've said that, and I guess my feeling on this is that, that still if we can do anything that, that gives you a greater sense of control at those times, and the thing that I think you, you would like about the Lamictal as opposed to the Depakote when you were on it a few years ago is that it is, the side effect profile is much better.  It's a morning medicine.  It's once a day.  There's a titration up over the course of about 5 weeks to get to the therapeutic dose.  Uh, it's not a medicine we don't have to do any blood work on like you did with the Depakote.  Um, it is, it's generally what we consider a weight neutral medicine.  People don't tend to gain weight on it at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wonderful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Typically they don't feel tired or drowsy on it, which is why we've been able to give it to people in the morning.  If in any way, shape, or form you, you would, we could always switch it to bedtime because that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is, it, it works 24 hours a day independent of when you take it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, the, the side effect profile, as a general rule for people, involves potential for some dry mouth, mild upset stomach, mild headache—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I have that with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's, it's mild and it goes away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The only very important piece of information we want people to know is that 1 in 10,000 people can get a very serious rash with this medicine.  It's called Stevens Johnson syndrome, and it can be life threatening if it's not treated or addressed and people have gone into a hospital with it.  The risk factors for that are risk factors that you don't have.  People by, this medicine is approved originally for seizures, and so we found that children, uh, had risk for it.  People on immunosuppressant medicines, for example, that had, uh, organ transplants or had advanced—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Stages of, uh, HIV.  Um, people aren't taking it in combination with Depakote, uh, or people, if we titrate it up too fast, and that's the key.  That's why, it's been out for about 10 years, and so it's in a generic now, which is also very nice, uh, but that it's, it's, what we found is that if, if people don't have those factors, their statistical risks for rash drop.  It doesn't mean it's zero.  You, you still have risk and what we tell people is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I notice something strange.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you get a, call me and stop the medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could stop the medicine abruptly.  There's no complicated withdrawal symptoms to it.  And it's also not a subtlety.  It's not something like, you know, you have to be looking for the small of your back to figure out if there could be a rash there.</p>

PT:	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	People get, they get a rash and, and they notice it, you know.  It looks kind of like the Target symbol on people and it's, and any time I've seen anybody get a rash on this medicine, it's not been a serious rash.  I mean people can get allergic reactions to the filler—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To the dye, um, to all kinds of different things.  That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a serious version of it, but as a precaution, we have people stop it.  The reality is, is some of those same risks are present with things like Depakote, and we didn't ever tell people about it.  Uh, the risks were very low.  Lamictal, when it first came out, they were very aggressive in the dosage schedule, and so it, it showed itself more than some of the others.  So the FDA came in and labeled it specifically for that, but the reality is there's a number of medicines that we use for bipolar almost like Tegretol and Depakote have that warning, and I bet nobody ever told you about it back when you were taking the Depakote.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, and that predates [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I, I get the little pamphlets with it, and I read on it, and I know that there's always a risk just to, you know, most of the time mild, and just watch myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and like I said, and I don't mean to minimize it, but like I said, we're at 1 in 10,000 or less for you, and so I think that bodes very well in terms of, I've had people do well with it.  What I expect—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what, if it makes me feel better even if it was a high risk for me breaking out with a rash, it's worth a try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and the thing that's nice about this is it's FDA approved in terms of bipolar illness.  It's approved as a maintenance medicine, meaning preventing recurrence for depression or trying to prevent recurrence from manias.  They actually did studies in Type I bipolar illness, and you have the Type II with the hypomanias even with it.  Um, and so in combination, I think it even has a little bit more robust effect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would leave you on the citalopram for the time being.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think there's a possibility that we could bring dosage down, particularly if we're hitting still a lot of those kind of hypomanic episodes, but let's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's do one thing at a time here because otherwise the citalopram has been good at treating your depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I have, sometimes I have more trouble with the hypo than I do [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, and that's, and that's where I think for you, there's where I think it's time to, to come in and get this started.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I think that's probably why I have trouble sleeping is I just, um, I can't unwind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and, and I think that hopefully what we can do is get your sleep hours to a decent point and, what I've been doing for people is this, the medicine's in a generic, but it's also in a branded product, and only the branded company makes the starter kits, and these starter kits are actually really nice.  What they do is they essentially lay out, they've got a picture of it in there.  You, you would be on the orange kit.  They make a couple.  If you're taking divalproex, which is Depakote, there's this one.  You're not here, you're here, not taking any of these medicines, and they lay it out.  They give you, it's 25 mg once a day for the first 2 weeks, 50 once a day for the next 2 weeks, 100 for the next week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then I'll write you a prescription for the 200 mg pills.  So there's 5 weeks with this kit.  They give you $35 off your copayment with that.  So I typically write for the branded kit with this coupon, so you get $35 off.  So it may not cost you anything at all, and then we can, then we can switch you over and, and there's no problem with going over to the generic, and the Lamictal, the generic is lamotrigine.  They sound alike.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But at least it gets you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like I said, it's just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well it won't cost me anything because my copay's, uh, for, for, uh, the regular one is $15, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, right, exactly.  So then it won't, and that's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they won't give me the other $20 I'm sure, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, right.  No, I guarantee they will not do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I apologize.  Let me, there's a code in here that I have to put on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I know I can go to the generic and it's really basically the same thing, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What I expect is that we just see a leveling out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would like that, you know, because like I said, there are sometimes when I just wonder, uh, I, I, I just feel empty, devoid, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, and other times I just feel like I can't get enough of people, and I can't get enough of anything, you know, and I just run, run, run.  And I guess I've been, I, I guess I don't think too much about it because I've been that way since I was a kid.  My mother said I used to go for 24/7 for the longest time, and then all of a sudden I'd stop and I'd sleep 24 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, and I think again, within that range, if we can get you back to the point also of doing the best you can to the part that you can control of getting your sleep hours normalized, you know, closer to that 8 hour time frame, I think you'll also find that that helps with some of those things too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The 6 hour doesn't bother me as much as sleeping 12 or more hours a day, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do your thoughts during those periods where you're, you're sleeping a little less and you're feeling your mood's up, do your thoughts keep going faster?  Do you feel like you think faster or talk faster?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I probably do and never noticed it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Do you, do you ever get any to the point of having odd experiences like seeing things, hearing things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To the point of feeling like your mood's so up that you have powers or abilities other people wouldn't have?  Does it ever get to [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, Huh-uh.  No, I've never, no, I've never had any experience like that, but I have gotten to the point where I haven't had enough sleep where sometimes I'll move and I'll get dizzy and I feel like I'm going to, you know, and I have to stop myself, but, uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I've got 2 prescriptions here for you.  The first one is the starter and that's got your citalopram on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's got the Lamictal and it's just got what they call the orange starter kit, and then you'll take that exactly as, as that's prescribed, and then the next one here is your—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Prescription once you get through that starter kit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is the one you're taking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, in a very different way, it may also be that if we get you some more leveling in this effect, that that's also an easier combination to quit smoking with too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It could very well be because I really, I really know that I need to quit smoking.  Right now, I can still get out and walk.  I can still do things, you know, and, uh, I, I feel good, you know, as far as physically, other than a little bit of pain in the left, the right lung, but, you know, I can still do things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, but you're right.  You'll feel better and you'll save some bucks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I want to see you back in 6 weeks with these changes though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, that sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And like I said, if there's any, if there's any problems, if there's any concerns or anything with it, call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well the only problem I might have would be that I'm going up next month to be with [NAME OTHER] for a while before Christmas so that she can do some things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if, uh, if there's a problem with that, I'll just call, reset the appointment if I know if I'm going to be into trouble.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And request a, a refill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right, exactly.  We've got, and like I said, and you've really got over, you've got over 2 months of everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, so I should be all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If, if at any point you end up off the Lamictal for 5 days or longer, we need to titrate back up the same way you started it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So don't miss, don't miss 4 or 5 days because that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pushing the limits of getting back onto that dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If, if you miss a day or 2 here or there, that's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't like to miss.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, and I don't like people to miss either.  We'll agree on that, but like I said, it's more important [INAUDIBLE] we don't have to stick with me.  Just call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I will.  I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You have a happy Thanksgiving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you.  To you too.  It's good to see you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You take care of that family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you.  I will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If you're going away for the holidays—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You enjoy those gifts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Drive safe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep, I appreciate that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think [NAME OTHER] actually going to come down unless she's got trouble with morning sickness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's nice.  Good.  Good.  Um, like I said, you take care of yourself, and if there's anything, you call me, but otherwise I'll see you back in 6 weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're welcome, bye bye.</p>

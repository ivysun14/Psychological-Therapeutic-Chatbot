<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence) One of the things that comes to my mind is uhm about being late, and uhm well, I think I want you to know, well it's because FCE was late getting to me.  She was very late today, the worst she's ever been.  And uhm, I think I want you to know that it was not me because somehow I think, I don't know, I, I, I felt annoyed.  Or (sigh) Well, I just don't know why I was feeling annoyed exactly because when FCE was so late, uhm I went through the idea again that something had happened, she wasn't coming.  And I've never, that I know of, that I can recall, given her a telephone number but she could very easily have taken it if she'd thought of it.  And so the 2 times recently when she's been so late, today and the other time, I've wondered if she's not coming and just doesn't have my number.  But I don't know, it seemed like I was annoyed mostly because if she wasn't coming I wished I'd know.  And it was almost as if in a way I wish she really weren't coming, which I can understand might be true after yesterday, but I wasn't really thinking of it that way.  And then I was thinking also that when she was so late today that maybe I really should get somebody who's closer so that I wouldn't have this problem, because apparently she does have trouble with the train.  And, and, yet well, what I was wondering today is if there's a pattern to when she's late.  Because it would make me suspect that she doesn't leave enough time if there is.  And (sigh) I don't know, I just still feel well, I didn't really want to have FCE stop coming.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I also now was thinking about when I came in and that was on my mind also.  I was thinking about going to PTN this weekend.  And uhm I think I've, I thought first of the fact that the other night, the same night that I spoke to, or evening I spoke to FYR, my mother called that night uhm, I guess to check on when we'll be coming up and to say that they were getting a lot of, they had snow and they might be getting more with what we had had down here.  And so that often we have to use another car or jeep to get up the road, and uhm and then I just thought about going up.  And I remembered when she called, well I was already in the mood, so I suppose it didn't really have anything to do with her, but it was as if I just couldn't really focus in on talking to her.  It wasn't that I, I had any strong feeling of not wanting to but well, I guess it was just simply something else was on my mind and so I couldn't think about my mother (chuckle).</p>

<p>ANALYST:  So now you think of your mother right after you're thinking, thinking about FCE.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (4-minute silence) I don't know, I'm having trouble thinking about that, the fact that I connect FCE and my mother.  And uhm, like, well, I think it must have something to do with the feelings I've had about you that I've been afraid to see and express.  And uhm and then I keep thinking, somehow FSO fits in, I, or I think she does, but maybe not.  And then the only thought I had that was at all clear, was, was something that I'm not sure I fully understand why it came to me, but I don't know, I'm thinking that FCE comes to my house and then I come here.  I, I thought of just sort of recalling a feeling of being with my mother and being afraid to be with my father, and pref_ preferring to be with my mother.  Whereas in a way I suppose I really didn't.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, you did say you sort of welcomed FCE not — I mean you had this idea at least, you would, you would have welcomed her not coming at all today.  And it's clear from what you said that it must be very hard for you to simply make it clear to her you want her on time.  And the point I'm trying to make is that I think you must cooperate in some way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  And that serves you a purpose.  And you just hinted at what you think that might be, which would be to keep you away from here, from me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (2-minute silence) I feel as if somehow the same thing is happening today that happened yesterday and that well, I don't have quite the same reaction.  But I keep thinking of why did I think of, or what, what is the meaning of my thinking of my mother after FCE?  And I don't know, it seems to me that after you pointed out I did, you then have sort of dropped it and or I'm not sure whether I'm just missing the implied connection.  And on the one hand when I think what I want to do is just leave it for a while — but then I keep thinking about it, but there's something I'm missing I should be seeing.  And the other thing that had come to my mind after thinking about going to PTN, before I spoke at all and ha—, keeps coming to my mind uhm, and I don't know, maybe something to do with the way I'm feeling here with you.</p>

<p>I, I do—, I was just thinking MSCZ's been, well, ever since right before we moved he hasn't been feeling well.  And he has had something, but he keeps talking about it and he doesn't, he probably can't afford to stay home, I don't know, but it doesn't seem to me he really does much of anything about it, except keep talking about it.  And he doesn't sound that sick.  He may feel a lot worse than he sounds.  And last night he felt worse again than he had for a while and began questioning whether we should go to PTN at all.  And I don't know, I, I was concerned about him before, but now I think I'm just annoyed and especially when he questioned our going to PTN.  It's almost, I think my feeling was he was doing it on purpose.  And he had already said when he heard that FYC and MEIR would be up, "Well it's going to be one of those weekends where everybody gets sick."  And so I immediately thought well now you're just getting sick first and calling the weekend off.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I guess, I think it has something to do with feeling he's trying to stop me doing something I want to do, and he'd, he, in fact he asked me, "How much do you want to go up?"  And well, that's another thing that I haven't, I'm not sure how clear I am on it but in a way I do want to.  And I, I think it's because I don't know, I haven't seen FYC's family for so long that I'm eager to see them.  But I think it has something to do with the fact too that they haven't seen FSO and so I want to have them see her.  And, I don't know, in a way I feel I'll end up feeling the tensions I always do and maybe wishing I hadn't come, but yet I want to go before I'm there.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uh, I was just thinking about also uhm what I did today.  I guess maybe because for a while we thought we'd be going out to PTN tonight and now we won't go till tomorrow morning, so there were certain things I had to, had to do before we went to PTN and the day would have been more rushed.  And I don't know how I got on to this first, except I became aware just now when I was thinking about it, that I've had this feeling today of doing nothing.  Although when I think back over it, I did do a number of things and there wasn't too much more I could have fit in.  And, I don't know, I just — seeing things still around — MSCZ hasn't had a chance to do anything so that it's all on me.  And I'm, I know I'm not that organized but even when I really work at it, it doesn't seem I make much of a dent.  And so I, I just have this feeling today I think, that I can't handle it and that I'm getting nowhere.  But then it made me wonder if really what I'm feeling is that I can't handle something else.  And then I thought of yesterday and —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  What specifically?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, what I said at the end yesterday about thinking only indirectly that what I wanted was for you to make love to me.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Then I think of I guess — well first I thought of, right after I left here thinking about having said that at the end yesterday and then, I don't know, just having this feeling of almost panic, I guess of ha_ having said it.  And, and then I, I don't know, I felt particularly disorganized last night.</p>

<p>And, but then I started thinking about my appearance and uhm and FSO's appearance.  And I don't know, I either go to the extreme of thinking she's too fat or else thinking that because I don't want her to be too fat, that I'm starving her, mainly because the doctor said I can be giving her, and I think he implies I should be giving her, more than I am.  And, and then I thought of a fantasy I had today of well, something I never have done, I wouldn't do it, but I was, I had her on the changing table and I'd finished changing her but there was something I wanted to do.  And the easiest thing, what I would have liked to have been able to do if it were possible, would be to leave her on the table and go do it — it's something in her room — rather than carrying her with me or putting her somewhere else.  And I can't recall what it was now, but the fantasy I had was stepping away and that FSO would fall off the table, which might very well happen.  But then I started fantasizing that she'd break her neck or anyway, really either hurt herself or kill herself.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  And then what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) I don't know, somehow I haven't thought beyond that till you asked.  But it seems like I have this feeling, well, horror that I was thinking it, I suppose, because in a way it was a wish and then I'd be freer.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  To do what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Oh, it seems somehow then I'd be free to get your attention without competition with her, or to, well I mean ah, it, it all comes to the same thing, I wouldn't have to be thinking about her.  So I could think just about you and that you'd be thinking just about me because she wasn't around.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, it somehow seems uhm, some reason it's puzzling to me though, I'm not sure why, uhm — and I remember we've talked about this before or you've pointed out before that at least this is the day I'm feeling right now — that I'm just seeing FSO as a birth of another sibling.  And it's almost as if, I mean I'm taking care of her, but aside from that, it's, it's as if I have no connection with her, that she's not my child and —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  I think that's why you want FCE to stay around so much whether it's convenient or, you know, makes sense in other ways or not.  Because you sort of regard her as FCE's child.  Or it's at least easy to feel something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) And then what I think is that, I mean it does seem that's what I'm doing.  And I sort of vaguely was thinking that before.  But I don't know, seems like if I'm doing it, then it's, I want to because somehow then it makes everything clear.  I'm not sure, I, I still don't feel completely clear on this, but I don't know, then somehow it seems then I'd feel it was right for me to feel that FSO was a sibling and I guess maybe then I wouldn't feel so guilty that I'm not feeling her mother.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

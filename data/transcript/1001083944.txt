<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how've you been?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I changed. I started a home business I think last time I met with you I was thinking about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I went ahead and did it uh, end of December/January I became a [DEIDENTIFIED]. So I'm doing that. I've been doing that for three months now. I'm sorta on the upward swing where I had a candidate, and I was placing him and marketing him to different places and last week I was lining up some interviews for him, but I got an e-mail this morning from him saying he's not interested to pursue this right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think, I think he's got, he's going to some classes in the evenings and it may prevent him from starting a new job right now...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I want to get some more understanding about it, but you know, I'm going through the process. I'm trying to learn from this network that I signed up with. It's not a franchise network and I'm trying to learn the process and follow what they informed me is a tried and true thing. I want to give it a year and see where I stand and uh, I think whatever results I get will be my results, you know, they may be financial, they may be learning from a sales standpoint, they may be learning about handling, you know rejection, whatever they may be, so at this stage that's kinda what my goal is, just kinda try new things, something home-based, so I didn't have to travel, it's on my speed. Luckily I have the support of my husband so we're - we're not starving as we would be on my salary would be...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or changing careers.  What kind of [DEIDENTIFIED] are you doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, they asked us to pick a specialty and I didn't know where to go so I said I'll start with pharmacists. So I am placing pharmacists right now, but um, I talked to some other people who said go into diagnostic imaging, radiology techs and those kinds of people, there's a lot of demand there... there's a lot of demand in all these fields, right now, so I may be going crossing into different areas, but right now I'm focusing on pharmacists in [DEIDENTIFIED] and that's my, my specialty for the stage.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And do they provide you with the names of the pharmacists or do just find them?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I have to cold call and locate people...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then if I find a candidate that's interested, I do reference checking and then I go and market them to likely clients who need those types of people, make the match, uh and hopefully get paid from the client's company, so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well good. And I know that there's a lot of need for all kinds of help...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's lots of jobs.  The candidates are tough.  And the approach that this company has used is you don't go and look for the actively looking people, you do more from a passive candidate, in other words, you find people that are already employed and see if they would be interested in making a change, in their careers at that point see if they want to start something new. So if you get someone who is more passive they tend to be the more caliber folks that people want to hire, so... we'll see.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well good.  So far so good, you liking it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, uh, I was very committed in the beginning....I did some on-line training for a month, I did a weekend class in [DEIDENTIFIED] to get the...they gave us a lot of internet tools to do research and uh, those... and technology to help manage our workload, uh, from that standpoint I enjoyed the technology tools, obviously that's my background.  I'm not originally a [DEIDENTIFIED] but I'm learning how to be convincing over the phone, yeah, and uh initially it was very daunting, oh my gosh what have I done, but as you practice, it gets better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well good, good, well the initial experience whatever happens will be... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah exactly yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, and you're moods been pretty level?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, it has, I think last time we met I was thinking of cutting back a little bit on the Lexapro and uh, I did for awhile and I think I've been feeling some anxiety, so I went back to my original dose....</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 10 mg. I did cut back a little bit on the Seroquel. I'm at 50 mg now, 75.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it was more for my weight. I've been trying to fight this weight thing, but uh, no luck.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's your weight doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm stable right now, but I've definitely gained over 10 pounds from my original weight. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm kind of in the 130's now, I always used to be in the high teens, so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You weigh less you say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm like, I'm about at 130 - 131 right now and uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I never usually topped over 120 before so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm trying to get myself those 10 pounds off. I'm not actively exercising, so there's a lot I'm not doing, but you know I'm watching what I eat, I'm not over eating...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you find yourself craving sweets or carbohydrates?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I think, maybe carbs and I'm trying to watch that. I think for awhile I was overdoing it which put me over the top with the weight thing, but uh, I'm trying to control my carb intake and maybe down to a main meal a day, in the morning I'll just do juice or coffee or something like that. I don't do a big breakfast and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A light lunch maybe yogurt or something, but, it's not like I'm eating big quantities of food, but I can't, I think I have to be active and of course, now that the weather's getting nice, good excuse to get out there and do some exercise...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, this winter's been a rough one...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It has been for the long run.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I also think that you're lifestyle is different now too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is. I'm not on the road, I'm not going back and forth to an office and stuff like that, so I'm walking from the bedroom to the office isn't very far.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I know but sitting here all day you still get the same level as cardiovascular exercise. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's your energy during the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been pretty good.  My mornings, uh I've been driving my son in a car pool, driving my son to school a couple days a week, early in the morning, and you know, I'm in morning traffic and my response time sometimes I gotta be careful because I'm still not really awake the very first thing I get up and take him down to [DEIDENTIFIED] at 6:45, so I'm on the road early. I notice that this morning, I thought I gotta be more careful.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With traffic in the morning and having to be responsive on a quick, you know, quick stop or whatever, you have to be more alert.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the only thing I'm missing there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what do you think of this answer that you're not quite as focused or you're sleepy or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I'm still a little sleepy.  I think, you know, I think it's that grogginess that I haven't kind of shaken yet in the morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> From the medicine or you're not sure?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know I don't know uh, maybe it is, uh, I used to be able to have a cup of coffee. I didn't take coffee again this morning, but a cup of coffee would keep me going, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Are you sleeping okay at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That I am, yeah I'm doing fine there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And about how many hours of sleep are you getting a night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, 10 to 6, you know, at least...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 8 yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds good. Now is this continuous sleep at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm not getting up, uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay good. You know once you get up and kind of get past that groggy period are you able to focus pretty well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think so yeah.  There were some times you know in the afternoon kind of yawning, a couple days I noticed that and I was surprised, but most of the time I'm pretty alert, able to do the rest of the day and I think my organization skills are coming back because I have a job now and it's forcing me to kinda keep tabs and things like that where before when I didn't have anything scheduled for the day I kind of just wing it and now I'm finding okay I'm accomplishing things and getting things done, my tasks are getting itemized and checked off, so I'm back to that organization skills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now do you notice, I'm just thinking about the difference between you this year and last year, are you aware of cognitively or thinking-wise how much better you're doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I find I'm able to tolerate things, I'm not so, I mean, I'm thinking back at the years when I was so irritable, so edgy, so hyper, so all those extremes and now I roll with the flow and when there's somebody in my family who maybe gets a little over the top I'm like look it, let's calm down. I'm the one that bring them back in the center, so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's a major accomplishment for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're stress management is better than it used to be. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Less irritable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> More organized, better able to handle stress.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And also I'm just aware, just in your thinking and organizing and your speech even...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How much more focused you are...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh so that's, I don't know what was normal for you before all this.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh normal for me was pretty erratic, um...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. But this is the best I've ever seen you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. I think I'm at a new place now, a new calm, a new peace, had this happened to me before where someone rejected my efforts, I probably would have flown off the handle and I just realized I read it and took it in and discussed you know to myself. I wanted to speak to the person, I called him but I got his voice mail and wanted to sort of understand the change, um, like I would have been in totally angry and upset and just belligerent and things like that would have happened before...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, recognizing changes happen for whatever reason they happen and I don't have to control them, where before I was trying to control the whole world.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so it sounds like you're in a much better place.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah definitely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you doing anything for fun these days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We're gonna go to [DEIDENTIFIED] for spring break.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been there before, we want to go back because we didn't catch it all uh so that's planned for the end of the month. We went skiing over Christmas, we had a wonderful time and then we went over president's weekend, we had another great time, we enjoyed the skiing and what else, I guess, you know, haven't done much around the home base.  There's a lot we should be doing, painting and things like that, but those we kinda put on the back burner...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand, there are always [INAUDIBLE] projects aren't there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they're home projects.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like a good time the skiing...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And trips to [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, definitely enjoying being with the family and doing those kinds of things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I bet the kids enjoy having you home too?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah they do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Even though they're at that age where they're becoming more independent.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I think...I'm helping my son recognize a lot, he's turned a corner in his [DEIDENTIFIED] of high school, you know the beginning of I don't like it here and friends and all that first year stuff. Now we're passing the point and um, he was made an honorable mention for freshman year, had a 3.0 average, which I was pleased...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Saw the other students were in the 3.2 - 3.5 - 3.7 range getting their awards and I think it's motivated him to get a ... okay I'm gonna shoot for that now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent. Good for him.  He's got some friends now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah he does. I wouldn't say they're his best buds, his best buds are still uh, you know from his other school, but he's yes, he's talking more about his friends in class now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good, good good. So, sounds like overall things are going pretty well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'd say we're in a good space right now and I'm very thankful for what we've got.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And medication wise I'm just thinking, back to the 50 Seroquel, taking 10 of Lexapro right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Correct.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, again remind me have you had just a general physical of blood work with your primary care doctor in the last year or so?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know the last time I had, yeah I did, I had some blood work. My numbers came in, in the range uh, I wanna say that was within the last year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> See if I have copies from lab.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was that with...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> With [NAME OTHER], okay. Let's see what I've got here. This is, actually the ones I have here are from 04, so maybe what I'll do...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, there should be a recent copy from her um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. I'll get a release too, so what I'll do, let me see. Actually, maybe I'll have you sign one for [NAME OTHER] and now that it is [DEIDENTIFIED] office</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what I want to do is just keep an eye on your lipids because with the Seroquel it's unlikely that you've had a problem, but one of the side effects can be not only weight gain, but increase in cholesterol lipids...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I just want to keep an eye on those.  Again, I don't think that will happen. You have such a low dose I mean. You're taking 50 mg. Some people with bipolar disorder take 400 to 600 mg. a day. At that dose it can be much more of an issue. But are you okay for signing a release for that office and I will just-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Check and keep an eye on the labs.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That would be great uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Put [NAME OTHER] name also.  I guess she's seeing a lot of the folks there now since [NAME OTHER] left?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm glad they still have her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, me too. Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Also, you may read about, hear about, they are coming out with warnings on the Seroquel class of medicines</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> About diabetes, have you heard about that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, and you know I was curious because it talked a little bit about weight gain, but...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just to let you know what's happening with these class of medicines are that some people are on higher doses of Seroquel some people can start to gain weight and if they continue to gain weight they can gain so much weight that there body builds up a resistance to insulin and they actually develop diabetes and the solution to this is stopping the medicine and losing the weight and then the body works fine again. I have not seen it in any of the patients I have, partly because we monitor for weight gain and keep an eye on it and anybody who gained that kind of weight, if they start gaining weight we stop it and try other medicines because there are medicines in the same class that don't cause weight gain...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hummm</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But since you're doing fine with it, my suggestion is just leave it alone.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because if we switch to another medicine it may or may not work as well...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And we could create a whole another set of problems and again you have such a low dose that the significant weight gain and diabetes is so small and the benefits outweigh the risks...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you comfortable with that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And again if you're weight were to start creeping up up up then we need to talk about other options.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not that I want you to, not that I'm saying 10 pounds is negligible but it doesn't put you at risk for diabetes...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it may be that with this season we've had, so many people have been so inactive because it's been rotten weather that then with the warmer weather you get more active and get that weight off.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right. Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the Lexapro, the dose you're on is fine. We have leverage to work with if we need to, but you don't sound depressed.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, I think, again as I said I had cut back to about half that and was on it for a few weeks, 3 weeks or so and I thought, I just didn't have my middle zone there...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I went back and it's been fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't have much anxiety  now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. Okay. Anything else goin on, any stressors, or problems I didn't ask you about? Insurance?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like you're doin great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm I'm, you know, at a point, I'm glad to be doing something at this stage. You know, it may not be the right final career for me at this stage in my life but it's a chance to test something and learn something new and test the waters so, and that's positive for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And do they pay you based on how many people you place. Is that the way it works?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I run my own business, it's not a franchise, so yeah, I get paid for the people that I place.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I'm thinking that if it something that you stayed in and build up a clientele over the years, it probably would be much more profitable...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's probably going to be, I guess it takes time to do that. Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm able to add some people to my company if I want a [DEIDENTIFIED] for me to help me grow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In that space so, we'll see, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It is an opportunity, like you said, try something, see if you like it, it could be terrific if not you have lots of other opportunities.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're daughters in what grade now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's in 8, she'll be going her freshman year next year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, yeah, so four more years, four more years both of your kids will be out of high school, that's amazing to think about to so you get to find something for the next few years where you can work from home.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah definitely and that was the other thing to be able to be mobile, uh I could take it with me if I choose to go somewhere else and uh [NAME OTHER]'s been with his company over 10 years now and I know he's like to maybe consider retiring some day down the road, so, if we can put something, you know, on a side thing that maybe we could do together, or whatever, so that's kind of why I am testing it out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds good. [NAME OTHER] doing well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good, good. So keep doing what you're doing, things are workin for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I think I'll stay with where I'm at right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. And I'll check with [NAME OTHER] about those labs just to make sure all of your lipids are staying reasonably level...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know if you check once a year that's usually enough. Do you see [NAME OTHER] about once a year?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we do the blood work I think every two years or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Don't do it annually.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And as long as there's no change we don't necessarily need to check it every year as long as your weight's is relatively stable. If you ever have questions or concerns we could check it more often.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Still looking to see, the 04 your cholesterol was borderline high at 202, which is nothing to be terribly alarmed about, but we just wanna make sure it doesn't creep up on us.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're, let's look at your others. Yeah, you're quite a risk ratio which is, your different types of lipids or cholesterol, you're at what they call a coronary risk ratio, yours was very low...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So even with that 202 cholesterol, you had the good kind of cholesterol...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And not very much of the bad cholesterol so, that's even more important than how much.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that was in 04?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That was about 04, that was two years ago so let's see how these compare.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'll be curious to see.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well, anything else before we set up an appointment?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You want to just check back in three months again?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can do that, yeah, that would be fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you're doin so well, I think three months if you're doing well we can then set up for six months.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, let's do six months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You want to do the, okay. You want to do Fall, yeah I think you're doing well. You can always call if you need anything. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I will. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. April, May, June, July, August, September. Giving you the next school year. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh boy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know, time flies, and [PATIENT NAME] you want to do morning or afternoon?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Morning's fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about, let's see, how about [DATE]. At 11 o'clock?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll drop this off in your office so I can finish the...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or if you want I can make you a copy, whichever is easier for you, doesn't matter to me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll bring it back so I can look through it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> One of the things I liked about the article, it talks about how men don't often recognize depression and how they don't get treatment, but they have a list, couple of pages of famous men who had depression, football quarterbacks, presidents and CEO's of companies, just a wide range of people and how they didn't know they were depressed when they were and how they felt much better when they got help, so...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I read in this paper where [NAME OTHER] passed away this weekend and how he was faulted for having his depression and I thought back in that day we weren't accepting at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, things have changed a lot thank goodness. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it has, I was wondering, I would hope in this day and age if we would have a candidate that would have to you know reveal that where we would stand and I hope we would be more open to that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I think, I've heard even the response of the candidates is different this year, like I heard someone asked [NAME OTHER] if he'd smoked pot....</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you hear that response?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He said yeah, I did, when I was younger, well did you inhale?  He said well I thought that was the point back then which was what 10/12 years ago. Again, just people, things are changing. I think people are more accepting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And not as judgmental which I think is a good step, you know, every body has things go wrong in their life. Nobody has perfect lives.  The difference is people get help, but or not, and anyway so...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, there's the card.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate David. Yesterday before I left work my mentor came to me and said, "I need to leave early today and I'm taking the day off tomorrow and I just kicked off this long-running job. I'm the guinea pig for this new environment that the CAD team wants to roll out. William, Ted and Cameron over in CAD really want to know how it goes, so can you keep an eye on it all evening and e-mail them status updates?" I said, "Sure, no problem." But later I left here I was really upset. And then there were detours in traffic between here and home and stopping to get groceries and I failed to eat yesterday because I was so upset over everything else that was going on. By the time I got home I was starving and exhausted and pretty much just went to bed and totally forgot that I was going to check in on this job. So I got to work today and there were like 15 e-mails in my inbox saying, "What's the status? We need you to check this. We need you to check that. Can you set this up and flag before you do this stuff?" Of course, I haven't seen any of them because I completely forgot. I adSchoolted this yesterday. I felt really terrible and was trying to get caught up. I finally answered all the questions and got caught up and realized that there was this really big error that happened yesterday around 6:30 that, if I had caught, I could have restarted the thing and we could have had data, but I didn't catch it. I was just restarting it now. After I did the restart, about a half-dozen more problems cropped up that were unforeseeable but needed after debugging. I spent all day pretty much e-mailing, calling back and forth to the people on the CAD team and it was very frustrating to me because I don't know the system as well as my mentor does. [00:02:16] I am not a good guinea pig for weird and bizarre changes to our work environment because I don't know the default environment, and so there are all these things where William or Ted would say, "Oh, just do da-da-da . . ." and I'd be like, "That's not enough information. Could you give me more details on how to do blah, blah, blah." "Oh, it's easy. Just go to this file and change it's pointer." Well, that file has 600 lines and I'm not quite sure which line I should be changing." (chuckles) "Can you provide some more evidence, please?" It was just very frustrating. I felt very stupid. And I ended up having to walk away from my desk to go collect myself and try not to cry a couple of times today and it was just awful. (long pause) [00:03:40]</p>

<p>On the bright side, having to put out fires all day meant that I didn't spend even a single minute browsing the Internet or on Twitter or whatever. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure yet what to say. I really think that one is the question about Dave, which I know is not your favorite question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still beating myself up for forgetting that I was supposed to check in on this job lat night. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you beating yourself up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly my internal monologue is calling myself names, telling me I'm stupid and irresponsible and everyone is going to think poorly of me because I screwed up and delayed the schedule by half a day. How could I? I know people were counting on me. And what's wrong with me? This is going to ruin my career. My boss is going to hate me. This is going to be reflected on my performance report and maybe I'll get fired. If only I hadn't been so stupid and irresponsible. [00:05:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that started this morning when you discovered this? How upset were you when you left, when it happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I left work today?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here, yesterday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just still pissed off about the situation with my gym and was very upset that the gym manager hadn't responded to my second e-mail. I had e-mailed her and she had e-mailed me back and said, "No." I e-mailed her back and said, "Actually, this is not something I want."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, what's not something you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being forced to work with their stupid Barbie-named trainer. That was probably affecting me. I should have said that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you suggesting that in your own therapy session when you're really mad about something you may not be entirely fair or rational? (both chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That doesn't make it right. That makes it explainable, but that doesn't make it right. [00:07:34] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess we could add differently that from my point of view the least varnished version of what you're thinking is probably the most helpful in expressing what's going on in that instance. Your feelings about "Barbie-like", (chuckles) I would imagine "marginal inadequate", not up to their or presiding standards in a number of ways - professes your feeling and how angry and maybe envious you are towards people like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you could say that. [00:10:13] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I mean, to be clear, in that I understand your feeling guilty for having put it like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I appreciate that you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On one hand, everything I said yesterday about not wanting to have to break in a new trainer and try to establish some kind of understanding or mutual respect, and that being very overwhelming and anxiety inducing for me is true, but there is more to it than that that we didn't really go into - I think because I'm embarrassed about it. I worry if part of my objection to wanting to work with any of the other trainers is that they're all women. Sergio was the only male trainer at the gym. Maybe that's indicative of some internal honest misogyny that a woman can't be authoritative in this realm. It's uncomfortable for me to ask myself that question. There is also the fact that they're old. Every single one of them [ ]. (inaudible at 00:12:51) I have seen them working with other clients in the gym and some of the routines they put together are completely ridiculous. Whether that's their choice or whether they're trying to work within the parameters of what their client asks for but, you know, just completely stupid, pointless exercises that are likely to get you hurt rather than help the strength. [00:13:24] There's also the fact that I always feel implicitly that I'm being judged by thin women when I spend a lot of time with really thin women. Clearly this is something I need to get over because clearly not everyone in the world is judging me but . . . I don't know. There's part of me that feels stupid for even joining this gym in the first place because it's not as if I didn't know what the atmosphere of this gym is like. It's very much a place for people who buy into the do-a-zillion-repetitions-with-low-weight tone and sculpt and it's not a kind of place that's conducive to the kind of heavy lifting that I enjoy. For example, there's no rack for doing squats in so I've been doing squats holding the bar wrapped in the front position rather than regular back squats because there's no rack to do them in, so it's not as if I didn't know this. I was a member of this gym before and I could have joined a real power lifting gym that would have all the equipment I need, but the gym I joined has the sauna and the hot tub and the massage rooms and the locker room, which makes it terribly convenient for getting massages. It's the froofy, girly stuff. That's also probably not a great way to frame it but that's how it is. There's a lot of self-recrimination going on today, like always. [00:15:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's exceedingly intense, as it generally is, and ambitious, as it generally is.</p>

<p>(long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it gets pretty overwhelming for you pretty fast and things just shut you down. Imagine, and it would be interesting to know if that's not the case, that was by me helpful or useful is that I sometimes get between you and this hatred of yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Not really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think you ever succeed at getting between me and this whole hatred. It's always there. I guess the fact that I can kind of take this self-hatred and hold it out in front of me and look at it and talk about it in kind of semi-rational ways doesn't mean that I'm not also feeling it at the same time. I'm just compartmentalizing a little bit. Does that make sense? [00:19:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess that I was suggesting if I say something that's either reassuring or that does point to the self-hatred as a "thing", that's not getting between you and it in any way that makes you feel any better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? Why are you sorry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I assume you wouldn't have made the statement in the first place if it weren't important to you in some way and I just contradicted you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, the way that it's mostly important to me is that I'm trying to figure out what is helpful. I want to know that it is. Does it feel like both of us are quite powerless when it comes to this or helpless?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I certainly feel like I'm powerless against this raging storm of self-hatred. [00:21:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But my status in that regard isn't clear. Does it feel to you like I have a reasonable sense of the intensity of it or not really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Sometimes it's not clear to me how much you know and how much you act like you don't know in order to draw me out into talking more versus actually not knowing, if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Any time you can think of in particular where you wondered with that? [00:23:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't know where I'm getting this idea from but it's an idea that I have. I think I'm not even sure what it means to be normal or, I guess, for medical and insurance purposes mental stuff is described as "mental illness". I have no idea what it would look like to be mentally healthy, to have a lack of illness. I don't even know what that means or what it would look like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean in general for a person or do you mean for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. Either. [00:24:19] (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did that question relate to where we're headed or what it would look like for things to get better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:25:49] Normal people, I assume, experience frustration at work and sadness and anger and probably even negative self-image occasionally, but where's the line between normal and pathological in terms of frequency and intensity?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Those are exactly the relevant parameters. The line is generally drawn in relation to functioning symptoms and subjective experience or if you can't work. So that or where the gratuity is greatly reduced by it. What's greatly? I don't know. It sort of depends, but significant like from 100 percent to you're 70 percent, could be significant I would say. Speaking very roughly. And there are symptoms like there are also — these kind of overlap — like difficulty concentrating or trouble sleeping or a lot of inhibition or avoidance of work. There are meditative symptoms. The subjective part is how crummy does it feel? (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You guess productivity is a less objective measurement either, right? Totally objective.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And there are people who are very functional and productive and not even necessarily that symptomatic, but subjectively feel awful. You know, like somebody who's getting all A's and feels horrible about themselves. You have a lot of symptoms. That's a real problem, too. You've been that person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I've had many semesters when I've pulled all A's, but there have been a few.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Growing up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. In high school, I guess. Got all A's in high school then barely graduated college with a C average. Clearly those A's were desperately meaningful or something like that. I'm not even sure where I'm going with that. [00:30:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think for you feeling less self-hatred would be good and plausible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But how would I get there?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Coming and keep talking. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to tell what the internal monologue that tells me it's horrible it's hard to tell what's actually coming from me and what's coming from my dad and coming from society. At one point today — and I caught myself doing this, realized that it was bad and I needed to stop and eventually got myself out of it — but I got in this telling myself, "Oh, you're upset because your boss sent you an e-mail saying you should have talked to William instead of Ted and now you want to cry. That's such a girly thing to do. You stupid girl. This is why no one at work respects you because you're a fucking girl." I realized wait, wait, wait. Where the hell is this coming from? That's very clearly something I absorbed from having spent almost my entire life in sexist, male-dominated environments. Especially at school, as much as they talk their 50-50 gender ratio, it's hellish for one. My freshman year people plastered the school with signs on the first day of classes saying women don't belong at that school. We're only there because of affirmative action. It's very clear where that particular message I came up with today came from. It's not anything I remotely believe. Other times it's not as clear as that. That's a very dramatic, clear thing and I can tell where this message is coming from, but other times it's like, "Where is this coming from?" I don't know. (sighs) Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe I shouldn't be having that kind of internal monologue [ ]. (inaudible at 00:32:42)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. What's the alternative? That you should be having some horrible, completely untrue self-hate monologue because you came to the right place? It's terrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But at least with stuff that very clearly and identifiably comes from outside of me, it's easier for me to shut that down and then I can get angry at something that's not me, like get angry at engineering culture for being so fucking misogynist instead of turning that around on me. I don't know if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It feels a little better to blast somebody else when they clearly deserve it rather than blasting you and feeling like you deserve it. [00:34:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think three of those things are very frequent, very intense, feels awful. It's interfering with you're functioning and those are symptoms that are secondary, there are ripples from it. I think you get anxious about going into situations where you anticipate it will be evoked, like going to the gym or confrontations. I think it's sometimes not so much that you're afraid of the confrontation, afraid that the other person is going to punch you or do something, you're afraid of how angry you'll get as a result of what happens in the course of the confrontation. I think when you feel really overwhelmed by this you shut down and it's really hard to work or think or, I think sometimes in here, to associate. [00:36:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean "hard to associate?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like when it comes to mind, like your thoughts stop. That may be for other reasons as well, but I suspect this is one of them. [Yeah, it could only be a long-standing in an attempt and be entrenched in this sort of thing. It's going to take awhile to .] (inaudible at 00:37:13) It seems to me like that's [ ] (inaudible at 00:37:19)</p>

<p>I didn't give you a good answer at all when you asked how. Let me think about that one because I don't want to just give you kind of a generic answer from a therapist. I'd rather give you something that I think more specifically applies to you and the stuff we're talking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. We'll talk more next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client number 1429/110, third (inaudible 0:07), November 19th, 1970, interview number three. Hi Johnny.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hi, I always shoot by this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too close to the stores for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I get mixed up in this district.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 0:40) I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I made it earlier today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said I made it earlier today. I was away south. You've got that on. Every time I come in here you've got thing going before I even...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just as I hear you walking in, I turn it on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got my car broken into here once. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: While you were here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I must have just come when the guys were getting ready to...in fact, I had my car broken in twice. I was here and I think they got the outside window. I put it on a street: maybe I shouldn't have been there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, because there are some places right where I can come.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well that is what I did today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am going to put another tape on because that one is squeaking again. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I only worked about a half a day today. I spent most of the morning...what was I doing most of the morning? I don't even know really. It has really been a weird week. I couldn't even get myself up for going into work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just didn't feel like getting out of bed this morning, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was out, you know. It has been the last three mornings: I set my alarm for 6.30, I wake up at 6.30, and usually if I am tired what I will do is I will go back to sleep and I won't wake up until 10. But these mornings I have woken up at 6.30 and then I am awake, you know. I know when it is 7.00, it know when it is 7.30 and I know when it is 8.00 - it is usually 8.00 when I get up. I can't make my job at all. I start at 8.45 so if I leave at 8.15, it takes about 45 minutes to drive so I have been walking in my dreams. And I really can't figure what, it is just that I don't want to go there. From last week, I was trying to think of this word: it is a word to describe...the reaction that I had to this girl...the word - and I am still not sure if it is the word I was thinking of before but I think the word was "cheat" - that is the word. During this week, I did a lot of thinking on... the incident is kind of well passed now...the kind of thing I was talking about last week was kind of like a shotgun thing and it is kind of like my approach to a lot of things. In other words, I cover a lot of ground but I don't really go into anything in depth. Like when I was in group sessions, I was going to a group session at (inaudible 4.41) General Hospital and while I was going there, there was always a different thing every week. I had maybe four or five different things I was going through but I never went into anything in depth. 0:04:56.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a group dynamic: when you were talking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Last week, I thought about a lot of things that I mentioned last week which I am sure - my mind was just flying - I have thought about incidentally along the way but I have never really, on a lot of those things, worked out...like I was saying, I saw a whole bunch of things that needed to be bought into. I don't think I have really ever worked out...Like, for instance, on just a thing that I was thinking about last week...maybe it will come later - It doesn't seem to want to come right now. The thing I want to come right now...like I was thinking this week about just splitting up because I don't...it is kind of like in "Narcissus and Goldmund" - this book by Hermann Hesse - there is kind of like two kinds of life: one is supposed to be responsible; one is supposed to be, I don't know, irresponsible. The trouble of it is even when I...I am supposed to have a job and I am supposed to be responsible but I don't really feel very responsible. And a lot of thinking...I thought about during the last couple of days is whether I have ever really been a part of anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Accept responsibility, you mean? 0:06:59.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is kind of hard...it is like most of the time I observe things but I am not a part of things. There are very few instances that I really feel that I am really part of what is going on. There was one thing: like today, I brought this kid out...it is like not being emotionally involved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what you are doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In anything. In anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR You are detached somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and I was trying to figure out where did it ever start? Where did it ever begin? I brought this...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that from now - right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I have trouble getting it to where I want to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I mean even in this situation: it is hard for you to get involved in our interaction now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it is? You say that as though it hasn't always been there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, like I can kind of sense when I am talking about something that comes closer to what I feel somewhere that I want to talk about. Last week, I felt better when I got all done. I didn't think I accomplished a great deal but I thought for myself I had just got glimmerings of things that I know are there and the more I know they are there, the more know I want to get into them. You know, it isn't across the board. I have a tendency to say all or nothing but it isn't like I am immersed in something. This is all very different for me - this sort of thing - so I cannot say it. Although I have not felt like...Okay, this is the third time that I have been here: I would say that there have been times that I have felt that I am getting at least inklings of where I want to go. The kind of thing I am talking about - and the kind of thing that I would like to experience most of the time - is just...I don't want to use the word spontaneous but...just like really feeling a part of whatever I want to talk about. 0:10:30.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, and that is not easy for you. Most of the time it is like you said and not like you are really into it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, flat. Yeah, just...I can make it sound that I am actually feeling something happen...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it is not the way you really want it to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the feeling of it is very like...somewhere along the line it has either gotten lost or it has really become covered up. Maybe now I can...with the feeling I had of being cheated, the only thing that I can kind of relate that to is this one time when I was at home - that is when I was a sophomore - and my Ma came in and had been out with a new guy. She had been dating this other guy for about seven years. I knew she had been going out with this other guy although she never said anything. It was always kind of that way in our house. Anyhow, she was sitting in the driveway one night and well, what I did, I snapped on the lights - the outside lights. I was really furious at her and eventually she came down. I remember coming downstairs because I really had to go to the Jon bad and I called her "an old cheat."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because she was cheating on this other man that he had been going out with for so long?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that is what I thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were just infuriated that she would do that to anybody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is what I thought about it at the time. The more I think about it, she wasn't cheating on the other guy. I think I interpreted that she was cheating on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: On me, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you liked this other guy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no, no, no. I like the other guy but the more I think about it, I was too upset and, I don't know psycho-analysis or anything like that, but I remember the feeling: I was too upset. It was way too personal a thing for me to be that upset because it was this other person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it like now she wasn't only going to split her attention between you and one other person, but now between you and two other people? 0:13:58.5</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I called her a cheat but, see, the first time that I found out about the first guy...I don't know. This is another thing that I guess I never really...I wrote it down once. The very first time that my Ma dated somebody...how did it happen? Oh, she had been seeing him for a long time but she never told us. She would see him late at night when she thought we were sleeping but I would always be awake. She never knew that I knew. And there too: it must be something that I have never worked on. I am not quite sure what it is. It wasn't so much that...I remember the incident where I met this guy. One night, I knew this guy was coming and I just ran out of the house and I was crying. We were in my grandmother's house. Then she came over to my Grandmother's house and introduced this guy and it was a really embarrassing thing. That is the way I met him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After you screamed you carried on with that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, what I did: I ran out of the house. It was like 9.30 at night and I cannot remember at this point if I said anything in there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said something to your Grandmother, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I did. I think I said something like...I didn't even remember that because that was a bad scene too. When I went over to my Grandmother's house, I was really angry. I can't remember the exact words but I know I said something like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That cheating bitch?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't use that word. That was the way I felt. Yeah, that was in my head. I remember this whole thing but I didn't remember that when I went over to my grandmother's house, it was almost the same reaction as my... and I don't know why it is. The thing of it was that it was like being kept secret - hiding it from my sister and myself. On the other hand, there must have been things about my feelings which I never really thought about. Anger was there and jealousy and I remember when I went to my grandma's...sneak - I called her a sneak. There were a whole lot of things that I said to her and then my Ma came and there was this formal introduction - a very formal introduction. I can't remember if I stayed there. That is the way it was with mother's first boyfriend and my reaction to that was...was I jealous? I was jealous I guess. I was angry. Hurt maybe - I wasn't good enough. 0:18:29.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not good enough for her? Should I go find somebody else - is that what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of. I don't know. I was mad because I really banged the door. When I first ran out of the house I slammed the door, I ran off and I was crying. Like she didn't trust us enough to tell us about this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR She didn't treat you as a person?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I can't understand is why I wouldn't have been told? Why not make it a natural sort of thing? I don't know if this is what has screwed me up half of the time. I don't know: there are kind of two things there. One, I was angry because of what I considered the sneakiness of the whole thing. and then the whole other thing of what is my position? I was a little kid. If my Ma loves somebody else, what does that do to me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, what does that do to you? Here you are: 10-years-old now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I wasn't not even 10 yet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Younger than that? Eight? 0:21:06.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was before fourth grade. I must have been eight or nine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay Johnny: you are nine-years-old then. You have just discovered that your Ma is in the car in the driveway...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no - that is the later time. The later time was when I was a sophomore in high school so I was about 16.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you ran out the house?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The first incident that ever happened was when I was nine...no, that wasn't the first incident...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The more you think about it, the more incidents pop up, huh? The more you realize stuff happened between you and your Ma?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like when I relate to a girl, I figure it must be a pattern after the way I related to my Ma because the way I related to my Ma is supposedly - from the stuff I have read - like my first love object. If I had a father I guess then that would be both.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is your Ma your first love object?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is what the books say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is your Ma your first love object?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I doubt my Ma has the capacity to love.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wasn't talking about her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel very cool towards my Ma. I talk to my Ma and my Ma is there. I think I would cry at her funeral. I am not sure but I think I would. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that not a sign that you love here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I can never remember the time when my Ma either held me or kissed me. I can never remember that in my whole life. And we were always a cool family after a certain point and time. My sister and I can remember being affectionate toward her when we were small: I think until about 10. I don't know if it just that I can't remember. My Grandma: I remember I sat in my Grandma's lap and she would read me stories. 0:24:23.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She was more...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really that much either. It is like Germans: they way Germans are. I don't know if you know: Germans are...well my Grandma would hold me in her lap but my Ma, I don't know if I just block it out or I can't remember. Like when I was a third or fourth year in the seminary, I mean, finally, we started kissing goodbye but it was a bit embarrassing because it was not real affection.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A peck on the cheek or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is an official sort of thing that we go through. I don't know why that is. Now it is to the point that I look exactly like my father. I have seen pictures of him. He died I think when he was 25 so I am about his age. I even write like him. I never even knew the guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your handwriting is the same?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No the way I would write a letter is the same and I look like him. Now if my Ma sees me...I don't know if that was a part of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If she saw you as him instead of as her son?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know: that might be way off. It wasn't intimate before I was even nine. Was that my love object there? I don't know: the way it seems to me, when I was really, really small - this incident goes way back. I was separated from my mother: it didn't have to do with me. I can't place it exactly but when I was real little I just remember I was terrified because that was the first time I can remember my Ma was ever going to go away. I yelled and screamed. I must have cried for half an hour. It was another one of those things that I didn't know about it and all of a sudden, boom, they didn't fill me in. another time, when I was circumcised, nobody filled me in. They told me I was going to a nice place where they had a nice room and all of a sudden, boom, they hit me with it. When my sister was pregnant, nobody told me about it and I went to the wedding like a dumb ass and later I came back and found out that my sister was six months pregnant. I didn't even believe my own eyes on that because I remember seeing her coming down on the day of the wedding and I thought her stomach was awful bulgy. I was so unbelievably naive that I didn't say anything. My eyes told me that she was pregnant, you know. 0:28:19.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or nobody treats you like you have any sense or can take in things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My original...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They don't trust you: they don't treat you like a human being?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a lot of it: that is really it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They don't treat you like someone that they would love and trust?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I said, right around when my Dad died, I guess that was my first memory, she said: "Okay, you are the man of the house." I had never been treated that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like you wanted to be treated as her love object but weren't? She paid lip service to that: she said you be the man of the house but she never acted that way. Even up to this day she never confided in you. Then she started going out with other men. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you wanted to be her love object?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I never could figure that out because a lot of times, even my sister would kind of do that. One time I was at her house I think it would have been in the last five years - and she said...her kids were arguing and screaming and there was a lot of tension. She said: "Uncle Johnny wasn't like that." People don't usually fight around me or else they try and cover it up. I don't know, I did a kind of...it was kind of devious I guess...I called up mother to talk to her and told her that I loved her which I never done in my whole life - I never once told her that - and it really seemed strange and inappropriate to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? Because you don't love her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To me love is like a feeling or emotion or something, you know. Sometimes you cry maybe once or twice when you are feeling sorry for yourself. The only time that I have done that - when I felt sorry - was when my Dad died. Once in a while I feel sorry for my Ma because she has had a rotten life. She has had a lot of shit thrown her way. But mostly, recently, it would have been much more my Dad. If he would have been alive, how would it have been? What was I saying?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Told your Ma you loved her - you called her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. That scared me because the way she reacted was very...almost metallic - sort of official way. She said: "Well, I love you too Johnny." Very on an even line. And the first time that I said it, she went into this digression of 10 minutes talking about everything but anything. It was the kind of thing I like to talk to my Ma about but she just backed off of it right away. Then she finally came around to it, as though she should say something. As I said something, she said that. I said: "What was it like when I was a little kid?" If the way I have learned to love and they way I have learned to think about myself are - in a way the way my emotions go - are determined by that woman. And at this point in her life, that is the way this woman reacts to a thing called love. Now, maybe it was my fault because I didn't really mean it. I don't think I meant it: I just wanted to see what she would do. I don't know, maybe that is the way it was a lot at home because when some tension would come up or some problem would develop, there would usually be that drag, drag, drag - it would never be resolved unless, once in a while I would cause a huge scene and I would say something like: "I didn't mean to do that (inaudible 33:58)." I guess what scares is that emotionally, if my Ma couldn't give me love...she did things though - she did things for me. That I think was her way of loving. Things like make sure we eat. 0:34:51.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Take care of your necessities so far as your physical needs were concerned but never very much in the way of affection or emotion?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It always seemed strange when I saw...my Ma, after all this happened - this is within the last four years or so - my Ma has dated different guys but now it is kind of more out in the open. If she is going out with someone, my sister and I kind of kid her about it now to try and get her to talk about it. She was dating this one guy: we went on picnics and stuff. The guy was a creep. The second guy - the guy when I was 16 that I reacted to so violently - that was a good guy. That is the guy that I wish maybe all the way along that I would have known. My sister really thought a lot of him and I did too - once I got to know him. He died of cancer a year or so ago. This third guy - she has dated maybe four or five guys since the second husband died - but the guy she dated right after was just a ding-a-ling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When did she get married again? You said second husband?</p>

<p>PATIENT It was in March I think when I was a senior in high school but I had just left home that year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he died also?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He died a year later. That is one thing they told me. They did tell me he had incurable cancer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before he died?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before he died, yes. This other guy, his name was Butch and he was just an unbelievable - what would I call him - a primitive ape. That is the only thing I could call him. And then the alcohol did him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Went along with his name, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really. Well, my Dad's name was Bubba so, God, there was a whole bunch of things (chuckles). But my Dad could write a letter. I mean, he could write a letter that would sound like he had some sensitivity.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have read some of his letters? 0:37:51.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: One. Only one in my life. That is another thing: why I have not been secure. But this guy...oh what a...well, what I was going to say was that my Ma would call him dear but it had the same metallic sort ring to it. I really started asking myself...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it was just kind of a habit or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think she had the feelings for him but to me it came out false - the way she said it came out false. I think the feelings were there but I don't think she knew how to express them. Before I never even had an inkling of why I am the way I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Removed, like from things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, I guess you are saying that it is because your Ma was like that: is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well the only thing I can figure is, I say: "Okay, Where did I grow up? Where did I learn my emotions from?" Well, I grew up in a small, little town in a one roomed house up to fourth grade, then we got a bigger house for all practical purposes. It was a little town and a little, bigger town. In that situation, the closest people to me where some of the guys my Ma dated, my Ma, my sister, my Grandfather and my Grandmother. And then scattered aunts and uncles which didn't amount to a whole lot to my emotions. But the main one where my emotions lie has to be my Ma. Although when I used to think back, I couldn't think of anything. Nothing would come back and now within the last year, a lot of incidents pipe up, and especially like...I am trying to figure out when I got divorced from the emotional world. I can really sense that for some reason or another, I would always cover a hurt up - if I was even aware that there was one or this thing down at the bar. It took me maybe four days of thinking to try to figure out exactly what had gone on in my head. And why, all of a sudden, this person was dirt. It really was the way - boom! All of a sudden, I really didn't want any part of her - cheap. But that wouldn't have come out that way. 0:40:45.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is when you think about it that you realize that is probably the way you felt about it - cheap?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because all I felt was that then I knew that something had come up and I couldn't identify it and I didn't feel at all good toward her. That I wanted to take her home, even though I said I was taking her to my place. This was a punishment for her. I knew it was not recreational: this isn't the way it should be. I was going to take her home and then I knew that if she didn't say anything to recognize that I was upset then I would have to say something, which would also be a judgement against her because she didn't have the perception to see that something was wrong. And even though all these things are going on, I was saying to myself: "Okay, I know when I am not figuring something out or when things are just a hodge-podge." What I thought about it was all there but at the time, it was like a coldness that I couldn't understand. Why that one person could come up and (inaudible 42:18) me? To me, I learned it when I grew up. I have never carefully tried to understand why these things are so. I do it now, once in a while, where I will try to figure out: "Now, why would I react that way?" I don't know if that would help me to react differently. All I know, when I date girls I am very affectionate. I am not really afraid to touch people but there was a time - up until I was 21 - the first time I ever kissed a girl I never knew that the human body could be that warm because the only body I ever touched was my own.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You never touched your Ma's either?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't know if it was because I wasn't in the school system for so long or I was that afraid of touching. I don't remember the girl's kiss or anything else: all I remember is that she was very warm. That is the whole total recall of the first time that I ever kissed a girl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That felt good, I bet?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah. It was just really something that I had never...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Never experienced.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The warmth of another body; another person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was completely foreign to me. Like even now, if I am dating or something like that, I check my time. I must have some reason for checking it. I must have been checking those (inaudible 45:15) out. See, my sister isn't this way though. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She is not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, she is the same way too. She is extremely affectionate. I think it is real but I can't understand...I guess I think there is really something wrong with me. I guess why I go into this stuff is I think the way I can find out what is wrong is by going back. All of a sudden I feel kind of weird. I think I am kind of off the track.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ever since I looked at my watch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were starting to say: "Even now, when I go out with a girl," you said, "I better check the time."</p>

<p>PATIENT: To me that was...I don't know...all of a sudden I felt funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would get your watch out: "I better get away from this."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was conscious about not looking at my watch (chuckles). Now you see me look at my watch? I don't know why. Why would I even feel strange about looking at my watch? It is not even a big deal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like you are trying to worm your way out of talking about something you didn't want me to know about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I was to go out with a girl now, even. One thing I have never been - what I would call mutually in love - where somebody loves me and I love them. Either they love me and I can't return it or I love them, kind of, or I get extremely dependent on them or all these other things. I ought to use the word "love" - I love them and they can't return it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That makes it sound as though you are not sure that you really have any love, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Every time I think I have it has been such a bad scene, it ruins me. The first time it happened, it took me three years and I couldn't study. 0:48:47.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something petty and (Inaudible 48:50).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, after the first time I said: Okay then Alector, you are not going to be bitter about this. You have got to be big about this: you have got to control those things. The other time since then - that was in...the thing I finished in about '66; it came to an end. It went from '63 to '66 - '62 to '66 - and it was all long distance. No way that I got to know that girl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was like (Inaudible 49:27), huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure, it was like all of it was by long distance. Since that time, I didn't think it would ever happen again until this year: it could have happened twice this year but both...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It could have happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: One time I was dating a girl - this girl was engaged - and we saw each other for about a month and one night...God (chuckles) I called her. We had a date - we had a date. It was on a Monday night - I remember that. She said to call her to make sure she was ready to go. So I called her and she said: "Oh, I am washing my hair - I can't go." And I heard a voice in the background, you know: "Dirty cheat." I was polite to her for a week: that is how I reacted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She was engaged to another guy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah! But she was still going on at me, you know. What happened was, I would never have asked her out but it was in January, I met her at a party and we talked and I said: "Whenever you are available, let me know." Well, at that time they were kind of...they had been going out together for a couple of years but what happened was, about a month later, all of a sudden they decided to break up. I got the word through the grapevine so I asked her out. I didn't ask her out for about three weeks. I finally asked her out but I thought she was back together but she still went out. She decided she was going to date a little too because this guy was fascinated by it. We started going out for about a month. Then, the way she explains it - and I guess I believe her - is that the guy that she started questioning her feelings for the guy and she also had feelings for me. We never did talk on that one either. What happened was at that point I got very polite. I went out to lunch with her a couple of times. It was just really an extremely tense scene. Then we went out on a ski trip and finally, one night she came up to me - we were on the ski trip - and she said: "You're a bastard." "What do you mean, I am a bastard?" I made her extremely nervous and I treated her the same way and the reason that I was mad at her - I am sure now - is because I thought somebody was (inaudible 52:15) that night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She eloped?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and she cheated on me, even though they were involved together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Next Thursday is Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is your week like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could we meet earlier in the week at all?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to go home on Wednesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about Tuesday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday would be good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At 5.00?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I still don't know your first name.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Michael.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Michael?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have got a good friend whose last name is Michael. I kept thinking that was your last name.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. First one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, see you then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so long. 0:53:39.8</p>

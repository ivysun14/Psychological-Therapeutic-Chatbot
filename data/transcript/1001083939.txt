<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how have you been doing overall at this point?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Overall? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fair to mid land</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, now [NAME OTHER] moved out already?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh hum, well yeah, for the most part, she's still packing up some stuff and pulling out. Friday I've got an inspection by [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, which I'm going to try and postpone another week because I'm in the pain clinic program, which has been very helpful.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, found out I couldn't stand on my tippy toes on my left foot, just shows you I could.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because of your back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's gotta be. Gotta be.  Because of sciatica you know or something, so something's not working right there, ya know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Should I see [NAME OTHER] on that you think maybe or no? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or should I just wait and see what the pain clinic recommends?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'd see what the pain clinic recommends. Are you [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, just ask him</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I get an injection on Wednesday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, ask him what he'd recommend in terms of a work up. Okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Because you know that's starting to get serious then if I'm losing function ability.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pain is one thing that we can control but function and ability is another thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah it's real important that we find out what they can do about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, [NAME OTHER] was trying to get some muscles unknotted but there's not too many muscles knotted. There's a couple muscles that are knotted, little bit, but [NAME OTHER] the guy, in the, the occupational therapist, at [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, I think like in two spots you know and it doesn't matter if [INAUDIBLE]  muscle, you know, I still can't stand on the tippy toes you know. If I bend my knee I can stand on the tippy toes, but that's different, that's like locking it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ya know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's muscle weakness?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess, I just can't do it. I'll show you. Like you, like you stand on your tippy toe on one, like, pretty much right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, this one, if I try [INAUDIBLE] I can go like this and I can go like that, but this...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It just goes right down.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, but you don't have a foot drop when you walk at least?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not yet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have trouble holding my leg a little high, you know, but... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's kind of scary.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um hum. Sounds like surgery might be comin around the corner, you know, either fusion disks or fusion vertebra and/or I've had some spinal stenosis, some nerves comin off that have stenosis.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They might be able to do something for them, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's certainly better than having crushed vertebra or something...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like that where they only do fusions.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fusions with a bar. Ya know or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I was out in [DEIDENTIFIED] last week and I went to that body exhibit...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Heard anything about it?  They took people from, real people from China and obviously deceased folks and they dissected them in the most ornate way to see parts of the anatomy that you couldn't even see in gross anatomy with four people working on a cadaver for three months. So I spent a lot of time on this, especially looking at the central and peripheral nervous systems. What struck me as amazing is how tiny those nerve roots are that come off of the spinal cord. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're that small huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They are, some of them are like very fine string, not quite thread-like, but very fine string.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> String. That's still thicker, thicker than a filament?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, yeah. I was thinking of a filament, but, I was always under the impression, given some of the other nerves that come off of the brain stem, that these are actually thicker than they are.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thicker than what they look like, yeah. Again, remember you're dealing with Chinese people.  Everything's smaller.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's definitely some truth with that but.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Very little truth though the proportion still there's something there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but it was just... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've seen the sagittal section they had in the Museum of Science and Industry, that was very interesting. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They had one that was coronal and sagittal there, another one was longitudinal, just phenomenally done.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I guess they had it at the Museum of Science and Industry for awhile.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is it a traveling exhibit or something?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it was just amazing. I mean, now I have a much better appreciation for what surgeons are dealing with when they go in there and how, but the thing is they can't really guarantee a whole lot.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They can't guarantee nothing. I asked them, you know I says well you know, I guess I got infusion to look forward to, not forward to but eventually and that'll take care of my pain then she said, I talked to her and she said, well, she said sometimes fusion gets rid of the pain, sometimes it gets rid of some of the pain, sometimes it causes more pain. So she said fusion is the extreme last resort because you never really know what the outcome is gonna be. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, most people that talk to neurosurgeons come back to me and say to me they are told there's a 50/50 chance of everything of everything 50% could be better, 50% could be worse.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I wouldn't want to end up paralyzed at all with canes, but I'm running that risk now anyway, you know, with the foot drop, or the toe drop or whatever I call it, can't stand on my toes. I think something's gotta be done about that pretty quick.  See, it's the fifth, fourth and fifth vertebra. I guess it goes this way, goes this way, or does it go this way?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This way, this down.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The fourth and fifth vertebra down here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Lumbar.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Lumbar, okay. There's two disks that are squashed and desiccated. I'm not sure which ones what, between the fourth and the fifth is one for sure, the other one might be above the fifth or below the fourth, I don't know which, but uh, the one on my left side is squashed like that and the one on my right side is squashed like this a little bit and this one is more narrow and he had a hard time getting this one when he was doing the Epidural. When he did the Epidural he said well tell me what you feel, you know, he said tell me when you feel something. Well I didn't feel anything hardly like so I didn't say anything and then all of a sudden my leg goes like this and I go ahhhhhh and he said I told you to tell me something and I said I just did, .I just felt it, so the next time he inserted the needle I gave him blow by blow little tiny feelings, you know, so he knew exactly where he was and what he was doing, because actually, I didn't, I didn't think much of it, or I didn't feel much of anything when he was doing the first one, you know, so. I mean one time when he gave me the Epidural he used a florascope, a year or two ago, I said maybe you should have been using a florascope again, I don't know, but that area because it's so squashed I think he had a hard time hittin it, is my best guess, you know so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How dry are theese disks?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How desiccated are the disks, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, back pain is no fun. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, you know with the Relafen and the Lyric-, what is it, Lyrica?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the pain isn't so bad, you know, but my legs still don't function as good as they should, the hips still hurt on and off or a lot here and there, the right hip in particular but the left hip hurts sometimes, but who knows.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that coming from the nerve roots or because you've got hip problems?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's coming from the back, you know, and possibly the roots too because I've got, the roots on both sides were undergoing stenosis and stuff like that, at least on the left side for sure and on the right side had similar problems to the left side they said and I had sciatica initially diagnosed on the left. I have something going on with my right leg. My right leg is worse than my left leg mostly now, except for standing on the toes like that, you know. Like my foot right now is numb. On and off, mostly numb. Mostly numb but sometimes not so numb you know, kind of like a wave going through it and increased wave and then, so it's weird, you know what, anything with nerves is weird, you know, you gotta give me something...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Unpredictable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You gotta give the neurologists a lot of consideration for all this [INAUDIBLE] because you know, you know as a doctor, you know as a doctor how strange everything is anyway. Well with nerves that's even weird.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Far less predictable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what I think you know. Far more hypothetical than anything else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've got, you know [NAME OTHER] from [DEIDENTIFIED], her car went off in a ditch...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, oh, you pushed something and wound up, you screwed up your back or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Screwed up my back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What did you do to it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Crushed the top of my L1.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You're L1?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] vertebra?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so the vertebral body shattered.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh man.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now it didn't lose height, thank God, the disk pushed out a little bit, but that was the most painful part of it but what I found out, this is from for sure from and earlier injury, because I have an L4 bulging disk, L4/5 bulging disk with a little bit of stenosis down there and a little bit of fine metal stenosis.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Dissection</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The nerve goes through. Now some of that might have been from but since then I've had some pain shooting through the both of my hips.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's from your back?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right here, exactly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What are they gonna do about the vertebra you crushed?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well fortunately, it didn't, it shattered, but it didn't disintegrate, it stayed in shape so I took it up to a neurosurgeon and he said the pain would be gone in three or four weeks if your vertebrae heals, if it crushes and falls, he said so if you feel anything like strange or abnormal, come on in and we'll give you an MRI, he said even if it did come down we can inject it with a balloon acrylic, acrylic substance, and to...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bring it back up?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bring it back up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That would be nice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so there's no surgery involved, it's the needle and....</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's questionable too, I don't know, I'd almost rather be opened up and they see what they're doing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so he'll know exactly what's going on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. What are they hoping? Are they hoping that the vertebra heals back together?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He said that what I was seeing on the MRI was dissolved and lit up of course was all the inflammation in the hip area so even though the bone shattered it didn't displace.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So the shattered parts are going to heal back together probably. Now what is the pain coming from, the bulging disk?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The pain's from the inflammation.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, so when...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've got the lower pain goes down to my hips is from the bulging disk.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The bulging disk. So you should do the pain clinic then.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well both of them so, are mild, in fact I've taken this whole time...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ibprophen or Aspirin which one?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tylenol.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Tylenol. The candy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's funny, I'm not, I can't sit here and tell you I'm in a lot of pain.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I can't lift anything either.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So you better not. You have to heal at least a little, even after that...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I figure I'm looking 8 to 12 weeks before I'm...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You're looking at the rest of your life without lifting much of anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Lifting maybe 10 pounds or...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 20 pounds at the most, you know, you shouldn't monkey around with anything else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I won't especially the distressed lady that did this. Never did get her out anyway. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No? I got my distressed ladies out of ditches when I was in college but then I popped an internal stitch on my, on my hernia repair, I could hear it pop but then the outside stitches were fine. To this day I don't know if it'll pop open or not.  I'm not going to be doing heavy lifting anymore.  I wound up removing the stitches myself, little alcohol, why go to a doctor.  I didn't have a doctor. I wasn't gonna go to the clinic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've got enough medical background.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I didn't have a medical background then.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh not then?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But still you know, I monkeyed around in a lab with frogs and big rats. I was just a bigger rat. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are your moods holding up all right and...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty good, I've been down, but I'll get out of it I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've got a lot of situational stuff going on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Somebody, somebody messed up my car. Somebody pulled out the distributor cap, pulled out the wires, it's a four-banger, all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pulled the wires out so three of them wouldn't touch the rooter when it went around, one would, put it back down, put the rubber caps on so it looked like it was all correct and my car wouldn't start and so when I got that all fixed, it still wouldn't start, so I checked the spark and somehow my coil got screwed up, I got like a new coil, and my coil got screwed up, but the spark from your coil is supposed to be blue, if you grind out your coil or a spark plug wire it's supposed to be blue, bright blue or bright white and my spark is yellow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And this was intentional?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, obviously, somebody did that intentionally, you know, did that intentionally to my, to my, to my car, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, did that happen by your house?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, right in front of my house.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That neighborhood is pretty rough.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yeah, but I think it's the new system. They let girls drive it the day before, so they wanted to slow me down. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then did the system ever intervene that way?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah. They've done shit to me, a lot of shit, you know, all of shit, all sorts of shit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know psychologically, but I've never heard you, if anything actually....</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Damaging?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Damaging...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well they gave me orders.  They give me smells, they give me taste and when you smell things and taste it sometimes and some of the oils aren't very pleasant, so they don't taste very good, you know, they give me suggestions which uh...because I'm so suggestible, you know...it's almost like reality in me sometimes and it is screwed up some of the stuff I see or do or feel.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Speaking of which, are, did you have your EEG done?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not yet, I had to cancel it because my car died.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh okay. The reason I'm asking is, people and I don't know if you have temporal lob epilepsy or what type of seizure you had before.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know what you're thinking doc. You don't believe in my system, but I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Smells and the tastes are classic temporal lobe, so it would be helpful if...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Has, has, has included hundreds of people that they used to work against me. I hate to say against me, I don't mean against me, I mean to trying to help me and cure me, but doing stuff that's just wrong for me....</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hundreds of people, hundreds of people who I've seen and it's been very upsetting to me. Now, don't you dare up my Abilify. So, I'll be taking a bottle a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're on the maximum dose on Abilify anyway. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I think so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've never had anyone above 30 so I don't have any intention of doing that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't want to piggy back on it...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, [INAUDIBLE], no...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not a big fan of using two antipsychotics together. I've had you know, obviously some concern about whether the Provigil's...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh the Provigil is very effective.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But the Provigil keeps you awake and I'm not going to stop it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think we'll keep everything the way it is, with your mood dropping down a little bit is situational.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah that's situational, it's not, it's not, it's pretty much situational the way I interpret the situation and not, not so much, not so much internal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now how are you on refills, the Abilify?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know exactly but if I have trouble I'll just call...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just call [NAME OTHER] and we'll call...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Excuse me. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or if I have trouble I'll call [NAME OTHER] or I'll call you if it's really bad but it shouldn't' be, you know, I'm pretty good with refills, like they can always call you or</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or the pharmacist, they can fax over...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Well, this ought to be interesting to study, they'll probably really think I'm screwy but...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's life.</p>

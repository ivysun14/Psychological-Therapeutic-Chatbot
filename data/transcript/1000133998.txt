<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well apart from whether the machinery's going, I want to try and get straight in my head what the Counseling Center is and who they are before I talked to Mr. Williams at one of the groups the night before. This as I understand it is now a private grouping of individuals who were formerly associated with the university.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, all of us were on the staff at the NYU Counseling Center. And then the university phased out its clinical psych program and with it the counseling center. The people there decided to continue seeing the people they had been seeing and to offer it to this community. And that's where we are right now. [0:01:25.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you are connected with the university at that point and now you've kind of broken away. Is that the idea?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not a temporary routine I take it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just discovered salvation and nirvana?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, that's not it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well and as far as...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And first of all I'd like to check why were you curious about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm interested to know who I'm talking to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And who they are and what they are. Because the reason why I got in touch with the outfit... I don't know how much of this you already know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't. [0:02:02.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't know anything? Well the reason...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except what I read in your initial.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The reason why I got in touch originally was because I had been down at the Center for Continuing Education and picked up a copy of Maroon and saw this thing that their going to add to get people in. So I talked to somebody there so I've already been through, I think, it was 10 sessions or 20 sessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, with Dave Crocker?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Crocker, that's right, yeah. So I was just curious as to what the relationship actually was. Now Dave Crocker when I spoke to him was strictly and purely a student. He may no pretensions of having any professional expertise in dealing with the kinds of things that we were talking about. And I take it that's not the case with the people here at the Counseling Center.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the difference is that Dave at that time was a first year practicum student which means that you were the first client he saw probably, one of the first two, under the auspices of the university. Okay, so we go through a one year training program of about 15 hours a week seeing, I don't know, four, six clients that you're... [0:03:17.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right out of undergraduate school?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's while we're second, third, fourth year graduate school. In fact I think he was in that first graduate school. I just finished my third year.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At the...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At the university. And I was in the same practicum that Dave was in and I went on to do an internship here which means doing about 20 hours a week, seeing clients this year and the consultation that goes along with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I see. I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've got other experience too but that's what I've done at this place. But again, I don't have the PhD tagged onto the end of my name yet. [0:04:07.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's all right. I'm not concerned about that. I was concerned though to get it straight and that gets it pretty straight. So I went and took those tests they gave. As I understand that's not really connected with what we're...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I will never know what those tests were.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't either by the way. I don't know what they're all about myself. I followed one of them (inaudible at 0:04:32.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're concerned about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I felt badly because after all it's a special kind of a program, and I did manage to mess it up. It was an extremely complicated test. I think they ought to revise it. Just to waste a moment, it had a whole series of relatives and associates you were supposed to name and it had this bewildering array of little boxes that you were supposed to put is this person is to that person the other is to the other when you don't feel that way about the third, make an X here. It's tough to compute. [0:05:07.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told the fellow that I'd be happy to take it over if ever if the thing made no sense which I'm sure will be the case. So well I was interested in another aspect of the thing too and that is after having talked to Dave Crocker and having given him an outline of the difficulties that brought me here, I was interested to note that he picked a woman to discuss these matters that are of a somewhat delicate, as far as I'm concerned, nature. Were you available or is this...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did that happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or is this...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It happens that I was looking for new clients, and I looked through your folder, and I picked yours out. That's how it happened. It wasn't by an act of God or... [0:06:04.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought that Dave may have thought well this looks like a good each and see how he reacts with a women. Because the unfortunate thing is that I don't know how well really I'll be able to communicate especially with a young woman about the thing. And you have an idea, I'm sure, of what's going on because you read the folder. And so it's somewhat ironic that given that circumstance that I should be in a position of talking about these is of great concern to me with a woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that make it more difficult?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. At first it certainly does, but I'm willing to give it a try and see if we make any progress. As I understand the program if you or I feel that we're wasting each other times, maybe we can switch. I also understand though that that may put me further back down the line in terms of getting someone. [0:07:06.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In other words, I wouldn't have gotten someone except that you were on tap as it were?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I feel you wanted that option very much being able to switch therapists...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I do in case we don't work because as I say, I'm from a very conventional background and it's going to be disconcerting for me, I think...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be discussing...</p>

<p>PATIENT: To discuss the matter and with the honesty that's required so we're not just screwing around as it were. But I'm perfectly willing to make the attempt. It might even be more valuable in the long run I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the conclusions (inaudible at 0:07:53.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well good. Well I don't know exactly how does one start normally? [0:08:06.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: However you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well some of this will be repetition of what I've already spoken of I think with Mr. Williams. But the primary reason why I'm here is I'm 28 and involved in a career that takes a good deal of self assurance to work in. And I feel that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To really carry it off you've got to be convinced.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And I feel that from the most callow reasons, that is to say so that I'd have a successful career, I feel the inhibition that results from my sexual incompetence or incapacity has its affect all the way through the very strata of my personality. It effects how I behave. One of the ways it affects my personality, and specifically the way I behave at the office, is I'm prone to riotous living on occasion. And this gives the rise to not going to work in the morning and all day which as you're slowly building up a level of confidence that your employers have in you, then you're supposed to be at the club at 8:30 to talk about this or that, and you're not there, and this causes them to think of you as strictly the lightweight. [0:09:36.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is really bothering you at this point?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, which bothers me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like your activities conflict with one another and you feel that you better get this thing straightened up if you really want the straight and narrow career.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think at this point I do. But that's just one manifestation of it really. There's a whole series of other manifestations. And as I say it goes right through the personality structure causing me to... In fact, I'll tell you specifically why I called that day. (inaudible at 0:10:09.9) got in touch with this center the second time. I'd been talking with a guy, an associate of mine, about a particular deal that we were going to go in to. This guy happens to be a very close associate of mine. Not associate, he's a very good friend. He's also in the same business and we swap stories and tell each other about the deals that we are in to and all that. There's a very legitimate opportunity I think coming on with connection with this guy. I might possibly join forces with him in this operation. [0:10:44.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As far as business is concerned?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And he called up one day and as it happened I was sitting at home I think, and I don't know whether I was going to work that day or not, but he called me up and we began to talk about this. And as I talked to him, I recognized I really couldn't trust my own judgment on the phone because of the personalities that were involved, his and mine, and I didn't even trust my own judgment. And he was talking about (inaudible at 0:11:11.0) I thought it was, and I still do think it's a substantial opportunity. So I hung up the phone and then almost automatically I'd been turning over the business after a number of weeks and almost automatically I picked up the phone and dialed (inaudible at 0:11:25.9). So that's what I did. So that's one of the reasons. I feel that the thing is potentially so working on my personality and such an affect on me that it may drain me of all...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All energy in you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and the whole thing is actually hopeless and then you get involved in a whole series of very messy maze like considerations. So that's what I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's kind of as a way of finding a way out that maze so that you can trust your own judgment about other people and yourself. [0:12:06.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. So that I know that I'm not acting from some peculiar motive that is based on some thing that isn't a rational judgment. It's just no judgment period. So that was a specific cause of why I did it although really the deeper reason is too that obviously it's a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs I would attempt in any event whether I was a conductor on a railroad train or to try to take some steps to try and figure out...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's serious enough in itself...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to beat the rap. But the approximate cause was this matter of some conceivably serious things coming up, and I'm at 28, at an age now where things are either going to start to happen or they're not going to happen at all and (inaudible at 0:12:58.6). And one of the reasons just to elaborate on this for free form for a moment, one of the reasons why I think that this is important is because I've had occasion to remark to myself on the fact that I went with the career that I did. I'm in the real estate financing business and it had to do with numbers. It isn't extremely important to quick calculation but it has a lot to do with numbers and that's one thing that all my life I have had absolutely no aptitude for. And this causes me to wonder about myself in the dark hours of the night because why in the world would I go into something that I know, to be truthfully blunt about it, that I can get rich at? Why would I go into something that's so obviously, in one sense, ill suited to my talents? And none of which have any academic background that come with it. My talents are really more in the area of probably talking, writing, more verbalization, that kind of thing. And so that's the kind of thing that I... [0:14:07.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels almost like you might be driven there by some need to put yourself down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Finding a situation beautifully suited for my failure, and then watching the failure, and then only confirming to myself of my worthlessness of my (inaudible at 0:14:29.7). So those are the kinds of things that this gives rise to. The difficulty with it, and really the whole thing is I'm a reasonably, I think, sophisticated person. I have a lot of paperback knowledge of Dr. Freud and all that and I'm knowledgeable enough to know that I think the thing is really in its elements classical. In other words, my inability to relate to really anyone, and especially females, is a result of some kind of fixation that I probably have with my mother and all that. It's horribly venal and disgusting to me to think that. [0:15:17.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Venal to think that you could be so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's just such a second rate kind of thing that's really disappointing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wish you could come in here with...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, something exotic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, something sophisticated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like how do you like this one then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yet that doesn't help in getting out of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The fact that it's so plausible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so stupid. But as I say it's not only the fact that I don't relate at all to women but it's the fact that even in my relations with many of my associates there's something missing there. I'm always very uneasy somehow when I speak with them in social situations. I suppose in an easy sense I come off all right. But I always notice there's something missing that other people... [0:16:15.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want anybody looking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I always notice that there's something that other people will have in the way that they communicate that I don't have. Maybe it's just really a projection of my gross insecurity in that sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think that is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. In some way it's like a chemical or a kind of a thing sometime when people are talking, they both know they're on the same wavelength in some way and they can just communicate better. It's not just hale fellow, well met, slap them on the back, and you're one of the boys, but that's part of it. But it's also the fact that I've always sort of been a loner in many, many ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't sense the...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Community of feeling or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the nonverbal ease.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right, just a simple feeling at ease with people in talking with them. For example, I've always had that awkwardness about me with other people. The friends that I have had have all tended to be a little bit screwy themselves and the friendships have always been fairly intense. I don't have a wide acquaintanceship... I do have a wide acquaintanceship but I mean of real friends, I don't have Friday night with one group and Tuesday night with two or three of the others. You know that kind of wide ranging friendship that many people are able to achieve. So that the friends that I do have are people that the friendships are strong, and intense, and are with people that are probably a little screwy themselves because that's our basis of communication. [0:17:52.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that kind of scares you too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Because it really has been...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you had some really with it friends, they might be able to help you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Normal people, not just with it, but normal people. But I'm not immune to the blandishments of being fashionable and all that. I take that. So my whole life, when I really think about it, is definitely a little out of tune. And things could get bad, and I've seen it get bad, and it frightens me in some way because as I get older I find things coming to the fore more, they come out more. I don't know how many stories we should go into now because it'll just start be distracting. [0:18:41.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're getting a little bit tired of stories yourself right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, after all...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's also very hard for you to quit talking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I noticed the nervous laughter like it's a little bit scary when there isn't something (inaudible at 0:19:02.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you be willing to try an experiment and just sit here for a minute or so being together without words? If you say no, that's fine. [0:19:22.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd rather talk at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Let me get one thing straight because otherwise this is going to be in my mind the whole time one thing that I did notice on the form from your talk with Dave was what I was trying to get straight was how you felt about therapy with Dave Crocker. The form said something like he didn't talk much, and you didn't like that. Is that correct?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. As I mentioned to Mr. Williams I went in there quite aware of the fact that it's a student. I mean there was no question about that. I didn't really expect him to. And not saying that this guy Crocker is bad or whatever. I don't even think that he had a technique. I think his function was really to sit down and listen, and probably play the tape, and say well what do you think about, or how does this tie in, or something of that kind. And I recognize that. The only thing I was saying is that it's important to me to be provoked. In other words, I'm 28 and I've been going around the same treadmill about this matter for a long time now and it's important to me to have someone that's able to say something that'll clear of the congested passages in my brain. [0:20:45.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want more than a listener right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it's important to have a little bit of give and take. Because, for example, when I would talk to Crocker sometimes in these things that I've noticed with Crocker, and that's the only time I've been through it before, you do start to... And he just wouldn't say anything. And as I say, I recognize that was part of the deal. But you do start to talk and you can get a little bit far of field and talk nonsense forever, and I noticed myself doing that. [0:21:11.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pardon me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you're not talking about the general public.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I can, and I think anybody can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ted O'neil has the tendency to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think everyone can do it. I specifically can like anyone to talk for long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I'm not interested in talking about anyone in here. I'm interested in talking about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I can most specifically talk nonsense, and I noticed that I did that on occasion. I got a little bit far a field and he was just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you'd like one my roles to be to help you from getting far a field?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And to not let absolutely virtually everything I say go unchallenged because if that happens well then nothing happens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you're talking to empty space.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, except I rehashed it which I've done a thousand times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think the important thing is hopefully try to communicate it to someone else to bring that other perspective. [0:22:14.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's one thing I'd like to insert right here and that is one of the functions that I see at first interview with the client is establishing some kind of knowledge between the two people of where each one is at, and some kind of general rules or working understanding of what the relationship is going to be like, and what is going to be my role, and your role too. And I just want to tell you that I think I am quite a bit more active than that. And in fact you may get disgusted...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Dominating female?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we're talking about therapy right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I probably will tend to be pretty active, and I want you to know that from the start but to be very fluid the whole time and working at okay, how are we going to do this? What's helpful? And I appreciate it if you think about that. And if I'm doing something with you that don't think is helpful, say so. And at the end of each session, I'd appreciate it if you'd just say that was helpful, that wasn't helpful, let's go more this way, whatever, just so that we can both have a gauge moving back and forth all the time to make sure that we're making the most use of our time because we've got 20 sessions. I think that's the best way to make use of it so I hope things, in that sense, will change fast. [0:23:42.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Good. I think that will work. It's not always instantly evident how things have been helpful or not, but I basically agree with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Basically agree with me...</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the fact that it would be a good idea to compare notes as it were as to what...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Again, I'm not saying get obsessive about it but that's just kind of general stuff to keep in mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's going on right now? You seem quieter than you have been.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm not sure how to proceed after this point in a craftable way. I'm trying to get a fix on really how to get a handle on things to talk about it in a good way. I don't really know how too exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you just tell me how you feel about it? What's the most important thing about it right now? [0:25:02.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean about my difficult...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why you're here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what I'm really looking for is something that I suppose can't be delivered and that's the fact, and everyone I suppose attempts it, the attempt to, on my part, achieve some kind of a mature relationship with other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So that's your goal. That's what you want?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what you'd like to have therapy help you to toward?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. To recognize what that is and what it is in myself behind the kind of thing that I can talk very glibly about. This causes me to have been unable to do that to date. So that's the kind of thing I'm looking for. I don't know whether therapy this discussion of this kind can do it. I think in many respects obviously you really have to achieve it yourself. I'm not sure you don't achieve it just by going out and doing it, but I haven't thus far and, again, that's why I'm here because I'm really flailing about. [0:26:31.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're a little leery about putting all your eggs in this basket as to self improvement.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I don't because I really don't have that much faith in it, especially just a 20 session, but I do think that obviously I think it's helpful, or I wouldn't take all the inconvenience to get here, and to go into it. But in terms of flailing about, and you'll notice I think as we talk, that I have a great capacity for self pity, but I'm just going to let it go for the moment. But one of the things that.... [0:27:03.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean let it go? You're going to show me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm just going to talk about it and not feel badly that I'm weeping over myself. But one of the things, in terms of flailing about, and I was going to begin to say why I was so disturbed is there's really getting to be a desperate quality to my relations with people. And two or three different occasions recently, having been out with nice looking girls to whom I was at least reasonably attracted, I drink overmuch, and I get drunk. I know why I'm doing it. I drink for that reason specifically because I obviously think they're easier to talk about. I get much more relaxed as everyone does of course. But I know what's going to happen. For example, having recently gone out with a girl who's attractive on a blind date, I absolutely overwhelmed her with (inaudible at 0:28:13.6) about how much I, and I really embarrassed myself, about how much I adored her, and loved her, and I thought she was cute, and I touched on the most maudlin kind of things and she liked it, and I knew she would because people (inaudible at 0:28:27.4) and anyone likes to hear that kind of thing. So the next day... And it was really a desperation kind of a shot you know. I knew that she liked me as it was. I didn't have to do that because everyone left and she said, "Well let's go on." Well obviously she enjoyed it. But anyway I did do it, and I didn't have to do it, and I woke up the next day writhing (inaudible at 0:28:59.2) like a bloody fool so I handled that objectively. But she liked it, and she called up the next day, so we went out to see her the next night, and it was, as those things often happen... Again, I admit this is all very venal. I was very ill at ease. She was ill at ease. I was certain that anything.... [0:29:23.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was much, much harder.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, it was horrible because I was certain that anything that I would say would be goofy, stupid, inappropriate. And so it was a really incredible performance. I'm pleading my hangover. I said, "Gee I really feel disassociated or something today because I drank so much." Get it. And I'm in the back seat with her driving along with the other two. I sat around and found an umbrella for when we went back downtown from someplace out in the country and it was horrible. She was sweet about it but it was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was her opinion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was very painful. It was another failure. And so I almost feel like I don't even like to go out with females anymore because each time is going to be a failure worse than the last and I make a bigger fool of myself than the last time. [0:30:11.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:30:13.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, brought to you by... It really does. I mean it becomes worse and so I think well Jesus, why even do that because it's going to be a fiasco. And I just can't find any way to relate to them ordinarily. It's incredible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's so much fear in going into it that you feel that you have to do something to let it down and then the damn breaks down totally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I'm like a wall flower that gets drunk for the first time at the church social and goes and dances with every pretty girl in the place. That's pathetic. And in the back of it all running through my mind is a deeper kind of fear. That is to say that I think that the lack of success of sexual connotation, or just any relationship whether it be sexual or not, with females is in some way prima facie or some kind of a probably predisposition to homosexual kind of thing. In fact my only successful relationships, these intense friendships that I have, are probably, and I am acutely aware of it in fact and made embarrassed by it in some occasions, probably do have a homosexual tinge to them. Probably on my part but conceivably on some of my friends part too. But that's always the dark item in the background. And that kind of behavior to me is totally unacceptable to me and my ego. I've never indulged in it and if I ever do, it would be the most traumatic crushing experience I think I could have and it would just be horrible. (inaudible at 0:32:15.1) Even though I recognize there's probably a component in my personality. [0:32:21.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't. You may recognize it but you sure as hell don't want to accept it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I don't. And in a way I can conceive theoretical arguments. If I am a pervert but a queer... What to go with? But if I am then I should maybe just do it. If that's me, that's me as much as the shape of my nose and isn't a damn thing that I can really do about if effectively. And then just have the courage to do it, but I can't. I'm too incorporated with the... I'm an Irish Catholic, fallen away obviously, but nevertheless, it's all in my brain. So that's me too as well as conceivably... [0:33:11.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard to get those things together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard to get those means together. One more or less negates the other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And at this point you're incapable of accepting and living with either one which kind of leaves you on your own.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. That's right because I'm not going to become a Catholic. I can conceive that someone under the stress of this turning to the church or something that gave them solace to help them through it, but I'm not going to do that either. I'm apathetic about the church and about religion although one time I was a religious when I was a boy. But that's no longer the case. And I think... Well I don't know what I think beyond that anyway. That's the kind of thing that I'm faced with. [0:34:06.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's an area of confusion for you, the religion thing too right? It sounded like that's what you're starting to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was once religious and I'm not anymore. I don't think I'm confused about it. I simply don't believe in it and don't think about it very much in terms of dogma. I think about spirituality. I read obviously an introspective person and that generally goes hand in hand with it so I'm not concerned it. I don't think I'm confused about whether I should be a Catholic or not. It's like (inaudible at 0:34:38.8) which has no meaning for me. So to sum all that up I think, I'm reminded of something I read in a novel one time about a guy who went to West Point and became a general and got married. It was in the "Naked and the Dead". Did you read that book? [0:35:07.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he was one of the main characters in it. And when he was somewhere around 35 finally... He got married and had children and all that. And somewhere along at 35 he goes to Rome and he has a drunken homosexual encounter with some Italian guy on the street or something and this is a great turning point in his life. At that point he becomes a great general. And the point is his whole motivation of the guy is supposed to be suppressed homosexuality. And I'm reminded of that and something of that nature, although I certainly wouldn't become a great nature, but something of that nature is what might be in line for myself if I don't get a firmer on what's really going on in my mind. Either that or I can see the thing breaking out into.... This is pretty gamely stuff I suppose for the first session but... [0:36:09.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean without really going into it a little bit more I thought I would kind of skirt about these things a little bit. I think I mentioned this to Crocker but it's like there is this pressure there and as much as you deny it, you cannot. It does burst through. It's like lava flowing from a volcano or something and it will go through, and it will be twisted and warped, and it will cause my whole entire personality to twist and warp in some way. And today, although I feel I'm on the verge of it. Well I don't know if I feel on the verge of it or not but anyway, it's starting to come out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What I hear in that is one part of you saying perhaps if I did express the homosexual element, it might help straighten me out psychologically and getting my judgments or getting other things, getting that energy just and I'd be able to handle it. Is that... [0:37:18.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's part of it I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I know that's not all. But that's what I just heard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Right, that's what the analogy I guess was really talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are the (inaudible at 0:37:38.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: The what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The (inaudible at 0:37:40.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I didn't really recognize that. I can see that that's what I sounded like but that what I really wasn't saying I don't think. What I was trying to say is presumably we've got some sort of sexual impulse being totally denied at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Presumably or you know? [0:38:07.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just totally denied at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That the expression of it is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd like you to say my sexual impulses are totally denied at this point.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My sexual impulses.... I can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My sexual impulses are totally denied at this point. Is that a convincing statement?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I want you to try it on rather than talking about in an abstract out there way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I have a certain auto sexuality that isn't denied but not the way it's supposed to be with consenting adults. But in any event, what I was trying to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a second. I feel like you're rushing on with the story and there are things going on right now that we're rushing over; flying over. Have you lost what's going on right now or is some of it there? [0:39:20.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm embarrassed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's understandable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is. In any event, I feel vaguely foolish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think that you're foolish at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Attempt to get back to the initial analogy; I feel that in the event that I really just don't need to qualify it in that way, but in the event that my sexuality is denied at this point, it's going to give rise... This appears to be a natural force in a man. So it's going to give rise to... And this is really just high school textbook stuff but. [0:40:19.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you believe it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I believe it. Yeah, definitely. It's going to give rise to a whole series of later psychological problems and deformities of various kinds. So I don't really know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You fear that later (inaudible at 0:40:39.3) is a gamble?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bringing it right here right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh. Yeah, the clock is ticking and I could be in a very bad way shortly if I don't take some steps to try and at least have better understanding of what caused it. You know the funny thing is I really think in a matter of fact, specific way, I know what it is. [0:41:08.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what, what is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why I'm impotent. I know what that is. I think the reason for that stems again from this classically boring thing of being frightened of momma initially. Although if you were to just meet her initially you'd think she was an incredible scatterbrain, but she's a very forceful woman, and she got more respect out of me, so I don't think of her that way. I'm the youngest of four children and the rest of them have all had reasonably successful lives, and I haven't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At which point was... Okay, go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I haven't so it hasn't affected everyone this way in my family. And when I recount, for example, although my younger older sister, I think, is affected but she does not admit it. I have a strong relationship with her. I really like her. And not often, but whenever we meet, we tend to have maybe a couple of drinks, we don't get drunk, we have a couple of drinks, and loosen up our tongues, and we have an enormously intense conversation with her for hours, and I love it because I can really talk to her. She's not a shallow person. She really relates well to me and I can talk to her in a way that I don't because she's smarter than either of my other two brothers or sisters, and also a deeper person. But whenever I talk to her, for example, my version of the relationship between my mother and father, she just doesn't connect with that at all. She just doesn't know what I'm talking about. Now she's ten years older than I am so that might account for some of it because they were different people when I was ten, when she was ten, or whenever these things start to really begin to click in. But it's totally beyond her. And in fact I did express to her one night something I really deeply felt and never did express to her or anyone else before, and I was really surprised to hear myself about. Apparently I have a really virulent nature for (inaudible at 0:43:34.7), and I really said some cruel heartless things about them, and I do believe are true in my own mind. [0:43:39.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was surprising at that age.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But she said to me later, I mentioned to her I saw her briefly and said in a light way something about what did you think about what I said? And she said, "I think that you're a very cruel cold person." And I don't think of myself that way. I'm not that way. And I instantly said, "Well I do believe those things." I don't think well of my parents' motivation, and who they are, and what they are. [0:44:13.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In that moment, what she said sounded cruel and heartless and your sister said you are a cruel heartless person. There's quite a gap between those two things too though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of saying something that sounds cruel and heartless and being defined as a cruel heartless person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. There is. I don't think she was trying to define in that way. I think she was just carrying on, on that specific episode of what I said. Anything that I said wasn't horrifying in any way it was just that it was just an expression of my distaste for my parents. But anyway I think that this thing is a result of this problem that I have with the parents, misunderstanding them, and really relating to them very well, and thinking very highly of them in my heart of hearts. I have an honest contempt for my father that my brothers and sisters don't share and a dislike of my mother's motivations. I feel, I guess you'd say, conflicted about that because at the same time that I dislike her I feel that she's a wonderful person. And that's what makes her impossible to deal with because at the same time she's doing what I regard as things that I want to resist strongly, I recognize the fact that she's normal, she's doing this to try and make herself whole. She's a very insecure person herself. I noted it the other night when we had dinner, how she will go on, and on, and on, and tell stories about how people complimented her. It's really sad. And she tells them in the most naive way but finally they get to be a little bit annoying. She's all about this thing or that thing, and the whole conversation is about her doing it. [0:46:10.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it becomes very, very apparent how insecure she is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of scary.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then you feel like a wreck yourself for reacting the way you do and the thing is a complete mess. But I do have an enormous resentment for her. There's no question about it. And I really seize upon that in some way maybe to rationalize my own conduct. Maybe some of the things that I'm accusing her objectively are not true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that worries you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're concerned about the objective rather than your reality about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe I'm just wallowing about in a whole bunch of things that are strictly my own creation and are not necessarily the result of their or her actions, and that I'm being grossly unfair, and I don't want to be that especially when I see her in some ways such a strong and forceful person and in other ways such a... And really she is so forceful because she really (inaudible at 0:47:14.8) really a whole thing of mine which is utterly impossible for me to deal with in a way. See I cannot give her the simplest compliments that my brother will do or the simple thoughtful things that she loves now that she's getting older and doting a bit. I find it impossible to do that and that's probably kind of a tell tale thing. I'm not strong enough in myself to give her sort of normal little kindnesses that you do for your mother or something. Even right down to if I'm at home, taking her take the groceries out when she brings in the groceries or something. I absent myself from that because I would find it demeaning to me. I'm so insecure in myself that I find that demeaning to help her because I think that she's going put apron strings on me or something and I resent that. It causes her unhappiness and obviously it causes no great joy either. [0:48:15.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going to do one thing that I always qualify myself and that is give a bit of advice and you can forget it as soon as I say it because it's not the truest part of therapy. But I think that you would do well to quit or hold in advance the thing of trying to figure out the objective reality of is your mother really a bad person. Is she really those things or not? Trying to get any kind of objective reality about that because objective reality in that sense, it's just about impossible to get. And it's only making it more difficult for you to work with your feelings and work through them. [0:49:01.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I should have to resound them all for something don't you? I just can't say well I feel it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I still think that it's possible to think that's somebody is real bastard and not everyone else has to agree that they a real bastard. They could've been a real bastard to you and that's your feeling. And just go ahead and have that feeling. Have it strongly and get through it seems a lot more profitable than taking a poll of the neighborhood and finding out that you John Q. Jones is a bastard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you're right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the same kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I agree with that. Although as I say it I feel so guilty about it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I want to continually try and qualify it whether I really bugged him (inaudible at 0:49:59.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But I just bet you anything that that keeps you tied into that vicious circle much longer. [0:50:09.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I could see that it would. Well I won't worry about what I say about her here because she won't hear it so it's as though I never said it anyway. Anyway if I feel that way, I feel that way about her whether I say it or not so it doesn't make much difference. Well then I did feel that way about her. You know one of the troubling things about this to me is a question that's really just at empty air because it doesn't mean anything. I think there is a lot of biology or physiology, if you will, in all this, and genetics really, because in my family, in her side of the family, there is a certain history of this kind of thing. It does go back. Her mother was great bitch; just a horrible woman. But the man that she married was a very forceful toughest looking Irishman you ever saw in your life. I never saw him in real life but I've seen pictures of him; tough looking old man. And he had some mistress on the side as I find out (inaudible at 0:51:25.4) and so they were split apart. She hated him, and he hated her, and they both had vile tempers, and they fought a lot. So she was a great bitch and she out lived him and lived for a long, long time. And neither of her two sons got married; both great achievers. One was a judge and the other's a doctor. But neither of them got married and one of the one I'm named for died when he was 43 so it's unlikely that he... Well the law of averages say he wouldn't given the family history. So she sort of incapacitated them in certain ways. Although not looking at unfortunate ramifications that resulted in my case where I was a gross underachiever and flunked out of two colleges and barely gotten through everything I ever took. So anyway in their case they became great achievers but didn't get married. And I don't think I'm being unkind to say that the reason probably somewhat akin to the reason why I'm here. [0:52:35.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like a thin (inaudible at 0:52:36.6) of interaction this passed down from one generation to the other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At least over the last generation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it looks like it's got the same effect as far as relationships with women are concerned.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a family failing almost as it were. My cousin, who's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that do to you in all that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it makes me feel like its really hopeless, and I just better figure out a way to cope with it in a graceful way. But you know you say that in a way that you think that that's not so but I don't know. I would urge you find it by pointing out that my cousin who is married to another one of the greatness (inaudible at 0:53:16.4) daughters is also about 40 now, and he's a lawyer nor is he married. Nor is he likely to get married. [0:53:25.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I agree...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's an identifiable pattern.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The tone of my voice was one of surprise because I guess I've gotten a little bit unfamiliar with that way of thinking. It was genuine surprise that that was your conclusion. I was just being surprised, although I can see where that sounds a little silly too, but I don't share that perception. I can see it as an interaction that has happened and that it's going to be hard to break. But you're also away from mother and capable of making your own decisions doing something about your own life. [0:54:13.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's right. That's right. And I think it's highly unlikely that my cousin or either of my uncles even given the same (inaudible at 0:54:21.5) that we live in today, would've done the kinds of things I'm doing because they wouldn't have admitted to themselves those are the problems that they had. That might be a measure of speculation because after all that was 1920 and no Irish Catholic would ever conceive of going to this kind of thing. But I throw it out as a speculation that they probably wouldn't anyway because maybe the guys, and again this might be useless, but the kind of guys that have enough pride in themselves to work like hell to get through school and do well at it, and they had to overcome some obstacles because... Well I won't go into all that, but they did. And they did it. They had a certain amount of pride or something that I didn't conceive of as false pride, but they wouldn't. They had a certain amount of pride and I don't savoir faire about themselves where they wouldn't or refusing to acknowledge that things about themselves and they discontinue it. I mean after all the material, certain things in their life, they're successful and they obviously have a good deal of self control and discipline because they went through disciplined studies and that kind of thing. So maybe they would and maybe they wouldn't. I don't know. It's probably likely that they would not have given the kind of people that there were even in today's society where things are freed up. [0:55:50.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:55:50.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is idle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's very idle in terms of what are you going to make with your life, what decisions are you going make about the same issues?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's right. If I adopt if the stance that this is all genetically determined then I'm wasting my...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't sound like genetics. It sounds like psychological...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but what is it in the Wallace women that causes them to be such man haters? Maybe it is psychology. Maybe I'm being stupid about it. Maybe is it psychology and after all these women were the... [0:56:28.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's also cold.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But maybe there's something in this side of the family that causes them to be (inaudible at 0:56:37.8) energetic and a capable person and (inaudible at 0:56:44.8). But again, I couldn't adopt it as a working hypothesis and expect to get anywhere. I don't want to have the lurking around in the back of my mind. It will just be crippling any effort to be successful in the venture. [0:57:04.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We are really at the end of our time. What I go by is a 55 minute hour. Some people around here go by 50 minutes, some people go by 60, and it just becomes too difficult then to see another client right afterwards quick. So we'll go from 6:30 to 7:45 and that's it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have any questions or anything else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, same time, same station next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. No, I don't have any questions. We'll just pre-plug till next week and see what...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. [0:57:48.5]</p>

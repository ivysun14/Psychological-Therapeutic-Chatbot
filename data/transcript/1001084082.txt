<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, again no one knows who you are or who - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or who I am.  So, it's just a, it's a [INAUDIBLE].  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Happy New Year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Happy New Year.  How are you?  What did you do for New Years? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yknow, just watch the ball drop on TV.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I didn't even make it that far.  I was asleep before, uh - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll bet with the kids and everything. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So, um - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Made some resolutions, I'm, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What are you doing? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, well, I, I totally cleaned my room and organized my finances.  That was a job.  That was a throw out job.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How long did it take you to do that? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, 3 days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, when - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I reorganized my books.  And the books I don't use I put in the closet.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're a bit of a pack rat? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no just with books.  That's all I really own, um, is books.  Lots of books.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, so what did you do with the ones you don't, you aren't using?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I put them in the, I have a pretty big storage closet in my room.  And I just stacked them, like, uh, huge high risers - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> and wedged them in so they're really tight in there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And is there an organization that if you would need it or you [INAUDIBLE] you're never - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no, I know, it's all - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're never gonna need the books? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm never gonna use those books.  Good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, well that's, uh -  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, there's a next step would be to throw them out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, or sell them.  I don't - yeah I ought to sell them -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or sell them, yeah, maybe do you think anyone would buy them? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I can't even buy a bookmark it's - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's terrible.  I give it to some guy who sells books on the street.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't give him [INAUDIBLE] but [INAUDIBLE] - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, yesterday I went to the eye doctor.  I wanted to do that laser surgery.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, my cornea's too thin and, uh - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm starting to develop cataracts, so - that's all right I don't care.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So he said you're not, uh, a candidate for it? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Unless I get, uh, lens replacements with the cataracts - and he said I'm gonna [INAUDIBLE] over do that, recover.  Yknow, so - anyway I've worn glasses for years, I realized it.  It's no big deal.  Um, and what else.  Dentist, the dentist you recommended, I have an appointment with tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Which dentist is that? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, what's his name?  That you recommended it's, like, [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He's a good guy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's a good guy? </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My mouth is a mess.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 'Cause of 40 years of total neglect, it's gonna be, eh.  So, I need dentures down the road, implants.  We'll see. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And what else?  Softball, with this friend upstate, he's getting me on his plan so, I'll only pay, like, um, 20, 25 dollars a month - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, its one of the ones where you get an extra friend to sign up - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's got, like - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.  And they save all those extra minutes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, so that worked out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's awfully nice of him.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, we're, yknow, close, brothers.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so, um -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I saw you December 18th - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your mood was good, you weren't sad or anxious or irritable.  Your appetite was good, you were sleeping well, your energy was fine, your self esteem was fine, you were not suicidal.  You had some referential thinking people could read your thoughts, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's always there. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no hallucinations, no paranoia.  The trouble with that, yknow, in the context of these mild symptoms you're doing reasonably well -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> On the Seroquel and Wellbutrin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How have you been in this past month? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, good.  I go, I'm up to 400 again on the Wellbutrin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, I realize I'm gonna try 350, I realize, uh, that might be my best bet.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How are you gonna get to 350? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> To 1, 2, 1, 200 and 1, 150.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Oh I need a prescription for 200s.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right I'll give you [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so, uh, I think that's gonna do it.  That's the, um, optimum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's, that's your sweet spot? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  And, um, the way I get to sleep, I, I just exercised.  I, yknow, walk at least a mile in the park and, uh, lift some weights and that that gets me to sleep.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sorry I'm such a mess here.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that's all right.  I'm always a mess.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's that? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm always a mess. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I guess with you I, I let it all hang out.  [INAUDIBLE] for this, yknow, disorganized.  Um, let's see.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My dad has, he has this key chain, that I, I use his key chain and his, his desk at NYU was such a mess, it says, this key chain says, "Please don't straighten out my mess you'll confuse me and screw up my whole world."  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, mood is good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sleeping well? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your appetite is fine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Self esteem is okay. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You feel better about yourself now that you've organized and cleaned things up, right? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How did you get the, uh, the motivation to do it? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I, uh, the whole New Years thing I said, "I got - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, this was a New Years resolution? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  I said, "I got to get it together this year." And so, next step is, uh, computer.  That, that, um, I've been looking at all, mathematical and that software and I said, "Yeah, it's about time I join the, the 21st century.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's a nice [INAUDIBLE] - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, so - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, and I'm gonna, I think to pick up this phone I'm gonna go upstate to my friend's for 1 night and, uh, see how my mother deals with, does it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And this, this is the start of, uh, me getting, separating.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She, yeah, yeah.  I'm really, yeah, I'm motivated to do that.  There's no choice, I mean, there's no - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, but where is there anywhere else to go?   </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mm.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, uh, what might happen? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know that's what's, that's what's so interesting - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, so you, you've arranged that she could, uh, eat.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know it's like, you take it a day, yknow, that's what's so interesting about every day I wake up it's a new, it's a new frame it's a new problem.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so, yknow, I'll see, I'll see what happens.  And, um, oh this is [INAUDIBLE] - I got a Christmas card from my last case manager at the half way house.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and she said, "Think of you often."  And she's, like, 10 years younger, her marriage is on the rocks.  What does that mean?  Maybe, I think I just made an impression on everyone.  So, I'm writing a letter, a long letter, telling her, yknow, [INAUDIBLE]. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that doesn't mean she thinks of you in a romantic way, but, uh - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, I, I don't think so. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], yknow - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, not after everything she knows about me; just too much information.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She wouldn't take that long.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How old is she? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She must be a good 10 years younger than me; 45.  She would never, even if it was possible she would never.  Because I definitely know how to pull back. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, it doesn't have to stop you from trying.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's too, uh, I'm still thinking about this woman in my building.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well.  You know what it made me realize, I haven't been in love in 30 years.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've had, yknow, some one night stands and some crazy sex, yknow, during monkey love and stuff and but, um, yknow, great wild sex, yknow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Who did you have that with? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A few women I met out in California.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they were about my age.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but, I don't know if I'm capable of love, I realize that I'm just too of myself too much., yknow, and it made me reali, and I'm sad, I got sad about that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why, why wouldn't you be capable of love? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know I'm just too, yknow, me.  Me, me, me, me, me, me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Self absorbed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, self absorbed, that's it, that's it.  And, um - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the fact that you recognize it makes you less self absorbed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's the paradox, yeah.  Some of my - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How far can you really go with that? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] self reference I don't know, how far you can go with that.  I don't know.  But, um, I'm saying, so I got really ups - sad and then I said, "I'll just do math, then."  So I did the math and the blues went away and I said, "Okay, that's it."  I'm still married to the math, yknow?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So, I'm working on a Reimann Hypothesis, yknow.  I've been, I've been doing that for over a long time.  I got a, I got a lead on it.  I got a good lead on it, so - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And this is the one with the big prize? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, there were 7 of them but this is the most famous one.  It hasn't been solved in a 150 years.  It's the biggest.  It's out on every mathematician's list, wish list.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Number 1 is Reimann Hypothesis it's this, it, it, um, tells the exact distribution of prime numbers everywhere.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Everywhere? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Which is, like, prime numbers, yknow, for photography, that's every public key encryption is, is used as prime numbers.  Yknow, so they're, it's better than pseudo [INAUDIBLE]. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But, what's your insight? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> To someone who, uh, doesn't understand that either.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.  Um, um, something, um, the last 60years that's discovered by, uh, Robinson at Yale in the 60s.  They're called hyper real numbers and basically what he did, when calculus was first developed by Newton and Leibniz, they acknowledged the existence of infinitesimal or quantities that are infinitely small.  Won over - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Whatever, or a left phase the left [INAUDIBLE].  So, um, it's, incredibly powerful because you, you go beyond something called p adic metrics which are non arca, now I'm gonna lose you.  Non-archimedic metrics.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, [INAUDIBLE]. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay this is how it works in p adic.  You know usually you write a, you put a decimal point -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then you write the number and goes to, to, um, to the right -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Infinitely.  Well, with a non Archimedean valuation it's backwards.  Where the aspiatic numbers now they're using it in strength theory.  You start from the right and go to the left.  The trick is - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the decimal point is still to the right -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, there but you never reach it, because it's infinitely far off.  And that's a non- Archimedean metric.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's Archimedean's right and you there's some cut off.  So, they use a limit, yknow, and, but limits are, they're clunky so, so that's what I'm doing, so, writing my friend about it, so, but I, I thought a lot about what you said.  I got to get separated from my mom and get, yknow, I'm working on it, I don't know, yknow?  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, no, I mean, don't -  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's a, it's, it's an unknown, I don't know, uh - It's an unknown but I and I don't want -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't mean to separate from her I mean to prepare for change in her condition.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, yknow - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] to separate from her, but, uh, the condition she has doesn't stay static -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It changes.  And it changes, not for the better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so, yknow, just to have that in the back of your mind with issues such as spending down her money - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And moving her money, or finding, yknow, just looking for options if she can't be cared for at home anymore.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, money is no problem.  I don't spend money, for, yknow, it's just bed, med and bed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, no, but a nursing home would, would, uh, use up - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Everything she has.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I, I, I don't think she would, it would have to be homecare or something - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she wouldn't, she would go nuts in a nursing, they'd have to shoot her up with something, Thorazine because she'd go totally nuts.  But I don't blame her, yknow?  But, um, that, yeah I know, I'm just taking that, I've decided I'm not gonna worry about finances or the future; the prime directive is recovery.  Whatever that game is.  Like I said every day, morning I wake up it changes, yknow?  I, I get a little infinite then [INAUDIBLE] pause - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Non directive is non interference with the other culture.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, so, um, I, I infinitesimally I'm good where I'm - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're reaching your [INAUDIBLE]? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well if it's infinitesimal then it means you're not, not getting [INAUDIBLE]. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I don't know where it's going; I don't know where it's going.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you have a trajectory - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Going in the direction - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're just not going very fast. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, uh, there's no choice, you can't, you can't, it, it's, like, that, it's like, okay I can talk good, I, I sound like, um, yknow, I got it together, uh, yknow, it's a knack.  It's a mask you got to put on for everybody.  You got to wear that mask but, out, inside I'm just a mess still. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, why don't you let me rope it in a little more with meds?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we tried the, um, Zyprexa, that, that was disastrous.  And um, what, what else, what other options are there - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We could raise the dose on your Seroquel.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mm. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever been, been on much more?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I tried that and just shew - I just wake up a zombie.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Knocks you out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, really a zombie.  I'm really sensitive to that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You -  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll try it, yknow, I'll try it.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you ever have Abilify? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, eh, I mean, what's the other one? </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Geodon.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Geodon, yeah, yeah.  And Neurontin? </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, Neurontin's different.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Different?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But we're talking antipsychotic medicines that might get you a little better internally organized.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it doesn't necessarily mean I'd move faster, that's, that's the thing.  I mean, like, the computer, that's gonna be a big step.  I mean, now, I'm looking at my books on assembly language - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Writing code, compile theory, um, it's easy but it's so fucking boring.  It's just - and it's ugly, it's ugly.  It's not math the, uh, the, uh, yknow, it's the aesthetics.  And that stuff is just so ugly it's like, uh, bad, it's like bad architecture or something.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Bad art.  Um, and anyway [INAUDIBLE] - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still getting referential thoughts? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In [INAUDIBLE] things relate to you? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're a bit grandiose? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's gone, that's gone, that's out, that's gone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thank God, I don't know how, how I got rid of it but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you're not hearing anything, right? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no I don't hear things.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Any suicidal thinking? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Still, um, preoccupation with religion, mystical.  That I don't know, I think that's gonna be, that's a lifetime plan, I don't know how to get, I've been trying to get rid of that for 30 years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't - it's not gratifying to you? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It is, but it's, um, very strange.  It can be very distracting sometimes to, um, have this, these belief systems.  Reincarnation and, uh, the goal in life isn't, is, um, not loving work but to free yourself from this, that we're a stranger here. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And now we got, we got to go back to wherever it is, where it's nice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where is it? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, but I, yknow, I know it's there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's, uh, kind of, uh, bipolar not, not in this but, yknow - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Two different ways of existing.  In the one you're a mathematician - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The mathematician does not mess with things that are not - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Except Platonism.  They're - most mathematicians are Platonists.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But they don't, mo - but they don't believe in God, this is strange.  They think it's out of [INAUDIBLE] - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They believe in, uh, the platonic ideals.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That the stuff they're dealing with they're discovering.  They're not making it up, they're, it's there, they're climbing - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It exists.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Their reality.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They're on the moon, yknow, or wherever they're - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you don't believe that? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really, no.  I'm what's called, um, a constructivist and a formalist.  I think it's more like, uh, a formal game.  And the, the reason that has reference to reality is, is there's certain overlaps, coincidences and, uh, I, I'll explain - I'm not sure I can explain it. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But, well, but it makes sense to you - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That this, uh, spiritual side, that focuses on, kind of, the non physical - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Aspect of the universe -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Goes fine with the mathematical side.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, yeah.  Yeah, well, the math grounds me, yknow, in, yknow, this is western.  But then I have that, I don't know, I don't, like I said that these psychotic experiences as a teenager, they were very steeped in mysticism and all that.  And I don't know if it was part of the period of the 60s I picked up all that stuff - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or how much is, is it is the illness and how much is, yknow, just private faith?  I don't know I can't sep, I can't draw it, uh, there's no rhyme, you know what I mean?  This is har, complicated isn't it?   </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I suppose.  You mean -  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Part of you [INAUDIBLE] not to you appropriate but, your, your claim is the part of what other people point to you as illness, you claim is your own way, your own belief system.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, right, right, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, as long as it doesn't involve hearing voices - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or being especially paranoid - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't see angel, yknow, whatever.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, you're not seeing things that aren't there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why, yknow, why not see it as your idiosyncratic way of - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Appreciating reality. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's fine with me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Any [INAUDIBLE] any [INAUDIBLE] I think about it, I do the mantra and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I, yknow, it calms me down a little.  So, yknow - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, it's illness to the, to the extent that you suffer from it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mm.  Not really but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It messes you up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A little bit torn.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It interferes with your capacity to relate socially I think.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's it I think.  So I don't know where.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But some people have religions that do that, right? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  You could join a cult -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you say fuck the world, yknow? </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, you have your little family, sudden family.  And, uh, that's all that exists.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But, you don't even have that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm a, I'm a non conformist, I, I, yknow - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have your own little [INAUDIBLE] and - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  I remember in first grade I looked around and I said, "Shit, I don't like this, everybody's doing the same thing."  And, yknow, I, I just from young I said, yknow, "I don't -"</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're a, uh -  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want, I don't - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A vehement non-conformist.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't follow.  I don't follow to [INAUDIBLE].  Anyway it vilified you, [INAUDIBLE] or what do you think?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, listen, I, to be honest, I -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll give it a shot but -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, well, we have to have a target center.  We have to have a target center and it strikes me that you're not that upset about where you are.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm not, I'm not.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow, [INAUDIBLE] don't do it for me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Don't take anything for my benefit, yknow, I don't live in your skin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you're right, you're right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] we have to have a target center.  There's not target if you - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Even though other people might - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Give, yknow, give you a list of problems, if you don't have them then, then it's okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yknow, I've been in recovery 15 years.  I went to that half way house when I was 40.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I look at myself now, I don't recognize myself.  I can't believe it -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're that much better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm that much bett, I can't believe, I wake up and I say, "My God how did, this is wonderful, yknow?" </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And, yknow, it's usual for those conditions.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  And I - and I feel like what I was telling you.  I feel there's progress, I'm starting, I'm moving - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Towards more of - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If I were to give you [INAUDIBLE] level -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Adulthood, [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I, I would say that the social thing - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, in, inability, we haven't tested it - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But the inability to hold, hold on to a job - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Would, would be problematic, but, yknow, you don't, you don't need a job - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, that's it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, you usually don't want a job so who am I to tell you to get a job.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Most people are motivated by money, yknow, or love.  But I love doing math so that's not - and to me it's, yknow, it's better than money.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's certainly an alternative lifestyle -  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You've chosen.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But who, who is anyone to tell you that, uh, you that it's an inappropriate choice? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you got to, nobody else is gonna make you happy.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nobody else is gonna - if you're reasonably sane and rational nobody else can tell you how to play the game.  I mean, they can give you advice, they can make you step aback, make, take a step outside yourself, but, yknow, when you wake up in the morning, you got, you know what you got to do and the at the end of the day you know what might come through.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow? </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, I agree with you, your mood is back in shape -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not especially, um, dysfunctional - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or with serious symptoms.  And the real challenge you have is, is this issue with your mother and her illness -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And her need for you to take care of her, and yknow, and - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm [INAUDIBLE] -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Looks like you'll, you'll face that challenge -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> As it evolves.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm getting a cell phone, I'm gonna getting more connected with this friend, uh, upstate and I'm gonna take a trip to New Haven and see all my old buddies there and, uh - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When are you going to New Haven? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In the spring, yknow, and, um, I guess I had made an impression on everybody there, that's - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Especially the social worker.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess so, yknow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, don't take advice from me, but what do you have to lose?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, right, right, nothing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Give her a call and go to, go for a cup of coffee with her.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow, not as a romantic thing but - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just to - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's not an option.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, I mean, if she's interested you'll, you'll pick up a vibe.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, the sex, it's not the sex thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is she good looking? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's good looking, nice Italian girl.  It's not the sex thing, it's the intimacy, touching and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Being with someone of the opposite sex.  I don't care about the sex, at my age forget it.  Yknow, I've had enough of that, yknow, wild sex, yknow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Tired of it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  There's something deeper as you know there's something - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Much deeper with love, intimacy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Companion, yknow, dialogue.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, so, uh, my, my, um, I think you should respond to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you had a good relationship with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it seems to me you're doing fine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think so, too.  I, I don't know where I'm going, but I, I feel like I've come a long way, yknow, and, um, recovered.  As far as my mom, I, yknow, kind of, still get separated, like, sad.  If I get to see her, she spends most of her time in bed and she's gone, yknow, it's, it's just, I'm starting to get distance from her.  So, it goes on, yknow.  So, I hope she's got time, but - So, how are you doing?  No complaints. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, how are you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, good.  New job's working well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] it was stressful because it's, because of my attention deficient, three, 3 schools.  So I'm constantly—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Three schools?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I have [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's where I went to elementary school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did you?  Me too.  Yeah, that's my school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm there 3 days and then [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I hear it's changed a lot since I was there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [DEIDENTIFIED] I do pretty well because I'm there 3 days, but [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED], when you're at one Monday, one Friday, I'm leaving, you know, I don't leave my Q test and laptop, but it's like my jacket or my lunch—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or my planner.  I mean I just have so much stuff—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To carry around those 2 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That now I have to alert the secretaries.  Now everybody is like okay, where'd you put your stuff, and there's no really room for me, room to go to, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I test in one room and then I carry my, and so it's, it's still disjointed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But really other than that, it's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm waking up early.  I have to be at work, I have to be at [DEIDENTIFIED] at 7:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ooh, and did you get a house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We did.  We bought a house.  You probably want to change my address on your folder.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Yeah, what's the new address?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, is it going to be on the tape?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, uh, you want me to turn it off for a minute?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I'll turn this off while she gives me her address.  Okay, it's back on.  Yeah, we had some friends that moved down there in that neighborhood.  So, that's nice, that's very nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they can walk to school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When they get back into [DEIDENTIFIED] and they, um, all their friends are there from school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's, which school are they at now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, right now, they're at 3 different ones.  We were lucky—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To get back in to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But [DEIDENTIFIED] with the mold thing, then they're going to move to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh they are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, for like $1 a year or something, they're leasing that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Land, and my husband got the assistant principal job back there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Can you believe this?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's amazing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Isn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They hadn't hired someone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it came up, a new job came up because of the mold problem at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The [DEIDENTIFIED] campus had to be disbursed to, kindergarten is at [DEIDENTIFIED], first and second [DEIDENTIFIED].  Third is at [DEIDENTIFIED] and fourth, fifth, and sixth is at discovery.  So I have one at [DEIDENTIFIED] and one at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And one somewhere else, [DEIDENTIFIED], but because [NAME OTHER] now, and so they didn't have, have the job when we first got here, but the job opened up because it was too much on the administration to go to all these places.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's a one year position, but the president is already like oh, we're going to keep him.  We're going to keep him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He'll [INAUDIBLE] in one, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so, and the great thing is he works at [DEIDENTIFIED] and he, all the kids get on a bus and then they come back to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So nobody's driving around.  The first month it was good because [NAME OTHER] was off, so he took them places.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Got them settled in and then one of my kids [NAME OTHER] is with 2 days a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, we're hoping and praying that they get back to [DEIDENTIFIED], but even if they don't, then they'll all be at the other campus together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then junior high through high school is when for sure that, it's a K—12, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Where will they go, which one will they do after elementary, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].  No—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, [DEIDENTIFIED] is only, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	K through 6, but the [DEIDENTIFIED] is going to do, house, house an elementary and then do, um, the high school home school program.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where kids can be home schooled and come out with an, a degree.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  That's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  That's a huge, huge thing, but it's really great.  I guess, yeah, community colleges are really under funded in this area.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what I hear.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's kind of a win win.  So yeah, so he's loving life, working right back to where he was, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he's happy.  You got back in with a good job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we got a house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The kids are happy to be back around friends again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Moved in a week.  Yeah, so we're just moving and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Getting, getting stuff and our realtor was, her present to us was, um, the same gal that staged our house to sell it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She hired her for a few hours to come and tell us where to hang our pictures in our house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it was really nice.  Yeah, so I get to go home today and she and [NAME OTHER] because they have fall break.  They have the week off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So they get to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does it feel okay to be back then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And being settled?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  You're not going through the struggles like before.  Good.  Well, you know, maybe you just needed to, you know, sometimes we don't know until we try something, you know, and maybe you just needed to try going back to see what it felt like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  Someone was saying, you know, if the Israelites had had a chance to go back to Egypt, then they wouldn't haven't complained anymore.  Yeah, it did knock it out of my system because I think I would have wondered.  I was counting down the days until my kindergartener will graduate from high school.  So I mean that was just terrible, and now I went back there, and it's like okay, well.  I mean there are a lot of things—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They would have gotten, we have gotten our kids into a private school, Christian school for free, $21,000 a year paid.  [NAME OTHER] has offered to be a consultant.  So it wasn't, it wasn't bad—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And good, it was just good and best.  So, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it wasn't really black and white, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And our marriage is just doing great.  We're back with our home group.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're probably going to change, um, churches, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which church are you thinking about moving to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it's so close, and because our kids are so connected with the kids, and even though I like it up here.  Our home group is still going to be through [DEIDENTIFIED] because they're the same people that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and it just makes such a big different to just live and work and be in the same community because our kids friends' parents are basically my friends whether I like it or not and I just don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Have enough emotionally energy to have friends at [DEIDENTIFIED], my kids' friends and my friends at the [DEIDENTIFIED].  I mean it just, it's like, so it kind of consolidates.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's smart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My friends are going to be in this general area.  I mean I still have a lot of friends, but you can only, when you work full time, it's just hard, you know, to do this woman's group and that woman's group and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they have really strong, uh, missions—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Program, and the pastor, pastor's son and my son play baseball together.  He was one of the coaches.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I know him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I know the choir director.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It just works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it just, it's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We haven't really started though, we're still sort of, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you're still settling.  It's going to take you a while, unpacking and hanging pictures and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got to get your home settled first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It feels so good, the little things just like sleeping in our bed, I mean it's just amazing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So your mood's been good then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just been a soft landing.  We can't believe it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How soft it's been, how hard my little, my [NAME OTHER] the one with the learning disability woke up first night in the house and says oh, I feel like I've lived here for 10 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's really nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's nice because usually it feels like a hotel for a few months usually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, they haven't seen their stuff in so long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So are you sleeping well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, good.  How much sleep do you think you're getting at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I don't know, 7 and a half to 8—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like a lot more on the weekend because I like to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  And appetite's stable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Energy level's pretty good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, those, these 3 story houses, I don't know who dreamed those up.  I mean it's up and down.  Do you have one of those too?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, we have a 2 story, just the main and the basement.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got a lot of stairs, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and they're real narrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So they're up and down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the eye doctor, the other thing I was going to tell you about was the Lamictal, my eyes have gotten twice as bad in 1 year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So the eye doctor said well, you might want to talk to your, um, one of the side effects of Lamictal is the vision.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They think that's what it is, the Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, they don't know.  They just said to ask, but they were going to do those Prescriptives, and I'm like are you kidding me up and down stairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like those, those invisible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The lineless bifocals?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I kind of almost need those, but I can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they're tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's amazing, I got glasses last week.  I mean the optometrist was like I can't even believe you've been driving.  I mean it was really bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I got the glasses and all of a sudden the trees had leaves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hey, that's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I could see people.  I could read street signs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hey.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have the, I have the little, um, what's it called, I can't remember, my little Garmin that says turn left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, GPS thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My GPS, but without that, I wouldn't be able to, I wouldn't have been able to find anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Even my jobs.  I don't even know where my schools are—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Without the GPS.  I mean now that I can see, I can read the street signs, but up until now, I've been like turn left.  It's like I have no idea, turn right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And sometimes it takes me down like one way streets.  It's like oh no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  Well, you know, I've never heard it being that much of an issue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I guess is our option is do we want to, do we want to consider switching to something else, or do you want to hang in there with it for a while and see how things go.  What's your feeling about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well we talked a bit before about maybe changing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's an option.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm pretty hit and miss with the Wellbutrin.  The Wellbutrin is what I'm out of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think because I don't have a bottle of it and it's just kind of in little cases, I, I take it really intermittently.  I'm good about the Zoloft, but if I don't take the Zoloft, I mean in the move I know there were a couple of days where it was like oh, I haven't taken it yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But when I take it, there's sort of, of, I don't know, kind of a numb, kind of a numbness feeling like when I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With the Zoloft?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, when I take the Zoloft and Lamictal.  Like if I forget to take it, and then I take it late—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just feels like all of a sudden it's like, you know, everything kind of gets a little—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Disoriented.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you said the Wellbutrin you have not been taking consistently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do you notice any difference when you don't take it consistently in terms of mood or focus?  Not really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not, not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So maybe you don't need it then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because my focus is, that's always my weak point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so one of the things we can think about is do we want to try getting you off of it.  It'd be one less medicine to take.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I can't really tell because I don't really ever go off of it.  I probably take it like 4 times a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what that means though is you're only getting about half a dose, and you're already on such a low amount.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That it's really not doing anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's probably not doing much of anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, how about your sex drive?  Has it been okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fine, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay because I think that was one of the reasons—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean that was probably, oh, and I, I guess I'm taking 100 Zoloft.  Is that what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Just one 100 a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I do a little more when I have my period, and like, uh, I feel, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it's hard to know.  I mean I would never like not take the medication, but it just does seem that, like I've been on this since 2004, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I don't know.  Is that kind of typical to stay on something as long?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, and a lot of times if we can find ones that work, people could stay on them for years and years and never change.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If, if they're working well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if they're, you know, if you're doing really well and don't need as much, we can always try to back off and find the least amount that works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  If I could cut down on the Zoloft, that would be good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry, if you could cut back you said more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It'll be good, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We could look at cutting back the Zoloft.  We could try to eliminate the Wellbutrin and see if you need it at all.  We could consider switching Lamictal to some other mood stabilizer, um, and the Xanax, do you use that much at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you remember when the last time you took one was even?  It's been weeks or months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it was during the move.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just for those like really difficult times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't feel, I mean only a couple of things that really go wrong are sometimes that disassociation—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where, and I've had it for years, but I mean sometimes I really have to concentrate because I don't feel like I'm a person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I have that like, I'm not, that disconnect, like see myself in a mirror—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm doing something and all of a sudden it like, like no connection with who I am, like at all, like I'm some complete stranger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how long does that last for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like a few seconds or minutes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, a few seconds, but it's, but it's always such an odd like, okay, bring me back.  Okay, this is, you are a person, but I've had even since a child I know I would have mirror as a young kid and not recognize who I was or just, it was like, well it's not like not recognizing me, I know who I am, but like somehow like I'm not really a person.  I'm not connected to who I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't feel attached to that person—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You see in the mirror?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or just like I'm going along and I ask, will ask myself well how come all these people feel like they're people.  I just, it's like I'm, it's like outside of my body.  I'm looking back at myself, but I'm not in myself.  So that's, and that's always been kind of bothering, and bothersome, and it comes and goes, but it is really a challenge to think that I'm actually a person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  Well, I mean there are some medicines that help reduce disassociation a little bit that we can consider switching to instead of Lamictal that are also mood stabilizers.  So I mean that's an option.  I'm just thinking there's several different directions we can go here, and I want to be careful not to rock the boat too much because you're doing so well too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and isn't that partly like a, the, it's not so much medication, but that's partly just been, you know, 40 years with a background of incest in the background.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Suicide and the background of all that that's been so disconnected, I'm not sure a medicine is what would help that.  It's more just, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Trauma.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [NAME OTHER] just keeps saying, you know, it's okay not to get freaked out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, you read the DSM [INAUDIBLE] and it's oh, great, you know, but to just be like it's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean disassociation—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To some degree is normal, and it's just intensified when we're, when you go through trauma, and then sometimes we learn that to cope, and then sometimes it starts happening sort of spontaneously.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it doesn't happen all the time, but it's hard to talk to people about it because my husband's like what?  I mean most people it's like they don't ever have that feeling like, because I'll be at work and all of a sudden it's like yeah, I'm a person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, like I just don't know who this person is or who this body is or just it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like foreign, completely foreign.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I kick in and I say oh yeah, I'm a person.  This is my name.  I live here.  I was born here.  I mean just that, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Well, so I guess the question is, is it anything we can do anything about medicinally or not, and again, there are some medicines that can decrease it a little bit, but I don't think it's something we have to like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Worry about it.  As long as it's not causing you any real problems or is too distressing to you.  It'll probably get better over time, and partly it's the stress level, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Decreases too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'll probably trigger less disassociation I'm guessing too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, so the first question I guess to ask is do you want to make any changes right now, or do you want to just let things ride for a month or two until you kind of get settled in the new house, the new job and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then maybe slowly kind of do some fine—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tuning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Look at.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want, do you want to maybe leave things—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For a little while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I'm doing really well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, that's my, you're doing so well, I'd hate to mess with things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I think, I think we can—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably reduce the medications and maybe even change some if we need to down the road, but let's, let's give you a little time just to kind of get settled.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you got a lot of new things you're tackling right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Well, and I like, well the Zoloft is an issue because of the sex drive.  I mean it's okay, but I mean it's, you know, it's not as, maybe it's because I'm getting older, but it's not as good—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As it should be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's probably the Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then, um, the Wellbutrin is supposed to be like the good thing to curb your appetite, and so I'd like to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A little.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does, people don't normally lose weight on Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean the one that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's supposed to be the happy pill, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's supposed to help with moods.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really one of the, uh, the only thing that typically helps with weight loss is Topamax, and we already tried that one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.  Yeah, Topamax, Ambien, and too much Wellbutrin just put me over the edge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two hundred Wellbutrin just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Was a nightmare, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so we got to be careful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've tried some different things—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Over the years.  So it's not like I haven't tried different things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  The things we haven't tried, well I haven't tried.  Let me look back and see if anybody did, for like mood stabilization that might help with the disassociation, something like Abilify.  Have you ever tried Abilify?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't, I don't think you have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.  I don't know.  I  remember buying it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, it's, that's something I, going back to my notes—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what about like a Lexapro or something [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lexapro's a good one.  Oh, yeah, we did try the Abilify way back.  Well, I have that I wrote a prescription on the [DATE] and then stopped the 1st.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know if you tried one dose or if we just didn't try it, but Lexapro is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That wasn't good.  That was not good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's really drastic.  That's why I don't like to mess with the Lamictal because there really aren't any side effects.  The vision could be just age.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It could be.  Yes, it certainly could be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stress.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Lexapro you asked about, you know, it, it's a good one.  For some people, it does cause less sexual dysfunction than Zoloft, fewer side effects in general than Zoloft.  So it's a good one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's one we could at some point consider trying if you want.  It's usually a 10 mg dose instead of 100 of Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, it's, it's the most widely used antidepressant now because it's so well tolerated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Is that like Celexa too?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, it's related to Celexa, but it's a little different.  It has fewer side effects.  It's a little more effective and typically people do—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most people do better with Lexapro that Celexa.  Not everybody, but most people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Zoloft is really hard to go off, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I've had any trouble getting people off of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if I don't take it, I feel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I think if you were to stop it cold turkey, it would be, but if we taper it or transition and overlap—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And put you on Lexapro when you're getting off Zoloft, there shouldn't be a problem at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we could maybe look at that down the road a little bit, do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's the same thing, I mean Zoloft and Lexapro?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're not the same.  They're in the same family called SSRIs, but they're chemically different, and they work a little differently, but they work similarly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They both increase serotonin.  Lexapro is actually more, um, effective at increasing serotonin even than Zoloft, and it's cleaner because these medicines all increase serotonin, but they increase other chemicals too, but Lexapro is the most specific for serotonin of all the SSRIs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's probably why people get fewer side effects with it.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, and I got better insurance.  So before I was thinking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.  Who's your insurance through now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, I didn't, it's called MedCo.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	MedCo, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's, who's the health insurance through, do you know?  Is it, is it still Kaiser or is it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you have Medical Network now, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Medical Network, and you're still on that list.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm in their network, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know how much you cost, but I know their drug benefits are—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And their monthly is less, about $200 less a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I think it's the same coverage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Did you bring your card, do you have a card yet?  If you do, I was going to make a copy and give it to [NAME OTHER].  If not, I'll let her know at least.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I was under that, oh, I guess I didn't come last time because, that's right, because I have such a problem getting it.  They wouldn't give me the medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, geez.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Finally.  So, finally it worked out finally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  It had to be a nightmare switching especially trying to get your prescriptions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  But yeah, so everything is, um, that's the prescription.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that your MedCo or you're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's MedCo for prescriptions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Would I have another one?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think so.  Well, because I haven't seen one like this.  This could be, no, yeah, this says prescription benefit card.  I think probably—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's different than the actual.  I just remember getting that one, but maybe I have another one.  Um, yeah, so we've been, why do I have Blue Shield?  Boy, that's a really old, that was a really long time ago.  So I don't know.  It seems like that's all they gave me at this point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe, I could make a copy of it just to make sure.  It has an ID number on it.  I think this is for—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your prescription, but at least it'll give [NAME OTHER] some information maybe so if she has other questions, she could just call I guess.  I'll be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so something is better than nothing, huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE]  ID number.  It might be on this card.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well she can't find it under social.  That was the problem.  They kept looking under my social.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And just they don't, this whole place doesn't work off social.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, a lot of them don't anymore because of confidentiality.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, yeah, so things are going really well, and then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess the only other thing is just I continue to, you know, perseverate about, uh, [NAME OTHER], you know, the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Therapist that I used to have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that getting better with time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, yeah, but I just wanted to talk to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, you know, all I really wanted to do was just say, you know, he always used to say, you know, how great things would be if you were ever functioning on all 4 cylinders right before [INAUDIBLE] how many cylinders people have, but, you know, but he used to always say that, and, um, so I really just want to tell him, hey, I, I talked to him before we moved.  I want to tell him hey, we're not moving back, and this is what's happened and I'm doing really well, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just really kind of wanted to have that, I guess kind of closure in a sense of saying, you know, I'm doing well, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He just doesn't call me back.  I've called him 3 times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's so painful because when you do psychoanalytic with somebody, it's so intense and so, I don't know, just so deep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's I'm around and I care about you and it's just been so painful to call him 3 or 4 times and just to not have him call back.  And so I do kind of obsess about that.  I mean I think about it, I think about it every day, I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think about it.  I'm like darned it, why doesn't he call me and I want to call him again, and it's like oh, you know, if somebody doesn't call you 4 times, after 4 calls—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like oh well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when you called him, did you him a message explaining you're out here now and doing well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, no, I guess I haven't said that.  I just more said, you know, uh, good things happening.  I really want to talk to you.  I want to tell you about that.  Please call me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, because I don't know, but I'm thinking maybe perhaps if you let him know that you're really just wanting to have some closure with him—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Perhaps he would call back because it would be good for you to have some closure I think so you could kind of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Close that chapter and move on to the next one in your life because that's kind of what you're doing in your life anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, and I'm so glad that we didn't stay in [DEIDENTIFIED] just because I missed him and missed him and missed him and wanted to go back to him, and now could you imagine if I went back there and expected to see him and he never answered a call.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that would not be good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean that would just be devastating—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For me.  I mean at least this way I don't expect him to see me, and I talked to [NAME OTHER].  I haven't been down to see her just because of the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have not see her yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you planning to or do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, um, she does not take my insurance though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which I guess is typical, but, um, anyway, [INAUDIBLE], but, um, yeah.  So it's just a matter of, you know, I mean to be honest, I'm kind of waiting until after the election because she's such [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm going to get the whole, oh, and I mean that's fine.  I mean I'm not like going to [INAUDIBLE] them, but I just don't want to hear the whole rant and rave, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's like [INAUDIBLE].  Everybody I'm around is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where I work anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I got new glasses, and everybody's like oh, so you look like Sarah Palin.  I'm like what.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did I go out and get glasses, no, I didn't actually, go out and look and say could I please have the Sarah Palin glasses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Oh, you're starting to get your sense of humor.  I mean, it feels like you're in a really good place, probably in as good—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A place since I've known you, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well actually, um, I think I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean that's pretty amazing.  I don't think I've ever been happier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I know when I first met [NAME OTHER] she's like, you know, talk about a time you were happy, and I guess I was happy when I lived out in Uganda for a few months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A couple of months when I doing mission work with World Vision.  So that was kind of a high time, but it was short lived and I remember it didn't end well when we came back and were debriefed, a bunch of things went haywire and so, but it was good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it was the novelty, but I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now it's, it's good and it's reality.  I mean it's just your, I mean I still, still the stress of life of getting kids everywhere and laundry and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not like oh, everything's just magically perfect.  I was at Women of Faith and I told my pastor's wife it was the best time of my life, and she looked at me and said keep taking your medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not like, it's not like mania, like if you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], you know.  She just like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was she serious or was she joking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think she was serious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, you know, because she just didn't want to hear me go, you know, hooray, I'm amazing and everything, but I don't tend to have that kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I don't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if anything, it's more hypo—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, but I usually don't go bezerk with mania—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I think she was afraid that I was going to, you know, start writing a book, or you know, do something or.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I think you're just in a good place.  I think you kind of, I mean there's a joy and happiness that comes from being at peace with we're at in life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it feels like you're at peace with where you're at.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just can't believe it.  I wake up just really happy to be alive, and happy to go to work—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just things are good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] and I are getting along very, we shared in our home group and that was really good because we hadn't shared very much in our group.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everybody knew that we were going back, recognizing that if our marriage fell apart, we would be near family.  I mean that was really the bottom line—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Reason.  I don't know if we told everybody that, but we were going to get, if we got divorced, we needed to be near family.  I mean that was the bottom line.  [NAME OTHER] said I will never move anywhere with you again as long as we live.  It'll be divorce.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then, because I told them, I was saying it at home group, and he was like oh yeah, I said that, didn't I?  I was like we just moved back here.  [LAUGHING].  Hmm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, this sounds like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Things have gotten so good that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was the right thing to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I actually was the one that initiated to move back.  I was the one who said I'm doing a u turn.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we came back without any jobs too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, that's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I had a good idea the [DEIDENTIFIED] was going to hire me because they had just had a good psyche leave and they needed someone bilingual.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I knew that 2 weeks, or a week into school, they weren't really going to have an easy time finding a bilingual school psyche.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you, you speak Spanish some?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean just with some kids—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But a lot and it's just, it's just a better fit for me, the [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't have the lawyers coming in and I don't have it.  You know, it's a little funny though because [NAME OTHER] I said, actually we both talked to each other.  We can't like go around and tell people how great we're doing because, you know, we should be [INAUDIBLE] because the economy's horrible and everybody's doing bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and he was like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Be careful, be careful who you say that to, you know, but where I work in [DEIDENTIFIED] I mean already, I mean I even noticed I'm overdressed compared to the people that I'm around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, you know, I can't really talk about the, you know, the house is, you know, gorgeous.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean for my standard, it's gorgeous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was built in 1999 and 3,600 square feet.  Yeah, it's gorgeous.  You look out the front window and you have the Air Force Academy.  We're probably going to be able to see the flyovers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then you walk to the park.  So yeah, it's gorgeous, but you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Perfect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I still can't really show that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a different culture and, you know, he said you don't want to, it's so funny that I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life, and it was oh you don't want to appear too happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Well I think it's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	After all this time of being miserable, people would have loved to have heard me be happy and I'm happy.  He was like well you got to like push that down a little bit because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, you can't be happy in the current climate of the world.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think there's anything wrong, and people need some happiness, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not get too fed up in it, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  Yeah, this whole thing has been so bizarre, this economy thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean it's, there are always ups and downs in life too, but if people can learn to ride the waves and not get the better of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, well let's do this then.  Let's not mess with anything, okay.  Let's leave—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Them just the way they are for, you know, again—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Another month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At least a month or so and then we can reassess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if you're doing well, we'll things alone.  If you're ready to start changing, we will and we'll, we can look at—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, backing off on some of the antidepressants possibly.  We can look at if you want to switch from Lamictal and trying something else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, the main thing I probably would keep the Lamictal to do something like Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That would, that'd be my suggestion because I'd hate to mess with it.  It's worked so well for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we can try [INAUDIBLE] Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if I miss a day, it is just miserable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean so I still feel that like if I don't take it, or if I take it late—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just was kind of like a head, not a headache, but just like a head swirl or, you know, it's like uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My brain kind of goes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a weird feeling if I don't take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've heard that from other people too, so you're not alone in that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I just, I have to take it.  If I don't take it, it's, you know, it's just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, but it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really, I don't know that I feel instantly depressed, but I just feel instantly agitated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Well, let's just not mess with it then.  So, but let's check back in about a month.  Do you want to, um, you want to do something—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The girl will have to let me know what the actual cost—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is for you because I don't really know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, yeah, she won't know probably until she bills.  Then she'll find out and let you know.  Do you want to do something around [DATE] or is there a day of the week that works best for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I think my family's coming in the [DATE], so if we could do it after.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	After the [DATE].  Okay, and how long will they be here for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably 3 or 4 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The [DATE] I think—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you want to do something, we could do the [DATE], which is a Wednesday, or the [DATE] or [DATE], a Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, Tuesday and Wednesdays I can't because I have those, I have meetings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You want to do a Friday—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And Friday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The [DATE]?  The next week after that is Thanksgiving.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to be out of the office that week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right.  What about, and you don't have anything on a Monday?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't.  Not that week.  Um, I don't, unfortunately or Thursday unfortunately.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've so far down on Fridays, it's hard to leave.  I'm way down at [DEIDENTIFIED] do you know where that is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't remember where it is anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	By a golf course, way down by [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, down by, yeah, it's down by [DEIDENTIFIED] I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's really hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's like a 45 minute drive probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then you got traffic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't like Fridays.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, so Tuesdays no, and so just tell me, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you said Tuesdays and Wednesdays don't work?  We could do Thursday the, when's your family coming in?  We could do Thursday the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah, I think they'll be here, but that's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, or, or Wednesday the [DATE] if that's better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh but Wednesdays don't work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Thursday maybe at, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, like 4:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can do 4:00 or 4:30, whichever you prefer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to do 4:00?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and that way I could get back to my family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thursdays are really the only days I can get out of there.  I mean you're supposed to work 7:30 to 3:00 [INAUDIBLE] so early at 3:00, but then they tack on all these extra meeting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well [DEIDENTIFIED] is so funny.  They pay you for everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They pay you for all those extra hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because [DEIDENTIFIED] never did that.  They just assumed you'd stay late.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Excuse me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But 7:00 in the morning is so great, there's no traffic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I live down there, and it takes me 20 minutes—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To get to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's not bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nobody's on the road.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So if you need anything before then, just call me, but hopefully things will keep going well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm glad you're happy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Me too.  Yeah.  That's good.  The only people that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, don't forget your coat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] the only person that's mad is my sister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, for moving out there?</p>

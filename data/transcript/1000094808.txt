<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>JOSEPHINE - Jennifer - 2-22</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you sound a lot better like the congestion's kind of cleared up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know last night it was, actually it was really bad last night. Like early morning, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this morning. I did go for my walk though - it was so funny that, Jean was talking about that last night because I was really exhausted. I can kind of go in back and forth because my past is so much push through, push through, push through. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I finally have this really healthy relationship with my body when it came to physical activity, and I think I've really been good about - I've really just been kind to myself the past couple years. I also have to watch the voices in the head because it wants to really take advantage of these kind of moments, you know? Or when I'm traveling or whatever, when I know without a doubt that you know no matter what I can at least go for a walk and I just - my mind feels better. You know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so the chatter, do you think is coming from addiction parts or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's more - I think it's, yeah, it's more like well, you know, you should be doing this. Or you know - it's more - I don't know how to explain it. But it's more like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it trying to set you up to not exercise or set you up  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To not. And then it's got you vulnerable to feel bad when you don't do it, is that what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I - I can usually talk myself through it but I've noticed, I mean I'm very aware that that's there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it doesn't happen very often but I know too, when I start comparing, you know. that that is a big red flag for me. Because when I finally ask myself okay, what really is it? And it's like oh, it's you don't want to run or do something really active and hard and now you're feeling guilty because you know ultimately that helps you lose weight. You know what I mean like it's always triggering body image stuff. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's when I usually, as soon as I make that connection you know, I just go for a walk. You know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just healthy transition from the mindset I was used to. And I think that was one of those things, you know people say they're struck abstinent or whatever. I was struck abstinent from exercise absue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - from where I couldn't do it anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I had to do my PFT and when I was running and I was working with a nutritionist and she just said, your adrenals are so bad you cannot do anything. And when I was running my 3 mile run that day I was at this beautiful lake and I was by myself  and I just was so grateful that I was running and that I had 2 legs. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you know it didn't matter anymore. It didn't matter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I got it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was like I just - I got it. And from that point on I never - I don't think I abused my body with exercise. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it felt good. You know? 
 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know when I went for a walk and was in the fresh air. I knew it was going to make me feel good. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I ask a question about, I know you used an acronym, PFT or something? What  - ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: PFT, I'm sorry it was our Performance Fitness Test. It was our required Performance Fitness Test.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay, P-F-T. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Performance Fitness Test.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Performance Fitness Test. It's just a required fitness evaluation that we do every, twice a year in the military.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That you're required to take.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: And the funny thing is - I'm sorry, go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was going to say when you were in that phase and you found out your adrenals were bottomed out or blown out, is that when you started taking better care of yourself?  Kind of like, struck sober from the exercise abuse? Is that what you meant?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was more of in a place of acceptance I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I got back from Indonesia, I had already been seeing a counselor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we were working on some family stuff because I wasn't sleeping at night. And this all kind of led to the acceptance of - and I was well aware of having this eating disorder. But I hadn't found someone who really knew what to do with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet it was kind of like they could fix all the other things. Like I did have you know menstrual problems and I did have - I was having like cystic acne as a result of the hormones. I had never had acne before. I was - my adrenals were burned out. So there were a lot of  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - a lot of symptoms from my eating disorder. But they were trying to fix all those. You know? And then the main culprit, I was still active in the eating disorder. So I think when I came back I had this intent in my mind that I was going to figure it out, I was going to get help. This was not going to be my life forever. And so I kind of started this search when I got - I ended up randomly running into this naturalpathic doctor who specialized in women's hormonal problems. And lo and behold he had a real background in recovery. And his nutritionist said, they were the ones who saw the adrenals were burned out, I really want you to work with a nutritionist when you get home. I think she was trying to get me to a of realizing how sick I was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And by trying to follow this menu plan I would say, it wasn't even like a diet. I mean looking back, and even at the time I knew it was very balanced and very healthy and she was just trying to get me better. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That was where I really realized how full-fledged my disease was, because I couldn't follow it. It wasn't - there was nothing I could do even knowing that my adrenals were as bad as they were. But she explained to me that I was only going to be allowed to walk for 20 minutes 3 times a week. And you're talking to an excessive exerciser.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was like, what? But at the same time I was so sick that I was at the point where I couldn't do it anymore. I didn't want to do it. I just wanted to stay in my bed. And that was the first time in my life I didn't want to exercise. Because a lot of times I did exercise to stuff emotions. But a lot of it too, was mentally, because  I knew it really took away stress and I always felt better afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So there was kind of like that love/hate thing with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know when I could detach the body image of it I could always do it in a healthy proportion. And it was a place of love. When there was a body image thing attached to it, it was never a healthy experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I think when I had to do that with her and then for 2 months just do what she said... you cannot run until the day you take your test, because you're not going to have enough energy. And that came in when I did take the test and I got to finish it and I did - the funny thing was I did well. Like I mean there are people that trained to run what I ran that day, you know? And that's when it really occurred to me that it doesn't matter. Like it doesn't - my health is the most important thing I have. And then  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - lo and behold about 6 weeks later is when I found the doors of recovery so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that was what, 2 years ago? Or about 2 years ago, a little over 2 years ago?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, 2 years ago now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it was February, was the first time I went to meeting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. Good deal. So with the congestion kind of clearing up did it make sense last night when we talked about it being some grief stuff?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hit home. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It totally does. Yeah because it's all intertwined. But I think because of this and what we talked about it's shown me, you know, how intricately we are of body, mind and spirit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and it all, it all ties together. And if I choose, you know sometimes my willingness and my commitment whether it comes from a place of love and compassion or it comes from a place of, I don't want to feel like I used to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's still ultimately going to affect my physical body, if I do the right thing for my physical body my spirit is going to prosper, and my heart, from it. And if I take care of my spirit and my heart and my physical body is going to prosper.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What happens usually for us Jennifer though is, what we thought was taking care of our body, which was the - what did you say, running for X number of you know miles every day?. Wasn't true self care.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know sometimes at the time we don't know the addiction is lying to us and telling us that's the best thing for our body. You know instead of going by that athlete's mentality of the 80/20 rule, the addiction tries to say 100 percent healthy eating, 100 percent exercising. You know? So once we kind of get that a little bit of a perspective about moderation and balance, moderate living, balanced living, then kind of like you said if we're taking that kind of loving care of our body, that then works with the mind and the spirit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Yeah because I could never understand why it wouldn't all come together. And then I think it got even more frustrating because people, they saw me in this different light, you know? But I knew the reality, I think it was because I was failing every day because I trying for 100 percent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I just, and I thought some people just could do it and I just think there were people that were functioning at 100 percent all the time. And I just didn't have the secret.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: E everybody thought I was so together but in reality, there was that sort of shame came even harder and heavier, you know? When  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's what happened that day when I was running is that I realized how ungrateful and selfish I was and how at that moment how grateful I was. And that it didn't matter. And that you know I was going to just be grateful. And the funny thing was after that my body started getting healthier and healthier and healthier and  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The funny thing is that my run times now and I enjoy doing those fitness test. You know I just - there's still a little butterflies because whenever you're getting tested on something  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - there's sort of butterflies. But it's an enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You articulated kind of the old belief there with the 100 percent I'm failing but I should try at 100 percent, I'm failing. Do you know now that you could articulate your new kind of balance truth?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think the truth is that 75 to 80 percent of the time I am on target. And the times I'm not, have nothing to do with failure or not being good enough. So I think the new belief would just be I'm not perfect. I'm a human being. I'm an imperfect human being trying to  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There aren't any other kind, might I add. There are only imperfect human beings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think that's it - I say that a lot to myself. I'm living today as an imperfect Jennifer. I joke with people about mistakes, I often say, " I give myself ten mistakes in the morning."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughing) That's great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I'm not surprised when I make a mistake. And I don't spend a whole lot of time shaming myself. Instead I'm like wow, I hope I don't do that next time. Or how can I fix this or how can I make this better?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or - and I think incorporating that into different areas of my life like work and social settings. I think it has helped me do it more when it comes to my body too. You know?  But I still need to just accept right where I'm at right now. Because I've heard some chatter lately about meal sizes, you know? And so I've been - like the other day I called Tricia and I think a lot of it too is from eating out or being in this transient state, you know? And I think you and I talked about that a lot last week. But the chatter has kind of been like well, gosh, maybe your meals are too big, maybe you're not being very honest. And I just kind of  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you challenged that and got a reality check by calling the gal in the group and checked it with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And that's what I've been doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just take total acceptance of my body where it's at. And I think in my mind, I think of the places where I've been the most serene and surrendered with the food.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm..</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had just come back from the Middle East and had kind of like - could take a breath. You know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think I had a lot of hope. And then I got my orders to leave again. And then all of a sudden it felt like a diet and it felt like more pressure and how am I going to do this forever? And it wasn't surrendered. But before that time that I felt real surrendered to my choices and just kind of taking it as it comes I remember that total freeness of knowing my clothes were going to fit and, you know, like the closet was going to fit. And it didn't really matter. And my bowel movements were starting to become regular. And exercise really came from just activity. You know? Like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me ask you, compared to how your body was coming into balance at that point and kind of how your body's coming into balance now, are they similar?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In other words is your sleep as good as it was then? Is your digestion and bowel movements as good as it was then? Or are your energy levels as good as it was then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but then again it's like I feel like I'm basing it on such a short period of time. You know it was like eight weeks in between there and I  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just coming off doing my twelve steps for the very first time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I again might have been on this high.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, all right. I gotcha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really hadn't grieved some of the bigger stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Gotten that just a layer off. So I think that's kind of where I'm at now - I don't know. I'm in acceptance of my body because I know I'm healthy and strong. I just feel like I'm still - I see now with this no impulsiveness and really grieving some of this stuff that I think maybe I'm coming to another layer of awareness. That there's somehow  like I want to say manipulation maybe with my food? You know like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now tell me again when you say, "manipulation of my food," I don't know if you mean volume or you mean nutritional choices?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean the meals. I guess the meal sizes and choices. Like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For both the quality and quantity?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, quality and quantity.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I would say quality is pretty good, even though at restaurants I tend to choose - you know I mean every once in awhile - at least once a week, maybe I'll have something fried or something I don't really want but it's just because of where we're at, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it wouldn't be my preference, you know. And the volume I've noticed that you know in certain situations, in more stressful situations like with my family, I was kind of planning more moderate to high. Not high but I would say - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mid-moderate to high-moderate?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah like an 6 to 8s.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's more-so to the 7 or 8 kind of thing. But I'm seeing that I don't even want to do that anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I don't - I think that's more of a level of awareness, is realizing I don't even need to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's just maybe because I'm growing and I'm grieving and I'm getting rid of stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so there's just really no hidden, underlying feeling of hurting myself or wanting to hurt myself. And  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if I'm remembering right too, Jennifer, you put that bottom line - you already had the bottom line to your abstinence. But you put that recovery bottom line of no impulsiveness at mealtime?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then I think the planning got a little higher in numbers?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now you've kind of done that awhile and you've - the impulsiveness has pretty much been dormant and now you're looking at the volume. Does that sound like I'm remembering right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Perfect. Yeah. Way to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know how oftentimes when people first get abstinent, they plan those three meals but they're all three high-moderate because the chatter in their head is, if I'm only going to eat three times I'd better get enough food in at that meal. And then after they go a few weeks then it's like okay, maybe I can take a breath here. Maybe I can relax. Maybe I can start to move around in the moderate range instead of hang out at the high end. And that's kind of what I'm hearing you say once you closed the door on the impulsiveness at mealtime.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I guess so. And that's maybe what I'm feeling now is I feel like I have this extra layer of insulation on my body.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That wouldn't be there if I was rigorously honest. So it's not that I look at my body in bad thoughts or  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm well aware that I might not be totally reflecting that my heart, you know like I could be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That might show up. I think that's kind of where it is, is that I'm very, very well aware that I could be living in a place where I do know I'm going to fit into all my clothes and it's not going to fluctuate and it's not based on emotions and being transient and this and that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because my meals are just going to be the same. I don't know if I'm explaining that right or clearly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me try to repeat it and see if I got it. You said, you kind of chuckled and said, "I think I've got an extra layer of insulation. But that as I'm moving along on this path and not only bringing rigorous honesty about volume at mealtime and where I am in the moderate range, that the rest of my life is - you know I'm doing enough work for the rest of my life and I'm not going to need an extra layer of protection. I've got my steps. I've got my recovery. I've got God. " Does that sound like what you were saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea!.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because there's some - and I don't know if you can help me with, but I feel like I'm still trying to control, not - and it's very subtle I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like there's this idea of maybe totally surrendering to what God is going to show me. And I think where I'm struggling is that I keep showing up - the body keeps showing up, not like when I used to be so crazy. And once I finally gave up on the fact that I could ever be the weight that the doctors suggest or the weight that I felt really good at, I did feel very surrendered around my weight. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I remember. You know I look back and I remember how my body felt. And it really did function. You know and  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - those moments. But I spent so much of it in the 150 to 154 range.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think there's this like grieving part of me that like really wants to believe that I could just totally let go and just let whatever weight show up just show up. And that I'll be okay with that. It's almost like I can't imagine myself any other way and is it - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well again let me see if I got it. The 150 to 54 range is where the body feels the best and works the best?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's where I'm at.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's where you are now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's somewhere around 145-ish that you feel the best?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like between 142 to 146. Somewhere around there, 140 to 145. I haven't been below 142 in a long time. But when I was between like 142 and 145, somewhere in there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 146. I did feel the best.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's where you think nature's weight is for you is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I noticed that at those times, I wasn't thinking about it- I was just not comparing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it didn't really matter what I wore, I just put something on for the day and I didn't focus on the mirror that much. And I  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I just want to make sure that I remind you that you know about the handout I've got called "The Secret of Healthy Nourishing," It's where I talk about nutrition as a secondary issue, the quality of the meals. It really is more about our inner dialogue. Is it coming from faith or is it coming from fear? Is it coming from acceptance and love or is it coming from hatred and loathing? You know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so I want you to really know that all the work you're doing on accepting your body at the moment exactly as it is and accepting - in addition to the rigorous honesty stuff, but the acceptance and the growing spiritually and the working your steps and working your program, that's going to give you more and more of that mind set that will be a part of the whole body chemistry. You know when we operate from that fear and you just said you know when I got my orders to go back to the Middle East, it probably wasn't a great time for you. And I wouldn't be a bit surprised if a layer of insulation didn't come on not necessarily simply based on what you were eating but based on your mind chatter around going back into that and dealing with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That can't have been you know an easy dynamic to walk through. And  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just - yeah I was agreeing because I can distinctly remember when I got on the ship I was still saying, okay - I'm going back into the Middle East again but I love that service and I love the benefits.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it was, for me it was knowing I was going to be on the ship and confined with people - with addicts all around me. And no outlet. And it was almost like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I was holding on until I - I was holding on knowing that there was never going to be a release. You know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so the first two weeks or the first ten days I remember feeling like I was in that probably like 142 or 43, around there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just remember feeling so good and feeling - I mean not just the number but I just, my bowels were working. But then as I got closer to realizing that my life was soon going to go away  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - because I had no outlet and I had no help. And I just slowly found myself dying, like giving up. And then that was in July and so then August was when I think I got to call you and start working with you one on one. You know?  I needed to work on with someone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you had a relapse in your abstinence at that point right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When we started working together you were trying to get stable again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been asking for help since I was 13.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just, roundabout way I had to go through the things I had to go through. But I see now that the first person I started working with, I think she understood the importance of planned meals. And what I would do was just what I'm basically doing now but every night I called in my food for the next day. And if I changed that I'd call her. And I did, I experienced some real physical recovery. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the problem was that she was very controlling - she came from an anorexic background. I was an OA and so I never, knew what is the difference between this and the diet? So eventually when all this happened, now I see that I never really got it but I was very committed to my recovery and very committed to working the steps and very willing  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - to do this abstinence thing. But I just could not figure out what it was. You know? If you're an alcoholic, you pretty much know what being sober means.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that was the grace that God gave me when I got to work with all alcoholics in the Middle East the first time. Because you know I think in my roundabout way I just saw that it's got to be black and white, it's got to be black and white, you know. And just doing it on my own was harder but at least I was understanding the concept.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Again. I just want you to hear, you know kind of at a heart level, that the willingness that I've seen you have over the last year and a half is benefiting this issue of changing your biochemistry, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have more and more and more faith and calmness and serenity flowing through your body. That's got to make the body better. I told you that I had a client that had a back problem. And you know she ended up reading a book - the author's name is Sarno. And he's an M.D. But he talked about how we take anger, and because it's not an acceptable emotion most of the time, that we channel it neurologically in other ways. And that very often it ends up in a back situation, a back problem. And he said don't let any doctor tell you it's about aging. Because back problems that are complained about which are between 35 and 55, not the elderly. And she started working with this in her abstinence and committed to not only no impulsiveness at mealtime but no high end to moderate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the 80/20 rule you know with 80 percent of what she's eating is healthy for her body, she doesn't worry about the 20 percent. And not only has her back problem gone away, her weight has gone down where she had been abstaining for quite awhile without the weight shifting. And the weight started coming down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I said, wait a minute, what? Tell me that name of that book again? He's not like a spiritual guy, he's just a doctor that thinks that emotions get channeled certain ways in the body neurologically. I thought that was so fascinating that I got the name of the book and the author of the book.</p>

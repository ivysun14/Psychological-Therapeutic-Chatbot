<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Plus we look at—start from wherever you need to start.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I’m (inaudible at 00:00:08).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:00:12). Josh got a heart. I got a fellowship I’ve waiting for for two years today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of my friends just passed her quals. I just had a bunch of champagne. I cried all morning after I got the ring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of tears?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [sighs] I was super excited. I mean, I kind of knew it was happening. I knew it was happening but still felt so overwhelming. I thought I’m okay. Then, I called my mom to ask her if she’d come to the hospital later. She’s like, “I can’t. I have to teach. Why do you need me to come?” Then, I just started crying. [00:01:01] For like an hour on the phone to her. She was really happy. Everything’s going really well with Josh. He’s moving along really fast. The heart’s working very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s very overwhelming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [laughs] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have so many things to feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The couple days I’ve been searching were super overwhelming and I thought everything was okay. And then, I just cried for an hour driving home to my house. I’m not even sure why. I think I was relieved. I think it was relief tears, but—happy tears? And then, I thought I was okay until this morning. Because we had this whole issue, FedEx not being able to actually get us the rings and having to wait for it, the person to come to the door. I didn’t get it. It was going to go back to the jeweler. And then, I just felt like now (inaudible at 00:01:59) going to happen at all. [00:02:01] And then, maybe Josh would start doing poorly. I don’t know. It just felt like – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s a lot of pressure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, “Why am I feeling so overwhelmed by getting this rings?” I guess it feels like a good thing. Maybe good things are now happening. And if I didn’t get it, I don’t know. I mean, as of yesterday, (crosstalk at 00:02:23).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It symbolized a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing disastrous should happen after the first few days. We would know if he got some weird illness from the person or something was bleeding or just some—something unknown was happening. So, now, it would just—it should be okay unless he gets sick. And we’re like, “Really? (inaudible at 00:02:44) We took our first walk down the hall last night. He was really scared. He didn’t go out of his (inaudible at 00:02:50). It was super exciting. Throw a party at the hospital. Everyone’s super excited. There were four hearts transplanted in the last two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. [00:03:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s crazy there. And Josh is doing really, really well. And no one got a heart until like two weeks ago. Since like (inaudible at 00:03:09).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s weird. Although maybe normal in the heart transplant world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who knows? There’s no – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm, right. There’s no rhyme or reason to it, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And two days after I last saw you, he got a call for a high-risk heart in the middle of the night. Meaning that the girl overdosed, which they have to tell you, because there’s a potential she could have been—gotten some needle infection or AIDS or hepatitis or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can’t they test for that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It takes a couple months to be for sure, I think. So you wouldn’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. And you can’t really wait a couple months for a heart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. You got like four hours. So, we had to decide (inaudible at 00:03:51). Then, we turned it down, because Josh has been doing well enough that he didn’t want to risk getting hepatitis or something if he could help it, even though it was a low chance. [00:04:02] In the past two weeks, we’ve been—I’ve been really trying to believe. I’m not really good at wholeheartedly believing things. I’m trying to wholeheartedly—it felt like the right decision. And he felt like it was the right decision (inaudible at 00:04:13).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s a big decision to make.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You still have to live with it. You may think it was the right decision. And he’s been having nightmares every night about the surgery. And how he was convinced he was going to die. And was crying on Saturday night. Thinking about how it could be our last night together. (inaudible at 00:04:31) the heart and all this. I don’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you’ve certainly lived through a lot in the past week. You’ve lived through a lot in the past year, too. But what a lot of things to have happen in a week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have all these emotions. I want to happen, but I’m afraid to happen. Can we actually hope that—can we actually plan our wedding? [0:05:01] Can we actually hope that he’ll be out and doing well in a week, which is what they say? He should be able to shower tomorrow (inaudible at 00:05:11) since November. Are we actually moving in a good –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be (inaudible at 00:05:17).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, last time he was in the hospital, everything was just problems, problems, problems, disaster, disaster. And I know he’s scared to talk about it a little bit (crosstalk at 00:05:25). To jinx anything. It’s just too good. It’s too good. He’s just moving faster than they would’ve expected. It’s all going too well, so we’re [sighs]—but then, all these things that we’ve been dreaming are – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - can we actually have these dreams now? I mean, he’s really high on drugs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably lots of different kinds of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, he was (inaudible at 00:05:55) like water dripping or something yesterday. It was just a sign of one of the narcotics.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles] [00:06:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s on a lot of (inaudible at 00:06:01). He’s on a lot of steroids, which make you (inaudible at 00:06:03) emotional, I guess. [sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, they can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, he’s not even – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They usually make you revved up and – </p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s mostly just really sensitive. He was really revved up, and now he’s just very mellow, but also sensitive. So, he’s not even really there exactly. So, I’m still waiting. (inaudible at 00:06:27) patient. [laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I can only really imagine. I can’t really, truly empathize with what you’re feeling, because it’s just such a unique experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You don’t even know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So few people are in your position.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would happen if you did let yourself hope and believe that, yeah, things are going really well? [00:07:06] And he could be out in a week? And no machines attached to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I mean, I don’t even know what to do with myself at all. I’m really tired. I mean, we went through—there was the night of the surgery, I was celebrating someone who’s (inaudible at 00:07:26) their Ph.D. and I was (inaudible at 00:07:27). So, I was already excited and then we got the call. And we sprint to the hospital. Waited until like 4:00 a.m. for him to (inaudible at 00:07:34) the surgery. And then, waited all day for him to get out of surgery. And then, I was—and then, I had—just been exhausted, meltdown. But I still didn’t relax until the next day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who did you get to melt down to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unfortunately, just my brother on the phone. With my family and—I definitely don’t usually melt down with my parents. My grandma was there, which was nice. And I thought I was fine. They (inaudible at 00:07:58) some dinner after we saw him at the hospital briefly. [00:08:03] (inaudible at 00:08:03) And then, I drove home. I’m like, “I’m not okay. I can’t go home alone.” My dogs were at my parents’ house. I was going to be alone. I can’t do that. And all my friends were out. It was a Friday night, 9:00. So, I finally ended up getting ahold of my brother and I just melted down to him, while I’m driving, on the phone. It was not the safest thing to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I’m glad you’re okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [sighs] I still couldn’t get ahold of him on—see them, basically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was not good. Wish that I had just gone to the bar where my friends were. Where my brother was or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would’ve been good to be with a person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, my parents are trying to get me to stay at their house (inaudible at 00:08:50). And the weekend, I’ve spent with Josh. [00:09:00] I was just nervous. This was that week of (crosstalk at 00:09:03).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It’s a really big deal, having a heart transplant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [laughs] Yeah. I couldn’t believe that he was (inaudible at 00:09:11) doing well. They always say he might be asleep for days. They don’t know. And he always (inaudible at 00:09:17) way because he always wakes up too early and they have to sedate him. Yeah. So, that was a whirlwind of a weekend with all this stuff. And then, today, I just—I’m so overwhelmed this morning. I went outside. I left my house three times, because I kept having to go in and get my tissues. I was talking on the phone to my mom – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s okay to not know exactly what you’re feeling because you’re having a gazillion different feelings at once.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exhausted and –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We’ll sort it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I don’t want to get sick. I want to take care of myself so I can be healthy and not get sick. [chuckles] [00:10:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what do you need to take of yourself? Because I’m guessing you have gotten lost in the past week of people graduating and getting hearts and finishing their quals and –</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today was great. My friends were great. Even my friend just—who did quals. Her name is (inaudible at 00:10:30). Greatest day. And I did manage to see a friend who happened to be in town. We’d been planning on seeing each other for a really long time. Of course, it was the weekend Josh got his heart, but I still managed to see her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I got to do a few things for myself. But I didn’t even—(inaudible at 00:10:50) help. (inaudible at 00:10:52) yesterday, because I’m—I just needed to be for a little bit. I can go to yoga, because I don’t necessarily have to go answer a certain phone call anymore. [00:11:02] But, so, barely took (crosstalk at 00:11:07).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:11:07) of whatever it is that you’re processing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s so funny because when something horrible is happening, I usually feel so removed from the world in a negative way. I feel like I’m in a dark corner and everyone else is out in the rest of the world. But now, I feel like I’m in a happy corner looking out of my happy place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You still feel removed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just walking around like everything’s normal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. But you’re not normal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Walking in circles around my block, crying, going back inside my house for tissues. That was not normal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles] Not totally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m sure I walked past some people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who knows what was going on with them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, who cares what’s going on with them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought I could go to school today and do some work. But instead, I walked into my office, and my friend was like, “Oh, hi,” and I just started to cry. [00:12:01] [sighs] [I don’t know] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there’s a lot that you’ve bottled up for a long time. I mean, I wonder if part of what you’re processing is that you’ve had to keep a wrap on everything from getting too out of control. And now that there’s signs of he hasn’t rejected this heart, things are going well, he could be out of the hospital in a week, all of those fears and anxieties that you’ve had to keep tabs on, you can let go a bit. Let them just go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. I don’t know exactly. I don’t know why the whole ring thing was so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:43) a ring or the official engagement?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it’s telling everybody. Because that’s a lot to deal with, when you tell someone (inaudible at 00:12:52). They’re all excited and – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. What do you want people’s reaction to be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, be excited. That’s great. [00:13:00] (inaudible at 00:13:03) my mom’s going on about how they—we’ve been through so much and deserve this and blah-de-blah-de-blah. And I couldn’t handle (crosstalk at 00:13:11). Maybe I’ll stop and (inaudible at 00:13:13) your emotion (crosstalk at 00:13:14). Because I wouldn’t be able to stop crying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s okay to cry. Even multiple boxes of tissues, if you need to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it’s so exhausting. I don’t know. I guess it feels really good just to be an emotional wreck a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah. And it’s okay, because – </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just throw myself at my friend and melt down. It feels really nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice to have people take care of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I still resent the fact that all my friends were out at the bar. [chuckles] I wish I’d been a little more demanding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but it’s not every day that your friend has—her boyfriend has a heart transplant. [00:14:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right? I mean, still, I mean, I sprinted out of this party where we were celebrating my friend just getting her Ph.D. And threw my drink at someone and left. (inaudible at 00:14:13) and left. And I got all these messages and wishes from people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, they noticed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they noticed. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess I’m happy. I think. (inaudible at 00:14:40) know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Happy, scared, worried, excited, tentatively hopeful. Any of those – </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:14:51) too defined.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - fit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:14:52)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Too defined.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Overwhelmed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I’ve put so much into so many surgeries. [00:15:02] None of have gone right. And there’s so much that can go wrong. But this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Afraid to put hope into this one, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [sighs] I mean, the way the doctors are reacting is very hopeful. Very happy. So, I’m allowing myself to be happy. Be hopeful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did doctors respond to the other ones?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, less certain, I guess. (crosstalk at 00:15:31)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. So, the doctors seem more certain about this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he’s doing well. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like from what you’ve shared today that his progress has gone, well, faster than expected but as expected. There haven’t been hiccoughs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way that there were hiccoughs after everything else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:15:47) Yeah. Or (inaudible at 00:15:52). [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. Maybe you guys don’t need to have disasters all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know it’s not your typical experience with his health, but it would be okay for something to go better than expected. [00:16:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’ll be a first. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would. He has not been lucky in that regard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And he always told us how lucky he was. His heart was the only thing that’s wrong. A lot of people get multiple organ problems or—there was a girl named Laura who’s 30 who’s down the hall who had chemo as a child for lymphoma. And it wrecked her heart. And now, it’s been failing. So, now she needs a heart transplant because of her childhood cancer. So she is having a really rough time. She got a heart and it’s great, but she—her recovery is going to be a lot longer and slower. [sighs] He got really lucky that the surgery went as well as it did. It went as well as it possible could. And a lot of people have a lot more complications and troubles, whatever. [00:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I’m glad for you guys.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don’t even know what he’s going to be like when all the drugs wear and things settle down. I mean, (inaudible at 00:17:12) what it will be like. What things will be like. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. He hasn’t been healthy in a long time. Are you scared of what he’ll be like? Or just don’t know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I just don’t know, yeah. I can’t believe that he’ll actually feel good. I’m holding some reserve of, I don’t know, cynicism. But, I mean, these drugs have major side effects that are no fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. What are you anticipating?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [sighs] I don’t know. I mean, he’s already got—basically steroids can give you diabetes and emotional problems. And I guess it can – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he stays on the steroids forever? Or –</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. It totally depends. Every week, they cut out a little slice of your heart and look at it. [00:18:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, boy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:18:02) [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Through your neck, so for at least a few months. And then they (inaudible at 00:18:11). And that’s how they determine whether you can get off drugs. Especially the steroids, because those are no good. And also, they thicken your bones. All kinds of terrible things. I don’t know. I don’t know how prone he really is to (inaudible at 00:18:34). How sick he will really end up getting because of the immunosuppression. Maybe he’ll fine. I don’t really know. We’re going to be really nervous about (inaudible at 00:18:47) –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. There are just a lot of unknowns. It’s particularly poignant that dealing with uncertainty has always been—even before Josh, dealing with uncertainty and unknowns was not really one of your favorite things. [00:19:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles] The anxiety associated with not knowing was pretty high to begin with. And those are really big things to have to not know. And you are going to get a lot of practice at not knowing and being okay with that. Being anxious, perhaps, but I don’t want you to have to live in fear of not knowing. And these are big things that you’re just going to not know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t even feel – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to live anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckles] I don’t even feel anxious at the moment. That would be (inaudible at 00:19:42) defined.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you’re probably feeling a lot of things, which is why it’s hard to pick one that feels right, because there are so many different emotions running through you. And they all make sense. [00:20:00] It’s giddy and tired at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was such a shock go to the ER (inaudible at 00:20:09) to check in for the transplant. I immediately (inaudible at 00:20:11) with, “Why are you here?” And then I went to the congratulations. It was like a party. All the doctors were coming in, “Congratulations,” “Congratulations.” And that was nerve-wracking (inaudible at 00:20:20), “Well, we don’t have (inaudible at 00:20:21).” [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was also really nice (crosstalk at 00:20:27).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, that they really know you and care about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, these people don’t know us at all. They were just like—we’re like, “I guess a heart transplant really is this awesome (inaudible at 00:20:33) thing.” (inaudible at 00:20:34) Awesome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it wasn’t any of the people that you were familiar with? Or are these – </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. They just tell you to go to the ER to check in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The transplant team.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m not sure why, exactly. (crosstalk at 00:20:46)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s always open. [laughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s always open. Exactly. It’s always open. [sighs] Yep. I don’t know. I guess I’m still not over that whole night. I was just a ridiculous night. [00:21:00] I don’t know. Josh was (crosstalk at 00:21:04).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don’t have to be over it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I think that’s probably going to be a night that stands out for you for a very long time, if not forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would it be helpful to go through it piece by piece?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. [chuckles] I don’t know. I mean, it’s weird when things this big have happened, and it’s happened a few times, I don’t even know what’s going on until I suddenly start crying. And all the emotions just [makes sound]. So it’s not like a build-up of anxiety or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It hasn’t hit you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go through your story. And let’s see what hits you. Because I’m wondering if part of what feels so unsettling is that you really know what you’re feeling and when and why. So, start from the beginning. [00:22:00] Tell me your story and let’s see what comes up for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I mean, I guess Josh was such an emotional wreck, what, two weeks prior and that day?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, starting from when you had to say no the high-risk heart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because then it became really real that this was happening. And he started to get really upset about the surgery. Having nightmares about Indiana Jones. I guess there’s some scene where Indiana Jones rips somebody’s heart out (crosstalk at 00:22:31). [chuckles] Getting upset when I would leave at night, if I was going to go to this party. He was afraid he wouldn’t see me again. I don’t know. And I guess because he was being so emotional and upset; I just kept telling him how sure I was that we made the right decision. And pretty much believed it. It felt like the right decision and I had to believe that, otherwise I’d be (inaudible at 00:23:00) wrong for it, too. [00:23:02] I was getting a little worried that this couldn’t continue. He was just having a really hard time with (inaudible at 00:23:09). Now I forget where I was going with this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You started with the first two—the two weeks before. He was really upset.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Because of his extreme emotional state within that, I was just trying to feel – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had to be really steady.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - to feel optimistic and sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s a lot of pressure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, there was no way I could second-guess our decision. No way. (inaudible at 00:23:44) and we had to be sure that it was right or—I mean, there’s no other thing to do (crosstalk at 00:23:50).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. There’s no going back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I wasn’t going to—I’m not the one getting my chest chopped open, so—but for him, it made it so real, the surgery (crosstalk at 00:24:00). [00:24:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And that people really do call and say, “There’s a heart available.”</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And (inaudible at 00:24:04) to think (inaudible at 00:24:04). And it was really soon. We did not expect it—this is way sooner than we had ever—anyone would’ve ever expected. Or told us or told us to prepare for, so –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. People were talking years. Right? I mean, you told me (crosstalk at 00:24:16) – </p>

<p>CLIENT: Up to a year, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were like, “Oh, well, we’re not even worried about this until the summer.” So, yeah, so, suddenly, it was panic (inaudible at 00:24:22) but thinking about the actual surgery.</p>

<p>Yeah, so then, that night, I come home. He calls me. I come home. He’s crying. He’s crying, everybody knows. Tell them he loves them. Freaking out. I have to drag him out the house. He’s bringing out the phone. The doctor’s like, “Get your butt down here now.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just hang ups. And just come. And he was an emotional wreck. He was terrified. So, again, I couldn’t freak out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You couldn’t be terrified.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I saw his mom—I mean, I could still (inaudible at 00:24:55)—I don’t know if I’ll be able to freak out in front of her. [chuckles] But, yeah, I guess maybe today it was pent up. [00:25:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All the times that you weren’t allowed to have emotion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Emotion. Or didn’t want to, because it would be too hard to. Yeah, then, that whole next day, I waited with his mom for the surgeon to come and tell us things were okay. And we were. And then, I fell apart that night when I was home alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:25:21) good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I told my brother on the phone that I was alone. And then, I don’t know what happened today. I guess because he’s been doing so well. I didn’t really believe that we had actually officially got engaged. [chuckles] Just sounds still so weird. [I don’t know] (ph). And tell people. Tell my parents. I don’t know why it feels so huge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s a pretty big deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’ve made two really huge decisions in a week. [00:26:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it didn’t feel like a big decision until this morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Until you had the ring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I would have—if he was in a moment of crisis, I would’ve married him that night in the hospital or something. But this feels so –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re headed in sober.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I was clear-headed (inaudible at 00:26:25).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it feels bright. (inaudible at 00:26:33) Even though Josh is not himself yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know who he is. And he’s himself one week post-heart transplant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yep. [00:27:00] I don’t know. I feel like I’ve let it all out this morning. I’m not sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder what it is about going public with your engagement that makes it so much more real.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I mean, I just (crosstalk at 00:27:20) – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it’s, I mean, certainly something you and Josh have been talking about and planning and made a decision together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had lunch with a college friend yesterday. (inaudible at 00:27:31) try to have a little normalcy and told her that Josh bought me a ring. Still didn’t feel like anything. I don’t know. (inaudible at 00:27:41) actually told another friend the other day, too. (inaudible at 00:27:45) because Josh was just getting so excited, but . . . I don’t know. [chuckles] I don’t know. Being more public with it, I just—it’s really overwhelming. [00:28:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To me, you have a lot of things to celebrate, which feels very different than what it’s been like. You’ve had lot of things to deal with and crises to get through. To have some things to celebrate is a switch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yep. Right after we got the call from—for the heart, too, we went to a conference, which I was engulfed in. Really worried about, stressed out about. It was a very exhausting week. I think it went well (crosstalk at 00:28:48) – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The heart that you didn’t take, (inaudible at 00:28:50).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, the conference. The conference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but you got the call for the heart that you didn’t take. You went to the conference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, two days later, yeah. I went to this conference. [00:29:00] And suddenly, it just wrapped up in school for a week but in a very stressful way. An exhausting way. And then, I came back and a few days later, we have another call. [chuckles] And now I don’t even know what I’m doing in school (crosstalk at 00:29:14).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, school took a back seat. [chuckles] This week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I e-mailed my advisor finally on Monday. I’d be like, “Josh got a heart.” So, we just had a nice conversation about in Montana, despite all the stress (inaudible at 00:29:29). He said, “I hope things work out for you,” and all this stuff (ph). [chuckles] Of course, he was really ill on Monday and hadn’t responded to my e-mail. And he just sent out a blanket e-mail to the group that he was really sick and could I take care of this one thing for him. [chuckles] Which I ended up doing (crosstalk at 00:29:49).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles] Seems ironic you’re sick and I’m sitting in a hospital room waiting for a transplant. [laughs] [00:30:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was in today. I didn’t want to go talk to him because he’s really—still sick. And he’s at school (crosstalk at 00:30:05).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles] Yes, no germs. [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I got this fellowship I’ve been waiting two years for today. It’s so weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You mentioned that earlier. We didn’t get to that part. What is the fellowship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s from BBC. They didn’t fund anything last year because the government just gave up on BBC or whatever. And I got an e-mail that’s—when I got to school, basically the (inaudible at 00:30:34). (crosstalk at 00:30:36)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations on that, as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckles] Of course, (inaudible at 00:30:38) just—it’s just a weird of source of work validation. Just so bizarre.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why is that a weird source of work validation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I haven’t been doing anything related to school. And I mean in a big way in a long time. [chuckles] Because I (inaudible at 00:30:53).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, apparently, your work stands for itself. [00:31:01] Your history.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I was very lucky, in a way, because they waited two years, so I’m sure half the people were not eligible anymore for that or got something else. [chuckles] But also, I had so much guilt over being (inaudible at 00:31:20) my advisor because of all these problems (crosstalk at 00:31:24).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s (crosstalk at 00:31:24).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:31:24) so nice to let me stay and (inaudible at 00:31:26) me anyway. Now, I can be like, “Here, look. Here’s money. You don’t have to (inaudible at 00:31:32) give your special funds to somebody else, now.” Just be (ph) nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it’s nice to have—you don’t think things—bad things don’t happen because people deserve them. Good things don’t happen because you deserve. But it’s nice to have some good things fall your way. You didn’t deserve any of the bad stuff. [00:32:00] But it certainly does feel like you were due for some nice surprises.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My dad has been getting—I don’t know. I guess spiritual about all this. (inaudible at 00:32:14) doesn’t even know what happened yet. About the heart and everything. I think Josh allowed himself a tiny little bit of the universe (inaudible at 00:32:25) energy (inaudible at 00:32:26). I don’t even know. He keeps going on about how his blood clotting levels [chuckles] were almost dangerously low on Thursday when he got the call for the heart. Who knows why? However, it was a great thing for surgery.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:32:42) to happen. They kept questioning him about it when we were at the hospital, like, “What happened?” (crosstalk at 00:32:51) Because basically if you eat too much green stuff, there’s a vitamin. Vitamin K reverses your blood clotting. “Did you eat a pile of broccoli? Had (inaudible at 00:32:59)?” “I don’t know.” [00:33:01] And then he started to get really spiritual about it. It’s just a weird thing to get [chuckles] spiritual about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: His body was working for him in the right direction for once. It’s hard to know what to attribute it to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it’s any little bit of luck, we’re like, “Really?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: “[Can we] (ph) really be lucky? Is that possible?” Yeah. I don’t know. I mean, maybe I’m afraid to feel anything for a few days, in case something bad happens. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do seem tentative.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, again, he’s still not even himself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well, it’s a pretty short time. I mean, a week is not a very long time in the scheme of a major recovery.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:34:00] Yep. I think they actually moved him out of the ICU today, which is crazy. Really crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That would be freaky (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And his recovery from the last surgery was so long and so painful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. His pain is better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:34:20) [chuckles] He’s got a thing coming out of him and (crosstalk at 00:34:23) finally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It must feel nice not to have machines hooked up to you all the time. I’m sure he’s still got some.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No lines, no nothing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe one. I don’t know. He was so scared to get any of them taken out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, they were keeping him alive. Like a security blanket. A painful security blanket or safety net.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, also, last time, they took things out after surgery and everything was fine. They have to put in these drainage tubes. I wish I’d known about these before surgery. No one ever (ph) told us about those. [00:35:01] But when they do the surgery, they fill you full of fluid to keep your blood pressure up. And then, they close you up and stick tubes up through your skin and to—between your lungs, (crosstalk at 00:35:10). It’s lay there with tubes hanging out of you for days. I can’t believe there’s no better way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was awful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s horrible. The amount of medical knowledge that you have amassed. [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But anyway, the last time he did—had surgery, they had to put them back in after they took them out, because they found some more fluid and it was really painful and horrible. Actually, they had to do it twice. And he was so—he’s like, “Please don’t take them out. I’m scared to take them out. You’re just going to have to put them back in again.” And they’re like, “No, your heart’s working now. And everything’s good, so your body should take care of it.” And he’d still retained some fluid from the surgery just generally. And that’s something that his old heart couldn’t handle. [00:36:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But his new heart can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems to be handling everything (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles] His new heart works better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s really happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s the point. I mean, the goal is that the new heart works better than the old heart and better than the pump.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He has still a little bit of denial about how horrible his old heart was. Someone took a picture in the OR, his (inaudible at 00:36:20), of the two. I would really love to see side by side. Old heart, new heart. Because I still can’t even believe that it was so bad. And now it will be so much better. [chuckles] I don’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, the old heart really wasn’t working. I mean, you guys lived through all the ways in which it wasn’t working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Which I’ve actually never known him with a working heart. I mean, I thought I did, for the first six months. But it was really just a slow decline from an okay place. [00:37:00] And I will not be working like a normal heart. I mean, there’s so much to get used to, too, because they cut all of your nerves and your heart no longer talks to your brain. So your heart functions totally different (inaudible at 00:37:11). Basically off of adrenaline and other hormones instead of your brain. [chuckles] I almost started laughing because (inaudible at 00:37:21) great for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [It would be] (ph). If I could cut the nerves between my brain and my heart, I would sleep all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No more racing heart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Please do not ask any surgeons to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We will work on less drastic ways. [laughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank God for Ativan lately. (inaudible at 00:37:45)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Unbelievable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really nice, after two-and-a-half days of being more keyed-up than I realized to suddenly—I was suddenly sitting in the hospital room on Saturday afternoon and we had to go lay down. [00:38:02] And I was like, “I feel terrible. This is great.” I think I actually fell asleep (inaudible at 00:38:09) awesome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You needed it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m trying to remember if that was even Ativan-induced or (inaudible at 00:38:14) or – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or did things (crosstalk at 00:38:16).</p>

<p>CLIENT: - or whatever. Yeah. But it was nice to feel (inaudible at 00:38:18). Instead of being still keyed-up or whatever. Maybe that was because on Friday, I had just totally had a meltdown. And then I didn’t even really sleep that well that night because I was still – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really keyed up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Yeah. Well, keyed-up and in an emotionally (inaudible at 00:38:39). But then I had to (inaudible at 00:38:44) or something. I don’t know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know you can call me at times like that? [00:39:00] When you’re (inaudible at 00:39:01).</p>

<p>CLIENT: On a Friday night at 9:00?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. If you’re having crisis and you’ve tried to reach friends and you need just to talk to a human being, you are allowed to call me in times of crisis. It doesn’t mean I’m necessarily going to answer my phone right away, but if you’re in crisis and you need to talk, I check my messages.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even on Friday nights.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:39:28) my brother (crosstalk at 00:39:29).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re talking about pretty extreme circumstances. Those are times when you can call your therapist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [chuckles] Yeah. What a terrible time to not have (inaudible at 00:39:41). It was good, in a way, I guess. Things will pass. I was talking to my friend who I left with yesterday. She just completed a stress management study. It’s like a study but also a class. But then they did MRIs on your brain throughout or something. [00:40:03] She said it really helped. And it was mostly about learning to let things just happen and go. But it’d be nice if it’d go by a little bit—a little more—I don’t know. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, the things that you’re having to let go and have them go by are more extreme than what most people have to deal with. You’re not the only one in the world who has these sort of major events and health crisis, but when I think about the typical group that might go through a DBT skills workshop or a similar—that’s similar to, yeah, stress tolerance. People talk about things about confronting their oral exams.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that’s why I couldn’t go. I told you that. (inaudible at 00:40:57) I tried. I went one day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and you’re (crosstalk at 00:41:01) – </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was so anxiety inducing. [chuckles] [00:41:02] Oh my God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Finding a match where it’s life and death. People experience really extreme anxiety for the things that are not life or death. But when you’re dealing with life or death – </p>

<p>CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:41:15), sure. Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s hard to identify with those other ones.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I—maybe that’s (inaudible at 00:41:26) little hard to talk to my friends, because it’s hard to tell them, “Josh really thought he was”—they all wanted to know, “So, how did he propose?” Well, it was a little less romantic than that. He was kind of high the other night. Told me he saw moons and stars in my eyes or whatever. And that the FedEx was coming. And we’d already picked out rings because it was something to do to keep distracted while he was really ill. I mean, I don’t know. It was (crosstalk at 00:41:54) – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s not the typical TLC proposal story.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is yours, though. [00:42:00] And it’s your story.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and it’s perfect. It’s perfect. But it was hard to tell them. He really could’ve died maybe—every day over the last year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. “I’m afraid I might not see you again” is very real for him and you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:42:17) we walked him to—he walked to the OR at 4:00 in the morning (inaudible at 00:42:21) anesthesiologist. They couldn’t quite figure out how to get all the machines on the bed. It’s all so weird. What he has is such an uncommon thing, the type of machine he was on. It’s not the usual machine. They don’t put many people on it. But (inaudible at 00:42:38) to go home, otherwise he’d just stay in the hospital. It feels weird. Everything we did in the hospital was, like – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:42:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: - “How does this work again?” We had nurses getting out instruction sheets.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, gosh. That doesn’t make you feel very secure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my God, that was terrible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, thank goodness you’re getting rid of that. [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, they have to put him on a bigger one for surgery with more dials and things. It’s like a refrigerator. And every time a nurse has had to use, because it’s usually a different nurse who’s probably done it once in training. They have to get out the instruction manual.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That’s terrible. The whole thing set off alarms all the time. It would beep and (inaudible at 00:43:13). And I just forgot what I was saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your proposal story (crosstalk at 00:43:17).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. It’s weird to tell this to my friends, though. I don’t want to come off flippant. Sometimes, I’ll start crying, but mostly I don’t. But it is maybe I won’t ever see him again. [chuckles] For every one of these surgeries. More than that, though, he really, really thought he wasn’t going to (crosstalk at 00:43:41). I’m surprised he woke up. And I actually told the surgeon. And the surgeon (inaudible at 00:43:47) seemed offended. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The surgeon seemed offended. I was trying to tell him how upset he was when he (inaudible at 00:43:53) surgery. And the surgeon seemed pretty offended. He thought [chuckles] (inaudible at 00:43:56).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Surgeons like to think that everything is about them. [00:44:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He’d also just done his fourth heart transplant (inaudible at 00:44:03). Do whatever he wants. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughs] And he got Josh through it alive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Ever since I guess the surgeon came over, I’ve just have been acting however I want, in a way. I mean, I (inaudible at 00:44:21).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hugged a bunch of other nurses.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s okay, too. Are you worried about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. (inaudible at 00:44:34)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re really grateful. And overflowing with emotions that you don’t know what to do with. And you don’t feel quite ready to have. It’s a little bit scary to have all these feelings. And so, hugging these people that kept your fiancé alive is –</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my God. (crosstalk at 00:44:55)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And just so you know –</p>

<p>CLIENT: - because want to [sighs]—(inaudible at 00:44:59) my friends, we were having this best day ever. [00:45:01] Cake and champagne. My friend just passed her qualifying exams, which—it was even a bigger deal, because she failed the first time. No one really fails in general. It’s not like most—some schools, where it’s a very competitive thing. It’s not like that competitive (inaudible at 00:45:16). She basically failed because her advisor paid no attention. Things weren’t being communicated. It’s not that she wasn’t doing great work. They just didn’t get what they thought they would. Whatever. Anyway. So, she didn’t tell anyone it was going to be today. So, we found out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she was terrified.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, we found out because somebody was trying to make an appointment with one of her advisors. And they were like, “Oh, I’m going to her quals.” And we’re like, “Oh my gosh, (inaudible at 00:45:41).” Oh, what was I telling you now? This is (crosstalk at 00:45:44).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I used the word “fiancé” and it freaked you out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh! So, we were celebrating her thing. And all my friends were like, “So, tell us about your proposal (inaudible at 00:45:51)” whatever and like, “What are you going to do for your wedding and can—when are you doing your bachelorette party? Can we do all this for you?” (inaudible at 00:45:58) [00:46:01] I sat on the floor. I was like, “(inaudible at 00:46:03) we must stop talking about this. It’s too much.” I don’t have enough – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re not for ready for –</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no more space for any kind of emotions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - for planning all that yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just wearing this ring. And I don’t know if I can call him my fiancé yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can keep calling him your boyfriend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I know I said it before, but it really a lot easier to deal with all this and telling people he’s my fiancé. Because it means more. Your boyfriend when you’re—especially when you’re going to see him in the hospital for months and months and months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And now that you can, it feels a little . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know why. (crosstalk at 00:46:50)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if I didn’t come with the expectation of, “Tell us when you want your bachelorette party” and “What do you want for your shower?” and “When’s the wedding date?” and “Do you want to go dress shopping?” What if you got rid of all that part? [00:47:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would it feel easier to call him your fiancé? Or to say that you’re engaged?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I guess that’s a lot (inaudible at 00:47:10) and how my parents are going—I mean, I told my mom. I told you, I told my mom this morning because I couldn’t keep it a secret. But I’m also just crying to her. [chuckles] She said something, I’d almost started—stopped crying to actually talk to her about. And then, she said something like, “You told me”—because I said he got—he gave me a ring. Really, FedEx delivered the ring. [chuckles] And she’s like, “Wait. So you accepted it, right? Are you sure?” And I just flipped out and started crying again. It’s like, “What are you saying?” She’s like, “Well, but you said that he gave you a ring. You didn’t say you accepted it.” So then, I was crying for a little while longer and screamed at her and she laughed. I think she laughed. She probably didn’t understand a word I was saying. But I still haven’t gotten her actual reaction. [00:48:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what matters is how you feel and that you and Josh feel like it’s the right decision.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I just have a big family and I’m sure there will be a lot of commotion.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I completely believe you. Because families always have their own thoughts and their own reactions to things. But what’s really important (inaudible at 00:48:20) that you and Josh feel like it’s right. And that you do things on your time schedule as much as you can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I do. I want to have a huge celebration party with everyone there. I can’t plan ahead, though, just in case.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can’t plan that yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I do want to (inaudible at 00:48:37) all that, but I’m—I guess that’s part of the whole excitement thing that I’m afraid to do yet. Some of my friends are like, “Oh,” I guess – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You still need to wait for – </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I’m a little scared of (crosstalk at 00:48:46).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - he has a lot of healing to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And that’s okay. There’s no rule that says when—the day you get the ring is the day that you start planning all of these celebrations. It’s perfectly okay for you to say, “We’re engaged. I got the ring.” [00:49:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: We want to make sure he lives for the next three months. [sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Seriously, though. Even through the first year. I think there’s like an 80 percent survival rate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s pretty high.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is pretty high. It’s also a not small non-survival rate. And things are looking good. Things should be good (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. But you’re not comfortable yet. And, yeah, you get to say, when someone says, “When can we plan your bachelorette?” If what you feel is, “I want to wait, I want to wait and see how he does, we want to see if he survives the next three months”? You get to say that. No matter what their reaction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I just sank into a corner and was like, “Stop.” (crosstalk at 00:49:47) Which I think is fine, but I can only do it so many times. [laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can do as many times as you need to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I can, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because your situation is not what—it’s probably not what you thought it was going to be like. [00:50:00] It’s the scenario, right? Everybody’s responses to you is based on what they’ve seen splashed in wedding magazines, maybe their own experience with other people’s showers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is not the story that gets splashed all over the wedding magazines and on TLC and however many other shows there are about this stuff. But it’s your story. You get to have it the way is best for you. Even if it’s not 100 percent bliss and excitement and if there’s other things like fear and trepidation and “I want my mom to be supportive” wrapped up in there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even just when I was in Montana (ph) two weeks ago. At the conference, there was a high school friend of mine who I’ve known from church who—we’re family friends who apparently works in the same field as me in—at the University of Montana. Who knew? So, I ended up going out with him. I don’t know. I knew Josh was at home having a lot of trouble. [00:51:01] I was calling him every day. He was telling me how much trouble he was having, how miserable he was feeling. And then, one of the last nights, I went out with this high school friend who I hadn’t seen in forever. Got drunk with a couple of my lab mates. The place (ph) was really nice. I don’t know. I just have this other vision of how my life could be in Montana. Single high school friend. I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did that life—parallel life seem?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. In about two hours, I was over it. Because I really just still wanted to call Josh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That life sounds like it might be easier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know. Mostly just made me feel guilty. [00:52:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. I could understand why you’d feel guilty. But I can also see why you fantasize about having maybe an easier (inaudible at 00:52:06).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or more normal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A healthy guy who’s in the same field as you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This poor guy. He was born with a deformed arm. I mean, he’s very cute. And successful and everything, but he’s got his own problems. [chuckles] He has only half of one arm. I don’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, still not totally easy. You never pick the easiest (ph). [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckles] I don’t know. And there was a—just a bizarre set of emotions wrapped up in some silly cocktail hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and (inaudible at 00:52:48) very intense couple of weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn’t tell him any of it. He didn’t know any of it. Which was also nice, because I just – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: People treated you like were having a normal conference? [00:53:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And we caught up on the high school (inaudible at 00:53:04). I didn’t tell him anything with my personal life. He didn’t tell me any of his personal life. I don’t think I’ve hung out with anyone in a long time who knows nothing, who have any kind of history of (inaudible at 00:53:17). Who knows me but (crosstalk at 00:53:19) – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sets you up to play that pretend fantasy game.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. Yeah, it was nice. (inaudible at 00:53:23)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why don’t we stop there for today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry (inaudible at 00:53:26).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no need to apologize. Probably more to process than what we can do in an hour.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let’s schedule some follow-ups –</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - so you don’t get stuck with no appointment.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What’s your schedule next Wednesday? I forget what our normal day is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckles] I don’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, I mean, Tuesday the 12:30 were a nice time that I had to move because of his clinic appointments. [00:54:02] But that is no longer. So, if you still have that time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can’t do that next week because I’m out of the office for a doctor’s appointment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I can do it starting the 13th, which is the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can we pick another time for next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you have this time? Oh, no, this was an every other. What were we doing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t know. [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I forget what the opposite time was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It may be the—I don’t remember what it was, either. I can look back. But now that it’s May, there’s more flexibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, wait, what was—this was, what, 2:30? This was 3:30. I can do 2:30 next Wednesday, which is the 7th. Or 1:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m sorry. Next Tuesday, you said?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next Wednesday – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could do 1:30 or 2:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Either one. 1:30 (inaudible at 00:54:58).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [00:55:00] And then, after that, so—that’s okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, you said you have Tuesday at 12:30?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tuesday at 12:30, I have the 13th and the 20th. And then, that next week gets a little screwed up because of Memorial Day. But I could do Tuesday the 27th at 10:30. I think. Would that work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tuesday the 27th at 10:30. Probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most likely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Let’s put that in. If you need to change it, we can. And we can look ahead to June (inaudible at 00:55:46).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So, next Wednesday at 1:30, Tuesday the 13th and 20th at 12:30. And then the 27th, at 10:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next Wednesday at 1:30, yes. And then 13th and 20th at 12:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perfect. Cool. [00:56:00]</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry. I'm just a little sick. I got antibiotics finally because I went to the doctor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now she is calling it bacterial bronchitis. I'm like great. So yesterday, I tried-I don't really know how it came up. Oh but he went to therapy the other day, he was telling me that he had-it was a really good session and like whatever. It was emotional. And so then I asked him, what they talked about in regards to the whole Betty situation and talking about other woman, and the people in the past and whatever. At first he was really vague and then he-basically that his therapist basically said that he feels like he felt like he had nobody to talk to and that had to do with his own issues instead of issues about our relationship. [00:01:17]</p>

<p>I was like all right. In my head, I was like obviously. But I think it is good if maybe if I ease into that, but then I don't remember what I said-I started talking about my confidence because we had been talking about that last week and so it had been on my mind and how I feel really confident and know all of these things about myself but then when I think about the situation, it makes me realize that I lost confidence in our relationship basically. And then he was like, okay and didn't really have a response and I was like I'm really sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have said that, I just thought we were having problems with each other. [00:02:01] </p>

<p>And he said, "when you say stuff like that, I don't really know what to say and I just feel bad about it all the time. I know that you feel horrible and I feel bad about it all the time, but it is just hard because then you say stuff like that and it just reminds me that, I see that we are making changes in our own lives and for ourselves, oh no we are progressing in our own lives and for ourselves but I really don't see any progress in terms of our relationship." That really made me frustrated and it was like part of us making progress personally is what we discussed as necessary to work on our relationship for one and two we have been hanging out and when we hang out we don't argue. It is very nice we have a nice time. We are laughing and enjoying. There is not anything. I feel like that in and of itself is progress because we have been struggling with that a little bit before in terms of one or the other person, or him dominates conversations or just whatever. [00:03:05]</p>

<p>We have just been getting along. I don't know. I'm just frustrated and you would think that he hasn't really seen any progress in our relationship. Because then it is like okay, so to you is progress is the only indication of progress. I was like getting 100 percent back together and not having anymore, moving back in and whatever is that your only indication. Anyway, that is my thought of the day. (inaudible at 3:36) (pause) </p>

<p>So, I just find I'm not really sure what to think. And then he always goes back to complaining about that he is in so much pain and he hates the place he lives. They are so dirty. The bed is too small. His back is really hurting. [00:04:06]</p>

<p>It makes me feel awkward, because I don't know-I can only-I'm like that sucks but I wonder if in his head, he is thinking, yeah you could change the situation for me, but you're just not. You could make-you're saying I wish there is something I could do, but there is. That is what I think that he is thinking. You know there is but you're just not doing it or whatever. (pause) I just really don't know what to think. </p>

<p>In terms of the confidence and stuff and other stuff that we were talking about last week, I think that-I don't really remember what we were talking about at the end of our session last week. [00:05:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When is the first thing that you said about [you got me lost once] (ph) in the relationship and then you felt kind of bad about the whole thing and it made you feel bad, I guess you started to feel bad even before he had said anything? I guess it's kind of like [when is your last personal] (ph) relationship? How were you going to feel? I mean then again, it seemed that sort of dynamic where you say something that is upsetting to you that makes a lot of sense that you feel that way and then you feel bad about it, like it is going to hurt him even before he said anything. [00:06:11]</p>

<p>And then he sort of makes you feel worse for having said it, but (inaudible at 6:20) yeah, he is having inappropriate conversations with [when on the line is] (ph) frequently with one but clearly others. Of course you lost trust.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right that is how I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is how you feel when you're not talking to him about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess that that is a difference that is kind of striking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, I don't know. I really don't know why I have more trouble with that when I'm talking to him. I don't know. [00:06:56]</p>

<p>Maybe, I'm putting internal pressure on myself and feeling like I need to (pause) shit or get off the pot. He says that the only progress he has seen in our relationship is me saying that we are going to try to go to a couple's therapist. I'm like okay. I'm not really the one who's fucked up so I don't really have much to be working on it. So that pissed me off. And I was straight up, I don't want to talk to you for the rest of the day. I'm like, have a goodnight. I really don't have anything else to say to you. (pause) </p>

<p>[00:06:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there is a little echo with what goes on with him that is now going on here, where you kind of identify-because of what I set up with him, I think you kind of identify me as-sorry I'm having trouble figuring out how to say this. I think we can pretty safely say you're ambivalent about getting back together with him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is easy to say (crosstalk) and there is part of you that wants to and part of you that doesn't. And in that moment with him, you're kind of leaning a little more, you're identifying with the part that wants to and that feels bad, just feels bad about having said something hurtful to him and that makes you both sad. [00:09:05]</p>

<p>(pause) And you kind of fit in with how he sees things somewhat, I think. Which is probably because you feel guilty. And then, I point that out in here like a few minutes ago, and then you sort of proceed to explain how you're really not the one with the problem here. When he suggests it otherwise, it pissed you off for the rest of the day and you didn't talk to him. I think you go over and identify with the other part that doesn't want to be with him. [00:09:56] </p>

<p>I think you give that part over to me a little bit, like I either have that view or because I just pointed out what I did, it means that I'm kind of saying, you are distorting something and so then I think you are also falling a little bit into step with either how I see things or how it seems like I see things, which I am saying is king of an echo. Like what happens with him. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. I think that stems from maybe is the fact that regardless of if it is talking to you or talking to friends or by myself, when I'm not with him, I feel more on the end of the middle (ph) inside of things. Then like you say, when I speak to him and try to talk to him about stuff, I end up feeling badly or feeling poor him. [00:11:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I am imagining that you may be, unconsciously not consciously intending to be a little bit chameleony, where you are sort of taking the coloring of who is around when you are talking to a friend who's adamantly against getting back together with him because-sometimes I kind of see it more like how they see it. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well for instance, if I were talking to my mother about it and she were to say anything like that, it would be don't say that because we might get back together mom. This is my thing. Get defensive in that sense because I don't want her to, I don't know whatever. But yeah, I think definitely. [00:11:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it is the chameleony part that I am wondering about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you mean why? Or (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not even quite up to why yet. I'm more on that seems important if it works that way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, why so?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it makes it harder to sort out what you want. It also makes it more difficult to have a relationship with him because I think it actually is something that has made the relationship, I'm not saying it is something that you are doing wrong in the relationship but it is something that is making the relationship very difficult for you. [00:12:58]</p>

<p>Because if you sort of say and feel things a little bit more one way when you're with him and another when you're not, then I think what happens a lot of times is that you get stuck because you haven't said what you needed to say when you are with him and you haven't made the demands that you need to make things work the way you want. And so you feel like it's not going to work or it's not working. (pause) You yet you feel a longing for him when you're with him. I guess what I'm saying is-you're not with him in a way that is going to work for you. [00:14:09] </p>

<p>Because of something that happens in a conversation that happens with you. If you're not sort of holding him-or like you tell me that yeah I was pissed at him because he is the one that (inaudible at 14:26) needs to change on me, I'm not the one that really has a problem to deal with here. And you're inconsistent, you're not clear to him. Then it kind of keeps things back. It doesn't-now I'm not saying because he doesn't change. I'm saying because I'm really putting it out there, [all over your ass] (ph) so that you can never evaluate whether it will go the way you want, something like that. [00:15:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how to do that though. I don't even know how to put it in terms of that it could go the way that I want I guess or whatever. So okay, if I were to say well yeah, but you could find a couple's therapist then because I'm not the one who fucked up. If I said that, I just feel like he would do what is very characteristic of how he has reacted to things like that in the past and just be like, I don't know if I can do this because blah blah, or what do you mean, you have things that you blah blah blah to. I don't know. I have just been afraid of the reaction or something and don't want to deal with it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What scares you about the reaction? [00:15:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then it just puts me in a position of having to deal with him either getting really upset and depressed and me not really knowing how to react to that or him telling me how much he is doing and that I am not seeing it and still think that he needs to do all of this stuff so never mind that it is to much of doing his whole break up with you routine that I have seen a thousand times before and either having to make a decision to accept that or argue it until we aren't at that point anymore. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So, (pause) when you put it that way, it sounds more like you're not sure whether you want him the way that he is or not. But you're really not thinking he is actually going to change. You already know what he is going to do or how he is going to respond. [00:16:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I guess is entirely fair but at the same time, I haven't really seen anything to show me anything different. I don't know. I just feel like he is complaining about he is tired and work and he has back pain and his room is to small and you care about-I don't know, join a gym. I don't know, go to a library to study something. Don't complain to me about it because it really just shows me that you aren't really doing anything besides complaining. I'm thinking about going to get an $800 a month studio. I don't know what to tell you buddy, even when he was moving into the fucking place and he was saying that it smelled and the guy patched (ph) that up. I was like, well maybe you should find another place and he was "no, I will just do it". Okay, you made that choice. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know. And this whole school thing and whatever, I really don't understand why. [00:17:58]</p>

<p>I go home every fucking day and read for school. I'm up until midnight writing a paper. This is what I am doing. I'm taking a class and I'm working full time and this is what I am doing. I just don't see how his life is so hard that he can't figure out how to fit this stuff in that he needs to fit in. And then still complains about dancing, still complains about his crew, and if you're going to spend all of your extra time dancing, then at least don't complain about that for god's sake. And then last night he was messaging me, "Oh I wish I were there with you". I know he wanted me to be so come over. I wasn't. I already told him I have a lot of work and I was really looking forward to getting to bed early after I finished my work and having some time on my own. And I felt like it was really unfair for him to put that on me, just literally like messaging me with all complaints. [00:19:00]</p>

<p>My back is so bad, I think my roommates used all my butter (ph). They don't clean anything. They are yelling about the debate. My bed is too small. I need a new place. I hate this place. I don't have any clothes. I just thought it was unfair. Because what do you want me to say, sorry. He is I'm sorry, I shouldn't say this to you. After he gave me this whole list of stuff. I had seen him the night before, we had dinner. We had Chinese food and it was very nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like he can make you feel pretty bad about everything or pretty guilty or responsible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He really does. And yeah, I'm responsible for making the decision that I felt was best for me. I'm not responsible for why I had to make that decision. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what. It wouldn't actually really matter. I mean let's say that you just decided that you weren't compatible and you know you wanted different things from your partner and none of the other stuff happened but you just decided it wasn't very good for some reason. [00:20:07]</p>

<p>It wouldn't be your fault.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I feel like he would make it that it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he still is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess you buy into it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Totally. I mean not necessarily like I'm not feeling like oh my god, he is right. It is my fault.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I mean you feel guilty. You feel bad for him. You feel-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I respond</p>

<p>THERAPIST: help out or step in or something (crosstalk) And you feel bad that you didn't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know there (inaudible at 20:47) and it suddenly feels crummy. [00:20:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is just so stressful. This whole situation is just really draining. It's exhausting. And I guess I'm just not really-I don't know, I'm just not (pause) I'm just so undecided I guess. I don't know. And he asked me if I wanted to go this thing that he was-some people were DJ'ing at on Saturday and I said sure, why not. But then my friend was-we have been trying to make a plan for her to come over to my house because she hasn't come over in a really long time and I have a whole bunch of stuff that I am giving to Goodwill that she wants to look through to see if she wants anything. And so she was like Rory her son's father, Rory is going to take Cadence on Saturday night so that we can hang out if you want. [00:22:06]</p>

<p>And I really want to. And I feel like when tell Franklin he's going to be oh all right, I thought you said, okay. And I am once again going to be in a position of do I feel guilty right now or do I just apologize for the confusion and say, let's make a plan for another night. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not your responsibility to take of him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not. And for whatever reason, I'm so, I don't even know. I feel-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it is, yeah. Did I tell you that I spoke to his brother's wife? Like wife, I use the term loosely because she is 26 with 3 of his kids and they (inaudible at 23:03) [00:23:03]</p>

<p>But she messaged me about one of the kid's birthday parties. I couldn't go because I was going to Chicago last weekend and she asked me what is up and I had finally told her. I guess she hadn't heard yet or whatever or anything. And she had a lot to say. I guess she went through a similar bad relationship before and-wait I didn't tell you this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [not right yet] (ph) you could have and I forgot or-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't remember either. Then she told me that she might be overstepping her boundaries but that she talked to his ex when they were going through their thing and that her list of complaints or issues with him was almost identical to the issues that I had told her that I have been having with him. And she was like I guess the only reason I wanted to tell you that is obviously your relationships are different but maybe it shows something about— [00:24:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It says something about him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And what type of person. Then she said something that was kind of harsh but I don't think that she meant it that way. I think she was just speaking from her heart. Something about you know it's surprising how low we allow our standards to drop sometimes in terms of what we expect from a relationship. Kind of suggesting-or something about it's all about how low you're willing to accept your standards to be or something like that. She is kind of stupid and she is Christian republican and I don't know. I think they speak another language. So I think I wouldn't have said things that way but she makes a good point that she did have some helpful and supportive things to say. [00:25:03]</p>

<p>I mean one of the things that she said is, basically I would love to have you be a part of our family forever but I see that you [inaudible] by you more than he does for you, basically. I mean it was good to have a conversation with somebody is in his family more or less and is a little bit more on that side and I mean it was really not anything where telling me that she has seen our interactions and-I told her stuff that I'm super, cool, awesome, successful, beautiful-and that I shouldn't have to deal with these kind of issues that he (ph) can't ever get over. [00:25:59]</p>

<p>You know about his ex-wife or whatever and that her issues surrounded paying bills and (inaudible at 26:06) and following through with things and talking to about other girls and being independent, being able to do things, that he says he is going to do on his own. I mean of course, he paints a very different picture of that relationship when he tells me about it obviously. But hearing it from a third party, it just makes me kind of nervous. I mean I really might have to deal with this forever. I don't really know if these are things that, even if they aren't necessarily his fault and they kind of have to do with how he grew up and whatever maybe aren't things that he can change or maybe it will take so long to change that I can't, I'm not willing to sacrifice more than what I already have to help him. I feel like I have given him so much and I have given him so much support and I have helped him so much with so many things that to feel that we are even at this point makes me not want to try anymore. [00:27:02]</p>

<p>I mean, how much money-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he doesn't seem like he is really going to change or is he even showing that much motivation to change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it just doesn't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it doesn't me to either. And I think that is what is most difficult. And I try to kind of-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The question is (pause) why do you continue to feel so responsible for him and to pretend otherwise?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get blindsided. I don't even know, maybe that's not the word, but I get-I don't know but my vision of what I feel personally gets really obscured when it comes to the way he approaches things with me. [00:27:59]</p>

<p>And I feel bad. And I feel bad for him and I think that has been a lot of the driving force of the things that I have done for him throughout our relationship. You know I have felt bad for him. I feel bad. I think he plays on that in many situations, like he knows that I will feel bad for him so he uses that to his advantage. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is probably stuff in your history that relates as well. I'm not sure what, I mean the most obvious thing would be something about how you can take care of your mom or your financially (ph) responsible or something like that but I only have a schematic understanding for that. [00:28:59]</p>

<p>But I guess, clearly he plays on (inaudible at 29:04) ways who he is into this but I think it is probably something kind of going on for you and your personality and history in terms of how you wind up feeling responsible and how you end up feeling like all the way along you've invested a lot. I mean there is the money but also in terms of hopes about his changing, about things improving, about him becoming more the kind of person you wanted him to be even before all of this. My impression is you always wanted that and kind of expected it was going to happen. [00:29:57]</p>

<p>And now it's more like there is even further to go. Not like he has gotten closer to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And somehow, you've kind of let that happen or hadn't seen it coming in the way that is very upsetting, I think to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, I just don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like seeing something in front of you about how you want things to be but actually walking backwards.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It's a difficult situation to be in, I think. [00:30:59]</p>

<p>(pause) I just feel like if I something more-first I was saying, if he goes into therapy, now I'm feeling if I saw something more concrete in terms of not only that, okay I'm glad your talking about stuff and exploring why you don't like being friends with guys or whatever, but something else like the other stuff, I just don't see much that shows me how to trust him. I don't know. I just, I don't, no I don't feel bad for you that you don't have anybody to talk to so you start talking to some random girl that shows up at your practice a couple of times with one of your crew members because she messaged you and so you have a day long conversation. No, I don't feel sorry that everything you did is because you don't have good friends. [00:31:55]</p>

<p>(pause) You could just not talk to somebody. (pause) One big thing that scares me is that regardless of what he changes, regardless of what I'm aware] (ph) that I'm in the process of coming to the realization that I just don't want to deal with it. I don't, that he is not for me and that I can't. This has been to stressful on me and I really want a different type of relationship than the one that I have. And I think that is a huge thing for me right now. (pause) And I'm scared of making that decision, of going through it I guess. [00:33:03]</p>

<p>(pause) I'm feeling like two sides to my own story because it does vary so much depending on the time like with him or talking to him or in the moment and then talking to other people. (pause) I guess just feeling overall that I'm not going to be taken care of the way that I would like to be by him. Like that he could take care of me in some ways but that I don't feel like he can in others. [00:34:01]</p>

<p>(pause) And I really don't know what to do with those feelings and how to reconcile them, I guess. I don't know, I'm just very confused about the whole thing. (pause) [00:34:59]</p>

<p>(pause) I've recently had a conversation with my friend, Jillian. We were talking about my relationship and whatever and I was saying something, something along the lines of well when I do find somebody else or something like that and she was so did you notice that you just used the word when instead of if. And I was yeah because right now I am feeling like I'm not [in love] (ph) with him. [00:35:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, I am wondering if you're a bit annoyed with maybe some of your friends because I think what you really want from us is to tell you how to make this work or help you find some way that things could be better between you, so that you could be together and you could be happy. I think that is what you really want is for him to want to change, for him to be better, for things to be better between you, and to stay together. And I guess I sort of have the idea that maybe somewhere under the surface you kind of have wanted me and maybe some of your friends to tell you how to make that happen. As if it were, you're saying okay, here is where I want to end up career wise, help me figure out how to get there. [00:37:02]</p>

<p>And we were saying no, no I think you should you go with another career over here, we wouldn't be telling you what you wanted. We wouldn't be helping you in the way that you wanted to be helped. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah I think a little bit and I think that it stems from my obvious confusion and or I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Basically, your having to explain it or make it your fault or I don't take (ph) it back but sort of explain there is some problem in you that is leading you to be unfairly or unreasonably or something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would love for to have a conversation with my friends or with you or with my parents or whatever in which they are like listen, this is what you need to do and then you will feel better about it. [00:38:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Send him to this therapist. Put this in his coffee. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Get him to read this book. Go to see these movies together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Or even look at things in this way and not in that way. Which I think that feeling comes from him a little bit and being that I am just not looking at things right. I am just looking at them wrong and so that is why it is still so hard to deal with this. Because I think he feels that a lot. Like I'm not trying hard enough or something. Yeah, ultimately that would be ideal. Tell me what is the best thing to do and I will do it and then I will be able to move on, but obviously that is not realistic and nobody can make the decision about what is best in terms of how I am acting or reacting or whatever because I'm me (ph). [00:39:07]</p>

<p>I guess-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nobody is really taking care of you here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because, he sure as hell isn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although sometimes it feels like he does and we sure the hell aren't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because we aren't helping you get what you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It's like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're kind of in this unknown. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah yeah, that's definitely how I feel about it. I'm really not getting through this on my own. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is very difficult, stressful, upsetting, life changing thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, I'm going to work, and I'm keeping my house clean, and I'm doing my schoolwork, and I'm going to class, and I'm making plans with my friends, and I'm checking in with Franklin, and hanging out with him sometimes, and talking to him all the time, and when he wants to complain, and I'm doing all this stuff, and it is almost as if I'm just-I'm just doing it, all of this stuff all of the time. [00:40:14]</p>

<p>I'm always taking care of everything. I'm doing all this stuff. (pause) But then, why am I not feeling better about the whole situation? I guess that is what I end up with at the end of the day. Why do I still feel shitty?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're not getting what you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're not getting any help, and you're by yourself, and you're working super duper hard. I guess the idea is that if you work hard enough, you will get the things that you want. He will change. He will help. You won't be by yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [00:40:57]</p>

<p>In terms of him, I just don't know what to tell him anymore. I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do at this point. And I guess I am kind of dragging my heels on getting a therapist for us and because I'm kind of like man what are they going to do. (pause) And you know bottom line, if I feel like he could still talk to other woman, then I'm not ever going to feel good about our relationship and not ever trust him. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're done now (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'll see you next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have I mentioned that I'm getting (inaudible at 41:44).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to take my insurance but I can't until December.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (crosstalk) That's all right go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, go ahead. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was just going to say, that is why I'm doing it as of January 1st because I know (inaudible at 41:55) enrollment is in December.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, good. So I haven't gotten any (inaudible at 41:58) but I'm sure they will start (crosstalk) [00:42:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I will (inaudible at 42:02) to that. Well, essentially I am going to, the reason that I am doing that is (pause) so that I can balance bills. So you will have, it will probably be a $25 probably (inaudible at 42:24) essentially. The recording is going to continue. I have talked to them and they said that it will continue through the foreseeable future so I assume that he (ph) is at least six months to a year and probably longer than that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay that is great. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that will cover most of (inaudible at 42:46) for anyway in terms of 25 bucks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay that is no problem. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although you may also have a deductible with that-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what the new program [I need] (ph) is, but I basically just have to investigate one. [00:43:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know when open enrollment starts?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If there is anything else you need or need to know-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perfect. Will do. Thank you. So, I will see you next week. [00:43:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will see you next week.</p>

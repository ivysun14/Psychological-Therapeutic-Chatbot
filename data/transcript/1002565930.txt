<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, [PATIENT NAME].  Well, um, all right, so what's been going on with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, we did that last—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	ECT.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, ECT which was, uh, the 6th one.  We did those first 5.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um like I'd mentioned when we did the first bunch, um, it was like maybe a week and a half to 2 weeks before I felt anything and then the only thing that's really changed at that time was, um, I started sleeping a little better instead of the couple hours, you know, I was getting 4 or 5 hours and my appetite started getting a little better.  Um, now we did this last, that was it.  The, the rest of the um, depression is pretty much hanging in there.  Uh, now we did the last one, the sixth one on the [DATE] and, um, I didn't call you, you know, that, like the next, we did that I think on a Friday or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't call you right away Monday.  I waited until Thursday or Friday.  Again I wanted to kind of see what was what and I called you about a week later and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, to let you know that for the most part, it was kind of the same thing.  I mean, um, my sleeping has gone, well, it's, right now it's probably, I'm going to say 4 to 6 hours a night of steady sleep.  I mean that, again, since we did the first 5—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That is definitely a change compared to just having a couple a then maybe another hour and then another, you know, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was all broken up.  And the appetite, actually I think I'm at the point now where, um, me at times eating too much.  My, my, my snacks and stuff.  You know, I'm a diabetic, insulin diabetic and so that's not always good, but it's, you know, I'm probably eating my 18,000, 1,800 to 2,000 calories now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like I say at times I, I get the munchies a lot at times sort of speak I guess you might call it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that, you know, that's there yet, but kind of like the first time, but, you know, [PHYSICIAN NAME], you know, the main thing, I shouldn't say the main thing.  I mean, you know, those are, you know, sleeping is a good thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, you need that and that is, you know, it's gotten somewhat better, but, you know, I mean, you know, this, this, you know, the, the initiative, you know, you know, at, um, you know, the drive, the fatigue is just, you know, all the, and the sleeping.  I mean even though I'm getting more sleep now, 4 to 6 hours of, of decent sleep, um, just the other day again at the house, you know, I do all the shopping and, you know, the washing and the cleaning.  I'm, you know, I'm the dad at home and, you know, I had gone out and I had done, you know, a Home Depot, a Walgreens and I went to Pick and Save where I spent probably a good 45 minutes food shopping and this was around 3:00, 3:30 in the afternoon.  I mean even though, you know, whatever I got that night for sleep, I had to almost slap myself to stay awake driving home in the car which wasn't good and this happens almost every night.  I'll be sitting at home, you know, watching TV in the evening now and, and, you know, and I mean like by 7:00, I may doze off for an hour.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, just like that cause I'm so tired.  I can't stay awake.  And then, you know, luckily I will go back to sleep because that was the other thing where I couldn't get back to sleep before—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Once I woke up.  So the sleeping thing, even though I'm getting a little more sleep at night, the fatigue and the tiredness is there throughout the day whether I'm at PT, um, you know, um, I'm doing a lot of projects at home now.  In fact, the bathroom's next.  I'll be remodeling done.  I had concrete work done.  I've been doing a lot of work outside, you know, on, on relandscaping and seeding and all that kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I mean I'm really trying to really get into this thing and stay busy, uh, talking to more people.  You know, I, I understand all that stuff, you know, but, you know, it, unfortunately that, that kind of thing, everything I do that I've explained to you whether it's going to the Pick and Save or whatever it might be, I have to force myself to do.  If I didn't, I would—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just be sitting doing nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old are you now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[AGE].  In fact, next month I'll be [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, is it that you have to force yourself because you're more fatigued or force yourself because you're more depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'd have to say it's, it's a, you know, it's a combination of both.  You know, the fatigue and, and un, you know, unfortunately, I don't know where it all came from.  I know it did get worse with the depression, but I've been fighting fatigue for a while now.  Now with the diabetes and my back and hip problem, you know, pain wise, um, but it was nothing like what it is now with the, with the depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the depression definitely, you know, increased it seemed like everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause I guess the dilemma that I've had or we've had with this is, you know, um, I mean is it that it starts with diabetes and no work and you're in sort of a circle and then you're less active and then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you're less active, you focus on problems and pain and depression and it's sort of this kind of big circle and I was hoping the ECT would kind of break the circle a little bit—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Me too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But again, [LAUGHING], but again you're not employed, um, because of, um, because of the physical things, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so, you know, that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the physical things, but what topped it off was finally when the depression got that bad.  I mean my wife and daughter said they seen it probably 4 or 5 months which she explained to you I think before I ever even noticed it.  She says no, you, you, you were starting to show signs of just sitting around doing nothing before it got this bad.  Maybe when my mom passed away, that was maybe the thing that topped it all off, I don't know, but, um, worst having to stop work because, you know, I was dealing with a lot of hard issues and then my hip and back and stuff, I was falling down at work because the pains were so bad.  You know, a lot of different things in there at that time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now I've been dealing with a lot of that.  I mean I, my hip and back I don't want to say are, they're still there, it's still a problem.  I'm off of all them narcotics except for the hydrocodone, which I take every now and then now, you know, when I have to.  I'm using the lidocaine patches, which are nonnarcotic, which are so so.  Um, it's hard.  I mean doing things especially outside where I was outside, I mean it's, I, I feel it.  At night, I mean I'm hurting.  There's no 2 ways about it, but it's like if I don't keep pushing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not going to get better and actually it should, the exercise should help my back and, and hip to some degree.  I mean as long as I don't go crazy with it, but it, you know, it's just like it's like, like I can't get out of that, that, that rundown, you know, no ambition, you know, no drive mode and that's, that's a biggie.  I mean that's like you said I was working.  I worked all my life.  I enjoyed working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's not there now even though I'm trying to fill it in with whatever I can do, um, and I don't, you know, I, and I don't remember which one it was, but I had mentioned to you back when I was going to, you know, to, to the, to the college, to, um, [DEIDENTIFIED] and I was seeing the other doctor.  There were, there were 2 times when I was on pills.  Unfortunately, they were like 2 or 3 day things and it was like one of these things where you almost snap your fingers, you'd wake up on the morning and it's like, oh, my God, you know, what's, you know, I mean I actually, I, I, I was myself again sort of speak for those 2 or 3 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But as fast as they came, they went away.  Well, he increased the medication and added to it another medication, you know, trying to figure out, but it never came back again.  And that happened twice in that year, better than a year that I was with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I, I don't know.  My thing I mentioned to you I think on the phone is that I, as much as I don't want anymore medications or deal with that kind of stuff, you know, you know, I've been the psychologist route.  You know, I can pretty much tell them what they're going to say, you know, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and, and, and, you know, I'm trying to do what I can on the outside.  I more than understand that, um, but again, you know, I got that little bit of help those short times and I'm thinking am I, I, I can't, you know, it's, it's so deep I guess that I can't do this by myself.  I'm going to need additional help, meaning, you know, the medication or something.  We did the ECT's, which I hoped was the same thing like you said, I was going to come out of this in, in a week or 2 and be a lot closer to being normal, but, you know, it's not just happening to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  It sounds like, I mean the ECT helped.  I mean it moved you from really low to medium low or something.  I mean that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] impression, but you're not, but and I don't know what to say when, you know, when I hear stories that somebody had 2 days here and 2 days there.  I mean technically that's not how antidepressants and, are supposed to work.  I mean they're supposed to, you start feeling better and you get better and better—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you even out.  So whether it was just incidental that you had, I mean I hear people say that all the time, um, and again I, I mean what are the possibilities of why you feel this way?  I mean what is, it's pure depression and if we could only find the right medicine or treatment and get better, things would be better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The other extreme it's pure physical that, um, you know, you're age, diabetes, chronic pain, uh, and, and who knows, you know, sometimes there are other things, chronic fatigue syndrome, there's viruses, you know, like that and more—and I'm not saying you have that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that would be the other extreme and then, of course, everything is somewhere in the middle which probably is some combination of what you're describing.  Um, and, and then you add the psychosocial factors of not working anymore and I think that still plays a big role in your psyche.  I mean we're, we're often defined by our work role in, in society.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  I, I probably don't like that it's that way now, but I know because this is, next month it's going to 21/2 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This started in June of '06 when I started at the college and, and, you know, it's, it's, just, I, I, it's at the point now when I think about that, it's, it's a depressant in itself.  You know, it's like I've lost 21/2 years of my life.  That's the way I'm looking at it, you know, and, you know, I want and I don't want that to be that way, you know?  I want it, I want to get back to where I was.  So, you know, the work thing, it's almost at the point now where like, you know, I've driven into my head like the psychiatrists have said, the psychologists have said too, you know, as far as, you know,  how you look at it that, you know, it's there.  Maybe you look at it as an early retirement even though you didn't retire early.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's like, okay, you know, I'm here, I've got a ton of stuff around the house to do because I've been neglecting it for the last couple of years because of this I guess.  You know I can work with that now.  I can go ahead and do things.  I can get in the hobbies that I wanted to do, you know, that I, I couldn't do before because of work.  I mean I, I, I was a workaholic really.  I mean I did, put a lot of time in that work, uh, being in management for the last, you know, 20 some years and, and, but it's at the point now where I, I don't ponder on that kind of stuff.  The thing I did about, you know, really, you know, feeling bad about my wife and hurting her, yeah, it's there.  It's going to be there until hopefully one day I get kind of to myself again, but it's like, you know, and the therapists said, you know, it, she's there, she's accepting this, she's working with me and that's the way I've got to look at it so that's the way I look at it.  So, you know, I've heard these things so many times whether it was in a group or whatever that it's not really something that's strangling me day after day after day.  You know, I want to get better.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, no, I, I'm not implying that you don't or that, um, I'm just saying that these are all factors [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That contribute—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Could contribute, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, well, let's go over your current meds.  Um, right now we don't have you on any antidepressants.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't been on anything since you took me off, well, just before we started the ECTs and went off the Paxil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I took you off, but, right, for the ECT, but also because of the Emsam and we stopped all previous antidepressants.  So you're on no antidepressants.  All right.  We've tried Emsam and I even had you up to the 9 mg, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You, I think we did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The higher dose, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And I think the reason we stopped was because I thought that one of the side effects, the headache was in there or something if I remember right, but now I'm finding out that, you know, that it may not have been the problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but it didn't seem to necessarily help you either all that much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For the time I took it, no, I mean I wasn't on it real, real long, but, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ever, I mean sometimes, okay, what else could we do?  Um, have we ever tried to augment lithium?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lithium.  Have you ever been on lithium?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't believe so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think so either, yeah.  I don't recall it.  And what about the tricyclides like nortriptyline, amitriptyline, Tofranil, or azipramine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] have no idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The older medications, yeah.  I didn't know.  I mean that, I guess that's where I would go next and, well, oh, let me ask you.  So we did the ECT—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean did you feel that after that you got at least a little bit of a boost?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, no, again it was that first week, I mean that was like everything seemed the same and then going into that second week when I called you that following Monday—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're talking about—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	After the last ECT?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	After the last ECT—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There was a week span there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then that, that Monday after that then which was a little over a week I called and left you a message—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, uh, again what I, what I noticed maybe was at times maybe again another half hour added to the sleep, maybe an hour.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In terms of mood—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that's the, that's the kicker.  I just can't get this freaking mood thing, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So it, it didn't, so maybe it helped possibly with a little bit of sleep or something, but it didn't really help your mood at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, and, and it did seem like you got a bit better after we did 5 in a row, but it didn't last very long and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, and it didn't address the mood issue at all and that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kind of stuff, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sleep got a little better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The drive and—yeah, it was just the sleep and the eating that seemed to change with the ECT.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, I think what we should do is, uh, in the past, uh, you know, in the past I used to start people when, in your position on a tricyclic antidepressant and try to augment with lithium.  Emsam has come out, since it came out, I've been using that a lot more with some good success, but it didn't seem to help you all that much.  So my thought would be to, uh, go back to what I used to do and try nortriptyline which it's been around since the 60's.  It's an older antidepressant.  You start off at a low dose and slowly go up, but to try to augment that with also adding lithium and I've had some success with that in the past.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's the lithium now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lithium is a mood stabilizer and that's been around forever too since the 50's, um, and my thought as I often do kind of a low dose like 300 mg a day.  We give lithium for people with antidepressant [INAUDIBLE] bipolar, but the doses there tend to be like 9 to 1200 mg and my thought was to keep it low and to get up on a decent dose of nortriptyline like 75 to 100, um, get you on the lithium 300 and give it some time.  And again the main reason antidepressants don't work is that patients aren't at a high enough dose for a long enough time period.  So we do need to give it, you know, you know, like a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Before we give up, but that's, that's where I would go now.  I mean the good news still is like you said, I mean I got you off those narcotics, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, you scared me actually when you were talking about, you know, the possible things that it can contribute to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm like, no, that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, and your pain is not necessarily any worse off the narcotics and you're less drugged.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, no, not really.  Maybe I'm, I'm not as active.  Maybe that was part of it too where I was, you know, more physical before.  Maybe that contributed to something where now it's a little more docile but, um, I mean it's there.  I mean I've got my days when—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm in bad pain, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just dealing with it the way, the best way I can between the, the lidocaine patches and then, uh, like I say which is a nonnarcotic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's really superficial, but, you know, at times they help a little bit too and then the hydro.  I mean the hydrocodone that's, that's it.  I'll take that maybe, uh, a couple tablets, you know, off and on throughout the week as I need it.  That's it.  I'm not taking, you know, I'm done with the narcotics if I can help it.  So, but, yeah, you did and I talked to you about it and, you know, the possibility of it, and I've heard if from other doctors since you've mentioned that to me too about what narcotics can do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, I, I don't need that.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now nortriptyline, the side—you take it at bedtime.  The good side effects, well, I could even do something more—they have an anticolonergic side effects and anticolonergic side effects are sedation.  So that might be good helping people sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, but, um, orthostatic hypotension.  Sometimes diabetics have problems with this where you blood pressure kind of, when you stand up really quick, but I mean someone your age probably won't have that much of a problem and it's harder—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am having that problem.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, diabetics tend to have issues with, um, with, uh, their own gnomic nervous system.  So getting up—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really quickly, um, you might feel dizzy, you know, a little bit.  You might have to kind of get up slowly like not just go from lying down to jumping out of bed and running someplace, you know, cause it could—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, sometimes urinary retention is a little bit of a problem with anticolonergic drugs and constipation can be a problem sometimes.  So we'll just have to see.  Um, that's why we start off with low dose, 25 mg my thought would be for, for 4 days and increase to 50 and then increase to 75 and at the same time start lithium, 300 mg in the morning and let's start with that and then let's give that like 4 weeks and see where you are, um, cause I want to be, I don't want to go up too fast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To these depressant drugs, you know, you've got a list of them.  I think I brought in everything I was on at, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].  I mean then, so then like what you, want to start me on on now, that like is different than the Cymbalta and all this other stuff I was on before then or whatever?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, they, they often try to effect different neurotransmitters in the brain.  I mean the 3 main ones are serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.  So all the drugs, that's the goal of trying to increase that and that's the, the Emsam what I like is it affects all 3 of them but they have different mechanisms to doing it and again we're not sophisticated enough to say, you know, X person should get this drug and another person should get that drug.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes it's just a clinical experience and, and a matter of trying one thing and another, but I don't think you've been on these.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I don't believe so either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And because a lot of the docs, uh, aren't using them because they're, they grew up after these, you know?  These were drugs used more like in the 60's and 70's and then in the 80's when kind of Prozac came out, the SSRI's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A lot of people kind of got rid of those older drugs because they tend to have, they're more complicated and they have more side effects, but sometimes they still work better than the other ones and, you know, I guess what I'm debating in my mind, should I give you nortriptyline which tends to be a little less anticolonergic or should I give you something like imipramine which is much more anticolonergic, but maybe that will help you sleep better and, and sometimes it can help with pain too.  We used to use amitriptyline and sometimes we still do for people with chronic pain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've heard of that, yeah.  Amitriptyline, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you've never been on that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so, no, but I've heard it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought too that I've seem a few on TV and again just, you know, even you know better than I do, but on TV the new, going back to the newer medications, I thought I saw 1 or 2 advertising now that are like brand new depressant drugs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like Cymbalta or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I was on Cymbalta.  That didn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's nothing that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Isn't there?  Well, maybe it was something else then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's nothing that, I mean they are advertising, but I think even on the sort of more—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The newer [INAUDIBLE], yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, that's what I'm just debating about in terms of which medication.  Maybe I will give you imi, uh, imipramine [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So the, the fact of my, the diabetes and my age plays into this too then, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it certainly does.  I mean diabetics one, do have a higher rate of depression, they tend to and, and that treating can actually be helpful, but usually, I mean my experience is, lots of diabetics who are depressed will respond to a Zoloft or Paxil or Prozac, you know, the commonly—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Used things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, but certainly diabetes in itself just has so many medical, how many years have you had—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's been like 12 years now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it's been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're already having—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've got neuropathy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Problems and heart and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See I mean that alone could be playing a role in your energy level and what are you blood sugars running?  Are they fairly controlled?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not, they're coming back and better.  I mean I've always had them, I'm going to say for the most part they're under control, yeah, but then, you know, there was a good, that probably in the past year or so it was really rough.  I mean I was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They were all over the place and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See and that, that can play a big role in just your general how you feel and everything, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, no, I've, I've been religious.  I mean this, that's what actually, this is, I mean this is like my, my Bible.  I mean every day goes in here, you know, and I write down what I eat, what I take as far as insulin and, and, you know, I've even started noticing the sleeping.  I've [INAUDIBLE] for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what, what, like what was your blood sugar this morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, well, well, actually I was up at, I got up at 6:15 and I stayed up.  Um, I was low.  I had a 54.  So I had some—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, cranberry juice and that brought me up and 9:15 when I had breakfast before I came in here I was a 129.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, I mean do you run in 2 and 300's sometimes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah, I'll catch them every now and then, oh, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but from what I understand from everybody that those of us that try to control it, you end up having more lows, you know, because that's just it, you're trying to control it and keep it in that 80 to 90—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Area and, and I do.  I've had my problem in the past and, in fact, and I don't know if you've heard it, but that's what they, uh, explained to me.  I think [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] did.  Is that that's where, they don't know a whole lot about if you have tons of highs other than the fact that I mean you could go into a coma, you know, I guess—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Die.  But on the low end of things, the one thing that was explained to me is that people that tend to have a lot of lows, they do see some type of, um, loss in, in memory retention from low blood sugars.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm pretty sure he's the one that told me that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I, I could, I mean I, it's a—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Having diabetes is a—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because throughout the last 3 or 4 years, that's something that started even before this depression hit me and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was, you know, retaining things, remembering things, even things that I had known for years.  It's like I really had to think about them or I just forget about it, you know?  And it's like why, you know?  And I'm kind of in the engineering field and you can't really do that.  You need to be able to, you know, remember things and, and oh, that's the other thing too.  I, I wanted to, I did try out an insulin pump back about 5 years ago—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, just a trial with the saline.  They sent me home with that.  I was here in [DEIDENTIFIED] and, um, and because of work I think and everything else at that time, it just didn't fit my lifestyle to, to go with the pump.  Um, I kind of wish I had now because I've talked to so many people including what's his name?  That neurologist?  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?  He's been on the pump now for a long time and he [INAUDIBLE] or another—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Somewhere or anther.  Um, and I'd seen him now for this headache situation that he's got me on meds for, but and I talked to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  I seen him about 3 weeks ago for my normal 3 month checkup.  I see him every 3 months religiously, um, and I says, you know, I'm really looking at this insulin pump again.  I says, you know, the fact of dealing with this depression and, you know, having stuff all over the place for a while there, that one, this past year roughly was, has been real challenging for me.  Um, his, his thing to me was that he says you're still working with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm like, yeah, I says, you know, he just recently did another ECT.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, he says I really would like to see your depression better before we look at going on the pump, you know, and I really want to, I think, start the pump because it's just, I just talked to, you know, more and more people now that are on it and wouldn't go off of it, you know?  Their, their diabetes is controlled so much better.  Um, so, you know, I, that's another goal for me too to try and get this depression [INAUDIBLE], you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I want to get that, um, I did talk to, in fact, when I went in, I had a colonoscopy done, uh, here back about a week and a half ago and the nurse, her daughter's [AGE] and she's a diabetic and been for I guess since a kid now and she was pregnant and she was on the pump through her pregnancy, but I guess she's had a lot of problems even though she was on the pump, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  Yeah, I guess I can't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Comment on that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What I hear so, but anyway that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Something I want to get to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what, what pharmacy do you use?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, Walgreens on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have the zip code there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] I think is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], okay, let's see.  Walgreens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Their number is [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Let me, hang on a second.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm pretty sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Their number is [DEIDENTIFIED] what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See if I can find it that way.  Yeah, here, [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  I'm going to send this to them directly so you can just go pick it up, but here are instructions.  So you go up, you start with imipramine.  It's a 25 mg tab.  So I said 1 at bedtime for 4 days, then go up to 50 mg so that would be 2, you know, for 4 days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then 3 tablets, 75 for 4 days and just keep going up to 150.  Now if you have problems, let's say you get up to 75 mg and it's time to go to 100 and you go to 100 and you go, God, I just don't feel good on this, just go back to the 75 for maybe a couple more days and then try it again to go up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you don't have to be rigid with going up as, you know, quickly as this.  You can spread it out a little bit more.  But the goal is to try to get up to a more therapeutic dose like around 150 mg and I'm also sending in Eskalith or lithium and you start that 300 mg in the morning.  So you haven't been on either of these meds.  So this is sort of a new start.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is 1 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just 1?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'll say it on the prescription, but this is what I want you to do cause I can't put that into my computer—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here.  Um, and if you have some problems or something, give me a call and let's give it a month and see where things are and then come on back.  Um, so I'm going to send this to them directly so you can just go and pick it up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right.  It's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But these are combinations that you've kind of had success with in the past then or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess there's no—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I and other people, but, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Guarantee.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're, you're sort of in the more difficult treatment and resistant depression.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then we're starting to get into a little bit more of esoteric—type things and it's just a matter of trying.  There's things like adding, sometimes we've added thyroid, um, um, to help.  Sometimes, [LAUGHING], I can only tell you when I was a resident in [DEIDENTIFIED], I had a, a patient who was a psychiatrist who was an older lady who we were, I was rotating through the private hospital there and she ended up on my service and, and everyone had given up on her and, um, being a bit of a naïve resident, I felt sorry for her.  So I started her on, I took her off Stelazine which she was on.  She had ECT too and she had all sorts of side effects from her meds and put her on lithium, nortriptyline, and thyroid all on the same day and 3 days later, she was totally back to normal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that was just 1 person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.  Yeah, yeah, no, no, I understand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you never know.  Um, all right.  Let's set up a follow up appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Uh, when you do the ECT's then, you, it's not like medication where you can go, you know, from 25, 50, to 100.  You, you know, a panel where you can change what you do up there or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, in terms of the dosing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, how you do it I guess.  Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we, it's sort of a bit of the same each time, but each time you often have to increase the l, the power that you're getting.  You get a little bit more total jules or electricity because, um, it becomes a little harder each time to get another seizure, but the whole point is to get a seizure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So whatever it takes—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's the benefit, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I guess I haven't been super impressed that it's been that helpful for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	ECT is often—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thought of our best, as our best treatment for depression, but I do have people who don't seem to respond that well and that, um, trying different meds has helped when ECT has failed, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, often or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It, it's more often than reverse that, that we do the ECT and people are helped, but again your depression is a bit atypical, but, well, let's meet in December.  Um, what about, uh, Wednesday, [DATE] at 11:00?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE]?  Nothing on that date.  That looks good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll give you a card.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On the [DATE] I see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] over at the college.  He's a neurologist over there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what are you seeing him for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was dealing with my, my neuropathy and, and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I had a swallowing problem for a while and just some different things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, don't get on more narcotics.  That's my—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  All right.  Let's meet [DATE] and we're going to do imipramine increase to 150.  You won't, um, and call if there's any problems with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So here's the directions, here's the appointment, and I'll, I'll see you in a month—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And hopefully things will get better.  Take care of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I mean I, I'm hoping nobody can ever say that I, you know, I'm not trying because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, but, you know, I—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know there's no one cure, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I think sometimes expectations, you know, it's hard to hear this, but I mean when, but considering not working, chronic pain and diabetes, chronic illness that, that instead of feeling a 10 out of a 10, you might have to accept being 7 out of 10—</p>

PT:	Seven out of 10.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's just where your, you know, thing is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hope to see you next month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, [PHYSICIAN NAME].  Thank you.</p>

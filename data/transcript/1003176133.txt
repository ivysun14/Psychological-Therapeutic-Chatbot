<p><b><u>SESSION TRANSCRIPT:</u></b></p>

<p>Robert Powers: I don't know if we did meet before when we were out here; I can't remember.</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: But in any case, as far as I know—</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: —you and I just got acquainted. And all I know about you is that your father lives with you—</p>

<p>Jim: That's it.</p>

<p>Powers: —and that he has all the marks of longevity, from what you've told me.</p>

<p>Jim: That's it.</p>

<p>Powers: What are we going to talk about?</p>

<p>Jim: Neuropathy. Phantom pains.</p>

<p>Powers: What are they?</p>

<p>Jim: Phantom pains.</p>

<p>Powers: In the limbs that aren't there?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh. I don't know very much about it. I suppose you know there's a great literature about it, I suppose, huh?</p>

<p>Jim: Just from what I've experienced, I guess.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. I guess, though, there's a lot of the doctors can tell you things about them and so forth.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: So I have the advantage of not knowing anything about it—</p>

<p>Jim: Right.</p>

<p>Powers: —so you'll have to instruct me as I go along. Only that there is such—</p>

<p>Jim: Okay.</p>

<p>Powers: —such a thing. Where do you experience them?</p>

<p>Jim: Legs. Not so much the arms. The arm. Phantom pain is, to me, when I got hit in ‘Nam, I came to in the hospital and I could feel everything down there.</p>

<p>Powers: Yes.</p>

<p>Jim: I feel like I'm sitting here now, my feet are on the floor. Okay?</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. You have the sensation of your feet being on the floor.</p>

<p>Jim: It's all there.</p>

<p>Powers: Good. Okay.</p>

<p>Jim: The whole time I was in ‘Nam, I was medicated very heavily. And when I got stateside they cut you off. October 21... I went 21 days getting, then all of a sudden, the 21st of October, nothing. And I had extreme phantom pains and I didn't know why. I had no idea why.</p>

<p>Powers: No one had told you this—</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: —might be there.</p>

<p>Jim: And at that time, I had a doctor that stood next to my bed about 11:00 at night and said, "Son, it is all in your head. The limbs are gone. You do not have the pains." So I laid there for a few weeks telling myself they were gone. But the pains were there.</p>

<p>Powers: Sure.</p>

<p>Jim: And it seems to hit when the weather changes, when it gets cold and damp. But the, I guess, weird part is I get it more in the legs, extremely bad in the legs at the time. But very seldom in the left arm.</p>

<p>Powers: Describe to me... Let's speak of your legs, where the pain is, and so on. As you just introduced them to me, as far as I'm concerned, they're, your feet are touching the floor just as you said. You can feel it, all of that, and the whole, that whole portion of your body. Where is the pain located in the lower leg? What...</p>

<p>Jim: Arch of the foot.</p>

<p>Powers: In the arch of the foot. Is it like a cramp, like a...</p>

<p>Jim: No, basically it's like a cramp most of the time, all the time. But when the weather changes, it feels like somebody taking a red-hot knife and sticking it in the arch of the foot and peeling back. And...</p>

<p>Powers: So it feels like it's being laid open.</p>

<p>Jim: Right.</p>

<p>Powers: Which foot?</p>

<p>Jim: It always varies. The majority of the time I'd say it's the right.</p>

<p>Powers: Let's just stay with the right foot first, then, okay?</p>

<p>Jim: Okay.</p>

<p>Powers: And talk about it. Let me ask you first, is there any distinction at all between the experience of the right foot and the left foot? Is there difference in the way the right foot experiences the pain?</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: You had to think for a moment, and I want you to take the time. If there's a difference, if they feel it differently, I'd like to know what the difference is.</p>

<p>Jim: No, I don't think there's any difference.</p>

<p>Powers: You'd use the same image both times.</p>

<p>Jim: Yes.</p>

<p>Powers: It's as if a heated blade were entering the flesh and laying it open.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Just as if it...</p>

<p>Jim: Just peeling it back.</p>

<p>Powers: Peeling it back like a blade opening it up?</p>

<p>Jim: Just like filleting a fish.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, like filleting a fish, cutting the whole sole off the foot.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: What do you know about filleting and all the rest of that kind of stuff? What, what is your experience with...</p>

<p>Jim: Just fishing. Everybody...</p>

<p>Powers: Did you fish as a boy?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes, but I never got into filleting the fish.</p>

<p>Powers: How did you choose that image, then, of filleting a fish?'</p>

<p>Jim: Well, the way you were trying to describe it, just peeling it away.</p>

<p>Powers: All right. Let's talk about any pain you have ever had in your childhood. Any physical pain that you suffered as a child?</p>

<p>Jim: Polio when I was a kid.</p>

<p>Powers: Where did you...</p>

<p>Jim: I was paralyzed from the waist down.</p>

<p>Powers: And how old were you when you had...</p>

<p>Jim: Six.</p>

<p>Powers: How old are you now, Jim?</p>

<p>Jim: Forty-two.</p>

<p>Powers: So that's, we're talking something that happened 36 years ago, huh?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Thirty-six years ago is ‘53, 1953. And where were you living then?</p>

<p>Jim: Innsdale, Illinois. Mother and father and a kid sister.</p>

<p>Powers: And in ‘53 had the Salk vaccine and so on not been developed as...</p>

<p>Jim: Yes, it had. I had received two of the vaccinations. I was due to go in Monday and get my third one, and Friday I came down with an extreme headache. Parents rushed me to the hospital after laying there for about 24 hours, I guess, crying. And they turned around and told my parents that I'd be paralyzed from the waist down after they did a spinal on me for... That I'd never walk again.</p>

<p>Powers: Did you hear that? Did you hear them say that?</p>

<p>Jim: No, that's what my parents told me.</p>

<p>Powers: Afterward.</p>

<p>Jim: Yes.</p>

<p>Powers: They didn't tell you at the time.</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: Only after you were recovered.</p>

<p>Jim: Not even after I was recovered. During recovery.</p>

<p>Powers: As you were recovering.</p>

<p>Jim: While I was in the hospital, yes. Because they said he'd never walk again, you know, talking to my dad, I guess, was...</p>

<p>Powers: But they told you that only after you had begun to recover the use of your legs again.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>Powers: Did you make a full recovery?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes, good enough for the Army to take me in ‘67.</p>

<p>Powers: Exactly. At six years old, of course, your memory of that event in your life is probably episodic—you have a number of slides, huh?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: It's like you have a certain number of them that you can—</p>

<p>Jim: Yes.</p>

<p>Powers: —focus on. Would you run through the slides for me and let me have one shot at a time so I get it, you know, frame by frame, rather than continuous?</p>

<p>Jim: Mother in and out of the hospital, state hospital, quite often, about every 18 months.</p>

<p>Powers: Now, wait a minute. No, I want one shot.</p>

<p>Jim: Oh, one shot.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah, the slide. One slide at a time. What do you, what are you remembering about Mother's hospitalization?</p>

<p>Jim: State hospital.</p>

<p>Powers: Going to visit her there?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Is this before the polio?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes. From the time I was an infant, just about.</p>

<p>Powers: How did you connect it to the polio? I didn't... I was taken off guard there somehow. I wanted to get this polio experience straight. Maybe I didn't make myself clear.</p>

<p>Jim: No. I misunderstood you.</p>

<p>Powers: Okay, I'm sorry. Let's start again with the polio.</p>

<p>Jim: Okay.</p>

<p>Powers: I'm interested to know about the mother's illness, but I want to go back to it, okay? Because the polio, you remember the headache.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: You were due to go in to the doctor on Monday, and this is on a Friday?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: And what do you remember about that experience of the headache and so on? What, what can you remember of that day?</p>

<p>Jim: Laying on the sofa and crying.</p>

<p>Powers: And you say it took them a long time before they took you seriously?</p>

<p>Jim: Seems to be, yeah, that's the way it comes back.</p>

<p>Powers: Who finally took into account that you were in pain? Who, who...</p>

<p>Jim: I think it was my mother.</p>

<p>Powers: And they took you...</p>

<p>Jim: And she got hold of my dad at work and they took me to the hospital. I don't know if she called or, you know, and they said, "Bring him on into the hospital." Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Now, let's pick a moment in time that's most vivid in all of that, that you can sort of see the surroundings. Are you on the couch?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: And the feeling of pain just overwhelms everything else, it seems to me.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: How do you feel about the fact that no one's taking this seriously? That no one's responding to this pain?</p>

<p>Jim: I think it's terrified.</p>

<p>Powers: Terrified?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Tell me more about terrified.</p>

<p>Jim: Well, just upset, really angry because they're not, you know, paying much attention to me, even though Mom was, she had given me a couple aspirins or whatever it was she gave me, you know.</p>

<p>Powers: Terrified is different from angry. Which one was it?</p>

<p>Jim: Terrified that nobody knew what was going on.</p>

<p>Powers: I see. Something...</p>

<p>Jim: And why weren't they doing something, really?</p>

<p>Powers: I get it, I get it. "Something awful is happening to me."</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: "And nobody's doing anything about it."</p>

<p>Jim: Didn't seem to be at the time.</p>

<p>Powers: Okay, yeah. What's the next thing you remember? The next moment in time. The next slide I can see</p>

<p>Jim: Having the spinal done.</p>

<p>Powers: What, what, just get me into that moment. Where are you?</p>

<p>Jim: Having the spinal tap in the emergency room, and several nurses holding me down and the doctor, in a fetal position, injecting, or sticking in the syringe and taking out the fluid of the spine. And screaming my head off.</p>

<p>Powers: It's painful.</p>

<p>Jim: Very.</p>

<p>Powers: That procedure. Your mother's not present or father's not present?</p>

<p>Jim: No, my mother died after I got hit.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, no...</p>

<p>Jim: Oh, back then. Okay.</p>

<p>Powers: In this room.</p>

<p>Jim: Okay. No, they were right outside the emergency room.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. And you were crying out in the pain of this...</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: What is your idea about what they're doing? You're six years old—you don't have much of an idea, do you, what this procedure is?</p>

<p>Jim: Seemed to be they weren't doing anything.</p>

<p>Powers: No, I mean this procedure with the needle. Holding you down and all the rest.</p>

<p>Jim: Oh.</p>

<p>Powers: What did you think they were doing?</p>

<p>Jim: I didn't know. I did not know.</p>

<p>Powers: Did you think it was... I wanted to get into the feeling of that. "Are these people on my side? Or have my parents turned me over to the, to these strangers who are doing even worse things to me?"</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah. I had no idea.</p>

<p>Powers: You couldn't get that straight, didn't understand what's going on here.</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: Okay. What's the next thing that you remember?</p>

<p>Jim: Being in an isolation room where my parents couldn't go past the door and looking out the window at my kid sister about two floors, maybe three floors below playing outside.</p>

<p>Powers: What's your feeling?</p>

<p>Jim: I wish I was out there with her.</p>

<p>Powers: And instead you're cooped up.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Sort of the feeling of being locked in.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Okay. You have any more incidents from that period?</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you remember coming out of the hospital afterward?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes, well, a little.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you remember when your father told you that they didn't expect you ever to be able to walk again?</p>

<p>Jim: No, not really.</p>

<p>Powers: You don't remember that. You only know it happened.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. So somehow or other, you just found your courage again, you came out of the hospital. Was there anyone who encouraged you while you were in hospital?</p>

<p>Jim: Physical therapist.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you remember that person?</p>

<p>Jim: Strong male. Male physical therapist. Just worked with me constantly. Heat packs. Scalding baths. Yeah. Submerged in water. Yeah. And just telling me, "Do it, do it, do it," all the time.</p>

<p>Powers: He believed in you, and somehow—</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, I believed in him.</p>

<p>Powers: —it encouraged... And you did. You remember any one incident in your work with him? See if you can...</p>

<p>Jim: Him trying to get me to wiggle my toes on my right foot.</p>

<p>Powers: Tell me about it. Where are you?</p>

<p>Jim: Lying on a table in physical therapy and him wrapping my legs in scalding hot towels.</p>

<p>Powers: Yes. And?</p>

<p>Jim: And it being very painful.</p>

<p>Powers: Yes.</p>

<p>Jim: And hurting.</p>

<p>Powers: But you trusted him.</p>

<p>Jim: Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Powers: You knew he was doing this for your sake.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Can you tell me about the toes?</p>

<p>Jim: Seemed to wiggle. The big one. Just a little bit.</p>

<p>Powers: How did you feel?</p>

<p>Jim: Ecstatic.</p>

<p>Powers: Triumph!</p>

<p>Jim: Yes.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. That the life was coming back again.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Any other feeling in the foot?</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: Can you feel that toe move now?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes, I can feel that toe now, yes.</p>

<p>Powers: When you tell me the story?</p>

<p>Jim: Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Powers: Because even in the story from all those years ago, the movement of that toe and the triumph is still there.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: All right, now come out of the hospital. What happened afterward?</p>

<p>Jim: Going home. Had to go back past places that I used to play when I was capable of playing with all the other kids.</p>

<p>Powers: How did you feel?</p>

<p>Jim: Like I'm going to be in the house the rest of my life, because they said I still wasn't going to walk.</p>

<p>Powers: Did you know that then?</p>

<p>Jim: That I was going to walk, that I wasn't going to walk?</p>

<p>Powers: No, that you said, "I feel like I'll be in the house the rest of my life." Had they told you you won't walk?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, they had told me I wouldn't walk.</p>

<p>Powers: So you believed it.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah. But down deep, no.</p>

<p>Powers: Ahh.</p>

<p>Jim: Definitely, down deep, no.</p>

<p>Powers: Well, tell me about...</p>

<p>Jim: Because I had seen the toe move. I made the toe move.</p>

<p>Powers: It was enough.</p>

<p>Jim: That was enough help.</p>

<p>Powers: So you're driving home from the hospital, you're going by all these places. And they think I'm going to be in the house the rest of my life. But deep down what do you think?</p>

<p>Jim: I'm outta here.</p>

<p>Powers: You did believe you will overcome it.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: How did you do it then?</p>

<p>Jim: By getting super ticked off at my dad. The doctors had told him to get rid of my horse because I had a horse when I was little, and because I idolized the horse too much. And my dad got rid of the horse. And I guess it was about six months I went without speaking to Dad.</p>

<p>Powers: How did that help you?</p>

<p>Jim: More determined that I was going to make myself walk again.</p>

<p>Powers: Did you... And how did you go about it?</p>

<p>Jim: Lots of therapy. Mom working with me on the dining room table. Don't remember Dad working on me too much. It was mostly Mom.</p>

<p>Powers: So you were furious with him that he sold that horse.</p>

<p>Jim: Oh, definitely.</p>

<p>Powers: Did he know it, that's why you weren't talking to him?</p>

<p>Jim: Oh, I would imagine he knew it.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah, yeah. Because you were punishing him.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: How come you, after six months, you started talking to him again?</p>

<p>Jim: I don't know. Maybe I started moving my legs more. I really don't know.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you remember anything in that period, that six-month period, that you can tell me of your mother's working with you on the dining room table?</p>

<p>Jim: No, not really.</p>

<p>Powers: Anything in that period? Do you remember the day he sold the horse?</p>

<p>Jim: No, I wasn't there.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you remember when you learnt that he sold the horse?</p>

<p>Jim: I was in the hospital, back.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, you were still in the hospital.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, I was still in the hospital when...</p>

<p>Powers: How did you learn that he sold it?</p>

<p>Jim: I, I don't remember who told me that he had sold Big Boy, the horse.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you remember how you felt?</p>

<p>Jim: Crushed.</p>

<p>Powers: So, "It's bad enough that I'm sick—they have to sell my horse as well."</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Now, finally you overcame this polio and you restored yourself to full functioning.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: How did you do it? Tell me a little bit about how you overcame it.</p>

<p>Jim: Well, I had a lot of faith in the good Lord, and the physical therapist.</p>

<p>Powers: Tell me about the good Lord. What did you know abut him when you were six years old?</p>

<p>Jim: Not a whole lot. We had just gone to Sunday school occasionally, Easter, Christmas, and once in a while we were called back going to Sunday school when I was little.</p>

<p>Powers: Good. What did you think about when you were six years old, when you thought about the good Lord?</p>

<p>Jim: Fantastic things.</p>

<p>Powers: Like what?</p>

<p>Jim: Well, he could do just about anything. Or could do anything, I guess.</p>

<p>Powers: And how did that impress you at six years? I mean, let's just be six-year-old boys again, and you tell me about it. Do you remember having some ideas about that?</p>

<p>Jim: No, just about the stories that they were reading.</p>

<p>Powers: So somehow that helped you. You found some encouragement in that. And you continued with the physical therapist. Even after you were out of the hospital, they took you back in for these things...</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, my mom...</p>

<p>Powers: The same fella who had so much faith in you?</p>

<p>Jim: I believe so, yes.</p>

<p>Powers: You remember any more incidents with him?</p>

<p>Jim: No, just going in and out of the tubs and, probably... Definitely the parallel bars, walking again.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah? Tell me about that.</p>

<p>Jim: He used to really make me walk. Sweat it out. And just keep going.</p>

<p>Powers: Tell me one time. Let me be there with you one time, when he's really letting it out.</p>

<p>Jim: Totally exhausted at the far end of the parallel bars. I wanted my chair.</p>

<p>Powers: Pardon me?</p>

<p>Jim: I wanted my wheelchair.</p>

<p>Powers: Yes.</p>

<p>Jim: But he said no.</p>

<p>Powers: What did he make you do?</p>

<p>Jim: Go back to it. Turn around and walk back to it.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah? And what were you feeling?</p>

<p>Jim: Ticked, because he was making me do it.</p>

<p>Powers: Ticked at him, but did you do it?</p>

<p>Jim: I did it.</p>

<p>Powers: What were the physical sensations you had beside the fatigue, the exhaustion?</p>

<p>Jim: Extremely pleased with myself. Tired. Very, very happy that he could show me that, you know, it's capable, you can take one more step. Go.</p>

<p>Powers: There's more there than you believed. He believed it was there and he let you find it.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: So it was his faith in you that helped sustain you. What came to you just then?</p>

<p>Jim: Just thinking back about that therapy, and then the therapy at Fitzsimons.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah, tell me about that, what was the connection you just made?</p>

<p>Jim: When I was going to... I had a super physical therapist there also. Big fella. And Dave. And he said exactly the same thing. And you know, I was totally exhausted with the prostheses on. And he turned, I turned to him, I was at the far end of the parallel bars. And I said, "Dave, can I have my chair?" He says, "No." Turned around and walked it. And I pulled a rotten trick. I says, "You know, it gives me great pleasure to call you sir." And he goes, "Why is that, Jim?" And I said, "Because my sister's got a Saint Bernard named Sir."</p>

<p>Powers: Did he get a kick out of that?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, and he made me walk back to the ward. Yeah, he did.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, of course what I'm looking for in all of this is something we can use about this phantom pain. What is that side... All I got so far about that phantom pain in the foot is that it's like a knife filleting, as if it's taking off the bottom of the foot. And I can't get that out of all these stories where you would have had any pain like that when you were trying to walk again, when you were in those parallel bars. What did it feel like to have your foot on the floor in that exhausted state? The first time, when you had, when, it's because...</p>

<p>Jim: I don't remember that.</p>

<p>Powers: You can't remember that.</p>

<p>Jim: No,</p>

<p>Powers: Did you ever have any pain in your feet before, when you were...</p>

<p>Jim: No, just when my horse stepped on them when I was a little kid, I guess.</p>

<p>Powers: Okay, well, let me know about that.</p>

<p>Jim: That would be about it.</p>

<p>Powers: Well, tell me about it. What happened?</p>

<p>Jim: Horse, I put my foot in the wrong place underneath the horse's foot when he put it down.</p>

<p>Powers: Which one? Which foot? Which foot?</p>

<p>Jim: Probably both of them, I would imagine, knowing me.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you remember one time when the horse stepped on you?</p>

<p>Jim: No, not really.</p>

<p>Powers: You only know that it happened.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah. It just about happens to all little kids.</p>

<p>Powers: Sure. Because what I can't get at is this, what this image represents, that you're being filleted alive.</p>

<p>Jim: Well, that's the only way I could possibly describe what it could possibly feel like.</p>

<p>Powers: Well, let's circle out around it and come back at it again, okay? How do you feel about it, that we're having this conversation?</p>

<p>Jim: Fine, good. Glad there's things that are coming out that I hadn't realized before.</p>

<p>Powers: What? What, so far?</p>

<p>Jim: Parallel bars when I was walking when I was a kid.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. And the faith in you that he had and that he inspired you to have in yourself. What is, let me get this family arrangement. You're the adopted child of your father. Is that right?</p>

<p>Jim: Unbeknown to my father that I know that.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, he doesn't know that you were the adopted child.</p>

<p>Jim: He doesn't know that I know.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, I see. He doesn't know that you know. Well, he's deaf now and legally blind, and if anyone tries to tell him, he won't trust it anyway, so.</p>

<p>Jim: Right.</p>

<p>Powers: And he won't be able to watch this videotape, so. What do you know, what do you want to tell me about that? How important is this story?</p>

<p>Jim: You don't have enough time.</p>

<p>Powers: Really?</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: Well, what should I know, just what part of the story should I know about? How is it important?</p>

<p>Jim: Well, my real father's always been in the background. And he doesn't know that I know. Because he's my uncle. Which...</p>

<p>Powers: Your father's brother.</p>

<p>Jim: No, my mother's first husband.</p>

<p>Powers: Your mother's first husband?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: How is he uncle to you?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: How is he uncle to you?</p>

<p>Jim: He married my mother's sister after he divorced my mother.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, I see. And he doesn't know that you realize that he's the author of your life.</p>

<p>Jim: Right.</p>

<p>Powers: What kind of man is he?</p>

<p>Jim: Good, he raised my older sister.</p>

<p>Powers: No, I'm speaking of your uncle.</p>

<p>Jim: Right, that's who I'm talking about.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>Jim: He raised my oldest sister. She's seven years older than I am. Did a real good job.</p>

<p>Powers: How is she sister to you?</p>

<p>Jim: My mother was his wife.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, I see. Mother married him, had a daughter by him, and then while she was carrying you they divorced. Is that right?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: I got it... During the divorce, she was already pregnant with you. And then your father married her very soon after, I guess, huh?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: So your uncle raised your sister, who you believed always was your cousin. How old were you...</p>

<p>Jim: No, I knew she was always my sister.</p>

<p>Powers: How did you learn of it? How old were you when you learned of it?</p>

<p>Jim: I can't remember. I would always hear her call Mom "Mom." So I knew she was my sister.</p>

<p>Powers: How did you know he was your father?</p>

<p>Jim: Through talking to my older sister Joyce, after I got to be about 15 years old and I was snooping one day and found adoption papers ... that my dad had signed.</p>

<p>Powers: I see. So you were always suspicious about it. You always had some notion...</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah. I guess so, yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: And so let me see. The man whom you grew up calling Uncle is your father. The man who you grew up calling Father is in fact your adoptive father. So I'm going to refer to your uncle as uncle, Okay, so I just, we keep these sorted out.</p>

<p>Jim: Okay.</p>

<p>Powers: But your uncle is your natural... the author of your life, okay?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Your father is the protector of your life, okay?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: So let me get these two men cleared in my mind when you were growing up. What's the difference between them. Let me get a picture of your uncle first. What kind of a guy is he?</p>

<p>Jim: Deacon in a Lutheran church. Homebody. Very caring man.</p>

<p>Powers: When I met you last night, did I joke about that, did you tell me what neighborhood you grew up in Chicago, there's a lot of Lutherans out there?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes, you did.</p>

<p>Powers: Okay, so that just strikes me as funny, because when we met last night, do you remember?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. Okay. Deacon in a Lutheran church, good homebody, and a protective family man.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: What kind of a man is the adoptive father? Your father?</p>

<p>Jim: Very, very caring about his children when they're young, up until the age of about 10, I would say, 10 or 11.</p>

<p>Powers: And then?</p>

<p>Jim: Started drinking heavy.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh. So he became absorbed in himself, then.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah. And just never had time for us after we got into, you know, early teen years. My kid sister and myself.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you have any idea why your mother divorced your natural father? What was wrong in their...</p>

<p>Jim: No, I haven't.</p>

<p>Powers: You don't have any idea.</p>

<p>Jim: No. Probably the drinking, I would imagine.</p>

<p>Powers: Your uncle drank?</p>

<p>Jim: No, my mother.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, she drank. Oh, I see. So he wasn't able to keep her.</p>

<p>Jim:  Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Let's go back now to the fact that she was in the state hospital for so many years. You remember visiting her as a little boy before you had the polio?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Is that hard for you to think about?</p>

<p>Jim: Just.... yeah. A little.</p>

<p>Powers: Don't... Let's not talk about anything you don't want to talk about.</p>

<p>Jim: No, I'm comfortable with it.</p>

<p>Powers: It's all right to?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. Because some things are painful to remember. I don't know about the state hospital thing. It doesn't sound like it was easy for you.</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: Because you loved your mother.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: And do you remember one of those visits, going there?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: What can you tell me about it?</p>

<p>Jim: Anxious, waiting for Mom to come out of the little door in that big building.</p>

<p>Powers: What little door did she come out of? What do you mean?</p>

<p>Jim: Just one of the side doors or something out of the...</p>

<p>Powers: She'd come out and you'd...</p>

<p>Jim: And we'd wait out in the parking lot in the car.</p>

<p>Powers: So you're sitting there watching the door, waiting for her, before she comes out, that you remember, this feeling anxious. Who's with you in the car?</p>

<p>Jim: My kid sister, Lynn and my, I think Dad went in... Yeah, Dad had gone inside to get her.</p>

<p>Powers: How much younger is Lynn?</p>

<p>Jim: Eighteen months.</p>

<p>Powers: So it's just the two kids in the car, waiting for Mom to come out?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: How old are you?</p>

<p>Jim: Probably about four, I would imagine.</p>

<p>Powers: So she is maybe two or something, two or three. Very little. She doesn't even know what's going on I guess, huh? And you're just waiting for Mother to come through that door and just feeling anxious.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Tell me a little more about the anxious feeling.</p>

<p>Jim: Wanting to be with her.</p>

<p>Powers: Oh, so it's that kind of anxious—eager, like looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: What else do you remember about those visits?</p>

<p>Jim: Her having to leave the car and go back inside. Very hard.</p>

<p>Powers: Can you see that? Can you see her going?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm. Fighting.</p>

<p>Powers: What?</p>

<p>Jim: She was fighting all the way.</p>

<p>Powers: Fighting who? Against who? Your father had to take her back in?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, my father, yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: And she was resisting it, huh?</p>

<p>Jim:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: How did you feel about that?</p>

<p>Jim: Mad.</p>

<p>Powers: Tell me more about that. What kind of mad?</p>

<p>Jim: I mean, she wanted to be with us and we wanted to be with her.</p>

<p>Powers: Did you understand why she had to be in the hospital?</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: It didn't make sense to you.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-mm.</p>

<p>Powers: Make you angry at your father for putting her in there?</p>

<p>Jim: I don't know, I guess so, yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Well, don't guess so. I'm only guessing.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah...</p>

<p>Powers: It's very important.</p>

<p>Jim: No, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Powers: You're not sure.</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: Because you believed he's trying to take care of...</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: But you're just unhappy with the situation.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Now, let me take a step away from the whole narrative, all these sequences, and only ask you, what is your very earliest recollection of anything at all? How far back does your memory go?</p>

<p>Jim: My oldest sister potty training me.</p>

<p>Powers: And what do you remember about it?</p>

<p>Jim: Standing in the bathroom and saying, "Jimmy, do this."</p>

<p>Powers: Where are you? On the toilet?</p>

<p>Jim: Standing next to the toilet, yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. She wants you to urinate into the bowl?</p>

<p>Jim: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: And how do you feel about it?</p>

<p>Jim: Comfortable.</p>

<p>Powers: It's okay? You know that she's on your side, she's teaching you something.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you pass the water into the bowl?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: And how do you feel about it?</p>

<p>Jim: I guess good. I don't know. Good.</p>

<p>Powers: But whatever she's doing, you're happy that she's interested in you and she's helping you and so forth. So it's a good memory.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: It's very nice. So you have some expectation of women that they are, they're going to finally be on your side if you can get them to come clear. When you're lying on the couch, it takes Mother a while, she gives you aspirin, she tries to do the right thing. She doesn't know how bad it is. Your older sister loves you and is trying to help you to learn something about life. You expect the women to be on your side.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: And your little sister? Did you get along with her?</p>

<p>Jim: About as well as well as brother and sister get... Yes, very much.</p>

<p>Powers: Did you? You liked her?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah Really. Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: And she loved you and so forth. So you have good experience with women in your childhood. Except that Mother was sick. Did you know what was the matter—that she was drinking?</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: You just didn't... you knew something was wrong, that's all.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. Now, the horse goes away when you're six. How old are you before you get another horse or anything like that? Did you get one back after you got into your teens or...</p>

<p>Jim: No, I... Well, they told my dad that I couldn't horseback ride anymore because I had a curvature of the spine.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah.</p>

<p>Jim: And when we moved back into Chicago, my dad bought a tavern when we moved back into Chicago.  And we took in... I was going to school, high school, and I was saving my lunch money and my bus fare and everything I could get a hold of, and sneaking off to riding stables and mucking out stalls, cleaning stalls, swapping that for time in the saddle. And my dad found out about it.</p>

<p>Powers: And what did he do?</p>

<p>Jim: Took me to the doctor. And doctor said, "He's been riding all this time, hasn't done him any harm. Let him ride."</p>

<p>Powers: So then you were back where you wanted to be again. Now let's imagine that we have some success in this conversation this afternoon and that as a result of our being together, these pains in your foot, in either foot, these pains in your feet disappear and you don't have them anymore.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Let's suppose that somehow we're able to get to the heart of the matter, and we get rid of that. What's going to be different in your life as a result?</p>

<p>Jim: Getting my eyes off the self.</p>

<p>Powers: Tell me what you mean.</p>

<p>Jim: Well, the pastor for my church, Steve, says, "You got navel contemplation." You know, people have problems when they have navel contemplations. They're looking at their own problems. And I've gotten more involved.</p>

<p>Powers: You mean you keep too much attention on yourself because of this pain, huh?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: While we've sat here talking, have you had that pain in the arch of your foot?</p>

<p>Jim: Not anymore than just the cramp, you know, the mild... I've learned to live with that.</p>

<p>Powers: No, I wonder while we're talking if it's, if it comes and goes, or...</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: ...if you experience it.</p>

<p>Jim: No, I haven't had the problem since probably August, end of August.</p>

<p>Powers: How frequently would you say you have had it? August, and then before that, when was it?</p>

<p>Jim: I would say once a month.</p>

<p>Powers: Once a month!</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm. Where it lasts for a few days.</p>

<p>Powers: What does it remind you of, once a month? Having some kind of trouble that lasts for a few days.</p>

<p>Jim: It almost sounds like my mother, for crying out loud. I don't know. That's just how it gives out, I'm sorry about that.</p>

<p>Powers: I'm not... I'm very intrigued by that.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, so am I.</p>

<p>Powers: Who are you more like? Are you more like your father or more like your mother?</p>

<p>Jim: Probably neither. I would imagine more like my dad. Bullheaded. [inaudible**] determined to do it my way. You know.</p>

<p>Powers: Are you like your mother in any way?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes.</p>

<p>Powers: In what way?</p>

<p>Jim: Emotional.</p>

<p>Powers: What kind of...</p>

<p>Jim: More caring. Well, I see a movie on TV, it affects me. You know. It's nothing to have to get a box of Kleenex when Jim sees a sad movie.</p>

<p>Powers: So you cry when the dog dies and...</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: How about [inaudible], then, where the girl promises her grandfather that she won't let him down and she'll help him keep the farm?</p>

<p>Jim: Didn't see it.</p>

<p>Powers: You haven't seen that? That's the one that I cry for. Jane tells me, "You're a sucker for [inaudible] Little knock-kneed girl says, "Don't worry, Grandpa, I won't let you down." So okay, you're sentimental.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: You have a sentimental side to you. What about your use of alcohol?</p>

<p>Jim: I drink. I got hooked on prescription drugs and then when, after I'd gotten out of the hospital after I got hit in ‘Nam.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah. Does it frighten you to think that you may be so much like your mother that you would get hooked on stuff?</p>

<p>Jim: Never thought of it that way. No. Doesn't frighten me.</p>

<p>Powers: What do you think of that you... What is there that you would not want to be, that you would not want to have happen, that you wouldn't want to be like your mother? Was she too emotional? Was there something about her way of being emotional that was...?</p>

<p>Jim: No. Not that way, no.</p>

<p>Powers: Is there any way that you would want not to be like your mother?</p>

<p>Jim: Probably being confined somewhere, I would imagine.</p>

<p>Powers: Well, you certainly don't like the idea of being confined. You have an early memory of being in the window of the hospital looking down, seeing your sister.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: You have an early memory of waiting anxiously for your mother to come out of the hospital.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you have some idea that you will be confined somewhere if you can't lick this thing, or something like that?</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you have any idea about being confined somewhere that's, that haunts you?</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: What will happen if I'm not able to help you with this problem in your feet?</p>

<p>Jim: I've pretty well taken care of the problem since January, so.</p>

<p>Powers: What are you talking about? August is since January.</p>

<p>Jim: Well, it's gotten better since January. I hadn't had the pains in my legs since, from January to August. August was the first time I'd gotten them.</p>

<p>Powers: That's interesting. So it isn't monthly anymore.</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: It's every eight months or so. What happened in August just before you got the pains?</p>

<p>Jim: Just before, I was getting ready to go to Hume Lake as a counselor with a junior high group from our church.</p>

<p>Powers: And how were you feeling?</p>

<p>Jim: Good about going.</p>

<p>Powers: And?</p>

<p>Jim: Then I got hit with the phantom pains.</p>

<p>Powers: So before the phantom pains, you felt good about going, and what else?</p>

<p>Jim: Well, I was a little upset with what was going on where I work.</p>

<p>Powers: What was going on?</p>

<p>Jim: At Green Oak Ranch. Well, they're changing their policy at Green Oak Ranch, because it's run by Union Rescue Mission. Out of LA.</p>

<p>Powers: And what was the matter?</p>

<p>Jim: Well, they're doing away with the camping program as the public knows it, where they were touching 10,000 kids that were going through Green Oak Ranch. And now they're going to go to a rehab program for drug and alcoholic problems out of LA in North County.</p>

<p>Powers: Were you upset about that?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes.</p>

<p>Powers: Did you try to do anything about it?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, I was quite concerned and did voice my opinion.</p>

<p>Powers: And what came of it? What happened when you voiced your opinion?</p>

<p>Jim: Well, the director of the ranch did finally come to our church and tell the congregation what was going on. And I felt they should be more honest and open to the public of what was happening at the ranch. One, so there wouldn't be any problems that would really come out of it, because everyone wants the problem of rehabilitation somewhere else and not right next door.</p>

<p>Powers: Now how come you went all the way from January until August without having any of this phantom pain?</p>

<p>Jim: Got my eyes off self.</p>

<p>Powers: But it's not very clear to me how this works, because at this moment your eyes were least on yourself. You were most concerned with the kids and the camping program, most concerned that the people who run it are honest, most concerned to be, put an open face in front of the public on what they're trying to do, least concerned about yourself, and suddenly here come the phantom pains.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: How come?</p>

<p>Jim: I have no idea.</p>

<p>Powers: Me neither, only I, I, I can see that it doesn't fit with the idea that they come when you're concerned about yourself, unless it comes to tell you you should be more concerned about yourself.</p>

<p>Jim: No, because when I got up to camp I didn't have any time for myself and I didn't have any phantom pains at all up there.</p>

<p>Powers: Did you have an idea when you were fighting with the board of directors or whoever it was, the staff or whoever it is, that you were sticking your neck out and that you ought to be more careful, that you should be more diplomatic or something like that?</p>

<p>Jim: Sure, I had an idea.</p>

<p>Powers: What?</p>

<p>Jim: I had an idea that I should, you know, take it easy because they might cancel my horseback riding program that I got going. But they had already told me that, you know, they were going to keep the horseback-riding program for the kids.</p>

<p>Powers: So the question that I have, Jim, is whether you had some idea that, "Whoops, I've gone too far here, I'd better take care of myself or I'm not going to be any good to anybody."</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, I guess I had.</p>

<p>Powers: What comes to mind?</p>

<p>Jim: Just, you know, I guess I did, you know, sort of back off about the last, about, two or three days before I left for camp, that I should slow down, take it easy. And not say so much. Step back and see what's going on. See what's coming up in the future, you know.</p>

<p>Powers: Let's get that clearer. Let's just remember them together, those last few days there when it sort of dawned on you that you were pushing things too hard and I'd better step back a little bit, is that what you said?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Help me to just picture what's going on at that time.</p>

<p>Jim: No, I was afraid if I kept saying, you know, "I don't like the idea of a rehabilitation ranch," you know, "next door to my own property," that they might cancel that I have to get kids horseback riding at the ranch.</p>

<p>Powers: And then your phantom pain began?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you remember the night when it came back or the time when it came back?</p>

<p>Jim: No. No.</p>

<p>Powers: Was it coming back at night or during the day or when?</p>

<p>Jim: Right about the time to go to sleep, yeah, at night.</p>

<p>Powers: Now, you hadn't had it since January and it comes back about this time.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: And when it comes back you don't remember the first episode of the pain?</p>

<p>Jim: Oh, I was laying there in bed trying to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Powers: You do remember.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Well, let me be there with you and, and, and, here's the first time you've experienced this pain now for eight months—it shows up again.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: What were you thinking about that night?</p>

<p>Jim: Concerned about going up to Hume Lake and being a counselor for the first time for a bunch of kids. Concerned because I wasn't there the last day at Green Oak when all my friends were leaving. Also that, you know, there would be, you know, no more camping program as we know it at the ranch for just, you know, kids. That it wouldn't be the kids from all over the, you know, three counties that are in this area. That it wouldn't be for those kids anymore, that it would be for LA kids, is mostly where they'd be coming from.</p>

<p>Powers: How were you feeling about that?</p>

<p>Jim: Fine.</p>

<p>Powers: That part was good.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: But you were concerned because you hadn't got to say goodbye to your friends.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: You weren't sure that you were ready for this camping experience as a counselor to the young people, or...</p>

<p>Jim: True. I didn't think I could keep up with nine kids.</p>

<p>Powers: And then the pain starts.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Well, let's try to do it this way. When in your life before did you feel you were unsure of something and didn't know if you had what it took to go on? What's that remind you of that night, lying in the bed?</p>

<p>Jim: First marriage.</p>

<p>Powers: What came to mind?</p>

<p>Jim: Her, my ex-wife's parents not accepting me for my disability.</p>

<p>Powers: How is that connected with this feeling that you had—"I don't get to say goodbye to my friends? I don't know if I'm going to be a good counselor to these kids?"</p>

<p>Jim: Marriage breaking up, not being accepted by my in-laws, and I had an ulcer at that time and it perforated.</p>

<p>Powers: How does it connect to the idea, "I didn't get to say goodbye to my friends and I don't know if I have what it takes to be a counselor"?</p>

<p>Jim: Just didn't know if I had what it took to be a good husband at that point.</p>

<p>Powers: So you felt like a washout.</p>

<p>Jim: I guess so.</p>

<p>Powers: That you failed, that you couldn't make it as a married man. You're married now.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Are you a success now?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes.</p>

<p>Powers: You have in-laws now?</p>

<p>Jim: Yes.</p>

<p>Powers: And they do respect you.</p>

<p>Jim: Definitely.</p>

<p>Powers: Okay, so this is, this is, this pain comes in my feet when I feel I haven't had a chance to say goodbye to my friends, I don't know if I'm going to be able to handle my nine kids.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: That reminds me of what in my first marriage? I don't know if I have what it takes at all to be a husband to anybody?  Is that the way you felt then? I don't know if I have what it takes, period.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: What about the goodbye? "I haven't had a chance to say goodbye."</p>

<p>Jim: I don't know.</p>

<p>Powers: I don't know either. I can tell you what it reminded me of. "My father got rid of my horse—I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye."</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: "When I found out he got rid of my horse."</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Am I on target?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>Powers: What are you feeling?</p>

<p>Jim: Didn't have a chance to say goodbye to my mom the way I wanted to when she was going into the hospital, she was taken away.</p>

<p>Powers: That's right. That's right. What's coming to you?</p>

<p>Jim: Well, I had a dog that—name was Springer—that had saved my life in a snowstorm back in 1971. And didn't take, you know, real good, proper care of her, veterinarian-wise. And 1978, I had to have her put to sleep. And... Colonel I had driven for while I was in the Army, his family had her in San Luis Obispo, because where I was living out in the country, there were too many foxtails, the weeds out there, and they were hurting the dog. And when Jeff called me and told me they were going to take him to see the vet, I never went and said goodbye.</p>

<p>Powers: It's all right. Take a little time with that. Just take a little time with that. Let that just come. It's all right.</p>

<p>Jim: Guess I'm not saying goodbyes.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah, it's hard. It's really hard. "There shall be no parting there," they say about Heaven, right? Because one of the things that makes it heavenly...</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, amen.</p>

<p>Powers: Nobody has to say goodbye. Is it hard to say goodbye to your feet?</p>

<p>Jim: No.</p>

<p>Powers: How come?</p>

<p>Jim: You just learn to do without them.</p>

<p>Powers: Not yet.</p>

<p>Jim: I guess not.</p>

<p>Powers: No, I don't think you're, I don't think you're able to say goodbye to your feet more easily than you can say goodbye to your dog. I think it's, I think it's hard. I think a shadow pain is a kind of an important reminder that not having feet is what you have. That you, the feet you don't have are the feet you have. And that shadow pain reminds you once in a while that some things are really hard.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: It's really hard to lose your legs, really hard to lose your feet. Especially your feet. Left arm doesn't bother you very much, that you lost that. You hardly ever have any shadow pain there.</p>

<p>Jim: No. And I've always said it's because I've used more, used it more.</p>

<p>Powers: You've used it more?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: Because what you have left of it is still usable to you.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: But the feet, you miss them more.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: It's hard to be without them. Especially if you like to ride.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you still ride?</p>

<p>Jim: Definitely.</p>

<p>Powers: Definitely. Be a little easier if you had feet, though, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Jim: Eh, a horse could throw you off, if you don't... On my saddle I get pouches that I put my legs in, I use like you would use stirrups, and I got a seatbelt on my saddle, so.</p>

<p>Powers: It'd be easier if you had feet though, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, I could go out and catch my own horse, for crying out loud, instead of having to have somebody do it for me.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah, well, is it a disgrace for a man to miss his feet?</p>

<p>Jim: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>Powers: I don't think so either. I don't think so either. How do your feet feel right now, while we talk about them?</p>

<p>Jim: Asleep.</p>

<p>Powers: Describe that to me.</p>

<p>Jim: Tingling.</p>

<p>Powers: Like pins and needles?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: As if they're just waking up?</p>

<p>Jim: No, like they're numb.</p>

<p>Powers: Let's just stay with that numb feeling in the feet. Is it okay that they're numb?</p>

<p>Jim: Sure.</p>

<p>Powers: When you move them around, can you get some feeling in any part of them?</p>

<p>Jim: Soles. Bottom.</p>

<p>Powers: Tell me what it feels like on the soles of your feet.</p>

<p>Jim: Like they're on cushions.</p>

<p>Powers: On cushions?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: What kind of cushion?</p>

<p>Jim: Good pair of Nikes. I don't know. Yeah, comfortable.</p>

<p>Powers: Are the pins and needles going out of them?</p>

<p>Jim: They're just there, comfortable there.</p>

<p>Powers: Can you move any part of your feet?</p>

<p>Jim: Toes.</p>

<p>Powers: Which toe?</p>

<p>Jim: Big one.</p>

<p>Powers: That's your favorite.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: That's your sign of life. Jim, would it be all right with you if, as a result of our talk this afternoon, you were to miss your feet from time to time without making them hurt?</p>

<p>Jim: Definitely.</p>

<p>Powers: And if you were to treat your feet as something really valuable that you had to part from, that you enjoyed because you're a physical man, you like being physical apparently, you still like horseback riding, you like training people to ride horses and stuff, the kids and all the rest. I wonder if it won't be possible for you to miss those feet in a way that doesn't require you to suffer.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: If you could do it in a way that just reminds you that what you left behind in ‘Nam was really precious to you. It was not a small matter, what you, what you sacrificed was not a small matter, it was the real thing.</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: Would that be all right?</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah.</p>

<p>Powers: What comes to your mind when I put it to you this way?</p>

<p>Jim: Comfort.</p>

<p>Powers: Do you have any further idea that you want to say to me, or is that what you came to talk about?</p>

<p>Jim: That's what we came to talk about.</p>

<p>Powers: Feels all right?</p>

<p>Jim: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Powers: How do you feel about it, that we had the conversation?</p>

<p>Jim: Very good.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah, so do I.</p>

<p>Jim: Very good.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah, so do I. I feel very good. I feel very good.</p>

<p>Jim: Thank you, Bob.</p>

<p>Powers: Yeah.</p>

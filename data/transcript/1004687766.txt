<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks for fitting me in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yeah. I'm glad this worked out. Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. So I'm nearing the end of August and Franklin's (sp?) moving. And I think that we spoke last that I had had mixed feelings because I saw the place and it wasn't so big, and all this stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [His new place] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe not. Well, but he's just kind of, like, you know, well he, you know, (inaudible at 00:34). Well it doesn't feel like home anyway so it doesn't matter, you know, how small it is or what it is or blah blah blah, you know. And then yesterday morning, like, we were talking about it and, like, obviously it's, like, kind of awkward. Like, it's just like—it's just a lot to—it's a big upheaval, you know, obviously. And I've been feeling really annoyed at him lately just, like, in general. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>Like, we went out to dinner last Friday and, like, it was supposed to be nice, whatever. It was going to be nice. But then, like, he, like, mentioned how—because I guess the people next to us or whatever were talking about politics, and he's like, "The worst conversation to have in public or whatever—politics." I was like, "True." And I was like, "Oh why? What were they talking about?" He, like, kind of started talking about it.</p>

<p>Then he, like, goes into, like—like, literally, he was, like, talking the entire time we were eating dinner and, like, about his opinions or whatever. And because I brought up something about voting and he proceeded to, like, explain why it doesn't really matter whether you vote or not. Like, one more vote isn't going to do anything and that's why he doesn't vote, because the government chooses anyway. Like, our votes doesn't count. Like, you don't know how it works Trina. Like, I was like, "This is the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my life. Like, you don't know what you're talking about. Like, yeah, maybe the senate vote, like, obviously plays a big part, but, like, what are you talking about?"</p>

<p>And, like, it made me angry at a couple levels that he would, like, literally not notice that I'm, like, sitting there like, "OK, shut up." Even after I was like, "Ha ha, like, it's funny that you just said this is, like, the worst topic and now you're, like, really talking about it." And he's like, "Well, no, but I'm just saying, you know," and, like, proceeded.</p>

<p>And then he—and it also annoyed me because, first of all, like, you should fucking vote. Like, I don't know, like, that whole standpoint. I feel strongly about a lot of the young people who have that kind of thing like, "Nah." You know, those are not people voting. Like, that can be a reason why sometimes, like, shit gets messed up. Like, because our vote counts, you know, and the younger generation, like, a lot of them will vote for, like, the right person. Well, which obviously is subjective, but, like, Obama, you know. [00:02:55]</p>

<p>And so that angered me that, like, I was like, "Ugh. Like, I don't want to spend with my life him if he's never going to fucking vote." And, like, granted, I don't vote on the little stuff and my parents are like, "Oh, you should," you know. At least I vote for the presidency, like, that's the biggest thing that affects us overall, I think, you know.</p>

<p>Or I don't know that much about politics, but whatever. And that's the other thing, like, I don't know that much about politics and I don't fucking claim to. Like, I'm not going to sit there—I don't know what the hell the government has to do. But (ph), like, I mean, I do. But, like, I don't really. Like, you know, I don't know what their—he's making it sound like we vote and then they see, like, who is most popular and see if it lines up with, like, their—whoever they are, like, decision of who should be—like, what? Like, no, that's not how it fucking works.</p>

<p>So and then I've just been getting really annoyed at him. And then yesterday morning, he was, like, playing the blame game with me about, like, why did this happen and how, you know, again, like, just talking about how I was hiding my phone and he thought I was cheating. And I lied to him once about when I was having a conversation with guy, and who is this guy? And I was just like, "What? How many times have you?" And then he just, like, defends himself. And, like, so we get to the point—this is, like, before work. I'm, like, crying, like, what the hell, he's saying all this stuff.</p>

<p>Again, like, going back to his standard of blaming me and also saying how, you know, "Maybe I really feel like this is not a good idea. The wheel's already in motion, so we can't do anything about it, but I just think it's going to pull us further apart. And my friends are, you know, anybody that I told has said, 'Well, you know, I think that's a bad idea when you're so deep into a relationship.'" And I was like, "Did you tell them why?" Like, no. Obviously he didn't tell them it's because my girlfriend caught me, like, talking dirty with some girl. Like, what the fuck? [00:04:41]</p>

<p>And that, you know, maybe we should just not even try and he'll just move out and that'll be that. I mean, he says all this stuff. I'm all upset and I'm like, "I don't know what to say, you know. Like, it's not my fault." He said, "Well, it's not like it's not my fault." I'm like, "OK." And then, when I'm at that point, he's, "No, like, I'm sorry. Let's just stick with the plan. Like, I love you, I really want to try, like, duh duh duh." After he says all of this stuff, like, "I don't even know (inaudible at 05:08), you're giving me ultimatums and..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 05:15) therapist today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. That would be helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I maybe have two people that I refer to. I don't think either one of them takes the BlueCross HMO (inaudible at 05:31).</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, yeah. But, I mean, I have to switch to out of network, but I don't know. I have to call. I think I can't do that until December, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, usually the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Open of enrollment is the only time that I can change it, so I may have to wait until then. But at that point, because I have to do it anyway for you, then I could maybe do that. [00:05:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. There's somebody else [that just occurred] (ph) to me, who maybe in network for BlueCross, who may (ph) also be good. I don't know her work as well as the other two, but I know her very well and think highly of her. And she's also right nearby here. I can give you her name right now...</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK yeah, that would be good. And then, in terms of the out of network people, I mean, I'll just do that when I'm, you know, (inaudible at 06:31). So I don't know. But yeah, OK, go ahead.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. So [Inaudible] Lindsey. And she's across the street, like, ten blocks west of here. And she may be in network for BlueCross, if you want to check. [00:06:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. [I'll check with them] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other two I was thinking of—one is Julie Forsyth, who I know well. I know her well and she seems (inaudible at 07:06). And she's very good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Julie Foreman?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Forsyth. And then the other one is Ellen (sp?) Dingham, who I was also (inaudible at 07:22) referred to, in Anthony Square. And she definitely wouldn't take BlueCross and she's more expensive. Julie, I (inaudible at 07:37), so I haven't suggested her. Her fee probably more lower—I guess (ph) more reasonable then Dingham.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, I'll look them up and check with BlueCross and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And Lindsey may actually be in your network with BlueCross (inaudible at 07:53).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And who?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lindsey, (inaudible at 07:56).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right. OK, thank you. That's helpful. [00:07:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. If I can think of anybody else who in network, I will let you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. I mean, I think that it would maybe be helpful for us, but I also still feel strongly that he should be, you know, starting therapy on his own, because I think that will give him a sense of if he—it'll kind of give him an idea of how therapy works privately first, which I think could be helpful because I think—I could see myself being a little overwhelming and, like, I don't know. I don't know it's, like, because, like, I'm so therapized (ph) just purely by nature from who my parents are and, like, having been in and out of therapy all my life, that—and he's just not used to it all.</p>

<p>I don't know, like, I don't want to go, like, couple's therapy and have it be, like, a tattle-tell session, like, every week. You know what I mean? Like, "Well, he does this and I really don't like that." "Well, she does this and this is really annoying," you know. I mean, even though that's sometimes what it is, I don't—I want—I don't know. Especially for him, because I don't think that he really recognizes, like, understanding. I don't know, I'm not sure. I think I'm just hesitant a little. [00:09:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You seem worried for you to have in that, [I think] (ph) for two reasons. One of which is, that, like, the opposite of how it is between you often at home, where you feel like he's more kind of blame or taking over attacking you the whole time. And the other which is, it's not really your job to make sure things are fair and everybody (ph) have a good time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no, that's true, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm not, like, saying...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, no, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's an interesting—I'm not sure what to make of it yet, but it's—and I think it's also because you're really pensive about a lot of things. Like (pause), yes, I'm sort of struck by your protectiveness of him. [00:10:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, honestly, it's more protectiveness of myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not wanting to, like, hear about it afterwards. Like, "Well, why did you have to say all that?" Or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Honestly, like, I'm not really sure if he's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 10:22) you say what you want to say in the session, and then...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And be like, "I can't believe you think that. Or I can't change that, that's me, you know..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm not really sure where to go with that (inaudible at 10:35). So, for example, I went to Chicago this past weekend with my dad to see my grandma and to start cleaning out her apartment and stuff like that. And, actually, coincidentally, my best friend Amanda went into labor that weekend—five weeks early, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really nice to be able to—I got to go see her, like, two hours after the baby was born, and she's beautiful and it's great. And so that was really nice. But anyway, so I'm coming back and I'm driving back, and we had driven with my dad, and I said, you know, "Like, why don't I just see if Franklin (sp?) can pick me up at your house (inaudible at 11:05) so you don't have to shuffle all the way to (inaudible at 11:06) and then back or whatever." So Franklin (sp?) said yes, no problem. He's, like, been out all day with his friends, which is great. They had a little show for the crew (ph) and then they were hanging out. [00:11:13]</p>

<p>But, like, I told him when I was leaving and told him when I would be home, and told him that I would call him about 20 minutes before getting to my dad's, so that he would have enough to get there. I call him at that time and I'm like, "All right, we're 20 minutes away." He's, like, at the house chilling and drinking with, like, these friends still. And so as soon as realize that, I'm, like, "Fuck, there's no way he's going to get to my dad's house. And I don't want to wait at my dad's house." Like, my stepmom's (inaudible at 11:33), like, whatever. So I go, "Dad, why don't you just drop me at Mom's instead, just because." And I didn't tell my dad what was going on. I feel like calling him after it happens, just so I don't have to deal with the questions. But I was like, "Oh, well, just drop me at Mom's instead so I can say hi to her, and it's easier for him to find, you know, he know where she lives exactly, more than your house." Even though it's just across the pond, like, it's really close to his house because she's in proximity.</p>

<p>So, I tell him that. And he's like, "OK." And, like, I already thought, like, his voice sounds a little slurred. Like, I don't know how much they've been drinking. They're probably shooting beers, whatever (ph). So, like, OK, I'm going to (inaudible at 12:04) my Mom's because, you know, it's just easier, I don't know. So, like, 30 or 40 minutes goes by. Oh no, no, no. Like, 25 minutes goes by and I call him and I'm like, "Hey, like, where are you?" 20 minutes is more than enough time to get—like, and I'm sorry, when you're picking somebody up, like, you're ready to stop, drop and roll and go in the car, like, when the person calls you. You know, [I've done that so many times for him] (ph). And he goes, "Oh, I'm in the car." I was like, "OK." And I'm like oooh. He's like, "I should be there soon." [00:12:38]</p>

<p>So he gets there another, like, 15 or 20 minutes later. So, I was waiting, like, 40, 45 minutes probably. And, like, I smell alcohol on his breath. And he's like, "Oh, I had to drop off Sean, like, at his dad's." And I was like, "What? Why?" And he's like, "Well, I thought Tom, but Tom—I went to the bathroom and then I came back and Tom was gone. I thought he could give him a ride." I was like, "Why did any of you have to give him a ride?" Like, he's a grown man. Like, he could've found a bus or walked or taken the subway. So, (inaudible at 13:06), you know.</p>

<p>And I honestly had made the decision, even before he got there, to not make a deal out of it because I knew that he would be like, "I can't believe you're making," you know, he would just kind of be like, "I can't believe you're, like, making this such a big deal. Like, I came, didn't I?" Like, you know, he just wouldn't understand. And he's like, "I don't know why I smell like this." And he, like, seemed a little tipsy and he's like, "I don't know, I had a shot and a beer." And I was like, "Mmm, yeah right. Like, a shot and a beer does not make a, like, stinky liquor car." [00:13:33]</p>

<p>Like, so I can annoyed with him at that and honestly just didn't bring it up because I just didn't want to deal with it. Like, this whole thing, I'm just feeling, like, really irritated at him lately and, like, nervous about him leaving but at the same time, like, I don't know. I'm kind of like, "Oh, I (inaudible at 13:55)." I don't know. I'm just feeling very conflicted about everything and irritated at him that, like, again, like, he's just still seeming like he's not act like gung-ho about this whole thing and, you know, as he was originally claiming to be.</p>

<p>And, like, the whole going back on yesterday, when he was starting to blame me a little bit again, like, it's just like, "Really dude?" Like, I didn't do anything. Like, OK, I was turning my phone sometimes and I was texting friends about my issues. Like, my bad. Like, I wasn't hiding relationships." And then again, "What are you talking about? It wasn't a relationship." [And I'm like] (ph), "I wasn't hiding making plans with somebody." "I was never going to meet up with her." I'm like, "Well, you were acting as if, 'What does it matter?'" You know. I just didn't really know what to say to him at this point I think. [00:14:48]</p>

<p>Like, and I guess, like, another point of worrying about couple's therapy is, like, worrying about some of the things. Other than, like, what obviously needs to be worked on in terms of, you know, why he talks to girls or whatever. Like, what if some things I just didn't realize and, like, I just don't want to realize and I just don't want to deal with for the rest of my life. Like, his taking over entire dinner conversation with, like, information pieced together from, like, random conspiracy theories (ph) or I don't know what, you know?</p>

<p>(inaudible at 15:23) irritated at him and, like, noticing more that's like, "Well, I wish this would change, I wish that would change. I wish the other thing would change." And the whole blaming me and turning things around on me, like, it's really, like, enough is a fucking 'nough. Like... [00:15:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like he's (pause) making much of an effort.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't feel like that to me either, but then, like, he's, like, so hurt when I, like, insinuated that maybe he wasn't—and he said I was, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't have anything to do with whatever he's making (inaudible at 16:13).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly. I mean, he's talking about me giving him all these ultimatums and, like, you know, doing stuff, like, you know, "School and all this other stuff shouldn't be like an ultimatum for if you're going to be with me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you'd rather (pause) be mad and pointing out all of the ways in which he's not doing things he said he would do, and most especially the things that you want him to do. Maybe you'd rather be kind of mad about it. [00:16:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And upset?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And upset and (inaudible at 16:58). (pause). I guess I kind of have the impression that you really don't want to acknowledge how little (pause) effort he's made since this started. I mean, I understand he gets upset when you tell him he's not making an effort and I understand in the first week or so—maybe two weeks—that maybe still occasionally he says things about really being invested and things working out, but (pause) you haven't described to me him actually doing anything. [00:18:07]</p>

<p>I mean, you had found him, like—I don't remember if it was texting or Facebooking—communicating in some way with some other attractive woman who just got a boob job, like, within weeks of all this going down [in the first place] (ph). Like, (pause) and you're talking about it as though, like, he's going to really start to come around, like, once he moves out. Or like he's going to have some kind of change in his behavior or, like, going to couple's therapy is going to make this different. I don't see how any of that could happen, (inaudible at 19:25) on what you've said. And it seems to me that you—it's less upsetting for you to be angry with him about it than to see... [00:19:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Things for what they might actually be, I guess?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I think part of that is also me feeling confused and sad about perhaps realizing that this is over. And, you know, kind of having these feelings conflict with feelings of, like, love and compassion for him. And, you know, wanting to save a relationship that I've invested three years into. But, yeah, I think that, you know, being annoyed and being just, like, kind of irritated and at other times just, like, being normal with him and like, "Oh, la la la. (inaudible at 20:16) love you, blah, whatever," is easier than trying to figure out how to deal with the fact that this really might be over. Because I still feel like, well, maybe I should still give it a chance, you know. Like, maybe he will, you know, start to do some stuff, but I think in reality I'm seeing that a lot of this stuff that I think I would need to feel that this relationship was secure and healthy and whatever moving forward, are maybe not something that he could ever provide or do or come through on. I... [00:20:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 20:44) think it, like, (pause) that it's possible he may never be able to provide it, or it's possible he might not ever change. I don't see any evidence that he will.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, precisely. I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Because you don't] have a crystal ball and he could wake you tomorrow with a new lease on life. But (pause) there's really no evidence that he's headed that direction. I mean, he—I guess I kind of think that if somebody was motivated to change and try to salvage your relationship, like, you'd probably see a lot of effort in the first—however long it's been—month or two. And you haven't really seen any. [00:21:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I think that I kind of was expecting, like, to see him, like, I don't know, like, after work, sitting down to study his fitness stuff or, you know, whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about not just communicating with woman about her boob job...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, I think that the—well, it's not even about that, communicating with, like, attractive woman who you've had these weird ongoing relationships with to begin with. Like, OK, maybe he didn't know she was going to send a picture of her, like, newly installed cleavage, whatever, I don't know. But, like, the fact that, like, he still is talking to women that, like, are not these close friends. You know, it's not like people that he hangs out with or he's making plans or whatever, but it's just happening (inaudible at 22:39)[00:22:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [And I believe] (ph) the kind of thing that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Led him to do what he did that I found, and made me so devastated. I mean, and then to kind of compare that to wanting to say that kind of thing, you know. Like, with yesterday, he was kind of blaming me. I was like, "Well, you know Franklin (sp?), I mean, you even, you know." He was like, "Well, you can't compare that at all because, you know, with Betty, I don't know. She just caught me in the moment where I was feeling scared and weak." Like, OK, so? Like, even if he's never really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can only imagine, like, (pause)—do you believe that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. What I believe is that he—somebody was being flirtatious and he was gobbling it up. And seemingly pursuing it, I mean, or pursuing it actively. I mean, whether or not he was actually going to come through on his plans to see her is just beside the point. Like, but to not recognize that, like, you should have just cut off all communication with women that you are not friends with that are just these random people on Facebook all over the world. Like, OK, I don't care that she lives in Chicago. That doesn't matter a difference to me. What makes a difference is that you're not recognizing this as a pattern and as—it's... [00:24:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, like, of course. Half of the problem is that he's failing to recognize, like, [who am I to tell you] (ph) how can you possibly compare them? I mean, do you really believe that he honestly sees them as being that different? I mean, of course not. Like, that's just telling you whatever will...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Help his argument and make me feel bad, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, like, honestly, it was like I'm crying, sobbing, like, going to be late to work, like, have to redo my makeup, the whole thing. And he's, "Well, never mind, I'm sorry. You know, It's OK, it's fine," you know, like, kiss and makeup. Like, OK, like, but you got me all mixed up and once again, for the 103rd time, threatened to break up with me. Like, it's just not OK. [00:25:06]</p>

<p>Like, it's not OK to feel that, first of all, my boyfriend is not paying attention to time and not saying to his friend, "Sorry, I can't drag (ph) you home. I have to go pick up my girl who just drove in from Chicago." That's, like, I feel that if I try to say to him, "You know, honey, I wish that you would've kept track of time a little bit more," or whatever, that I have to feel like I'll be attacked for having that kind of reaction, that I feel like he'll kind of, you know, bark at me about why I am making it a bigger deal and why am I picking on things. Like, I don't want to have to think about that and have to, again, like, walk on eggshells. It's just that, I think again, I am just realizing that I think—well, I just started having the feelings of, like, maybe this is not is going to work out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The only way I can envision that this could work for you is if you change a lot and this all became really quite acceptable. [00:26:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And you know (inaudible at 26:12)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, can you imagine a way things could actually change so this would work for you, other than that? What does it look like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, honestly, the only way that this, like, (pause)—like, I know this may sound bad to somebody else, but, like, if he changed his personality almost. Not 100 percent obviously, because I love him for a reason, you know, and we get along for a reason, we have things in common for a reason. But the things that I don't like and that I feel are...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So would what that look like? [What do you have in mind] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, how that would happen? Or, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What it would like, how he would act differently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not being argumentative, not blaming other people in arguments, mainly me. Not talking about his opinions about things with a conviction that makes the other person feel like they're an idiot for not understand where he's coming from, like with the thing about government. Not, like, talking to girls, like, ever. Not really, but kind of. Like, not being so (pause) accepting of, like, random single women talking to him all the time and whatever.</p>

<p>And I mean, what it would look like—and honestly, like, in our relationship, many times during arguments or upset fights or whatever, or me feeling upset about something he did, I would literally, like, been angry, saying to myself, like, "Well, this is my bed, I chose it. I'm going to have to sleep in it. And I guess I just have this coming and I'm just going to have fucking tolerate it for the rest of my life and deal with it and deal with an asshole who, you know, turns everything on me. And deal with some guy that I just have to turn the other way because he's always fucking talking to..." Like, angry, like, saying this to myself, like, multiple times in my relationship with him. [00:28:13]</p>

<p>And, like, that is the only way. Like, if I literally was just like, "I'm going to tolerate the fact that he literally talks about things that he's going to do all the time and doesn't really follow through on them or does it really slowly. Or, you know, complains about one thing. We figure out a solution, then he's completing about it again the next week as if we never even talked about it any (ph). All this stuff, like, and I—but I don't want to do that. That's not fair to myself. I'm not going to be happy, you know, I want to somebody who, like, is—I mean, and then the other thing is, like, then he'll make me feel—I was, like, looking back on all this stuff. Kind of even felt guilty because, like, he'll propose, like, starting some sort of business together or, like, working together or something and I'll kind of, like, be not really into it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [So, one of the things this has made me wonder about] (ph). So, how long was your mom an alcoholic before she got treatment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The first time she got treatment? I don't even know. Like, since I was born or before I was born maybe. And I think she went into treatment for the first time maybe when I was, like, 10 or 11, or 12 even. [00:29:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she was drinking pretty actively then, through the first ten years of your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's been sober, like, nonstop sober for 11, almost 12 years now. 12 years in January, and I was born in January. So whatever 28 minus 12 is—16. So yeah, she was for, like, a good decent chunk of my life. I mean, obviously I wasn't (inaudible at 29:50).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 29:50), like, I feel like I am (pause)—I felt like when I was making a fuss about the messaging a few months ago, like—and I think I said this. Like, I was telling you you were in denial about what was going on. And I kind of feel like I'm telling you that again about his changing, like you kind are angry about these things that he's doing in a way where u kind of have faith that they will change or they could change or he will be different when (pause) it just doesn't look like that. I mean, I feel like, again, kind of saying I think you're in denial about what's going on here. And it reminded me of, like, what happens with an alcoholic with themselves or other people around, where people just (pause) kind of pretend or disavow the way that the drinking is happening. [00:30:58]</p>

<p>Now (ph) obviously you were a kid, there was nothing you could do about it. But it makes me wonder whether (pause) the way you're being now, what is done by you, relates to what happened with your mother when you were growing up. I don't know enough about what things were like to say that I think that's true, but it—I do know enough to wonder about it, whether, you know, she or your dad or somebody else was kind of looking past or denying what was going on and you kind of picked up on that, or you pretended—you may not be able to see a lot anyway, because you were a kid. You get what I'm saying? Like, there was some kind of, like, denial in the air through a lot of your childhood that you're now, like, sort of recreating in how things are with Franklin (sp?). [00:32:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I think that my father definitely to a certain extent was in denial about it or enabled her in the sense that, you know, I don't think he really ever took a big stand on her working on her drinking. And I think I may have mentioned before that, you know, if they would have parties or whatever and I'd have a babysitter and I'd ask for my mom to come up and tuck me in whatever, it would usually be my dad on those nights. And I'm sure the reason is that she was drinking wine or whatever and he just would rather him do it. And I think that was a function of enabling, you know, in terms of, you know, rather than dealing with it. And I think to a certain extent I've enabled Franklin (sp?) by, you know, backing down many times from situations of me confronting him about issues that I have with things that he does.</p>

<p>And I think that's also part of the reason why I feel so strongly about this whole move out thing, because I really feel like, you know, I have an enabled him, and it is enabling to be in a situation where he feels so secure and I take care of everything. I mean, yesterday when we were having this argument he had this (ph) kind of balls, I would say, to, like, say how hurtful it was when I talked about, like, that's my furniture because it's our furniture and he bought a lot of this stuff too. Even though it's on my credit card and ultimately, yeah, we both paid them off and he will be giving me some money towards them. </p>

<p>But ultimately, like, they're my credit cards and if we do ever break up, then I'm going to be the one that's going to end up paying for this stuff, because the money that you've already put into it by paying them with me has gone to the (inaudible at 33:40) and the other crap that we bought together. So, this $800 that we just spent on the bedroom set, like, that's, like, not—we're not even there, you know, and probably won't be for, like, a year, in terms of the debt I have. [00:33:52]</p>

<p>So, I mean, even that was like, are you fucking kidding me? Like, I've given you everything that you've never had in your whole fucking life. So yeah, I think that I am and I think another part of it is feeling like, you know, that this is the end and how to kind of deal with that, you know. Like, how long do I let this, like, trial period of, like, him fixing stuff and whatever go before I come the final conclusion and, you know, figure out how to break if off essentially (ph)? And I'm fairly sure that despite his threats (ph), I will be the one to have to initiate a final breakup if it comes down to that, just because I can see him not, just purely out of comfort and not wanting to be the bad guy, honestly, so then he can be like, "You broke my heart," you know. [00:34:40]</p>

<p>And then he said to me the other day—I was, like talking about plans I have. I've been making a lot of plans with friends and going out on weeknights, (inaudible at 34:50) or whatever. And he's like, "Yeah, so you have plans every night this week," and he's like, "You're good at making plans." And then I was like, "Oh, well, like, thanks." I just, you know, whatever. And he's like, "Well, what should I say. You have a lot of people to make plans with." And I was like, "Here comes the martyr of the day" . Like, "What do you mean? You're, like, plenty (inaudible at 35:10)." Like, and yeah, it was nice that he recognized that, like, I am, you know, I put my mind to wanting to do it and I do it.</p>

<p>But it's, like, it felt, like, almost like a jab. Like, "Well, look at poor little me," like, you know. And that's the other reason why if I had bought up the whole why were you late thing to pick me up, it would've been like, "Well, you told me you wanted me to hang out with friends and that's what I was doing. I can't believe you would," you know. (inaudible at 35:35), yeah, hang out with friends but, like, OK, like, still be responsible with the plans you make.</p>

<p>So, I guess this weekend we're going to be, like, packing a lot of stuff. And he get the keys because the other person moved out and whatever. So we'll try to start bringing stuff over. I mean, like, I'm giving him furniture. Like, he doesn't understand, like, he's complaining about me being all weird about furniture but, like, you know, you're getting plenty of stuff Franklin (sp?). [00:36:03]</p>

<p>Like, I ordered a new, like, bed frame for my (inaudible at 00:36:05] whatever, that would fit better in the small room. I mean, I helped him buy a bike because he needed a bike to get around town. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, you paid for those things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no, we—but I contributed towards them. We split up our, like, he removed the direct deposit from my account, and then now he only has, like—he's going to give me 450 a month to, like, cover bills and stuff that we have together and cat food and stuff like that for now. So he's made it so that that'll just get directly deposited but then the rest goes to his account and whatever.</p>

<p>I found a roommate who is from Seattle. She's moving back here. She lived here before. She's going to a graduate program here. She's my age and she seems really nice and—so we've not actually met yet. I think we'll try to Skype tonight, but we've talked on the phone and we've e-mailed a bunch of times. So, sounds like it'll be good and we're both in agreement that, you know, it's nice that there's no lease because it can be a kind of trial period. So I was glad to have somebody that, like, you know, if it doesn't—no hard feelings kind of thing if it doesn't work out on either end. [00:37:10]</p>

<p>And so he'll be kind of out out by the first, like, slowly but surely (inaudible at 37:16). And she's not coming until the third and then she's not going to move in until the 5th. So, that's kind of good so that I'll have a couple days to kind of reorganize things further and figure things out. It's a huge upheaval. I mean, the whole house is his stuff and my stuff all over everywhere, intertwined in every cabinet. And I have to make space for her. I have to, you know, reorganize my shit. </p>

<p>[Do you think I'm] (ph) complaining about the big TV that we got in our bedroom because (inaudible at 37:45), because we, like, (inaudible at 37:46). I was like, "OK, do you want it? Like, it's all yours. Like, it's really not that big of a deal." He's like, "Well, no, because it's too big for the room," you know. Like, all right. And I don't want to say this but, like, I make more freaking money than you anyways. Like, I'm sorry. Like, and it's my credit card that I had in the first place, like—I wouldn't (ph) say that, but in my head I'm like, "Really? Like, really I paid for all this. Like, you're..."—I mean, so... [00:38:15]</p>

<p>So it should be interesting this weekend to see how it goes moving some stuff in. Our plan is to, like, go bring furniture over first, so then he can see what will fit and then bring all his crap. So, we'll see. Well, in the meantime I've made some connections with the other folks at school, talking about moving forward in my career. So I met with the manager of the program at school last week and she basically told me that, like, I'd be a great candidate for this position and that she, you know, wants my resume so that if anything comes across her desk she can recommend me directly.</p>

<p>And I'm also meeting with the deputy—no, with the—oh shit, I always forget his position—director of something at FAS HR or whatever, just to also, like—because he's the same type of person. If something comes across his desk and he knows somebody. [00:39:13] So that feels good to kind of be making steps in a different direction. It gives me something to look forward to. And despite everything, I got an A in my course for the summer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (ph), congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Yeah, so then an A on the exam even. So, I'm really proud of myself. That was a big...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I have my own things going on and this whole thing with him just feels, like, very separate from the other stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like it's going to be really hard when he moves out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think it's, like, completely unclear how things are to go and what's going to unfold. But I'm not wavering on my decision. I mean, there's times when I feel like, "Oh, maybe this is going to be a bad decision." Maybe whatever, maybe this, maybe that. But my feelings are more fleeting in that regard than, you know, stable. And my stable feelings are just that this needs to happen and this is what I want and I want to have some time alone and that's it, you know. [00:40:13]</p>

<p>And everybody that I talk to—he talks to them and say, "Oh, I didn't (inaudible at 40:1)." Everybody I talk to is like, "Wow, like, you go, you know. Like, that's really strong and, like, brave of you." But, like, that's (inaudible at 40:27), you know, if they actually know what's happened. So it's an interesting time. I mean, I will call, you know, some people, in terms of couple therapists, but I'm still waiting for him to get his own therapist. Like, almost a month later, like, still no progress there.</p>

<p>So (pause) and then in the meantime, in Chicago, my uncle is a crazy person and he's basically—he doesn't want to deal with anything at Grandma's—I think this is also a function of him just being upset and sad and (inaudible at 41:12) remind him of Linda if he has to go through the—their sister that passed away—if he has to go through the apartment because all her stuff is there. Well, you know. So he was kind of going ballistic this weekend at my father, which was unpleasant. But he wanted to throw everything away. "Just throw it all away, I don't care. Throw it away, all the papers, all the everything. Throw it away. All of her costume jewelry—I have all the good stuff, throw everything away." Meanwhile, in looking through her stuff we found, like, a really expensive bag. But then he was telling us, "Just throw away everything," so my aunt was like, "Just keep it, whatever." </p>

<p>At first we tried to say, "Oh, no, I'll go back in to look at everything and then we'll split it all up, everything. Every little paper bag, everything." And then (inaudible at 41:48), just, take whatever you want. Like, he was being an asshole. So I took all of the jewelry, I took whatever handbags I wanted, like, OK, you're just going to throw it away. So I'll be spending some time with my dad in Chicago in the coming months. I may even go for a week with him because that's, like, we really—it's a huge project. I mean, if it's (inaudible at 42:09) auction house, it's the furniture and all this stuff. I mean, not like her super expensive stuff but it's just really old (laughs). So that's difficult but interesting, and she's doing pretty well, which is a good thing. So, in the meantime, that's good. [00:42:25]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>Yeah, I think I'm just anxious for this move to, like, happen and the roommate to move in so that at least we can be in this new situation. I think right now it's just leading up to it, it's just very tense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Well, I'm going to stop for now. (inaudible at 43:02).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'll see you Friday then? OK. Well, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Thank you. (inaudible at 43:08).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 43:07).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you too. [00:43:16]</p>

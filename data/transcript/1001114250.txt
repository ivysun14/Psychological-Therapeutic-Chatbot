<center><P><B>PERSON-CENTERED CHILD THERAPY SESSION TRANSCRIPT</B></P></center>

<center><P><B>Introduction</B></P></center>

<P><B>Anin Utigaard, MFT</B> is Clinical Director of the Pacific Institute, and one of four founding chairs of the International Expressive Arts Therapy Association. She was a faculty member of the Person-Centered Expressive Therapy Institute for over 10 years, a program developed by Natalie Rogers, and she has presented workshops on her unique approach, blending the creative language with the person-centered philosophy, worldwide.</P>

<P>Anin Utigaard masterfully teaches us to pay attention to all of the ways we communicate with children in therapy. In this session, she enters the child’s world through her speech, body language and play, and carefully attends to the child’s need to please. Utigaard connects with a little girl’s shyness and fear of doing something wrong. Interacting with her through play and art, Utigaard builds safety and trust, and sparks the girl’s sense of initiative.</P>

<P>Anin Utigaard, MFT: Shayla, I would like to thank you for coming in today to be with us here. And I know you’re surrounded by cameras, so it’s a little scary, huh?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Yeah. And what I want you to know is I would like you to feel comfortable saying, doing whatever you feel comfortable doing. If I ask you a question that you don’t feel comfortable answering, you don’t have to answer it. Okay? This is not about a performance, so I don’t want you to feel like you have to perform. Maybe imagine, you know, it’s just like being in a playroom together, and we’re going to take this opportunity to get to know each other a little better through play, through art. And I want to show you a few things here so you know what you have available, okay?</P>

<P>So here’s some tissue paper that you can use for art or if you were to, say, make a mask or a design.</P>


<P>There’s all sorts of drawing materials here and paper, collage. Also, we have some dishes, some little play portable mobile phones, games, sand. There’s also some sand here. Playdough. Then we have our, the dolls here and a playhouse with some little figures, family figures and puppets. Have you played with puppets before?</P>

<P>Shayla: In a long time.</P>

<P>Utigaard: A long time ago? Mm-hmm. And so there’s this available. Sometimes, you know, playing is a way to tell stories about things that are important to us. So I don’t want you to worry about if you’re doing it the right way. Whatever you’re going to do is going to be the right way, okay?</P>


<P>So try to let go of all the fears about doing something wrong. That’s not possible. All right?</P>

<P>Do you have a sense of what you’d like to play with or what you’d like to do? What do you feel pulled to do? What feels more interesting?</P>

<P>Shayla: Art.</P>

<P>Utigaard: The art? Uh-huh. Okay. And I have big pages like this, and I have construction paper and, with different colors. I even have some scissors over there if you need scissors. And this. And, or if you want to do art on a paper plate. What do you think?</P>

<P>Shayla: I think I’ll do…(Points to construction paper.)</P>

<P>Utigaard: Okay. So let me move these out of the way.</P>

<P>And I bet you want to use some of these. Or we also have some other art materials over there. Do you want me to bring any of that over?</P>

<P>Shayla: No, that’s fine.</P>

<P>Utigaard: No.</P>

<P>Shayla: What do you think I should draw?</P>

<P>Utigaard: I think you should draw whatever you feel like drawing. Anything at all. Remember whatever you do is going to be just great.</P>

<P>Shayla: Draw a sun.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Hmm?</P>

<P>Shayla: The sun.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm. The sun.</P>

<P>Shayla: The grass.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Okay. Okay, I’m going to move some of this out of our way because it’s kind of blocking everything, okay? I’ll put it right here in case we need it.</P>

<P>Shayla: Sky.</P>

<P>And then … no clue what to draw. Like... What do you think I should draw?</P>

<P>Utigaard: I think you should draw whatever you feel like drawing. Do you have any ideas? So you’ve got the sun here and this is …</P>

<P>Shayla: Grass.</P>

<P>Utigaard: … the grass. And…</P>

<P>Shayla: Sky and the birds.</P>

<P>Utigaard: And these are birds? Uh-huh. So what do you feel belongs in that picture with those?</P>

<P>Shayla: Maybe a tree.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So you’re going to draw a tree.</P>

<P>Shayla: What kind of tree should it be? Apple tree?</P>

<P>Utigaard: What would you like it to be? You’re not sure what kind of tree you want to make, huh?</P>

<P>Shayla: I like peaches, so.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Peaches. Oh, there you go. You like peaches?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Maybe draw a butterfly flying.</P>

<P>Draw a design on the wings.</P>

<P>There. And then… I don’t know what to draw.</P>

<P>Utigaard: You’re not sure what to draw on there, huh?</P>

<P>Do you feel like something else belongs in here or does it feel complete or what do you think?</P>

<P>Shayla: I don’t know. There’s a big space over here.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm-hmm. There’s a big space here, and so are you feeling like you want to put something in there or that you should put something in there? Or what do you think?</P>

<P>Shayla: I should.</P>

<P>Utigaard: A "should." It sounds like a "should." Uh-huh. It’s hard being here under, with everybody watching you, huh? Isn’t it? Yeah, it’s hard. So does it make you worry about doing things the wrong way a little bit?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Is there things that you do sometimes that help you relax so that you don’t feel concerned?</P>

<P>Shayla: Twiddle my fingers.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Twiddle your thumbs like this.</P>

<P>Shayla: Should I draw a house?</P>

<P>Utigaard: If you want to draw a house, Shayla, I think… Whatever you want to draw is going to be fine. I really understand why you’re nervous, so. This is an unusual situation.</P>

<P>Shayla: It’s going off the page.</P>

<P>A door.</P>

<P>Windows.</P>

<P>I’m done. I think I’m finished.</P>

<P>Utigaard: You think you’re finished? Okay.</P>

<P>So do you want to tell me about the picture at all?</P>

<P>Shayla: What do you mean? Like…</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Shayla: What do you mean?</P>

<P>Utigaard: Like what does it, like are there things in the picture that you like here or what does it remind you of? Or what’s important about this picture to you?</P>

<P>Shayla: Well, I like butterflies, because that’s why I put butterflies in there.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Uh-huh. You like butterflies.</P>

<P>Shayla: And peaches, so a peach tree.</P>

<P>Utigaard: And you like peaches. Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Shayla: And it sort of reminds me of our house except for the peach tree.</P>

<P>Utigaard: You have a peach tree by your house.</P>

<P>Shayla: No.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Oh, you don’t.</P>

<P>Shayla: I said except for the peach tree.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Oh, except for the peach tree. Okay.</P>

<P>Shayla: In the summer, of course.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So you, so you put things in there that you like, like the butterfly and the peach tree, and did you put anything in here that you didn’t like?</P>

<P>Shayla: Not really.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So it’s all things that you like, huh? Like the house and, and birds.</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: You like birds? Yeah? Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Shayla: I like animals.</P>

<P>Utigaard: You like animals. Uh-huh. I have an animal over there, too. See this, I have a …</P>

<P>Shayla: Turtle.</P>

<P>Utigaard: … little, shy turtle. That looks like… I know he’s shy because he’s kind of a shy turtle, so he hides until he feels really safe. And when he feels safe, he comes out. He’s kind of shy of cameras, too. Would you like to see him? Yeah?</P>


<P>Do you ever feel that way sometimes, too, like right now, maybe?</P>

<P>Shayla: Sort of. Right now, I’m working my way out of my shell.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm-hmm. What name do you think we should give him since he’s so shy?</P>

<P>Shayla: Not sure.</P>

<P>Utigaard: What was that?</P>

<P>Shayla: I’m not sure.</P>

<P>Utigaard: You’re not sure. Yeah. You’d have to get to know him better maybe. But I think I know how he feels. In this environment, he probably wants to hide again.</P>

<P>Shayla: Can I make him hide?</P>

<P>Utigaard: Hmm?</P>

<P>Shayla: Can I make him hide?</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm…if you want to.</P>

<P>Do you think, do you think he feels more comfortable that way? Probably. Well then what happens when he’s stuck inside here?</P>

<P>Shayla: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Since he’s so shy. Do you think he gets lonely in there? Yeah? But it feels safer to him, do you think?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Have you felt like that before?</P>

<P>Shayla: Yeah.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Yeah.</P>

<P>Hi, Turtle. How are you doing?</P>

<P>Shayla: Good.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Are you starting to feel safer to come out?</P>

<P>Shayla: Sort of?</P>

<P>Utigaard: What are you afraid of, Turtle?</P>


<P>Shayla: Not sure.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Are you afraid somebody’s going to hurt you or make fun of you or what?</P>

<P>Shayla: That I can do something.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Hmm. Afraid you’ll do something wrong? Hmm. Oh… poor little guy. Don’t worry.</P>

<P>So he’s very shy.</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Well, it’s nice that he was willing to come visit us today, though. Does he, do you think he’s starting to feel more comfortable?</P>

<P>Shayla: Yep.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Yeah? So if you were here, Turtle, what would you like to do?</P>

<P>Shayla: A picture.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Draw a picture? Oh. What would you like to draw a picture of?</P>

<P>Shayla: Me in the lake.</P>

<P>Utigaard: You in the lake? Oh, okay. Are you going to help him draw it?</P>

<P>Shayla: Sure. I need blue for the water. And dark… Then draw some lily pads.</P>

<P>And need a light green for the turtle. He’ll be sitting on a lily pad.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Oh, so there’s lots of turtles.</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm. Those are his friends and his family.</P>

<P>Utigaard: All of his friends?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm. This one’s him. He’s swimming. That’s his shell.</P>

<P>That’s his friend’s shell and... Whoops. Draw a sunset.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So it’s a sunny day?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Which turtle is he?</P>

<P>Shayla: This one.</P>

<P>Utigaard: That one. And that’s his friend?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm. And what’s his friend’s name?</P>

<P>Shayla: Herman.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Herman. Uh-huh. Herman the turtle. And what about these over here?</P>

<P>Shayla: Want me to draw?…</P>

<P>Utigaard: Are they, are they turtles, too?</P>

<P>Shayla: No, those are the lily pads.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Those are the lily pads. Ah, okay. So he has lily pads, and… so it’s a nice pond?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: He likes living there?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Yeah?</P>


<P>So what is the turtle’s favorite thing to do?</P>

<P>Shayla: Swim.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Swim. He likes to swim in the water. And when he swims, what does he, where does he go when he swims?</P>

<P>Shayla: Just around the pond.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Just around the pond. Does he have family?</P>

<P>Shayla: I’ll draw his family. There’s his brother. Mom and… his dad.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Oh, they’re sitting on the lily pads.</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Ah.</P>

<P>Hmm… So does he, do you have any idea why he feels so shy?</P>

<P>Shayla: He’s not shy when he’s around his family and friends, only when he’s around new people.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Uh-huh. So he’s shy when he’s around, you know, only when he’s with strangers, but with family and friends he’s just fine, right?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: I can understand that. I can understand that. So you know what he’s worried about?</P>

<P>What would happen to him when he’s with strangers? Do you know why that makes him nervous?</P>

<P>Shayla: Because he might do something wrong, and they might laugh at him.</P>

<P>Utigaard: They might laugh at him or make fun of him? Why would they do that?</P>

<P>Shayla: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So, but he’s, that’s what he’s afraid of, afraid they’ll make fun of him or laugh at him for doing something wrong or different than they, than they do? Is that right?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: But when he gets to know them, then he feels more comfortable, and he’s not afraid anymore, right?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Yeah. Did you have friends like that, too, where you didn’t know them at first and you were really nervous, and then you got to know them and then, and then you felt more comfortable and at ease?</P>

<P>Shayla: Yeah.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Yeah. Like going to school, a new school. Like next year, you go to a new classroom, right? So the, as, the first day it’s scary and… Is that right?</P>

<P>Shayla: Unless you know some people then.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You’ll know some people.</P>

<P>Shayla: But the teacher is new.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Uh-huh. The teacher will be new.</P>

<P>So how are you feeling now, Shayla? About, are you feeling a little more comfortable or are you still feeling a little nervous?</P>

<P>Shayla: Comfortable.</P>

<P>Utigaard: A little more comfortable. Uh-huh. Do you want to, did you want to try one of the other things? Or do you want to still draw? Or what do you think? We have about a half an hour left, so that’s a little bit of time.</P>

<P>Shayla: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Whatever you want to do. Remember there’s not a wrong way. I just want you to feel comfortable doing what you feel comfortable doing.</P>

<P>Shayla: I’ll play sand, in the sand.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Uh-huh. Oh, the sand. Okay. Should I bring it to the table?</P>

<P>Shayla: I don’t care.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Okay. It’s up to you. Do you want to play with it here or…</P>

<P>Shayla: I’ll play with it at the table.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Hmm?</P>

<P>Shayla: At the table. Please.</P>

<P>Utigaard: At the table. Okay. Oh, wow. This is heavier than it looks. Okay. So with the sand, would you, do you want anything to work with the sand like dishes or people or…</P>

<P>Shayla: This is probably fine.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Uh-huh. Or build something in the sand.</P>

<P>Shayla: I’ll build something for him, the turtle.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Oh, you’re going to build something for the turtle. Okay. This is especially for the turtle.</P>

<P>Shayla: That will be the shape to it. Then make a door.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Oh, it’s a little door?</P>

<P>Shayla: He probably won’t be able to fit in it, though.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Hmm?</P>

<P>Shayla: Probably won’t be able to fit in it, though.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Well, we could just pretend.</P>

<P>Shayla: Okay.</P>

<P>And then there will be a back door. And a window.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So he has a little window to look out of.</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm. And another window on this side. There. And make a garden.</P>


<P>Utigaard: Oh, a garden. Yum. So he has things to eat.</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Yeah, that’s important.</P>

<P>Shayla: A fence.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Is that just like a protective little wall?</P>

<P>Shayla: Yeah.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Wow, so he’s going to be really protected in there, huh? Because he has this little, neat little cave in the sand and a protective wall.</P>

<P>Shayla: Garden will be up here.</P>

<P>Utigaard: A garden for food. Wow.</P>

<P>Do you think he would feel happy about being in that home?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: What do you think he would like about the home?</P>

<P>Shayla: Probably that it’s protective.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Protective. Uh-huh. Because he’d be safe. He’d be safe in there, huh?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Hmm. And sand is next to water usually, isn’t it?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm. So he could go swimming a lot.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So he can go swimming and having fun. Uh-huh. And going to his lily pads and everything. Should we check with him to see if he likes it?</P>

<P>Shayla: Okay.</P>

<P>He likes it.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm-hmm. Probably could, we could imagine it’s bigger. So he’s nodding his head. Does that mean he really likes it?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Wow! It looks like he really likes it. It looks like he’s very happy. Oh. Wow, a home that’s protected. Ah…It looks like he’s eager to go in there, huh?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Hm… So he probably appreciates that you made that home for him. Do you think?</P>

<P>Shayla: Probably.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm. I wonder if that, if that, we could draw it in or if, do you want to draw it?</P>

<P>Shayla: Sure. Should I just draw it on this piece of paper?</P>

<P>Utigaard: If you want to, or do you want another sheet?</P>

<P>Shayla: I’ll just draw it on this.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Okay. Should I move this?</P>

<P>Shayla: Thank you.</P>

<P>Utigaard: This is your water here.</P>

<P>Shayla: This is for the land. That’s the sand.</P>


<P>Those are his windows and that’s his door. The sun’s shining on it, so that’s why it’s so light. And…fence.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So that, it’s got his protective wall again.</P>

<P>Shayla: And the garden.</P>

<P>Utigaard: And its garden for food.</P>


<P>Shayla: There’s his home.</P>

<P>Utigaard: There’s his home.</P>

<P>Shayla: They’re having a party because celebrating—</P>

<P>Utigaard: They’re having a, having a what?</P>

<P>Shayla: A party.</P>

<P>Utigaard: A party.</P>

<P>Shayla: Celebrating his new home.</P>

<P>Utigaard: They’re celebrating the new home. Uh-huh. So him and him and the ones on the lily pad, they’re all celebrating the new home?</P>


<P>Uh-huh. So they all live in there together or just, or just…</P>

<P>Shayla: Just him.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Just him. Just him lives in there. But they can come, they come visit sometimes?</P>

<P>Shayla: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Just close friends and family?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Yeah. Oh, yeah, it looks like he has this nice protective wall and…</P>

<P>Shayla: Garden.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Is there anything else he needs, do you think? Can you think of anything else he might need?</P>

<P>Shayla: Not really.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Nope. Just family, friends, home, security. Garden.</P>

<P>Shayla: Which gives him food and stuff.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Hmm?</P>


<P>Shayla: The garden gives him food, and then he drinks from the pond.</P>

<P>Utigaard: That’s just about everything he needs, huh? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That’s just about everything we all need, huh?</P>

<P>Shayla: And if he likes TV, I can give him a satellite dish.</P>

<P>Utigaard: You could give him a satellite disk so he could see what’s going on in the rest of the world? Is that right? Yeah. Uh-huh. Did you want to put a satellite disk in there? Is that what you want, like to do?</P>

<P>Shayla: It’s on top of the roof, right?</P>

<P>Utigaard: If you want to. Wherever you think, Shayla. I’m wondering if we, well, we might have something. Well, you’re building it.</P>

<P>If we want, we could probably even use a little water if you want. Do you need some water?</P>

<P>Shayla: That’s fine.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So now he’s got a satellite disk so he can stay in touch with what’s happening elsewhere and watch TV. Is that right?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That sounds important, huh?</P>

<P>Shayla: Well, if he likes it.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Shayla: I forgot the sky on my picture.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm. So this is the sky?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So do you think he has a pretty good life, the turtle?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: He does now, huh? He’s at home with a satellite and a garden and they’re all celebrating.</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Do you think he likes having his own secure little space?</P>

<P>Shayla: Yup.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Yeah, he does. He definitely likes to have his own space. Do you think he likes having a satellite disk?</P>

<P>Shayla: Yup. Just in case he gets bored.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Yeah. It’s important, huh? Huh? Uh-huh. Okay. Well, anything else that you feel like you want to do before you finish this, like maybe… Well, whatever you think. What do you think?</P>

<P>Shayla: I’ll draw another picture if you like.</P>

<P>Utigaard: You want to draw another picture?</P>

<P>Shayla: Okay.</P>

<P>Utigaard: With that. Okay. And I also have some of, some more crepas over there and markers, and we have markers here, too.</P>

<P>Shayla: I’ll just use this.</P>

<P>I’m not sure what I should draw. What do you think I should draw?</P>

<P>Utigaard: Can, can you think of something that you like to draw?</P>

<P>That’s important to you, Shayla?</P>

<P>Shayla: Since I love my family a lot, I’m going to draw a big heart that says, "I love my family." Draw it this way. Oops.</P>

<P>Shayla: Can’t get the…</P>

<P>Utigaard: Having trouble getting it out, huh?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: That one’s a hard one.</P>

<P>Shayla: I’ll just use this. Use purple to outline it.</P>


<P>And then I’ll draw a heart with each of their names in them.</P>


<P>My mom, my dad, Cy, Lisa… Okay, this is going to take long. There’s Chris. There’s Adam. There’s Marina. Ben. David. Ryan.</P>


<P>Zach. Steven. And Kyla. And then there’s Acacia. I’m not sure how to spell her name, but…</P>

<P>Utigaard: Well, you know who it is, right?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Wow. So it says, "I love my family." So that’s, when I said draw something really important, this is really, really important to you, is what I get.</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: And who are all these people?</P>


<P>Shayla: There’s Acacia; she’s my sister, and she died.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Your sister and she died. She’s important to you, uh-huh.</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm. My mom, my dad, and Cy is my stepdad and then Lisa is my stepmom. Then Chris is Cy’s son, so he’s my stepbrother. Same with Adam; he’s my stepbrother. And Marina is my sister and Ben is my brother, and David is my brother. Ryan is Lisa’s son, and so he’s my stepbrother and same with Zach. And then Steven is my brother and Kyla my mom and Cy had.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Wow. So you have a lot of people that are important to you, huh? And, and it seems like you didn’t want to forget any of them, right?</P>

<P>You wanted to make sure they were all listed there, right? Right. Because they’re all important to you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Kind of like the turtle. You know, where did the turtle go? He, it seemed like he has quite a few friends and family, too, huh?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So you know, we’re going to end soon, Shayla, but I’m just wondering if there’s anything else important that you want to share with me or say about anything, about your pictures or the turtle or…?</P>

<P>Shayla: Not really.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Nope. Nope. You’ve said it all with your art, huh? Yeah. Yeah. I really get what you’re saying, that your family is really important to you.</P>

<P>It sounds, it seems like it’s really important to the turtle, too, to have a secure home …</P>

<P>Shayla: And his friends.</P>

<P>Utigaard: … and house and family and friends and a lake that he can swim in. It seems like, what I hear you saying is these, that this is important to you, too.</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm. And my friends, but I didn’t write them.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm-hmm. So how, how do you feel about this? How has it been for you?</P>

<P>Shayla: It’s been fun, but at first, it was, I was nervous, but then I got comfortable.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And as time went on, were you feeling a little more comfortable?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Mm-hmm. So it’s a little easier?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: It takes awhile, huh, when you’re in front of strange people. Kind of like this turtle. He was kind of shy, too. But you helped him get over that, it seems like. Right?</P>

<P>Shayla: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So maybe he wants to thank you. "Thank you."</P>

<P>Shayla: No problem.</P>

<P>Utigaard: So it was great getting to meet you.</P>

<P>Shayla: Great getting to meet you, too.</P>

<P>Utigaard: I appreciate you coming in here and being willing to do this, Shyla.</P>

<P>Shayla: Shayla.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Shayla. You’re very brave. Very brave, and I appreciate you telling me the right name: Shayla. Right? Shayla. Okay.</P>

<P>Shayla: Don’t worry. Most people get it wrong.</P>

<P>Utigaard: A lot of people get it wrong? Oh. It’s a nice… Do you like your name?</P>

<P>Shayla: It’s okay. But I never see it on any of those stamp things or anything.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Uh-huh. You look in the stores and you can’t, you don’t see it anywhere.</P>

<P>Shayla: Yeah, you have to get it specially made.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Uh-huh. It’s a special name. For a special person.</P>

<P>Okay, thank you.</P>

<P>Shayla: Thank you for having me.</P>

<P>Utigaard: And if you, do you want to take these with you or do you want to leave them here?</P>

<P>Shayla: I’ll take them.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Okay.</P>

<P>Shayla: Thank you.</P>

<P>Utigaard: Oh, you’re welcome.</P>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So how are we doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I went to the doctor last week and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What did he say?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He did a continence study or whatever that is to stop my leakage and he said I definitely have incontinence.  And, um, he gave me some pills to help stop the urgency of having to, you know, the leakage and on the 9th I go back and he'll discuss doing the surgery on me.  Um, he's going to, um, repair the sling because my bladder, the tube that goes from my kidney to my bladder is bent or something so that's why it's giving, it's not sitting right, that's why I have the urgency.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And the leakage problem and then, um, he says he's going to take out the mesh that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] put in and, hopefully, my, um, wall will be strong enough to hold now.  I have a concern there and I told him this, you know - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If the mesh is in there and it's down to a small patch, by you taking that out, is this going to help and he says, well if it happens again, you know, I'll just come back and repair it.  That still doesn't give me very much confidence, you know, if it happens again, that's part of my fear.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If what happens again?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If the rectocele comes out again, that's part of my fear, because he says I'll be able to go back to work and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Don't these guys get it, you can't go back to work lifting this stuff.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know but when I go back and talk to him on the 9th, um, I'm going to, um, let him read my paper.  I didn't have enough time the other day because it was in a process and he didn't get there till late.  His helpers, nurse's aides or whatever were doing a study on me and, um, so when I go back and talk to him, I'm going to have him read my, um, essay of what I do for my job.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He says he's going to cut, he's going to go in my stomach and cut out, um, a small piece of tissue from there to hold the tube up so my system or my body won't reject any kind of -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Whatever, you know, thing that they would use so I'm okay with that part.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but it's the other parts I'm concerned with.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I don't know, well you try with him and otherwise I'll, did you get disconnected at workman's comp.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't heard anything from workman's comp.  Um, [NAME OTHER] sent a letter out the other day stating my condition and all this and I sent it certified and I just got my green card back.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I do know they've received it and, um, - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That'll just make it all a lot easier.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If I get workman's comp or what?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I could take you out to get workman's comp and then we could disconnect with it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER] gave me a letter that this woman gave me permission to have, she had the same thing and her doctor wrote a fantastic letter explaining the pelvic floor of a woman, um, and by all means, any heavy lifting after you've had the surgery, it's going to do something to you and, um, just that alone and I have IBS so I have no control over that, this whole past weekend, I couldn't go anywhere because my stomach was acting up and I kept on taking all my medication I was supposed to so, um -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The only solution I've come up with is to quit eating.  You know, if I only eat oatmeal or something, maybe that'll stop me from having this irritation, the bowel syndrome.  I don't eat anything spicy anymore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I think I'm taking, I'm taking up to 4 of those Lorazepam a day, is that too much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Which one, the Ativan you mean?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I take like 3 - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does that help your gut at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It doesn't help my stomach but it does definitely make me relax so I usually take 3 during the day and then if I lay in bed for like 45 minutes and I haven't been able to go to sleep, I take 1 and it seems to help me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's okay, don't worry about it.  You're taking the Paxil too, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Do those usually give you a headache, has anybody ever complained about headaches with those?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No but anything is possible.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it what, all day long you have a headache?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, just like around 2 hours after I take it, it just feels like, you know, it's squeezing in here but after I go past it, it seems to be, it seems to be all right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When do you take it, daytime?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I usually take it in the morning when I get up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'd move it to before bed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Before bed?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And that way I won't</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Take the Ativan and that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, okay, that makes sense. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean if it keeps up, I guess we could switch it to something else.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's been working.  I'm not, I'm not, um, crying as much anymore and that makes me feel better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  So you stayed in the house all weekend?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, yep, because I didn't trust going anywhere because, like I said, I have no control.  I mean for the leakage that I have, I mean I just turned the water on yesterday to put in the sink to wash dishes and just the hearing of the water I went and I had just gone to the bathroom so I can put a pad on to help me with that so I don't, you know, but the other one I can't because if you feel like, you know, you have gas to pass or whatever, you just can't take the chance of letting it go because you don't know what it's going to be.  I usually hear,um, like a gurgling sound, it's called [INAUDIBLE] or something like that, the doctor told me the word but I usually can hear that going but, um - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't feel it as much anymore when it's, when I know it's coming.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because, see, your large intestine they come up here, over here, down and then out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So when you hear, it's moving stuff along.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well see now that they've fixed that rectocele, I don't feel it in my stomach as much as I do anymore, so it's, you know, it's in a different area so I have to feel, you know, I have to learn the feeling of it but this past weekend was something else.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you take that Lomotil for it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, they gave me, I just got the prescription yesterday, it's a blue pill, it's called Bentyl something but there's a generic name.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, Bentyl.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Bentyl.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is the one for that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> IBS but they have another name, it's called Depa something, Ditropan is that what the word is?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It might be something like that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's a blue pill.  I just feel like I'm going to have a pill for my leakage, got to have a pill for my IBS, I have to have a pill so I don't get depressed, I have to have a pill since I don't have anxiety, and, um, I have a patch for my blood pressure, I've got to take estrogen and it's like oh my gosh, I'm so young to have all these pills in me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you have quite a variety of things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You've got to get it so you can lead a more normal life though, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Don't worry about work.  I can't see you going back there.  The trouble is, they might come up with something else like the, down at the main post office or something. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know, I don't mind working, I don't, I'm a worker</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But if I have to lift something up and if I feel anything, it's always going to be there, did I hurt myself.  If I get a pain, I don't want to become a hypochondriac, I don't want to become a manic, you know, but you're the only one that knows your body and when you're in pain, you know - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You can look at somebody and go, oh they look fine but you don't know what's going on in their heart, their head, their stomach. Fear is a terrible thing, it can really make your, you know, lose it sometimes I guess.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's just not going to come up.  We'll just find a way around it, you know, so how long, how long have you worked there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Twenty years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean the worst thing is just do the medical disability retirement.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I think he's trying to go for but the doctor is telling me I'll be fine because you know you like that job, you know, go back to do it.  Well, yeah, what I like and what's up here, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> See they think you just, they think you just do letters all day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know and that's why I wanted him to read what I do for a job because I just don't pick up 70 pounds 1 day, I just don't bend over 1 day, you know, I'm constantly, constantly doing stuff.  I give the post office 110% of me.  I'm not a slacker.  I have a hard time dealing with slackers because then somebody else has to carry their weight plus what they have to do to make up for the people that don't do their jobs.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we're getting some good out of the medicines, that's good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I really do feel, I feel a lot calmer and because I didn't want to get hooked on pills so I, you know, I was just taking 1 of the Lorazepam like every other day or something but now that I'm taking 3 it seems to help me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They're not that big, I mean it's, you would have to take, let's see, I'll say 12 or 15 a day to even get dependent on it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no, no, no.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well, so he kind of told you, when did he say the surgery would be?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I go back to see him on the 9th to get the results of my, I guess the test and they gave me pills to help my urgency of having to go to the bathroom and I go back with him on the 9th to speak to him about it and I guess to set up the surgery and then he said around 6 to 8 weeks so I don't know if that would put me into Christmas, past Christmas - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But if I do have to do anything, I sure wouldn't want it to be during Christmas because that's when you have those parcels to do and you're working hard, you're busting your butt in the month of December to get package, you have to go deliver your packages before you can even deliver your mail sometimes because those big vehicles, they're all filled up, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So you can't have mail and packages in there so</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, is this [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] that you went to see?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], uh-huh, and the accident insurance that I had that I've been paying on since 1999, they, um, sent it in to review and they came back saying they can't cover me because even though the agent that wrote me up for this, um, he was thinking that I had just got this and I had just got my husband's accidental policy last year, I've had mine since '99 and I also asked for my medical charts from the doctor and on all the paper and everything, I was reading, it didn't mention anything about my left side  hurting me until 2001.  I got my insurance on May the 15th 1999, I didn't mention anything about my pain hurting me until 2001. I said my left side was hurting me and then it continued on saying my left side had hurt me but if I had my hysterectomy in '91 and I was working, I started the post office in '87, I had my hysterectomy in '91, I got my insurance in '99, I didn't complain of a pain until, um, 2000, 2000 in August, so it was well over a year that I complained about my left side and then somewhere in the notes they mentioned that I might have had, I guess everything that I've been saying, my stomach hurting me, my bladder, that it could be fibromyalgia or something.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Fibromyalgia.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, well even if they say that the reason they're not covering me is because I only had this insurances for 6 months and I had mentioned that I was hurting in 2001, they, I was covered, I was covered for it because I paid for it and I started in '99, I had no idea what was going to happen to me about me complaining about my left side but I've been complaining about my left side since 2001 and now this is 2007 and it said that if you get this insurance and you have to have it for, um, 2 years without ever putting a claim in it or getting disability from it, I never got any of that stuff until this year in 2007 when it was finally acknowledged, the fact that I had this, so they turned me, and then I found out too, because I haven't been working, I haven't been making payments into them and so they said that my policies all lapsed, well I didn't know that I was supposed to be sending money in because my agent, you know, said that he would tell me when they needed to be paid, well he didn't do it but I did send money in to cover my lapse but when you have lapse going on in your insurance, you have to explain why you had lapse and I put down because, um, I'm out because I haven't been working,  I haven't been, um, receiving any pay, so I put that down, so I don't know if they're still going to accept the fact that, you know, I lapsed and they already know and that I have this condition.  I don't know if they can turn me down for not keeping this insurance.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if it's a problem, I'll give you a lawyer's name who just deals with that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Insurance companies.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it made me upset that day and I got one of those pills and I called them and told them that, um, I was contesting their review and for them to say that I wasn't eligible for it, I called back and contested it because - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've had this insurance for too long and they were going to send me all my premiums that I had paid in for 6 months, well that was for my husband, it wasn't for me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, with all this going on and for me not to think that I'm a smart person, I'm working for myself on my behalf this time and, um, I don't know why I tear up when I'm defending myself but I lost my train of thought, just a minute, it made me, if I hadn't been paying attention, because when he said that I've only had this for 6 months, I go okay, whatever, but when he said it to me, I started thinking about it, I've only had it for, I told him, I go, I've had this insurance for a long time.  He goes, no you haven't [PATIENT NAME], you've only had it for 6 months.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, he's talking about your husband's.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but he was knowing that I just got this disability stuff last year but he forgot it was for my husband because I've had this insurance for, ever since I became a regular carrier I got it all.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Does it, why do you think I tear up?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean it's enough to make you cry but it's enough to make you angry too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I was angry, I was angry and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well some ladies, you learned when you were a kid not to be angry, what happens is you cry instead.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well I've just learned to turn the other cheek too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well don't do that with these insurance companies, I'll tell you that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, but I don't want to come across angry to them either, you know, I'm a postal worker</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you didn't come across angry, I mean that's something you're justified to be angry about.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it's not their fault, it's not their fault, the ones you've been talking to, they're just answering the phone trying to answer your questions.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but they've been trained to try to put the screws to you too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and this letter that this lady let me have to read, it explains in there, when you tell somebody, you know, when they're asking you questions, why are you here, whatever, and you try to explain to them a rectocele and a cystocele, most of the people have no idea what that is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then to go into detail explaining it, it's very, very embarrassing, you know -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, that is why they call these areas private parts because, you know, everybody does it but this is your own personal private area and to have to explain it over and over, it just, it demeans you, it does, I think that's one of the reasons why I felt less of a woman, you know, even though nobody can see, see it, you know it's there and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're not less of a person or a woman for it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know, well this is really, it's really put a lot of stress on me.  I think I've aged, I really have this year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you've had plenty going on.  Do we have to do anymore paperwork?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not that I know of.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For you being out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He gave me, um, he gave me a paper to give to the other doctor but, like I said, I didn't have enough time to give it to him because he, when I ask these doctors questions, they're thinking that I'm asking them to put their life on the line to do this.  All he wants to do is to hear, do you think my work aggravated my situation and any common person would know that a rectocele is having to put stress on an area that's weak and definitely - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe you already did this but you've got plenty of time, take your time and think through an average day or the average week how many times you picked up different size, different weight packages.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's very easy, I don't even take out the garbage now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, I mean in your job.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In your job all along, all these years.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because that's what they're not getting.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  On an average day, I guarantee you, an average day I pick up more than 500 pounds, one way or another through the packages, through the mail, through the newspapers that come in bundles of a hundred, from the advertisements, the flyers, they pack so much crap in those little pieces of paper for advertisement and then there was a book that I used to get, every book was that thick and I had almost 400 of them to deliver to people.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they come in stacks like that.  I mean it hurt my shoulders, no telling what it was doing to my insides.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's what might be better for a doctor to see that this job involves, um, picking up stacks of book that weight, then you're going to have to say 30-40 pounds - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or whatever, you know, and you probably had to put it on to a cart, take the cart out to the car, then put it into your car.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Lift it up, I had to lift it up and not only all the physical, your job is very mental, you have to be able to focus on so many things, the correct address because if you have the same address then a different street and it's a numbered street, so much mail used to be delivered, misdelivered on my route before I got it.  My subs have a hard time putting mail in the wrong slots, then you have to look out for animals, then you have to look out for older people that that's their livelihood, they come out behind you and you have to be paying attention, you have to watch out for children, traffic, then you have to listen to the supervisors being on your back because you're not on time and it's very stressful and then to think that I'm going to have to go back in there knowing that I'm going to be under pressure to get my job done and all this stuff and if I'm in pain, it's just another additive.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I don't see any way you could go back to that job.  There's no way they can make that job no lifting.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or you know, I don't care if you're limited to 5 or 10 pounds.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The doctors say no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can't be doing that job.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll be able to go back lifting 70 pound, I don't know what, I really can't - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I can't conceive that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I just, you know, 5 or 10 pounds is something different than 70 pounds because, you know, that's a lot of stuff, especially if you have to carry it a distance.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Even the clerks out front have to lift things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they have to pick up parcels and they have gurneys right there, you know, and then they might have 4 or 5 hours where all they get is 2 letters or they might have packages that they have to weight then they put it behind them, they're not having to pick up continuously all that weight constantly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they get 4 breaks a day, they get 15, 4 minute breaks a day.  Being a real carrier, we're allowed 30 minutes a day and if you go to the bathroom, that's considered part of your break.  Now [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was telling me that he told me to go do exercises like emptying my bladder out every 15 minutes, well if I'm there 8 hours a day and 15 minutes I'm emptying my bladder, how many hours is that taking.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> At least 2.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah because I don't smoke, I don't smoke cigarettes, you know, and I don't, I hardly ever ever take a break.  I go through, I used to go through McDonald's drive in and I'd give them my money and I'd have them throw my hamburgers in my vehicle so I wouldn't have to get back out of my seatbelt.  I bumped my legs and I can see I have good reflexes because it's jumping now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well you're not going back to that so I don't think you should worry yourself about that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Do I seem better today?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, I can tell, oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like my daughter is telling me, mom you're letting yourself go, you know, go do something with your hair mom, go do something and it was, you know, I just quit caring about taking care of it so I went and got it cut, I went and got it trimmed today so at least it makes me feel better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you're getting out of it, okay.</p>

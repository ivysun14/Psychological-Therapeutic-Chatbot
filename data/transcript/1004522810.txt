<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just realized I left something in the fridge at work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway, the building's closed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. (voices overlap, inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, no it's just I bought some groceries, and one of the things I bought was whipping cream, and I need whipping cream for the weekend. And yogurt, dammit! I'll just have to go to the grocery store. Um (sigh) so uh as usual, it has been a stressful week. Um, and I don't know, I feel like I've hit like, kind of a new at work low.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With the exception of throwing up all (ph) the time.</p>

<p>[1:00]</p>

<p>So we, we're having a staff meeting with the head of the library, he sent out agenda that said he would be discussing our new changing, like what our department will be like in the new library.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Is this Karl or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is Karl.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like really worried and nervous that you rang (inaudible) and then the thing that hit the most is at the beginning of the meeting, like right when it started, someone was like 'Oh Karen can you fix this computer thing?' And I always hate that when I'm like 'Uh I'm in a meeting,' but you know, went up, looked at it, and someone was doing like a webinar, and there were problems with the sound, and it was kinda working but not quite, and I didn't wanna screw up their thing by tinkering it so I was like 'I'll come back later.' Go down to the meeting and Karl has a PowerPoint going and he's showing us the Tower of Babel, like this this painting from like you, four or five hundred years ago...</p>

<p>[2:07]</p>

<p>...and everyone looks a little confused. And so I sat down and he just sort of, he starts off by ranting about Copyright because the image of the painting is c - , like the photograph of the painting is copyrighted. So he wanted to use it in a presentation but they just gave him videotape for, but the organization was like, Well we can't videotape that slide because of copyright. Because you don't have the right to that. So he was mad about that, he's like 'It's stupid, it's an old painting, you know, why is there copyright? And then he started complaining about the copyright extensions are stupid because the kids who created it are just greedy and they didn't really make the object anyway. And like I don't understand what, why, what that has to do with anything. Um...</p>

<p>[3:03]</p>

<p>...and he gave, he kind of half did, half didn't give a PowerPoint presentation about changing libraries. It had nothing to do with our department. So, partway through it I kinda half turned to one of my co-workers and was like 'Did I miss something at the beginning?' He said 'No, this is just happening.' So it was a PowerPoint about how like (inaudible) had to go to Tahiti in order to like have a new frame of mind so you he could make art and I'm thinking what, like –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [That's not a very good example.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know (inaudible) Tahiti and [slept with] (ph) a few pubescent (ph) girls, you know, could have syphilis and died horribly. Where are we going with this! (says loudly, both laughing) You know, and um, the painting he showed was (inaudible) like one with lots of half-naked Tahitian women.</p>

<p>[4:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I really wanted to say something but I was just like, 'If I say anything, it's all going downhill and I'll be unable to stop.' So I just sat there, and he discussed tube (ph) and throat singing. Karl's a musician.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it still doesn't make it relevant. And he talked about how everything's gonna be in the Cloud in five years, everything in the library will be in the Cloud, and we're gonna be moving towards open source, being open, like moving towards everything being open source and having an open source library. (pause) And so he did that for like 20 minutes. And then there was a, really (ph) made me mad it wasn't even like in the presentation, it was like when you're practicing a presentation and you're like 'Here's a slide, oh this is gonna be kinda about this,' but you don't really get it you just kinda are running through your slides and just kinda talking.</p>

<p>[5:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's what he did. He didn't give an actual presentation, he just sort of –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like that's sort of like his rough draft, practice version in front of all of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except that he's 40, he's already given it as a talk that was videotaped. So he's already done it as a real presentation, but we got the kinda rough draft version, for some reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And afterward?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah he gave us his presentation a couple weeks ago at [inaudible]. So Tuesday he just decided to show us the slides and do this weird like rough drafty version of it. I think he was trying to be informal, and casual. Maybe. But it was just very weird. Because like, so there was this rant, he ranted about copyright twice. And um, at the end, like you know we're doing questions, so I asked him, you know, what did he mean by open source library....</p>

<p>[6:09]</p>

<p>...because he didn't really explain it, and he was just like 'Well it's gonna be open source.' And so I gave some examples of things that are open source, like open source software, or unconferences...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like like, unconference, where it's like a, you can have a conference but it's not like, it's a, people organize to have their rooms, and like participants kind of crowd source, like collectively decide or crowd source, who's gonna speak on what topics.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like having a conference without all the hierarchy of a conference. And in theory like, anyone could speak on a topic, like their knowledge doesn't matter. If they're like the head of the library or a door checker, they're knowledgeable on the topic and they can speak about it.</p>

<p>[7:00]</p>

<p>So, Karl was like 'No, we can't, that, no you need to have like supervision from above.' I was like 'OK.' And he's like 'Yeah but but that's not open source library.' You could say like basically he didn't know what open source was, like (inaudible) that he was talking, that you were talking at cross purposes 'cause they didn't understand what open source libraries were.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which was your question in the first place, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he couldn't, I don't think he knows what open source means. Um actually I'm sure he doesn't know what it means. So that was really awkward and weird. And (inaudible) about copyright, I was like 'Well you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't, sorry, doesn't open source have a pretty specific meaning in reference to software? To do with uh software...</p>

<p>[8:00]</p>

<p>...that is compiled? You can get the code for it so you can (voices overlap, inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Open source means something really specific. So like open source software is usually free or a nominal fee and anyone can edit it and like anyone can share it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...special license, you might need a license for...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Creative Commons licenses are part of open source, or they've been giving like seeing things called open access academia, where scholars can upload articles to basically a free journal, so that anyone can read them. And there are people who do like, um, someone I know has been doing this thing where, just at academic conferences she asks for people who will consider uploading their PowerPoint presentation or like whatever they've created, to open source academia so that people can share it. 'Cause like most people don't really care. They don't, they're like 'Whatever, I don't care if people see this.' It's not like it's a journal article. Um, and so that way the information gets out there.</p>

<p>[9:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And that's also called open source.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like part of the open source concept.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right it sorta takes the metaphor for open source software and applies it in other domains.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah so it's really cool and I know a ton of people who do it, like open source software and open source, right. And so, Karl didn't know what that meant. Like it was super clear. So I just associated being like, and he was like 'Oh well you don't really,' like he was telling me I didn't understand, I was thinking I totally understand. And he just, then he wandered off about copyright again. And I asked him like, 'Well you know, like does that mean that Cambridge's gonna drop its copyright on the Cambridge seal?' He's like 'Oh God, no no no, obviously that has to stay copyrighted.' (both laughing) Yeah that's what I thought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Little provocative.</p>

<p>[10:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yes. (THERAPIST: still laughing) 'Cause he kept going on about how it was covered, it was stupid. (voices overlap)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well how many reasons do you have to be pissed off sitting in there, like...feel like you're getting a half-ass presentation that has been a topic that sort of you were promised he would speak about, that whether it was good news or bad news, at least would have allayed the terrible anxiety like hanging over yours and everybody else's' head about what the new organizational library's gonna look like. And then he totally proceeded not to talk about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other thing that really frustrated me was his narrow mind toward open source. Because open source libraries, it's like a really interesting concept, that he knows nothing about. And I had this moment of, 'Oh maybe we could actually talk about like something interesting.' And the answer was no.</p>

<p>[11:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, so it was like, promise, disappointment, promise, disappointment, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I did ask him like (inaudible) to be slightly obnoxious, but I was also curious like what he was gonna say. You know like how's he gonna respond to that. 'Cause he could have been like 'It's a trademark,' there's lots of ways you can go. And he just didn't go to any of them. And one person, she walked out in the middle of the meeting, um because he was just (voices overlap) yeah just left. She didn't offer any explanation, just got up and left. And after my attempt to ask some questions that failed, he quietly asked us, asked people for more questions and we just sat there. And then he let us leave, early.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) it was just, and the things I'm describing, like that isn't what his presentation was really about, I think...</p>

<p>[12:03]</p>

<p>...like I don't really know what his presentation was about. Like there were these weird little highlights, but I I just don't know. And it was just, it was so horrible, 'cause like we're all stuck there, and he is like really being competent (ph) and we're just kind of stuck. Like I like, it well you can either get up and leave, or continue to suffer through. And I just looked (inaudible) 'Oh I could do that.' But Karl's lock, top and (inaudible) I'm like 'I can't, ugh' and so I started writing a grocery list, as you do. Um so that was just, like, so frustrating and awful 'cause he, like I just, he you know like he said he was gonna discuss the (inaudible) apartment and then he didn't. And I really, 'cause he sent out the e-mail reminder on Monday.</p>

<p>[13:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like he, sounds like, in a way, he totally blew you off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I just like, he usually doesn't give meeting agendas, and he gave it to us like the day before so, it just seems really obnoxious to be like, 'This is agenda' and then, no it's not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, I would imagine that he gives you the agenda, he gives you the agenda, it (inaudible) a topic that everybody's anxious about right? And then like it's really in the air for everybody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and we're all like dying to know, we haven't, like no one really knows what's happening. And the people in the department who have been offered earlier retirement have to make a decision on it before they find out what their job is gonna be like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it's awful. So, they were all like 'Yes we get to find out what our job is like before, you know (pause) and then that never happened.</p>

<p>[14:09]</p>

<p>And it just was like, it was just such a, like obnoxious waste of our time. Like we could have been doing anything that would have been more useful. So that's just that about that, and then I went up to (sigh) see the big computer that was not working well, and I waited till they were done with their little thing and I was tinkering with it and it wasn't working, the sound wasn't coming out. And I found one way to do it, but just like it didn't seem to be working right. And so I called over to my IT department to ask for help. And I get sent on to Harry who's the head of the department, and he just starts kind of yelling at me that it does work. It's hard to like, that's how, it's not like he was yelling at me. He's somebody who always speaks really loud and fast, and never lets you like, there's no space for anyone to answer. Like he'll ask you like a bunch of rapid-fire questions and never fit you in.</p>

<p>[15:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah no [you think] (ph) he talks fast but you can't find an opening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No no I'm good at shoving into conversations and like he, yeah, so he was just like 'It is working.' 'Well Harry, I can't get any sound,' 'It's working, it's working, you just don't understand, it's totally working we tested it two months ago,' and he's just repeating 'It's working' I was like OK, but, and it just made me so upset 'cause I felt like he was completely dismissing what I was saying, like I was standing there, it wasn't working. And he's just saying, No. And so I just, like I felt myself like starting to cry. So I sort of was like 'OK, could someone please come over?' I managed to get that out, and he said yes, so I was like 'Great bye,' and hung up really quick. And –</p>

<p>[16:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, which day was this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was Tuesday, and it was right after that meeting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ouch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it was kinda like, building on each other. So I was really upset, and I was like, 'Well, I'm gonna go, I think I'm just gonna go to the bathroom. Like to the stall and just cry.' Just super upset. And I was crying in the bathroom and then I realized someone else was crying in the bathroom. And I was just like 'Oh my God, I can't believe like there are two people like we're just, the other person was I'm pretty sure a grad student. 'Cause she, at several points she was saying like 'I should have never gotten in' or something like that. And I was like well I really wanna give you some like Kleenex, but if you're in the bathroom with the door shut, you don't want, like you don't wanna be interrupt—I didn't wanna be interrupted, so I just sat there and cried for a while. And unfortunately I had my make up on, so it was everywhere.</p>

<p>[17:17]</p>

<p>Um (pause) and it was just like, I don't know, it was just, it just like felt like such a low point like (pause) I don't know, like I felt like just like very (pause, sigh) like I I just think I kind of want someone to pay attention to what I'm saying, pay attention to me, and like listen when I have a question or answer it or help me. Or just like all these things and no one's doing it. And I was especially stressed by (pause) Harry yelling at me about this, um, because like I was calling for help and he...</p>

<p>[18:09]</p>

<p>...didn't actually have to answer, like there were other people in the office that could've, like normally he never answers computer questions, especially not to me. He's always like 'Karen should talk to someone else first.' (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like is he sort of second line tech support, is that the idea, or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't know actually, like a year and a half ago he told me I should not contact him directly anymore, I shouldn't call him directly or e-mail him directly, that I should always go through someone else. Like I should go through, like my direct support or the two people who are on a higher level. And I'm like, so I was like, 'OK' and I was like 'Even if I have like a software request?' And yes, I'm like 'Well that seems dumb but OK.'</p>

<p>[19:03]</p>

<p>So I don't know why he did that. Like because it's not like I was asking or like contacting him a lot. And I have to (inaudible) things, so. It seemed dumb to like ask someone else to ask him, I could just do that, but he wanted me to do this. So it was (voices overlap)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like when you're talking to somebody, two people are talking to somebody who's on the phone, like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah and just like sort of... and then like I have to ask permission for so many things that (sigh, inaudible) and it also is really embarrassing when I have to tell somebody like, 'I'm not supposed to e-mail Harry, can you e-mail him please.' Stinks. Um...</p>

<p>[20:00]</p>

<p>...so yeah, it's just like, I don't know, like, it was also like just everything like bad about (sigh) you know, it was kind of like the worst aspects of being like a woman in IT is like some guy telling me that I'm just wrong. Like they're not there, but they just know I'm wrong. Um, he also has been nagging me incessantly about documentation for the media suite tables. Um, and one day like he e-mailed me really angrily (pause) wanting to know why I hadn't returned his e-mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The one you mentioned?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, mmm. So he scheduled the training that I'm supposed to complete, or I'm supposed to like tell everyone in IT how to use the room.</p>

<p>[21:00]</p>

<p>And now I really don't want to because he's probably gonna do what he always does, which is talk really rapid-fire at the like, at me, and I'm worried A if anything goes wrong, which something will go wrong, he'll just start yelling at me again, and then I'll like have to leave the room. And um, like I don't really (pause, sigh) it just feels really awful that, 'cause I feel like I'm being forced into this position where I'm gonna mess up, he's gonna yell at me, and then I'm gonna start crying, which is you know, like death in the work place. Especially death among like all the guys. And it's gonna you know, like, I don't know, not look professional impediment exactly but, it's gonna undercut like any vague amount of respect anyone has (inaudible).</p>

<p>[22:16]</p>

<p>And I just don't wanna do it, I don't, can't even get out of it. (pause) And I decided to talk next week to um the guy I report to in IT and just be like 'Can you do this with me' because this is just gonna like, like no one can make Harry stop yelling at me. I'm really confident of that. Um, so, I don't know like I want someone else to be there just like do a little bit, something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, um, what is it like when he yells that way?</p>

<p>[23:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause, sigh) I just like I feel attacked, I'm I guess, when he talks that way, part of it is that I, like he doesn't, he already sort of thinks he knows the answer like he's not actually asking me a question, or whatever, even if he phrases the question in the form of a question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel like he's beating up on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah like and (sigh) I don't know like I feel like, very acutely like right, I'm not in this apartment, which you've said many times before. Um, like you don't respect me, you don't think that I'm, you obviously don't think I'm very good at my job, and (pause) like I feel like, it just feels like scary, 'cause I feel like I don't know 'Is he gonna keep on going, is he gonna stop?'</p>

<p>[24:08]</p>

<p>'Cause sometimes he'll like do this and he'll stop himself, or something will distract him, or he'll actually pause for a minute so that I can say something. But I do think he did, like I try to reconcile several times and he just kept on going, and like yelling over me. Um (pause) and it makes me feel like really helpless, in ways that (sigh) I don't know, like I usually don't feel like (pause) I'm mad at Karl, I'm not scared of him. Um and he doesn't make me feel like I'm at the bottom of the totem pole.</p>

<p>[25:02]</p>

<p>Even though I kind of am. But with Harry it's very much like (inaudible) you're not even part of the department, so, like it just kinda like, he's just gotta pile on like all these other reasons why he's mad at me or wants to yell at me. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean like why you suck, kind of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean whenever he goes off on one of his rolls, you're not part of the department always feels like he's saying, 'Because you suck and you're incompetent.'</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does he say? I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well we're just sometimes at our staff meetings, which are usually at the beginning of the week and are horrible. I mean they're not that bad, he just talks the whole time. Um so then he'll be like 'OK well, you know so everyone be sure to take part like you know, sign up for these trainings you can do.'</p>

<p>[26:02]</p>

<p>Christy and I'll be like 'Oh can we do that?' He's like 'No you're not part of the department.' We're like but 'Why, like, we're sitting here in this meeting, you're saying everyone should do this, but we can't.' and so usually it's a map (ph), usually...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like pointedly exclusive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, 'cause usually he keeps offering something, like awesome or interesting, and he won't say except you two unless we ask. So like if we try to do the training or we try to get the whatever, then he would say no. So Christy and I learned, one of us will just be like, 'Is it us?' 'No' 'OK.' And then sometimes, like he'll be, he'll describe like how to set up something, how to set up a computer or set up some software, and inevitably like half the time, it's something Christy and I don't have permission to do. So like security permission, so he'll be like 'Eh do this this and this. Oh Karen, you're gonna have to ask someone else to type in the password for you.'</p>

<p>[27:06]</p>

<p>Because you can't do that. Um (pause) and I just like, it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really demeaning, exclusive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah like, I think it's really demeaning that you know, I've worked at that department for like three or four years and they still won't let me do all these things. And Christy's actually known our security guy for like a decade. And he's still like 'Nope, you just can't.' And (pause) like we've never really gotten a reason why. And he doesn't wanna give us permission.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the gender split here? I mean it's you and Christy, are there any women in IT?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Sort of. There is one, currently there is one other woman in the department, who is at a fairly senior level.</p>

<p>[28:04]</p>

<p>And –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you mentioned it to her before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah there was another woman who was like, there was Jenny, who was like at a kinda senior level, and then there was another woman, another Jenny, who was very senior who left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh OK, maybe that's why she left.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah she left. Now there's only one woman in the department. And (pause) she's not very supportive either. Um (pause) like she has a habit of assigning me work or scheduling work and not really telling me until it's happening. Um she hates to explain things, and if I say like 'I can't do this because I don't have secure—like I don't have permissions to.' She'll just be like 'No you must have, no you do, just try it.' I'm like, it's really irritating to go up and do that and waste like 15 minutes before I can...</p>

<p>[29:08]</p>

<p>...so. Yeah I mean in the meetings it's very much like, other people that Harry is, like say you should do this work or you should do this thing, it's a bunch of guys and me and Christy. And Christy and I are, we're not part of the department, we're just sort of (pause) like present and given work but not given like any respect or things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like this is like a new second-place low.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah I just was so (sigh) like in general, like, I don't like crying in public, I really hate crying at work. And I feel like (pause, sigh)...</p>

<p>[30:07]</p>

<p>...You know like, if you're having personal problems, you need to like you just gotta start crying like, you just go to the bathroom and like do that or like you know like whatever. But I was just so like frustrated and mad and upset at work and that is new to be like acting like that upset. And also feeling like totally helpless about it. Um 'cause it's not like I was like 'Oh fuck you, I'm gonna go talk to this other person or I'm gonna go do this or that, I don't feel like I can do anything. And I also am like well I think if I went to HR, they would say 'Whatever, we're in the middle of this transition.' Um like I really don't think they care.</p>

<p>[31:09]</p>

<p>And so like I'm stuck. Um (pause) yeah it just feels like (sigh) I don't know, it just feels so unfair and I really feel like, I mean I don't feel bullied but I feel, yelled at. Like I feel like a kid at the principal's office getting yelled at. And I'm an adult. And (sigh) I don't know like I just feel like that shouldn't happen in the workplace, like you shouldn't be made to feel so terrible about yourself. And it's happening and I feel stuck with it.</p>

<p>[32:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I don't dare (pause) and try to (inaudible) kind of hard for me to try and get a sense of (pause) but I wonder how they can (CLIENT blows nose) make you feel so bullied at all. You know? Like, (CLIENT blows nose) they describe it (inaudible) douchebag, but it's like I wonder, I mean clearly there's some sort of authority he has or hierarchy in the department, and there's something about the way he's treating, it's a lot of the way he's treating you. But I guess I wonder like (pause) I'm not trying to say it's not awful, but I guess the thing I don't understand is (pause)</p>

<p>[33:08]</p>

<p>...I don't know, there's something (inaudible) compassion to you in a way that I'm like, how is he able to do this to you, you know? Like –</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just, I think (sigh) and part of it is just sort of, I feel like everything horrible is just happening, so. I wasn't feeling very good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) I think one way he made me feel that way is just, he was making it like my personal fault. Like, the way that he would say like you know 'It is working, I tested it, Dave tested it,' things like 'I don't know what you're doing but it is working and obviously we need to show you how to use this.' And he was making it very much like (pause) it was working perfectly but I'm too stupid to know how to use the like projection system.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, except that (pause)</p>

<p>[34:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why did I agree with him?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know good and well that that's not at all what's going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not trying to give him how he's acting at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's, I think it's that I feel like, so people have told me that my job is safe because of the IT part and so I feel like I'm doing poorly at IT, I feel like 'OK this means that I am gonna lose my job.' And so like allegedly the way the transition team is doing this, is they're gonna look at every single job (pause) and assess each job like whether or not it's necessary, and that's how they're gonna, or at the persona and (inaudible) they're job, and that's how they're gonna do layoffs.</p>

<p>[35:10]</p>

<p>I feel, makes me feel like if someone were to say, 'Harry what do you think? Like, is Karen doing her job well? Like is her job even necessary?' He would say no. Um (pause) I mean (inaudible) I feel like any security or safety I have in like doing IT cheaply does not, they're not paying me with the IT budget, is gonna go away. Like whatever is the thing that people say is gonna like 'Oh you're gonna keep your job' yeah. And I don't fully be- I am a person that recommends I will keep my job because of the IT aspect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [That's what I keep] (ph) telling you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Most of the time] (ph) the Cambridge transition team is very contemptuous out of all BAT, the Cambridge system.</p>

<p>[36:07]</p>

<p>Yeah they like, they'll just complain about it publicly in like meetings. Like during open conversations they'll be like 'Oh yeah this isn't working 'cause you know, the (inaudible) is just so terrible here' or whatever. It always shocks people, like really? Insulting your IT department is never a good idea. 'Cause they control the computers. Probably, more of an even worse idea to do it in a public setting. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But (inaudible) little bit, I get your point about how he may well have say over your job and job security.</p>

<p>[37:00]</p>

<p>But that's a very different thing, and that's scary as hell, it's not that I don't get that, I think I do. But that's, that's sort of a different thing, isn't it? Than like how he can get you to feel so small and marginal and lousy at what you do, do you know what I mean? Like if you were saying 'Ugh he's being such a douchebag that's really annoying, but oh I'm also kind of nervous 'cause like I know he is gonna have some say over my job.' Like then I would sort of get how that went together. But it's more like you're really upset because of how badly he's treating you, and he has a lot of power to really make you feel small and crummy and like a kid and incompetent, none of which you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean part of it is that I really didn't know what that problem was.</p>

<p>[38:00]</p>

<p>And I couldn't fix it. So it was like I knew what I was doing, I was sort of asking like, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel like this is all on the topic of a call for help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah like I asked him for help and he's just yelling at me. I think part of it's like, a lot of times I have to call or say things like 'I don't know how to do this, I need you to do it.' Whatever, whatever. Like I really (voices overlap) don't understand what I'm supposed to do with this. And I want help with it so I can do it and I don't know it's like, I think part of the reason I feel so small is like, I'm asking for help and he's just (pause) saying I can't get it, like I don't get help. And (sigh) I don't know, like, I guess I didn't feel, I wasn't feeling confident in myself...</p>

<p>[39:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was just remembering like how much you love to ask for help in general and reach out to people. And I know this is in the context of your job so it's sort of like a little bit different, but–</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I was, no I hate asking for help at work. Um—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember you like, after your surgery like not wanting to call friends and ask them for help, (inaudible) alone, having to call Harry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's like I'm not good with the A/V systems, um it's not something I really care about, and for whatever reason they have me involved in installing or like being trained on it when they put all this stuff in, so which makes me feel like why like, excluded 'cause like why didn't you tell me how to use this tube (ph) thing.</p>

<p>[40:10]</p>

<p>And then like I'm doing, do do doo (ph), and like that's kind of like my worst nightmare of what would happen if I ask someone for help. Is they'd be like really angry, and dismiss everything I'm experiencing and doing and asking them for, and I wouldn't get any help. Or they'd be like, 'Well you should talk to this other person.' (pause) And also like, I don't like after all of that, I still don't feel like I actually know how to fix it. Um so I feel like it's, if there's a problem again it's gonna happen the same way again, like I'm gonna call say I need help and Harry is gonna yell at me, and then I won't get any help.</p>

<p>[41:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We gotta stop for now, um. I'm not sure (inaudible, other noises)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, throwing up felt worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah so it's not getting worse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the top worst being every time I threw up. I just I really, I don't think I've been stressed enough to throw up before, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

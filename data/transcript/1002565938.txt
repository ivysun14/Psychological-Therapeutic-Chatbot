<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.  How are you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So what's new?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I've been working a lot.  I worked—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You work 2 days a week or you increased?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was and then I just increase it to 3 days a week and this last week I worked 5 days in a row.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is all right for normal people, but for me that's a big deal.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How did you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty good.  Real tired and I couldn't, didn't sleep well at night, each night.  So I think anytime I have something going on the next day, I have trouble sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were too wired during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, my thought's, it won't stop.  So it's even if I have an appointment usually or if I have to work just a regular day or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe this [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, we're waiting for that settlement for my husband's injury—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And now they keep pushing it back and actually this morning they sent him to another doctor.  He's seen like 8 doctors now and this was insurance sending him.  So it doesn't look like, um, basically I picked up another [INAUDIBLE] I guess for Christmas money—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because we don't really have any.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has, has his job reduced or is it still—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They've been a little slow lately.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  The economy—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is really tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so but he's not working as much.  He, they work a lot more in the summer.  There's more places, uh, available, schools and that sort of thing, but so he had to take the day off today, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah, so I didn't really want to do 3 days.  Two days was what I had decided on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For the school year, but it's just going to be through the holidays.  So that'll be okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it busier now there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it is, but once, once January comes, it'll be slow again and they won't really need me for 3 days.  So I'll go back to 2 days then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the winter, that'll be good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, then I won't have to drive out there and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As much and I've been working a day a weekend too.  So I've actually been doing 4 days a week—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just every week.  So it's okay so far.  My anxieties are better.  I think with the Pristiq with taking it at night, that helps a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so or I feel like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you look, you look great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you didn't, no, last time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You looked more—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was razzled, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, but, uh, but you feel the Pristiq is different than some, than the SSRI's you've been taking before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.  I do.  I have noticed a little breaking out.  They, they make my skin—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I noticed a little bit, but not as bad as it was before and maybe that's because I'm on that, uh, your birth control also.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I think that helps it 'cause that helps your skin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But how does this feel different than—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some, some of the other antidepressants that you had?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm trying to think what the last one I was on.  Was it Prozac?  The antidepressant?  That one I did not do well at all with it.  I think it made it worse for me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If it's possible, but I was taking it with the Lithium and it just, um, I do notice, um, my dreams are strange and I had trouble—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then or now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now also.  They were stranger then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Much stranger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You say it made it worse, well, what do you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Prozac and the, I, I was having a really difficult time.  I think my anxiety's gotten worse—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I know my depression did too I think.  The Prozac, it just made me feel weird and I was having these really bizarre dreams like very bizarre, not able to tell if they were real or not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	During the daytime if that had actually happened when it was things that couldn't have possibly have happened unless it was like supernatural kinds of things that just don't happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, it was that bizarre, but I couldn't tell the difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  But you're not experiencing anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm having some dreams that are weird, but like the other day I thought I had sworn at one of my kids and I asked my husband if I had done that and he said no.  And I said well, I must have dreamt that.  I was worried that I had really talked harshly to them and, and it was the dream I guess.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Little things like that I notice with the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you used, you used to worry—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't know if antidepressants do that or not, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes if it's the wrong neurotransmitter that we boost, you know, the thing about Pristiq is that Pro, Prozac is primarily a serotonin drug—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whereas Pristiq works on serotonin as well as nor epinephrine as well as [INAUDIBLE].  It's more of a broad spectrum—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Antidepressant.  So sometimes if you're boosting the wrong neurotransmitter, it can make it worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With this I feel more evened out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More even.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Prozac I just, I felt—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's a hard one—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] figure out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With Lexapro and some of the others do and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they just didn't work or they would work for a short while and I would actually have this crash—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Big decline afterwards where I would really just sink low.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More depressed; couldn't function.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And now you're getting up?  You're doing things now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't feel overwhelmed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it's not perfect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you don't feel overwhelmed with—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm overwhelmed.  At night when I go to bed I'm overwhelmed—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With all the things, my house is just full of clutter and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have all the kids.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and a lot of the mess though is mine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, just piles of laundry and piles of picture frames and things I have to do and I'm having trouble with that still, but it's been 5 years I've been having trouble with that, not able to clear things away and make it feel like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, what would help to make that easier for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I think it's just so far gone now after 5 years I just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what if you rally the whole family and work as a unit—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, my husband has them folding clothes now.  It's, it's, I, I think I'm kind of a perfectionist where I really like to do, have the things done a certain way and so for me to clean involves, you know, making a big mess first and really going through things and taking everything down and cleaning that way and I used to do that and, but now I've gone the other extreme where it's just too hard.  I can't get it all done so I don't do it at all.  I won't even pick up usually and once in a while—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe you're afraid to start.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because it'll turn into this huge thing I can't finish and, and it won't be done the way I want and then it gets wrecked the next day or that night or whatever, but I don't know what would help.  I, I have too many things that's for sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean do you feel like the burden, your husband's pretty good about that though.  He's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He is.  He's a really patient and understanding guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, but he helps too even with his injury.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's been—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Helpful.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He makes dinner every night—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he helps with the laundry and gets the kids clean and doing all his stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has, has he changed since the injury?  His personality?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, he's done a lot better and I'm surprised, you know, because we went to the doctor today and they were looking at his arms and measuring his biceps and his good arm, he has 10 cm bicep; his bad arm he's a 7 cm bicep.  So there's a big—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thirty% drop.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Visual difference and he can't use it the way he did and I think if it was me, I'd really be—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Frustrated, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, all the time.  But he does really well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How is he able to work?  I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's, he has to use his left hand a lot.  He's been having trouble.  He's been almost dropping things and he—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually was making dinner last night and dropped the crock pot—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All over because he, his, 'cause his arm gave out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was too weak to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it gets weak when he's trying to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you see that happen?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but I know it frustrates him, but he—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did he do or you don't know what he—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  Usually he gets mad and I'm surprised the crock pot wasn't broken and, you know, that he didn't [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But he, um, made the dinner and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you were working or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I was probably folding clothes or something in the bedroom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm always in the bedroom trying to get that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you used to be in the bedroom to escape.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that's not, not the same with—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kind of still 'cause the house gets cra, my husband's a different personality than I am, I've told you that, and then he gets the kids—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you're so calm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean at least on the surface—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I'm quiet—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not inside, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and for the most part I mean once in a while it's okay, but he gets them going.  I usually am in the bedroom, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To avoid the chaos.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Right.  And always trying to work on cleaning that room and getting that stuff, but it never gets done.  I haven't been able to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that and I've had paintings I need to do.  People, someone asked me to paint a frame, wants to pay me for it, and I haven't been able to get it done and I've had it for months and it shouldn't take but a week to do it.  So I'm having a lot of trouble with that and every night I think what a loser I am for not doing it and I feel bad that I'm doing that to that person, that they've asked me to do it and I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What prevents you from doing it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what it is.  Usually it's getting started.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just, just—hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But then I got started and I'm still—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it a fear of doing it and not having it come out perfectly or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I don't know what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like a performance anxiety or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Possibly.  I'm not sure what's keeping me from it this time.  Normally, normally I have to work on it until I get it done and then everything else has to wait, the house, whatever.  I don't, but I don't know and a friend of mine asked me to do a frame 2 years ago for her daughter and I haven't done it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't, and then, and I think about it all the time and feel, it gets worse and worse as the time goes by—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where I'm afraid to even talk to them now, you know what I mean?  It's like I just, I feel so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It wouldn't be such an obstacle if—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's ridiculous.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know why I can't just get it done and, and give it to her and, and I'd get paid for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I need the money.  Why wouldn't I just do that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It must have something to do with the fear of disapproval.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't know, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's more disapproval now me not getting it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To them in a timely fashion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's even worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because the lady, the one lady loves, they both do.  They've had me do frames before.  They loved them and I just haven't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of trouble and I'm not sure why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm feeling, well, I, I guess 'cause I'm trying to do so many other, I don't know.  I'm not a multi tasker—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it like this is one more thing that you have no place to add in a sense?  That you feel that you're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, maybe.  I just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can't do another thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like the clothes—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sort of, yeah, like with the housework maybe I'm just not even—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're doing so much more by increasing your workload.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've doubled it or actually tripled it because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that I can do, but when I'm at home, it seems I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's, why could you do it there, but not at—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel different in the different environment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean do you feel the expectations are much greater in the home environment than the work environment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, my husband being so understanding and patient lets me get away with a lot and he's asked me before, you know, should I be demanding?  Should I tell you I need this or this done?  And that's, I don't respond well to that either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, they don't do that at work though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They kind of give you free reigns of how you handle it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it seems like you're less overwhelmed in the work setting than you are [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  My anxieties bother me a little more just 'cause there's more things—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At work or at—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Out of my control.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but at home I'm just feeling, I feel bad about myself.  When I go to work—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you feel better at work?  A better—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, 'cause I'm dressed up, um, which I, I still don't like how I look very much, but, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At least I'm just [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would it help if you could—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Acting, you know, where I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're more performing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A professional and I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cheerful which I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	By, by performing or functioning in the role—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Somehow you're convinced that you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Could you do that at home?  Could you, could you dress up?  Could you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would think I could be an artist at home or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What if you do that and try to change your mindset and think—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean like dress up as an artist—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see if that makes you more functional in the home setting.  I don't, is there some way to try that and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, if I could get up and shower right away—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You, you, you don't do that?  You just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I'm home, I just, I just, things fall.  I get going in the afternoon.  I, I do better in the afternoon, but then by the time bedtime comes, I'm not ready to stop.  I'm just getting going and but that doesn't work.  I mean I can't stay up all night.  So then I don't sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you don't even get out of bed after the kids go to school or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, your daughter's still at home, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, they're all at school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're all in school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Monday, today, yesterday I went back to bed because I worked those 5 days and I told myself I could.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that was okay, but I'm just, I don't know.  I'm, I've, I've been bothered about the house and my bedroom for years, but the fact that I'm not doing these frames that other people are expecting really upsets me and makes me feel really bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bad about you, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it builds on itself.  I mean the more you postpone it, the worse—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly and it gets harder and harder to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Even do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is silly and like self defeating—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it is self defeating, but you're right, the longer you put it off the harder it is to get going—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is right and there's no way to just do it.  I mean is there a way to like in the morning if you just to get up, I don't know.  Could you go for a walk?  Could you do something to change the routine?  Change the pattern?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think just getting a shower would be a huge deal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what if you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know why I don't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What if you tried to set a certain time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nine o'clock, 10:00 and say, you know, you're going to make sure you're in the shower by that time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see if that changes the pattern?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have such a hard time putting rules on myself or schedule on myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, but you do that at work, but no, it's not you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's somebody else that's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Someone else doing it and I feel bad and sometimes I'm late to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Most times I'm not.  When I'm there by myself at home I get there on time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When my husband's home or my husband and kids, it's a lot harder for me because I have those distractions and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not just getting ready the whole time like I should be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it frustrates me because I feel like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See if takes 3 weeks to form a habit.  If, if there's some way to push or to, to force for the first 3 weeks, you know, maybe get up and take the shower in the morning—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and, and just see if it becomes easier, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or have that routine.  Do the shower and then start working—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On, on the frames.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's going to be hard, but like you say, I think if you could do that for 3 weeks, you'll, you'll see a change in the pattern—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it'll become easier, but the first 3 weeks think of it as a, almost like as, as work, as, as a struggle to do—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you could try that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the kids are, the little girl's in, in kindergarten?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that helps 'cause what is that morning kindergarten?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All day.  I have plenty of time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm working more so I don't feel like I have any time at home—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Even though I do have Monday and Tuesday.  Um, some Tuesdays,  if I have anything going on, on a day, it seems like I can't do anything else that day [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, right, no, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't know why that is, but even if it's just an hour appointment in the middle of the day—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because of the preparation.  The emotional getting ready—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think, yeah.  It's just, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm worthless for that day pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So there's days, some Tuesdays I go into her classroom and help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, which that's a big—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that a lot of work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a big thing for me.  Well, it's supposed to be 45 minutes in all which ends up being an hour and a half or 2 hours because I feel, usually they have me help with an art project—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You take 1 or 2 kids at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that fits your—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's nice, but I feel bad stopping at half the kids and not, you know, because they all want to do their project and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I usually stay until everyone's done, but I mean that should be, that shouldn't be a big deal, but it is for some reason.  By the time I get home and I've got very—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have more time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Little time until the kids—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Get home, yeah.  So and anytime I don't sleep well, I don't know if it's psychological or, or an actual physical thing, but I don't do well and I know I haven't slept—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're tired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I'm tired and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, tired, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which means I need to catch up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Could be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Somewhere and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about for the holidays?  Are you going to be home?  You going to go away?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, we stay home, but we have a lot of, this week I'm not going to work as much.  Um, I'm going to work tomorrow and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Over Thanksgiving you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  And them I'm going to work Saturday and Sunday because it'll be busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	After, that's the biggest time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A week from—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So I'm a little anxious about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's good that they're, they're busy though in this economy—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's surprising.  We had our open house last weekend and did really well.  Did better—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Than last year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How did she explain that or she doesn't know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She doesn't know.  She just, and she, it worries her because she's seen other people—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Complaint.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right and gone to the gift shows and people aren't buying and there's not many people there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she's thinking anytime now, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are these regulars or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think she fills a need that other places can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are these regulars that come in or is it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of them.  A lot of new people too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm, from the college or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some college, some travel from, one lady came in from [DEIDENTIFIED] or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, or [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So that's nice.  I mean she, she's very good at what she does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She must, she advertises and she—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not a whole lot, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, you know, they do the 2 sales a year, send a flier, and she has a website which I think is helping a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, yeah, she's doing well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Luckily it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But none of the young girls—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That came in, you remember the students that gave you the hard time, are they still coming?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we do get some in.  We used to get some high school kids in and, and that still it's hard for me because I'm fearful of what they'll do.  I really don't think they [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Care enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, or, or, or understand what we're telling, I mean I, I'm really afraid of them for some reason.  It makes me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Feel very inadequate [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] you don't like to be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, your kids aren't really like that.  They [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, they're very good and they listen to me and they, they do what's right so far and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I worry that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You must be doing something right then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I guess, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's their natures too maybe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, were you like that as a kid or no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was very, you know, I never stole anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I did do some things I shouldn't have and, and I did, I probably would have maybe caused some trouble somewhere and not really cared about other, other people or whatever, but I don't think I would have had the sense of mortality either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.  Not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Question, how did, how did your past and being that way affect how you feel now in terms of the, uh, performance anxieties and the, you know, I guess, and we talked about that how you felt you had done wrong things—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how that makes you fearful now that you can do the wrong thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's almost like you're on guard a lot to avoid the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I 'cause when I confronted, I often will probably cry or say things—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just off my head that probably should, I don't what [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, even the fear of, you know, like you said about the kids—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That it was a dream that you would get angry with them and yell at them, it's like, there's such a fear that if you let any intense emotion out—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something bad would happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think if I could stay in control and tell them—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If they see me not in control or if I'm getting upset or red or voice shaking, that I will be a joke and they will—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Be a what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A joke.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they'll [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that they'll take that opportunity to then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hurt you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah or go further with whatever they're doing or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  But they, they never do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Say something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean they're usually good kids.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  I don't know why—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You fear that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And my boss tells me, you know, don't, you know, she'll take care of it if she's there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if she's not, then I'd be a little—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're never there alone or you're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, we're usually, there's usually at least 1 other person—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if we're upstairs, that's where the clothing is.  That's usually where the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, 1 person would be downstairs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Moving around, right.  So you're kind of up there by yourself—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm a mother of 4.  I mean I, I should be able to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but those kids that come in are not as respectful as your kids.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean they'll mouth back to you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right and that's what I'm worried of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And what happens if they do that is it starts stimulating anger in you and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're very afraid of getting angry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause that is my—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Makes you feel like you're bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] gut reaction is to get angry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Angry, but then you feel you're a bad person if you let the anger in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, and I have to be—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Professional there and you have to be careful what you do say 'cause I mean you could get sued for or their parents come in or, you know what I mean?  It's just a, it's a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's kind of a sticky situation.  I don't know, I don't know how best to handle it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think the more comfortable you can become with intense emotion, the more wouldn't scare you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it scares you if you start feeling, you say what's going to happen?  It's going to explode out and it's going to take control of me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I don't think that'll happen, but for some reason that's your fear.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'll be left defenseless for some reason.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you just lose control and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have no way of containing all this emotion.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That goes along with things that happen in childhood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, usually if I get mad at my siblings, I mean and I start hitting them and that's what I would do.  I would want to hurt them and if they laughed at me while I was doing that, I'd really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Get real angry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Get really crazy, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how would you feel after the fact?  Embarrassed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just horrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ashamed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably—I mean I feel ashamed now for it all—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just talking, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I mean my sister and I had a fight once where I hit her with hangers.  We were, I was a senior maybe, maybe college, old enough to know better—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was beating her and she took off, she got in the van and started to drive away and I climbed on the front of the van and she was driving and I'm hanging off, just crazy where I could have got hurt—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just—yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I couldn't have hurt her and I feel so horrible—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Emb—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But like the intensity was so great, you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I couldn't control myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's the fear now that you can go back and revert back to that, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  So what you do though is you contain all your intense emotion and it becomes too much work basically.  You got to let it out a little bit—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I don't know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're afraid to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good or bad, I don't know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you're afraid of any situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Even when it's good I cry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm embarrassed.  So [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Tears are right on the surface because the feelings are trying to break through all the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's why, yeah, that's why you're so tired in the past.  You know, it's like you have so much energy trying to control the intensity.  If there was some way to relax and let's move it out, you wouldn't be as tired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, 'cause some people suggesting drinking, that I need to drink more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, drinking—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].  That's the last thing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would make it get worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I need to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because it'll lower your guard—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then things will—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right and things have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, that's not, yeah, that's not a suggestion.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I tell them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I guess a solution would be to be around people that you trust and take risks in terms of sharing your intense emotions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel very comfortable with my husband and I tell him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You share, you share—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your intensity with him.  Does that help?  Do you feel better and more [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do.  I mean I think him and I really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Understand each other and I, I trust him with my feelings and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My secrets and my past and he goes with me too, but there's not many other people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No family members?  What about girlfriends?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, my sisters I do and, um, and they understand, but I think at the same time, not, not as well as my husband.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do feel I have to be careful.  Sometimes I'll talk to his mom or his dad and then something gets said and I wish I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hadn't said anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Had not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] you said the wrong thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Opened up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I should have kept it to myself.  Once in a while I feel that with my husband too, but not very often.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The fear of saying the wrong thing and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Being embarrassed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause I do [INAUDIBLE] foot in the mouth.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, but if, if you have feelings, it's okay to share them.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We are what we feel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

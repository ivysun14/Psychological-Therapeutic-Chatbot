<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How you doin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I'm struggling with staying steady.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I was for a long time and now I feel like I've jumped backwards where I'm just crying, don't even know why I'm crying. I'm just sad, that blue feeling.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, yknow, just, just crying and like why are you crying, I don't have a clue.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Is it just the lows or are you having lows and the highs right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, not, not very high.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not high just lows.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's just kinda roller coaster.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Um and there's nothing that's changed that you can put your finger on around you that's been different?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The only thing and I don't, I don't think it upset me, I mean, you know, didn't upset me is, um, let's see, well my college roommate, [NAME OTHER], um, she's only [AGE] and she had an aneurysm and died.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh no.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When did that happen?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, that was last Friday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She was in perfect health.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In fact she was just going back to study holistic health and just - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum. Had you been in touch with her still?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, Christmas.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Things like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How did you find out she died?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, her friend where she lives, used to be [NAME OTHER]'s friend in Dallas and that friend notified [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] notified me and I went online and read the newspaper in [DEIDENTIFIED].  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. So you weren't real close to her, but you stayed in touch over the years? Okay. And when did you find out about this the day she died?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Friday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This, you found out about it Friday, okay. So do you feel like you've been more blue or sad since then?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't, I just, I just feel like I'm back on this kinda blue, depressed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME] was that even before you learned about [NAME OTHER]'s death or just after?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, yknow, the week before last week I was agitated and then last week I felt steady and this week I felt like I sunk back into that blue, being blue.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't know why.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, yeah, it sounds like it might not be specifically related to [NAME OTHER]'s death.  Any other major stressors?  How's your mom doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, had to go the dentist, she has to have new dentures.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, you know, same old, same old same old.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and [NAME OTHER]'s here or traveling?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's here right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Uh, hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my boyfriend from high school, [NAME OTHER], that I went with and he married my best girlfriend, [NAME OTHER], um, he has pancreatic cancer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, dear.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When did you find out about that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That was this weekend from [NAME OTHER], I think it was this past weekend.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and how did you find out?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, [NAME OTHER], my high school friend, uh, her mother still lives in [DEIDENTIFIED]and goes to the same church and they had a prayer chain thing, put him on it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Wow so two close friends this week had pretty serious, well one died and one has pretty severe health problems. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, they said, I guess, once you get pancreatic, it's all over.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not a good one yeah cause usually by the time they find it, it's pretty advanced.  So have you been in touch with [NAME OTHER] still over the years?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I was in touch with [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] for a long time when they had their two little girls with cheerleading stuff and then I just kinda lost contact, but [NAME OTHER]'s, [NAME OTHER]'s dad was, uh, mortuary person and his son took over his business and that's who we, last year when we set up mom's funeral.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Got back in touch with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so you're still in touch with the family.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Those are a couple pretty major things.  Uh, but again I don't know if that's the only, only contributing factors though. I get a sense that maybe there's more?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, I, I feel sad -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have your sleep patterns changed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Still struggling with sleeping. I just seem like I wake up, you know, just keep waking up and waking up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, and how's your energy level during the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, this week I was just kind of blah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, just - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about your appetite?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Unfortunately, never been a problem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No problem there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wished that could be a problem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some people have that curse where they ever loose their appetite.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, what about your focus or concentration, is it difficult, are you doing okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I think I'm doing fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. Memory okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know for some reason and I don't know about this week I started thinking about [NAME OTHER] and I thought, you know why can't I remember the year he died. I mean, I, I am the master of writing every single thing down and keeping records and I've written, I mean I could go clear back to Dallas when all the patients would die, I wrote it down. For some reason I went through old address books, I went through old stuff and I couldn't find when he died and it started just, and I thought why didn't I write something this important down about somebody I really cared about where I have all my patients from Dallas.  Every pet and - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it really bothered you that you couldn't find that date?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It bothered me that I couldn't remember, was it two years. four years.  I had no sense of remembering and I thought okay, I wonder if I could find his wife and I couldn't remember what her name was and I finally found her name scribbled in an old address book, but it was just a first name, so got on the computer and started doing people search and just spent four hours tracking and tracking and tracking, which was really hard, uh, because you have nothing to go on, and, but I eventually found her, ironically because, and then I decided I was just gonna call her and I said, you know, is this [NAME OTHER]?  And she said, who is this? And I said this is [PATIENT NAME].  I said is this the [NAME OTHER] that married [NAME OTHER] and she said oh my God how'd you find me?  She said how did you get this phone number and how did you find me and I said well, actually I did it on the computer. I'm so sorry if you don't want to talk that's fine, she said no it's just that I've been hiding since [NAME OTHER] died because I had to leave the hospital with three hundred thousand dollars in medical bills and everything she said she walked away from.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER]'s medical bills or hers, oh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she said I changed with my name and went to my maiden name, I've remarried, we have an unlisted phone number, she said how, how did you find us?  I said, yknow, it was really hard, but I kept kind of, I said there's one part that'll say possible relatives and some names, so I tracked them and I said eventually I found out the right spelling of your name now, and I said but I was amazed cause then I did it to myself and I couldn't believe how much information is on there about me and the fact that they had possible relatives, which is also information [PATIENT NAME] instead of, I mean I use [PATIENT NAME] legally for everything so where did they find this information of, yknow, is it so, so that's how I found you.  She said oh, she was just, she could not believe it cause she lives, from Florida she's in a small town in North Carolina.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But anyway I said well the reason I'm calling, it sounds so stupid, I said I cannot remember when [NAME OTHER] died and I said and she said, just a minute, she came back she said I still have his ashes and I don't know why and she told me it's been twelve years. I said oh my gosh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Twelve years.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But what, can't be.  I mean twelve? So anyway then I asked about [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER]'s boy cause I paid support and everything and I love [NAME OTHER] and I said do you know where [NAME OTHER] is, did he start drinking because six of [NAME OTHER]'s siblings were all alcoholics and his dad and she said no he has three daughters and he's really got a nice business and a happy, happy man and uh, so anyway, sat and talked to her for a good hour.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we went back over [NAME OTHER] and she told me yknow she basically went through the same stuff I did and she said I just kind of forgot him and moved on and she said I can't even tell, I said, I said well, oh I went on tracking [NAME OTHER]'s death certificate. They had two different birth dates and I said do you know when his birthday was for sure?  I said I have it in my book as the [DATE], but it's listed, it's different things on people search and she said I don't even remember.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, so anyway I don't know why I became so, I mean I had so much work to do and before I knew it I'd spent four hours on the computer tracking this woman down just to find out when [NAME OTHER] died.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Sounds like something that fixed in your mind and you couldn't shut it off.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just wanted to know and I just couldn't believe I had not written it down when I have records of everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm the record keeper.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What date was this [PATIENT NAME] that you tracked, tracked down this woman?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it was Monday morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, because I didn't have anything to do and strangely enough [NAME OTHER] had this what they call those pick up cars, Caminos?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He had one of those, a brown, beige, one of those, I mean you never see those anywhere, never. I was going down the street, I stopped at a stop light and here came this exact car that [NAME OTHER] had.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This before or after you talked to her?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was after.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I just could not believe it, it's like [NAME OTHER], did you send me a sign that you, I don't know why I miss [NAME OTHER] so much.  She didn't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How long was she with him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She was married to him she said well four years, uh, she was gonna divorce him and then he got ill and she decided to stay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. How long were you with [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, eleven.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a long time.  Long time. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's [NAME OTHER], my Springer Spaniel, which was really [NAME OTHER]'s, I mean [NAME OTHER] loved that dog and the dog loved him so much and I would have let him have [NAME OTHER], but he just, yknow he's living in an apartment, then he moved to Florida so and she said he loved [NAME OTHER] so much that a year before he died he got a Springer Spaniel.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, why didn't it sink in?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you remember when he died?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was, uh, let's see, it was August twelve years ago, August something, I can't remember the actual.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe it was the time of the year or something when he died. Is there anything about this time of year that brings back any specific memories with [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or could it be maybe you learned about [NAME OTHER] and the cancer, that was over the weekend, could that have maybe brought back memories of relationships maybe?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Between [NAME OTHER] dying and [NAME OTHER]'s cancer, maybe sometimes it causes us to think about past relationships.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I know with [NAME OTHER] I was trying, I thought, wait a minute now was [NAME OTHER] my roommate the first year we went to [DEIDENTIFIED] or the second time? And then I thought wait a minute, okay [NAME OTHER] was, and my life is so crazy, I mean, sometimes I moved three times in a year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I was sitting there and I thought I can't remember, you know, the sequence because the minute I got out of high school I took off for [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And until I moved to [DEIDENTIFIED], every year I moved.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I had so many different jobs and lived in so, I mean I would be in Illinois and Texas and Nebraska and I just moved, moved, moved. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you remember why you moved so much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think I had any direction in life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just went to, yknow, I set down a period of all the colleges I went to and I said oh my God, no wonder I never had anything because I had to move so much I just had one suitcase.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many colleges did you go to?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Five. Five colleges, oh my gosh and when I, that was another thing I became obsessed with and I sat down and started, got out old records and it was like, okay I'm gonna write my sequence of my life because I may not be able to remember it at all. I had to kinda really sit down and pull out old records and old resumes, okay I was here from here to this many months and seemed like May would come, I think I was still on school schedule. May would come and I'd move somewhere. Then September would come and I'd move somewhere else and so I ended up sitting there typing my entire life out with every job I had and every place I moved and every college I went and every credit I took, just so I wouldn't forget.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I realized, oh my gosh, [NAME OTHER] was my second roommate, she wasn't my first roommate, how come I couldn't remember that? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I felt like I was getting old. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, we do when we can't remember these things, but they do become hard to remember, too if they're further in the past. There's more in there to try to like hold on to.  [PATIENT NAME] I'm wondering if maybe the combination of things triggered all these thoughts and memories, which includes, uh, I mean, some things from your past coming back into the present with [NAME OTHER]'s death and [NAME OTHER]'s cancer and then thinking about [NAME OTHER] and trying to remember things and it sounds like you just kinda continued that you want to remember more and more put it down, put it down some place.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. And then [NAME OTHER] emailed me and said [NAME OTHER] had put [NAME OTHER] to sleep, the Chow dog that was, I took care of so much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had, I know the dog is so much better off. I always worried about, yknow, what was happening to [NAME OTHER], but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why's that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because [NAME OTHER] never took good care of him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I did and [NAME OTHER] said yeah [NAME OTHER] still goes from hospital to home, hospital to home, still the same old thing. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Things never change.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was that her only remaining dog?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's got one left.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I wasn't attached to [NAME OTHER] like I was, cause I had spent time, I mean [NAME OTHER] lived with me for a while and I always walked [NAME OTHER] and cared about that dog.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And when did you learn about this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That was Tuesday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum.  There have been quite a few things that happened this week especially about from the past, the losses, [NAME OTHER] being put down, [NAME OTHER] dying, [NAME OTHER] with cancer bringing back memories of [NAME OTHER]'s death and so could be it's one of the reasons you feel more down this week, maybe grieving, some sadness from losses.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know cause now I just I don't even know why I'm crying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what bothers me the most, I don't know why I'm crying, I'm just crying all the time and I don't know why.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, [PATIENT NAME], again I think it's important from my standpoint to try to understand at least is this depression or is this grief, because if it's grief we don't want to medicate it or it wouldn't help to medicate it, um, sometimes we need to cry, yknow, it's a way we relieve sadness so we don't have to carry it around with us. In fact, I don't know if I told you this but there was a study years ago at the [DEIDENTIFIED] where they actually analyzed tears and they found that tears contain different protein that there's tears of sadness versus tears of joy. There are actually different proteins that we release in our tears so sometimes we need to cry. It's a way of letting out sadness and even though sometimes we don't know what we're sad about, it still is a good thing to let it out. So, kinda confusing sometimes when we cry and we don't know why. Doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Whew, hum. Any other emails or messages this week about anyone else?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I think that covers everyone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, that's quite a bit in one week.  Think when you were younger and had losses, people died in your life or loss of important, would you cry then?  Was your father, was he okay if you cried or would he be upset if you cried?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't even remember him.  He just wasn't there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you remember seeing him cry ever?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I think he cried when grandma, his mom died.  I don't remember grandpa [NAME OTHER]. He cried when kitty, his kitty died.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then somebody shot a deer on his land.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He had a real soft spot in his heart for animals didn't he?  Really touched him.  So he wasn't afraid to cry it sounds like or wasn't embarrassed or didn't hide it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He was just so many different people.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, he, he, it's kinda how we was talking about [NAME OTHER].  When [NAME OTHER] wasn't drinking he was like the nicest, nicest guy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And when he was drinking he was the meanest, meanest person.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  In that way [NAME OTHER] and your dad were alike, weren't they? Hum.  Do you remember what month it was when your dad died?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum, okay, just wondering if we got that anniversary reactions.  It's called anniversary reactions because when something significant happens in our life on a particular day like [DATE] then the next year when [DATE] comes around we might have memories or feelings that relate back to the event or earlier like five years or ten years earlier and I was wondering with all the losses that you've experienced this week that it also could be related to the other losses in your past, not your dad's death at least or [NAME OTHER]'s.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Whenever somebody you loved has passed away, whenever it's their anniversary or their birthday or Christmas, I usually buy balloons and send balloons up. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now and with dad a long time ago I bought him a little stuffed tiger, on his birthday I put his picture out and the stuff tiger and maybe get a cake and I just celebrate.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's nice.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Their birthdays.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, okay.  You don't have any birthdays this month that you've been recently celebrating?  Okay, yeah, [PATIENT NAME], I'm guessing it's more related to what you've already told me about the losses, the, uh, illnesses I guess, the dog, [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] and then well three with [NAME OTHER]'s remembering it too and it sounds like a painful death, it sounds like that's enough to cause us to cry and feel sad.  This week do you know what it is that wakes you up at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wake up and I feel like I should get up because I'm awake, I mean it's not that oh it's just and okay I gotta get to sleep and I just keep waking up, I don't know why.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, hum.  And then is it difficult to go back to sleep or do you fall asleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Let's see about medication.  You haven't forgotten medicines recently that you're aware of?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or changes or any other medicines or anything?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The only change was Wellbutrin to the generic, but you said that was the same stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Usually that's not a problem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And when I upped that Seroquel?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I don't know, but this past week I'm also having headaches.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know if that's, I don't know I just had bouts of headaches my whole life and then you mentioned possible constipation with Seroquel.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Possible.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I've been really struggling with that. But how does that medicine affect that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just that it has a drying effect, drying the GI tract.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some people have dry mouth or because it causes more water to be absorbed in the colon it can cause some constipation.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you've been so you noticed more constipation and more headaches since the increase of Seroquel dose a couple weeks ago?  Okay, are those manageable or tolerable at this point or are they pretty uncomfortable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I kept thinking okay let me keep track of my fiber because I have to be really careful to get that 25 to 30 grams in because of the diverticulosis.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so okay hit breakfast really hard, you know, bran this, bran that and, you know, I had it up to 25 grams of fiber and drank my water and ice tea and then really constipated the next day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  [PATIENT NAME], you're taking four Seroquel now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, three.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just three, okay.  Okay and can you tell if it's leveled off your mood since you increased the dose?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Last week it did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This week I feel roller coaster again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you went to three, you never tried four is that right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was kinda scared to go up to four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's okay. Just to give you an idea, that's not a high dose by any stretch.  Four would be a hundred, there are people who take six to eight hundred mg a day.  Not that you need to, but just to give you a context, but if three is working okay we don't need to go higher either.  Um, uh, do you feel like at this point you can tolerate those side effects?  Are they pretty intolerable for right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, just like I don't like having that headache all day.  If I take a Tylenol it's still there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All day every day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah it just doesn't go away until nighttime and then it kind of, about the time I'm getting ready to go to bed it finally goes away and then morning it's there again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does it seem to be getting better over time or can you tell?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not worse or better, it's just the same, that kinda dull headache.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum.  And the constipation can you tell if it's getting better over time or not?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, is it getting worse or staying about the same?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's, it's been pretty bad, I feel sorta back up taking the Mylan, or - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Metamucil?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Metamucil.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, because one of the things we have to think about today is do we stay at this dose and give it a little more time to see if your body adjusts to it or do we need to back off.  It really depends on both if we're getting benefits from it, although the benefits might continue to build over time and are you having side effects that are just intolerable where we need to back off.  So, what's your feeling about that, would you rather give it a little more time or do you feel like you can't tolerate the side effects and we need to back off?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't even know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's hard because I just hate feeling like I used so and [NAME OTHER] has noticed it, too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's noticed improvement?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No he said uh - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that you've slid back a little bit.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. He said you're going back to the way you used to be.  Why are you crying?  You know, that's what you used to do.  It scares him I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Would you be willing to give it one more week and see?  I, I'd like to kinda see if things will level off on their own. If they don't then we'll make some more changes, but I'm kinda hoping they will level off and that maybe it is in part related to some other things that are happening, not just the mood swings or the medication.  So let's give it one more week and if you start feeling worse during that week, will you call me? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But we don't want things getting worse.  Okay.  Are you feeling anxiety or nervousness or worrying more about things?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I, I just, I was, [NAME OTHER] and I, gosh I can't believe I said that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's just what's called a Freudian slip and yeah I think you're thinking about [NAME OTHER] more and that's okay.  I mean how do you feel right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know why I'm crying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> See, I think there's some old feelings coming back. Maybe they need to come out. Maybe there's some feelings that haven't been released, might be about [NAME OTHER].  When you've been thinking about [NAME OTHER] this week, what kind of thoughts have you had?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I was having, I mean, with [NAME OTHER] I just remember all the good stuff, okay, the bad stuff was a big learning lessons, big learning lessons, but I know [NAME OTHER was a good person.  It's just that he was an alcoholic and we had a lot of fun together.  Sailing, [NAME OTHER] and, oh just we just had, we had fun and really I think I really loved him, loved, loved him until he started drinking again.  Then you know it was a steady decline into hell.  And I guess I was kinda surprised that [NAME OTHER] just felt, I mean she really just didn't, she said she just left it behind and moved on.  And I thought how do you do that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, do you know as much about their relationship, for example, do you know if he was drinking when they met?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When they met?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know,  I'm sure he was.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That may have been part of it, I mean she may have not had as many good memories as you did with him and also she wasn't with him as long.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you're right about that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's probably a very different relationship than what you had.  She was with him three or four years while he was drinking and part of the time he was real sick and it sounds like she was getting ready to leave him anyway, so she probably doesn't have those many good memories as you do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I always think you know [NAME OTHER]'s up there playing tennis with [NAME OTHER].  I just - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did the two of you used to play tennis together?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, when we brought [NAME OTHER] home, um, [NAME OTHER], went and got some tennis balls and just every day he would always take the time to play tennis ball with [NAME OTHER] and that, [NAME OTHER] never, I don't know think we ever saw her again without a tennis ball in her mouth and even when I had to put her to sleep, I held her with a tennis ball.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You had to put [NAME OTHER] down while you and [NAME OTHER] were together still?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, that was uh, I had left, moved [NAME OTHER] with mom and she had [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] and they were happy there cause they had a fenced yard and mom was home all the time and stuff and I was going from place to place and then she just got dementia - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] did?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, couldn't get out of the corner and then when mom went to visit [NAME OTHER] I took care of [NAME OTHER] and I realized she'd go around in circles all night long, she couldn't sleep, she would get in the corner and not know how to turn around and I decided this is not fair to [NAME OTHER], but she sailed with us.  We'd put her on the boat, put a life jacket on her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She enjoyed it, huh? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, so sounds like you had a lot of good memories with [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure, I mean there really are. There's a lot of bad, really bad ones but, uh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The only bad ones you said was when he was drinking and he'd become violent is that right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you know, like break my nose, put a gun to my head, locked in closets.  He was really mean. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Put a gun to your head?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What, what why did he do that do you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When he was drinking he was just in a rage.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He'd threaten to kill you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she said the same thing, destroy the house, destroy my apartment.  I finally had nothing left that wasn't broken.  If you had plants, I mean he was, I would, I spent so many of those years sleeping in the car with my two kitties, um, or down at the swimming pool in our apartment or for a while over at [NAME OTHER]'s and then he got too scared of [NAME OTHER] and didn't want me over there either cause he was scared [NAME OTHER] would kill him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many of those eleven years you were with [NAME OTHER] was he drinking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ten.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, so it was one good year and the other ten he drank, wow, so you put up with it for ten years?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Total abuse.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And do you remember when you finally did leave why you left?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because, um, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was kinda going under and, uh, decided to move the business, uh, down to Florida.  He went on ahead to set it up in Fort Lauderdale and I stayed behind and got my place sold and, uh, ended up flying to [DEIDENTIFIED] and I just hated it there, hated it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you remember what you hated about it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't like the weather, I didn't like the humidity, I didn't like the, and I just did not like it there. Didn't want to go there. I wanted to go up to the mountains and, uh, to live there and came back and I thought, and I decided I'm not going. Just not gonna go.  And I moved all my stuff home to a garage, rented a little house and I started looking for a job up in the mountains.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know I'd drive all the way from [DEIDENTIFIED] and interviewed for a job and got a job and moved up there not knowing one soul and I got away from [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And finally that break to escape.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did he ever come looking for you or try to get you to come back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was so attached to [NAME OTHER], even with, you know living through you know, him not being able to keep a job, drunk all the time, abusive, just, oh gosh the hell that we had both, that he had taken me down into, um, and I'd never lived with bill collectors coming to take his car away, just ugh, it was awful.  And so I, I moved up to the mountains, started my job [DATE] and he came up Christmas. He flew back Christmas and I was watching and I thought I realized I could do this.  I can break away from him and I did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Because you might not have survived if you hadn't.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, even through all, you know, there was a lady counselor telling me if I didn't leave [NAME OTHER] he was gonna kill me, but somehow you don't believe it. I don't know. But I think he would of.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like he came very close on more than one occasion.  Huh, so there must have been a lot of emotions during those times, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was just, I look back and I don't know how, how, I don't know how I worked except that I would you know, be up all night hiding so that he wouldn't beat me up anymore and I'd leave clothes at [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and I'd go to work and put on a smile.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You learned how to block it out and just go on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Work.  Just like, yknow, when I tried to commit suicide and was in the hospital one day, the next day went back to work, put on a smile.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and again I'm thinking so where did all that sadness, fear, depression from back then go?  My guess is you just put a lid on it and it stayed in there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't want anybody to know either.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And now it's just coming out. I heard on the radio about a lady who was in the Holocaust, she survived the Holocaust, you know many of her family members were killed, but she survived and got out and she didn't talk about it until she was in her [AGE], then she started talking about experiences, she said she just couldn't do it until then so I just, I wasn't able to think about it or talk about it, but now she does and teaches children about what it was like and I think some of the truth about being in a place in life where we feel strong enough to be able to deal with some of those past horrific things, and I'm wondering if that's what's happening for you to some degree. You're in a place too where you can remember some of the past things that have happened in your life, like with [NAME OTHER] and relieve some of the emotions that go with it. And that can be a healing process, yknow. Have you ever heard of healing from the inside out? What it means is, I had a friend who had a ruptured appendix, it ruptured before they did surgery.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And so when they opened his belly up the found there was infection all over his belly. So they couldn't sew him back up because all that infection would still be in there, they couldn't get it all out so what they did is they left his belly open after the surgery and what happened in a situation like that is his body pushes the infection out and heals from the inside out.  So the body has a way of healing itself, but you can't help by closing the wound back up. In fact, it could have killed him cause the infection could have stuck in there. Same sort of thing happens sometimes psychologically. Sometimes people have a psychological, if you will, infection in there that smolders and just sits there for years, decades sometimes and finally it breaks open and then sometimes if people are willing to let it stay open it heals from the inside out and pushes that old psychological trauma out and it may be that this is part of what's happening to you. Some of these situations kinda opened things up so you can heal from the inside out, some sadness or other feelings that you might have had, for example your relationship with [NAME OTHER]. So again I encourage you to let yourself just feel whatever comes out and if you cry, if you feel the need to cry, go ahead and cry and don't feel like you have to shut it off or explain it to anybody and then if that is what's happening, with time the crying will become less and less and you'll feel better cause you will have released that old sadness. Does that make sense? Okay. Again, like I said if you feel like you're going down further, let me know because I don't want it to turn into depression, but this may be part of your healing. And again it feels like a lot of it has to do with loss.  Loss of relationships, loss of people and that's been kind of a constant concern on your mind with your mom anyway with [NAME OTHER] and it's kinda been hovering there for years anyway. So, yeah let's not medicate right now, let's watch the medicine and see if the side effects get better and give it a week and we'll see how things go, does that sound all right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, is there anything else today that you wanted to talk about that we didn't? Okay, well hang in there. I think this is gonna pass, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I hope so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I hope so, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I feel bad - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, hardly. Take care of yourself. Bye bye.</p>

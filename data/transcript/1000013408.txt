<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am today. I figured I'd try it out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not easy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's okay. It's a little strange without it. We'll see if I - how I do today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have you had it for a long time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. The surgery was in January. So it's not that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of not that long. Just on crutches first and then a cane. So a few weeks. But I don't like to get too use to it. So.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You have to do exercise?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: For how long?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you. For about another probably six to eight weeks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Six to eight weeks?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hum</p>

<p>PATIENT: Every day?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's good for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yes. It's amazing how physical activity can just lift you up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes it can.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Completely. Yesterday I was like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yesterday was a very beautiful day.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was a beautiful day. And I woke up and I was like no. And then I went to the gym. And then I went outside. I was like ah. It was so hot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About how long?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just the combination. The beautiful day and then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the activity?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The activity. And I always think like I resist the fact that it's not winter But I like winter. But it's nice. It's really nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They said tomorrow is going to be another day like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like yesterday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even warmer.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very changed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So (inaudible) came yesterday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not too sure to say anything about it. It's nice to have her. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it nice to see her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was strange with her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's strange. It's nothing to do with how we're involved with each other. It's strange to see how when friends come over to visit me it's A because I'm in a relationship so I behave in the same way. At the beginning I feel like I'm much more nervous. Because then I feel I have to take because I'm off school so I have days off. And then it's supposed to be funny like they all have to (inaudible). And I have to take care of her. And I feel like I because we have such a small apartment also everything is so crowded. So I feel I'm much more not edgy but a little nervous. [3:03]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have plans for the day?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah more or less. No big plans. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just small plans. And I don't know. Oh course they - maybe the issue with the kids will come up but (inaudible) while I'm on vacation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. She.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She said that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She said that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good for her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She said like do we have to talk about it? Let's just have a nice vacation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know we have to talk about it. (Inaudible) But there are times. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's from far back</p>

<p>PATIENT: As far as here. Yeah. As far as back. We came back Friday night. Actually (inaudible) overall advantage again. It was the first time we had - there was one day that was really like a very nice day (inaudible). He was very confused about that I think as he goes back and forth between (inaudible) what we should do. Just say I don't want to be - I know there is a respect there. It will take you away from me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (laughs) And so that's one thing I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you've got a lot of conflict.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And he is very honest about it. He's extremely confused. And he's very ... he's tense in his way when we actually go into detail to (inaudible) and to try to (inaudible). And I don't give him enough confidence. It's not like I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't give him enough.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Confidence that I have a strict answer like what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't have an answer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Rather or no. And it's exhausting ... not to know. And then the day will - on Friday after we met at such a ... I couldn't really say why I was in a very bad mood. I mean it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was quite a session we had. [5:58]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it wasn't exactly - what was exactly that ...upsetting me so much was that the truth or the fact that you said what you said because it's connected to me or just (inaudible). You know it kind of adhered to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No wonder you weren't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a very emotional way. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you - when you say you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to cry many times and I couldn't. I did I made dinner. And I cut onions so exactly. Sometimes it's when I cut the onions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you cut onions. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So that made sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that made you cry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because I would cry anyhow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said you were in a bad mood. Can you describe more about the feeling you were having after the session on Friday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt pretty much that ... pretty much lost, pretty much that I can't ... I was ... I was afraid that I would never be able to make the right decision of this child to live - to follow my instincts or trust my instincts. Everything seemed to be ... so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a word scary but. It was scary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scary.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was like everything - almost like everything that I ... it's not everything that - I felt like I don't have ... I know that I don't have a clue about himself or about my future. And I didn't have ... (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt like that after the session?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you don't have a clue about yourself. [8:29]</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way I have like. I know that I do but that was just the overall feeling. The feeling was that there is ... and it's true the reason that the truth that there is ... I'm not - I'm not happy. And ... I cover it quite well. I cover it quite well with people around me. I cover it quite well with ... with myself. Because I - I don't really know.</p>

<p>You know it's like I don't really know where ... to go in terms of for what is it that make me. So I feel like it's complicated that I don't know where to start like say where I'm not happy with my relationship. Is it and if it fit the relationship what I'm supposed to do about it. Supposed to be living with me, supposed to - there are so many complications that have to do with it. </p>

<p>And at the same time I need to create this affection. I need to be - I feel like I have to - if I confront James I feel it's - it's not even confronting. It's - I don't know to say to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know what it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What it is. So it's very hard to communicate about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me - let me get ... stop you for a second. I want to say something first of all. Last session because I - I felt it was an interesting and difficult session. And I was concerned that you left in a - in a little bit of sad and lost state. And what I thought of that you know oh course we could talk about it today but that we'll have to find a balance between you know kind of discussing things frankly and directly and making sure that you don't feel so lost and sad that you don't you know you lose the day to that.</p>

<p>But I was also just aware of something that just happened right here which is you started to talk about Friday and about feeling lost and sad and confused. And right away you began to talk about all of the issues that you want to resolve. And my guess is that by thinking about all of these different things that you are confused about ... that that kind of occupies your time if you know what I mean. You know if that's ... if that's clear. [11:32]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very definitely ... a constant buzz.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a buzz.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Makes - something that makes noise in my head. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I just heard a little bit of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's there. And it's not - it's concrete but it's not ... I'm very passive about it. It's not a sole you know. I feel ... that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But by being preoccupied with it you can take your attention away from other things in a certain sense. What you feel. What you feel for ... all of those kinds of things. In other words it's all turned into kind of thoughts and issues about things. And those thoughts and issues are very important, right? (Inaudible). But it's something separate from what it is you may be feeling. If that makes sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's the task.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what I feel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So (inaudible) you've got one of the things that we can do here in addition to actually talking about actual issues. Like we could - you're always going to be thinking (laughs) about the issues and how to solve them and all of the permutations of them. But what's more difficult is to - is to - is to focus on what we feel I think. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I think I'm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you think a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think a lot. Yeah. Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that - all of what I just said really I should have said I think you think a lot. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't let myself feel ... if it's bad or if it's good. I just don't let myself go there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do you get lost in the thoughts.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now what are you thinking? Or I should say what do you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't - I don't feel anything special. I feel again like my - I don't feel bad or I feel that I'm thinking about myself. Because it's just a (inaudible) that I - I think about it. I think about where was the last time I actually felt something strong. [14:39]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On Friday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Friday and also Saturday. So I was very - I was worse and that's why I felt very - very unhappy and very happy that I was with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds wonderful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then Sunday it's gone. So I'm trying to connect them. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you feel about coming here today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was a little nervous. I also expect - I know that overall I ... I enjoy coming here. I mean I'm looking forward to ... but I was - I think it's the first time that I ever was a little bit ... uncomfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know exactly what I was going on say. But I didn't know ... I'm thinking I had to be okay. Show that I was okay. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would happen if you showed me that you weren't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing. I don't know. Nothing bad. I'm just so ... I was so - it's all - I'm so use to being ... to present something that's or (inaudible) to. So I'm not ... at this point the way I found I'm - how I function. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it sounds like Friday wasn't entirely okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Friday was not. Precisely not. And the whole day was not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But none of less you wanted to come in today and.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But also there are you know today is Wednesday. It's almost a week but I'm not there anymore. [17:27]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: So. And I think also I wasn't sure exactly - I think some of it I'm not sure how to be offensive, how to ... and because I'm confused I'm a little bit ... I think I cross as ... as we said it something is not connected or disconnected or not clear. I'm setting - I'm sending a different message from what I actually feel. I don't know what I actually feel sometimes but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of the things I'm thinking is you're seeking a need and.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where you about to say something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That I don't think I ever think about myself. I think about how all of the other persons will react. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In relation to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Coming over here. You know even in our relationship. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you think about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How you will react. And ... I need to - I need you to react with me in a certain way. If I can get everybody to react with me in a way that you know that there is a ... I'm so focused on creating a certain image of myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how would you like me to react to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't want you to react to me from that image. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like part of you does or part of you doesn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Part of me just so use to it. And part of me just wants you to let me be - to leave me alone. [20:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In general. And part of me doesn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a dilemma.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not only for you for the people with whom you interact. Part of what I've been hearing and with what you've been saying in terms of us in terms of last week makes me wonder if when I express to you my feelings about the session before last session, if you experience that as a criticism. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess somewhere yes. Somewhere in my - I felt that it is criticism. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't intend it as such. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Although I can understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I know. I know. But I do see us and when I know is when I hear criticism ... I get very offensive. Not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Necessarily verbally. I defend myself. So I'm closing myself from the other person. It's more than I just don't ... communicate anymore. I'm disconnecting myself. And that's where I'm some many times I think confused between what is a criticism and what is actually ... assistance or ... authentic rely of authentic communication or observation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What an observation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. That's (inaudible). </p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like you're very far away. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was now. I feel like I'm still drifting from one thing to the other. I constantly my mind's going back to my other day with James where I feel like I don't know where to start to explain what I'm feeling. But it's almost in most of my relationships - my close relationships. [23:18]</p>

<p>I ... I've been there. I've found that that I'm ... I'm frustrated because I don't have the words today. That I don't know how to explain myself - explain my feeling and what I feel. And when I feel there is a rejection I close myself. When I feel that I can't express myself I'm disappointed from - and I suppose I also - I've either been very critical and cynical without saying exactly what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What it is that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you feel you've been there in your?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More so with James. I'm trying to send messages. Maybe I'm trying to ask for his help. And I don't tell him where I am. But he knows I'm very ... I'm very confused in our ... about our future. And he was like talking about it on the weekend. He was talking about ... buying a house. (Inaudible) so away from me. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could you tell him that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I said that to him. Like in a funny way and in a nice way but I said (inaudible) involve me in that. It's way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not where you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not where I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So. You communicated yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel like there should be more. Because I have to explain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're hard on yourself too. You said that you expressed to him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he got it. He said okay. I'm just checking. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What more does there need to be in that kind of interaction?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Should I ... because I have expressed and constantly said to him that ... I don't know if there's going to be a house for the both of us if we're going to have our own child. I have no idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't need to say that to him in very moment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. And I did say it twice. But I don't know. I constantly don't I mean it's not like that. It's so much about my own ... my own (inaudible) that I just need to ... express it to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To get rid of it. [26:05] </p>

<p>PATIENT: To get rid of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can understand the impulse.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really feel like I don't know how to start connecting with my feelings. And where the ... because I feel like I push it. I try to - I want to control and understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) That's right. It doesn't work like that in a paradoxical way. You know? Because what happens then is I think - my sense is that you would be left with thoughts about your feelings which are not your feelings. You know? </p>

<p>And I think it's just that something important which is bad. It's an attempt to control. You know? I'm getting the sense that I'm saying too much today. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That you're saying too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or too much. In fact do you feel that? Is that something you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe I feel that I need a little quiet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You need a little quiet?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm thinking about what you're thinking and I'm like - the dialogue is so - a little bit intense in my.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You know when you feel something like that - the dialogue (laughs) is too intense you can let me know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just say I need some quiet. [28:06]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's the way it is. I don't say when I feel something I'm so not ... it does - I don't execute it right away. There's so much issues around that moment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what that means.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel I don't even sense it like I need to say it. I sound like I'm getting passive - I'm getting passive maybe aggressive a little bit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I feel like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean because you know as it happened today it was a good guess on my part. But it leads the other person in that position there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Guessing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Guessing. I can't read your mind nor can anybody else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't ... I don't seem to be connected with what's going on in myself. I understand. I understand afterwards but not while it happens. </p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm feeling a bit of a dilemma. [31:20]</p>

<p>PATIENT: To - if to say or just to come out? I don't [know what to say] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking like that ...it's interesting that people I choose to be around ... especially the people that I choose to be in relationships ... are always so emotional. And that they're emotions were ... a kind of like so present that I didn't have to deal with my own. And it was to - for me to and it's still easy for me to rely on them options to ... to (inaudible) the feeling that I actually feel something. That something is happening. Because I react. I always react. I don't initiate my reactions - my actions. I react to what they do - what they say. And when I do feel connected to my feelings and when I just so I'll ... anything will. Angry or happy. I just like myself so much better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You dis.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like my.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You like yourself. [34:07]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So much better. And I ... I seem to accomplish some much more in every sense - communication, doing stuff. But most of the time I'm just not like that. </p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And one of the few things I'm (inaudible) ... the few things that's kind of - part of the reason why I feel so good with Josie because she's more than I am a passive. A numb person with her feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A numb person?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's so like young (ph) like I talk to her about it yesterday. And she says oh if only I could give you (inaudible). It's a she's so - she's so more than I am. You know gets very nervous. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But. And then I feel like I need to be ... I'm in charge because it's not necessarily that yeah, I'm in charge but I'm ... I'm the one that feels more - that communicates which is you know it pushes me. Pushes from almost the bottom. </p>

<p>And when I'm with people like James (inaudible) so 100 percent emotion constantly. It just pushes me back to - for - where the gray area where I'm not - I don't - I'm so hesitating really to express my emotions. My real emotions. My real feelings. </p>

<p>And it's so much like my mom and my other - my relationship with my dad. (Inaudible) I can share but ... and I know that I can (inaudible) her. Her perceivity (sp?) is the fact that there is my dad is the one that when he ... he's very present - emotion - drive - the energy in the family. And in their relationship. And she holds back. She can hold things back. I mean she can take them back with her but she holds everything back. </p>

<p>And when I think of her and when I think about this side of the family sometimes I feel like ... really like - almost like the physical rejection - almost disguising like a. </p>

<p>My uncle and he's my mom's brother, I really I can't stand him. I know I'm saying something very, very harsh. And I see him quite often because he is coming here and he's so passive. You always have to work - work to make conversation, to see what he wants, to understand for himself, everything he (inaudible). Oh my God. And I have it in me. [37:39]</p>

<p>And (inaudible) that I'm attracted to people that they are different from. But it's not that I want to be (inaudible). I just want to be tentive - attentive to what I feel. And be able to say ... and not because it's also that I wait for such a long time that eventually when I say something it's very aggressive. </p>

<p>To come across at work ... I just explode. </p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know that I have good instincts. I know that. But I don't listen to my gut. But they usually - I - they usually are the case. I'm really afraid of it (inaudible) because my guts or my instincts are ... are ten times more riskier than I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are they saying right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I went back to think about Josie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I should do it. (Inaudible) You know just even for being with her for a day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Enjoyed being with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I was thinking about ... (inaudible) I also I mean I can't think about people. And that's just to concentrate on other people that's running (ph) and not just about myself. And the fact that she is extremely (inaudible). She says exactly what she says but it's in such a positive way. It's not the drama. It's not the emotional. She's pure in a way. [40:36]</p>

<p>That's what I like about her. I always know where I am. And I always know where she is. And it's not too involved. It's not ... yet. </p>

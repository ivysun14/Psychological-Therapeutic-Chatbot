<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>(inaudible background conversation from 0:00:10 to 0:00:43.7 - overlapping of audio files)

</p><p>PATIENT: I feel like talking at 10:00 o'clock in the morning you feel like (inaudible). I don't get going until noon.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you still asleep?

</p><p>PATIENT: No I just (inaudible) but had to wake somebody up it's cold out there. I just don't nothing has gone wrong yet this month. Well actually I couldn't find a babysitter because my husband, my husband has classes all day Tuesdays and Thursdays. You knew that?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No.

</p><p>PATIENT: You should've told me. Well we've been doing our homework, in bed. And you know I find that it's not all of his to really work.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) at work by structuring or...

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess I'm not, like I say to Jim that it's going to take practice. And I think like I really, that's not really what I believe either. Or if I do I'm not willing to go through with it. I mean every night for weeks and...just sometimes, well I like a little break I guess. And I just can not believe, like I'm abnormal in that respect. 0:02:33.8

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're not the only one that would object to (inaudible at 0:02:44.8).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then, you know and like, well things like nothing is ever convenient. You know one it's 3:00 o'clock in the morning, the next night you're catching a cold. And so, okay I decided there's never going to be any perfect time. I kind of got over that hump. Because there never is. Let's face it, I mean there's either a TV program you want to watch or you have to take (inaudible) or chew or hair or something. You just, it's not ever going to be perfect. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're aren't able to like jump in spite of that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, right. I just said to myself you know, "There's never going to be a perfect time get in there and go."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You got in there but you didn't go.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah I did. And it kind of works but you kind of have to give yourself pep talks before you go. I mean it's not even the idea anymore. It's just I, I just don't, I'm too tired. I don't feel like it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yep. I wish that I enjoyed it. No, not, because I do when I throw myself into it. I do enjoy it. I wish I looked forward to it. But I just don't, I don't think I'm going to until after I climax. And I'm not going to climax if I don't get in there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like once you get in there it's alright, but it's sort of like looking forward to something, less than anticipation like dread or something. 0:04:59.0

</p><p>PATIENT: Well my first reaction is, "Oh not again."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm just kind of tired or doing the same thing over and over and over. If there was even, anything new to do. No I don't think so. One thing I was going to say (inaudible) was I saw a fellow down there which was in my husband's school and I about went under, you know made a tunnel under the hall.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Probably embarrassed.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh I could see him and wouldn't be embarrassed. I didn't want him to see me. I guess it, like I didn't want this bad reflection on my husband. And I don't know this guy other than, I don't know what he thinks. Well you really don't know what anybody thinks I guess. Because they might all sit around the bridge and say, "Wow everybody should go to therapy." But you know they found out somebody they were playing with they might all leave the table.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If they were to find out that you were in therapy (inaudible at 0:06:36.1)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And they avoid you like the plague.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well some people would and some people...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: ...ignore and not ignore.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah it does because last night I was playing bridge and (inaudible), you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I wanted to say there was this one lady I didn't even know, and I wanted to say, "Look guys I know I'm in therapy," and one girl sitting there knew I was. But the other two didn't and they were really just kind of screwed up. But I didn't have the nerve to (inaudible at 0:07:21.1) her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You didn't know just how she'd react. 0:07:25.2

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know whether, yeah I guess it was her reaction but I know, I don't think like it would have embarrassed me but I thought well maybe it would her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm, make her uncomfortable.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think sometimes, well like there was an article in the paper about Dory Previn a long time ago and how she'd gone to a therapist for 15 years. And one of the and Jessica said, "Well you know." I said, "Don't you feel sorry for this lady whose husband, got Mia Farrow pregnant?" She said, "Well look at her she's been going to therapy for all that time. She was in it, she's really off her rocker." And I'm thinking you know that's kind of a [envious say] (ph at 0:08:25.8) don't knock it until you've tried it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I guess also the things you'd been inclined to say, "Boy if I were in therapy for a long time (inaudible at 0:08:37.6).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah just the fact that you're going.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Boy she's really rude.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, well yeah but they might be true too but I don't feel like that. And I don't, like if everybody else is feeling like that I'd probably end up that way too. I might even end being a loon. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But I don't know which part of that thing (inaudible at 0:09:07.1) but what if and it sounds to me something like they're, it's like in a sense you might believe them. Like there's a part of you (inaudible) say something (inaudible). 0:09:29.5

</p><p>PATIENT: No I don't really believe that but I don't but I don't know about the rest of them. And it still is, it is important that, to me that they don't think I'm nutty. Yeah like whether I am or not that's beside the point. So now they say (inaudible). Jim said I have kind of a compulsion to tell people, when another simple lie would do. Like "Where're you going?" People ask I just don't think of lying to them. It should always be your first thought right? And I guess maybe it's different, like you know they ask them, like this guy downstairs he actually saw me here. Well he didn't see me. I mean it was, you can tell people outside, and maybe it doesn't mean the same thing as when they, if you tell somebody while you're sitting in the waiting room downstairs. And they like really know this, that this, is for real. That you actually (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like there is a way in which you experience telling somebody when you're in the waiting room is like feeling, like a more dramatic having more dramatic impact like if you're outside telling Jessica or somebody, well I'm not entirely (inaudible) but it's like more abstract or something. But here you are really in the flesh waiting to be called for therapy.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know why.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you have some feelings about that?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know whether that was, whether that's why or whether I didn't want to stop and, even say hello to him. I may not even any place.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You may have not yet (inaudible at 0:11:49.9)

</p><p>PATIENT: Not here or on campus any place I might not, of maybe would have gone by. I really don't know in there. But it did make me uncomfortable. Even when he walked by and I turned my head. The fact of the matter is they probably wouldn't have recognized me if I hadn't turned my head. But it might have drawn attention towards this lady (chuckling). 0:12:30.3

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What a, what are you uncomfortable about? What made you uncomfortable? That they'll think you're a loon (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't really know. My first thought was so for protect my husband from the questions and probably men aren't really like that. A woman would die of curiosity but he'd probably say, "Hmm wonder what she's doing here." And that'd be like the last he time he ever wondered. But I just thought like it might be embarrassing to Jim. And I don't know whether it would be or not.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But the reason that you're uncomfortable (inaudible) really isn't so much having to do with you but having to do with, do with in some way like it would reflect on Jim as your saying poorly. Your being here reflect on Jim.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I don't know why last night. I guess because there's two people that I, I would have had to tell. And really one person in (inaudible) is a little less frightening when facing two. And then you kind of have to get set to a barrage of questions too. (inaudible at 0:14:24.5).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like it ain't you're in therapy but it seems like it opens, opens you up for these attacks but certainly not a typical declaration about the whole, a lot of questions you really wouldn't want to answer questions.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, "Well why are you going?" Well that's not any of your business. And it's hard for me to say, "It's none of your business." And it isn't really and I mean it's really kind of a dumb question. Or a lot of people would say, "What kind of therapy?", "Oh, I did know you were hurt." You know thinking of physical therapy. Which must mean that I don't appear looney on the outside.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It can only come, or generally come as a surprise to people? 0:15:26.5

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then they, "What's wrong with you?" And they're looking over your body. That's the hardest thing to say, "It's none of your business." I just can't bring my, myself to say that. It sounds so hard or cruel or something. And you know what and another thing of my, which will be easier is when I'm finally through is to say, "I have been in."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Some how it's a lot easier (inaudible at 0:16:31.5) I guess I don't (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know why I just think it will be easier to say I, I did have it instead of I am. It may never come up again. I may never have to say I did. I mean I'll have to say it anyway if there is some sort of something pushing me to tell people. You know thinking last night that that really you know a part of my personality has changed and it's really not a likeable thing about me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You've become less likeable?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well also for the domineering type of woman or a man that wants a submissive anything. I'm not going to appeal to them as much as I did when I disagreed with everything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah now you stand up for yourself.

</p><p>PATIENT: And any, I get into these arguments and I know darn good and well that I'm right but I have not had any practice at arguing and I lose. I'll come home and I'll say to Jim, "Boy that was, I said this and she said that," and he said, "Well why didn't you say, [neither one you point] (ph at 0:18:22.5)." It never occurred to me. I do, like I go in but I back down too at the end rather than, because really they're tougher than I am, those woman. And I really think that's the next thing. I really have to tackle practice at arguing that they have. I mean they can go in with no fact behind them at all, and come out ahead of me. 0:18:52.8

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you can go in deep in fact and wind up having the points being rammed down your throat.

</p><p>PATIENT: But not knowing when to use stuff.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I just...yeah. But I would like to win one time. Well, maybe I can get the hang of it. How to win an argument.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So your theory you're saying like when it's different for you though is that you stand up to them more even if you back down in the end or lose or something that you (inaudible 0:19:42.6).

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I mean I find myself even disagreeing just because nobody found outside. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I would disagree.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Even if it's not right.

</p><p>PATIENT: You might disagree. And then like everybody has to give you your chance to speak, you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's the democratic way to do it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Having that space feels good.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Plus I feel like out of that group, say last night, I was the only one with any experience. We were arguing about children and how people raise theirs. And all of these sweet young things have lived in one place all of their lives and seen the same type of people raise the same type of children. And like, it's different all over, it's different in every class.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you've moved around (inaudible at 0:20:55.4).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I mean, yeah we've seen people and what they say are books (ph) and a lot of times that isn't all the story. Well anyway, probably get an argument out of you. You don't care to fight? 0:21:29.7

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What would you like to argue about?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't want to argue, not unless you'd let me ring.

</p><p>(phone ringing)

</p><p>PATIENT: I think Jim likes the new me better. Although he's the one that pointed out that he didn't agree with me but he was certainly happy to see me go, enter in at least.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Go?

</p><p>PATIENT: Enter into the argument. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?

</p><p>PATIENT: It's kind of nice, it's a nice feeling. I think that he doesn't care whether I make a fool out of myself or not at least I tried. And it, and that was kind of a cruel thing to say, "Make a fool out of yourself." Like, everybody's got their own opinions and you always thought that you just didn't, I mean I've been asked specific questions and back down because I didn't want to get involved with, in an argument. I mean the person who asked the question was obviously going to take the opposing stand whatever I said now I just didn't want to do it. And then that made me feel kind of disgusted with myself. Because I did have something to say but I still wouldn't say it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It made you feel like a, well sort of a coward? 0:23:33.1

</p><p>PATIENT: Well yeah and I knew, like I knew that I didn't have any self assurance. But I'm still going to have to learn to stop and think before I, get involved. And another thing, I find as I really, in a lot of ways I haven't really changed because I've gone to therapy. I mean you would think I should have. That I could be more empathetic with the people who really can't help what they're doing. I still think, if they want to do whatever they're doing fine but don't complain about it I guess. Because like after all...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:25:32.6)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah there is something they can do about it if they want to.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you would have thought the therapy would make you more tolerable of [these type of people] (ph at 0:25:45.2) but not at all?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I tend to bad (ph) too. Since I was, because you get like I know how hard it is to even come to therapy. And the other day Jim said, "Boy he was really getting nervous." And I, you know my first reaction was to say, "Well, why?" I'm going. Then I had, kind of look back to where I, I was just really nervous. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's one of my problems is you know I always go by my first reaction, instead of kind of thinking it over. 0:27:01.8

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And instead of thinking about what it was like when you first came. So your first and focus is (inaudible) in therapy.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I think all that's really silly.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not nervous.

</p><p>PATIENT: Why should you be? Well, actually, I mean he's seeing me and he knows it doesn't hurt, didn't hurt much. But I wish you'd hurry up and get him in here. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're like [the images and things] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well now and what I have said before still stands I said, "It's as if you would concentrate on that and make a real effort to be able to do it," and he has and he does. You follow that?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If he paid attention to changing...

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...he could do it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Instead of sitting there saying, "I'm like this because my mother did this to me." He's sounding like this and I don't like to be like this and you know, make an effort. And I think he's made an effort in the last, well even since I've been here he has his ups and his downs. But, I still think a lot can be done. Well obviously it has to be done by you, I mean I had to do the changing. He said the other night, "Wouldn't it be fun to go to the Morris' (sp?) and Karda's whatever (inaudible at 0:29:26.3). Much that, fun going to a movie or one of those things but it just didn't sound like fun to me. But at least now I'm allowed to say what I feel at home.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like, like you're different that way.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I mean he says how he feels and then I get my turn too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't, I'm not sure if that's the way you're saying it now but it sounds like it's a half way thing. Like you get [into a routine] (ph) he does it and then after he does it I do it but if he didn't do it then I couldn't do it. 0:30:15.2

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I say, I have to remind him that this, is the way we're running the house now. I mean if I say, "Wow I don't want to go to bed again tonight, with you," obviously I don't go to bed. Then he starts getting tight about it already. I mean, like, that's how I feel so. The other night I made a crack about his mother and he started getting angry and I said, "I see this, oh, tell it like it is just isn't working anymore." Like if I make a comment like that then he really he stops a little, makes a crack about my mother.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like, maybe this didn't occur, it's just the way it sounds, sounds like you see yourself sort of as more in control or more proactive with it. Like more involved in setting the ground rules and moving the emotional stone and (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's like, like that's a major part of marriage too. I mean we've made like a giant step forward. It kind of makes you wonder how many people do talk. I mean like I felt like, let's see I'm 24 and I've been around my brother all my life and I didn't know him until he came to visit. It really it's just great. It gives you such a glow. I mean even if I hadn't of liked him after I found out a little bit of what he thought or what he felt. It would have been better than the not knowing him. I mean and then like forcing yourself to feel like, "Yeah, he's your brother and you're supposed to love and isn't he great."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible) honestly you did like him. As you go through that (inaudible). 0:33:04.8

</p><p>PATIENT: And now I'm thinking well my younger brother who I always thought, well I don't know what I've always thought of him. He such a nice fellow. I mean like people say he's so honest, he's so nice. That's just about it, that's all you can say about him. But I don't, I don't really know what, anything about what he's thinking either. And with Chuck you always have the idea that maybe he's not, thinking. And then sometimes he comes up with really brilliant things and it really takes you back. And it's something like Jim and I talk about for a week after, "Chuck said that?"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Comes as a total surprise.

</p><p>PATIENT: Surprised because honest-to-Pete I never seen anybody so...did you know what that meant?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah so totally unsure of himself. I always thought he would be, well obviously he is a little slow. Such a nice fellow he just can't...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like he, he just [falls out with himself] (ph at 0:34:36.6).

</p><p>PATIENT: Hmmm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) bright and very out of character (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah and it's just really shocking. And he's, he's always thought my older didn't like him. Well we all thought that, the whole family thought he gone, he's outgrowing us or something. You know he likes using big words. And when Peter was there all he said about Chuck was just praise after praise, what a grand fellow he was. And I think that the problem in our whole family. Nobody ever says how they feel. Maybe that's not just the family either.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:35:34.7) nobody says, "Wow I really like you", "I really care about you."

</p><p>PATIENT: No. And you just, it really comes as a shock. I thought Peter just knew that Chuck was a nothing. I mean didn't even think about him. So it's really it did so much good for everybody. I mean if I never talk to him again, really talk to him about leading up the farm and "How are you? How's your job going?" sort of stuff. 0:36:15.3

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Get to like usually encounters of one.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that is important to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah it is. And I'd always thought that our family was so close. And I don't know where I got that idea unless somebody said, "Your family is so close."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because that's about the level of truth it is, somebody else telling you, "Your close to your family."

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I like my folks but that's about and my one brother but that's about as far as it ever went. And Susan (ph at 0:37:04.3) said something like she goes, I mean I never, never would say the kids now a days they hate their parents, that's what they say. And whether they do or not is besides the point. I mean when I was growing people you didn't have thoughts like that. And I really didn't even think about my family there were my family and what are you going to do. They were just really delighted [that you could help] (ph) you could just tell. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Very nice of them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And now my next project get the whole, the whole all of the children liking each other.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Which is that yours and Jessica's and those children?

</p><p>PATIENT: No I mean my brothers and I. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh okay. Well it sounds like your intro to Peter (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, so then I'd have to write to Chuck and tell Chuck what nice things Peter told me about him. Told him he's thinking straight. I think that was a great part about it. He wasn't going to care about Peter because he knew Peter didn't like him and so. We'll see how that comes out. My younger brother is very pliable. That's funny you know. I mean when he gets that letter and finds out what Peter thinks of him he'll return that thought. I mean he'll start thinking about Peter from a, I mean whether he knows (inaudible). 0:39:55.2

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think I don't know. It's just like a little servant. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel belittled (ph at 0:40:37.9)?

</p><p>PATIENT: I sit on the couch and say, "I'd like a drink of water," he'd go get me one. And I can see Jennifer doing that same thing with Sarah only we're (ph) getting her. I mean, Sarah is going, if we don't watch her she's going to turn into the same thing. I mean it's just disgusting to me now but I mean I knew I did at the time. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well like I kind of think that like not only me but the whole family made Chuck what he is. I mean because we were older and anything he said, you know it just wasn't very (inaudible). I mean after all we were older and we probably did know more than he was but instead of trying to help him (inaudible at 0:42:05.0). And Peter was more than me because I was just a year older. And I did my share too. We got him like I don't know if it was from the 6th grade because he had this, mother was telling me he had this nervous cough. And she said it was just because of what we did. I mean every time we opened his mouth we jumped on him. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Part of it was (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm (inaudible). I think that we were not taught compassion for our brother. Or do you teach children compassion. I guess you show them that. 0:42:54.7

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it was just, it's hard if it's just like mother the one that was raising us and dad was just not around. He was there at meals but he didn't join in. And I don't know (inaudible) or not. Can't think of anything compassionate that I...you know. But I guess I do feel a little guilty about the way Chuck turned out. I mean even though he is nice and clear and honest. If he was just a little bit stronger and had a little more, self confidence.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do yourself and Peter (inaudible) being (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The reason he is the way he is (inaudible). 0:44:38.0

</p><p>PATIENT: No really it isn't awful he'd probably do better than any of us. Just because you can't say a bad word about I mean other than he lacks self confidence. I feel confidant that he will do one, married money you know. But I don't know whether he will ever be, what do I say happy. Because it takes very little for him to be happy. Satisfied maybe with whatever he's doing. I was wondering why I feel compelled to tell people if I do. Well I must want them to know or I could lie. 0:48:10.3

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:48:15.9).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Seems to come up in conversation a lot. Yeah I think I'm sort of proud of it, in a way. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know maybe it's the shock value. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: And it's sort of a test too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Will they (inaudible)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Like me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Will they fill (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: [You're not typing] (ph at 0:49:36.3) how many people don't measure up. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible). How does that make you feel?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I don't know, kind of happy I guess. You know why waste your time and say, "Alright got to practice what they preach." But then it, then again it might be the change in my personality.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It may not be this (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I mean the first, well out of three people I told the two started backing away before, I noticed any change. So I'm, I mean it's just I think the thing is they didn't want to associate with a loon. And another thing was I think I like about Jessica that I'd really kind of, I can kind of understand her not understand but I see her so much differently than I did when I first came. Except I'm not really too fond of her so you know it's kind of a mutual thing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yep.

</p><p>PATIENT: But what I thought about Jessica and I told Jim when she started backing away too was that she had told me too much. We had been exchanging confidences and I think she has never done that before and I think it's kind of frightening for her. 0:51:55.2

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: That she's, she realized she'd said too much about herself. And I'm kind of, not like she remembers that when she's around me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So that for her anybody sounds like being in therapy your being in therapy was like, a gamble.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Very uncomfortable.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's kind of that's really kind of a shame because she had a good thing going. Well I mean like you can't go, well I guess maybe you can but it's not right to go through life and never having told your deepest, darkest feelings.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, well.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I, I don't know. What does she have, I suppose probably that she's gone on to saying, I would have too. But I mean at least she has somebody to talk to, to say things to that maybe she really felt that would never say to anybody. I don't know it just depends on your definition of close friend. And I have not been able to pined anybody down on that. I don't really know what is a close friend? Is it somebody you talk to? Or is it somebody you talk to and have fun with?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what the definition is either. I don't (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Doesn't make any difference?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know. Maybe it does. Why, what...

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. This one is bothering me. What is a close friend? 0:54:30.5

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What difference does it make. I don't know that rhetorically. I mean what difference (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd like to see if I have one. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like that isn't even an issue for me. It sounds to me or my judgment from a (inaudible) earlier was like the kind of people you hung out with were just people who spent time with you. That there wasn't anyone who really cared for you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I think I really you know was really concerned about Jessica and how she felt. I think I would have been a close friend...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah to Jessica.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...if it continued. Yeah and I think like maybe she's loosing something. If maybe she doesn't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Jessica was (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well even more than that. I think I was to her. I think she may never have that. Because she just is the sort of person who loves (inaudible) all of the time. She entertains them and I don't think she ever says how she feels. I don't know maybe I'm wrong. Maybe she's not but I just doubt it sincerely. From the things I've heard her say about we thought were really good couple friends (ph at 0:56:11.5) but she doesn't know them. And nobody knows her. Isn't that a...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really feel sorry for her.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I do. That's really a heck of a way to live. But then maybe I would have gone through my whole life without having if I hadn't just come here and really got to thinking about it. Are people worth it or not.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You made a choice.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I think I'm a little more selective about who I put on my pedestal now. And I don't think anybody is ever going to be up there again. Which is a good thing because it's a hard place to be. 0:57:01.1

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You can't look up to them (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I have a list of things (inaudible). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:57:29.9).

<p>PATIENT:  (8-minute silence) Last night, uhm, it suddenly occurred to me that I, I don't know, that I was really thinking about having, on Tuesday, talked about why I wasn't here on Monday.  But suddenly I thought that probably one reason why the thought was on my mind and in the way, indirectly it was important for me to talk about it, was to make sure you realized that I couldn't have been here on Monday.  And probably so you wouldn't be angry but I think also, uhm, lately I've wondered something that for some reason I f—, am very hesitant to ask.  But it's, do you charge for times when I'm unable to come, if I let you know ahead of time?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah, I have charged for, ah, the hours that you've cancelled.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Not the ones that I did.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And I think there was —</p>

<p>ANALYST: What, why were you hesitant to ask?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you have any ideas?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I sort of vaguely, uhm, again feel in sort of a vulnerable position asking in that maybe you'll be angry.  But that might be because really I would like you not to charge.  And so perhaps I feel angry.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Mm.  But you're not aware of feeling angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I would say annoyed, not angry (said quietly).  But that probably (laughs) means I feel angry and just won't admit it.  And it also makes me feel annoyed at myself if something happens that I can't make it.  (Pause) It just struck me that it's, uhm, recently I've seen there are really times when I think I'm angry at myself but it's, I'm probably angry at somebody else and I'm afraid to admit it.</p>

<p>But then something occurred today, when I was angry at somebody else but I'm wondering if really what was happening was I was angry at myself.  I'm not sure.  Uhm, I had, uhm, my assistant couldn't come in today.  And I had been up late last night so I had hoped she'd be there to help relieve me of having to handle them at all times.  And it was a difficult day anyway since it was a holiday and they had a party and we had a an assembly that turned out to be different than we thought, long and so forth.  And the dismissal has been very confusing the last few days and I had to handle both, we have some boys that go home with parents and some that go by bus.  And I had to take care of both of these groups in an area, a small area where the whole school was letting out.  And so by the end of the day I just had a splitting headache and, and I did what I thought was best for me and for the children, while they were waiting, while the bus boys were waiting for their bus.</p>

<p>And then another teacher, who usually, who, who is handling bus boys only at all times at dismissal, uhm, got angry at me and said I shouldn't have been where I was, I should have been someplace else and, ah, just simply because she thought that all the boys should be right together in this small place and I had taken mine a little bit away so it would be less congested.  And so instead of answering back or doing anything like that, I just sort of, sort of gave up and said, alright I'll do what she wants.  But, and then I felt angry at her but I think I was angry at myself for not having — well, I don't know who I was angry at but I was angry.</p>

<p>And then my supervisor came along and saw this big mess and, and asked why some people didn't go somewhere else to relieve the congestion.  And, and then, and then I just, I said, well I had but somebody had told me I shouldn't.  And, ah, and I just felt like sort of a 5 year old, the way I was handling the situation instead of just doing what I thought was right.  And so in th—, in this case it seems like in a way I'm really angry at myself but I ended up believing that I was angry at everybody else first.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You kind of got away from feeling annoyed with me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't feel comfortable (laughs) being annoyed at you.  (Pause) I suppose I was doing then what I do lots of times when I'm saying something that I don't like saying.  And so if I say it fast enough and then run away from it, it's a little bit easier.  (Silence) The, the only other thought on being angry with you, that comes to my mind right now is something that came up when you had to cancel several times right around Christmas.  I suppose the feeling that again, you can cancel and not charge but if something happens so I have to cancel, that I'm still charged, is what bothers me.  Sort of, you have the freedom of action and not me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: There's another context in which that would apply too, that same feeling that you, you didn't mention anything about what I said at the end yesterday.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  That was funny because my first reaction when you said it was, uhm, that I should say something like, "Well, that's alright."  Or, something to reassure you I wasn't angry at you, which might mean — I didn't consciously feel angry.  I was disappointed but, uhm, maybe the fact that I felt I had to reassure you I wasn't, meant that I was.  Well, disappointed and frustrated.  (4-minute silence) Ah, after that, I began to think about, uhm, Tuesdays and how perhaps I could change things.  But immediately I began to think of a conference that I'm having next Tuesday with, uhm, the parents of one of the boys in my room, who's had well, he has emotional problems, I don't know how very serious they are.  His mother thinks they're very serious but I don't really know how serious they are.  And I don't, his parents are very pleasant but I don't really like dealing with them because I don't think they're very honest about things to themselves.  And so I was thinking of having this conference with annoyance.  And then I started thinking about, again, how it was when we were all jammed into a little hall together at dismissal time.  And suppose I was just kind of thinking of all the things that annoyed me, or do annoy me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: There's another part of it, in a certain sense, that you were thinking of these things to yourself.  You weren't saying them at the time they were occurring to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, again it's that feeling that there're some things that aren't appropriate to say here.  And just now it seems a little clearer what it is.  I don't feel at all uncomfortable in a way, I mean I might feel uncomfortable about the feelings or reactions that I talk about but that's the kind of thing that I feel I should be talking about.  And just sort of narrating an action, which was what, the visual effect in my mind was just sort of a series of actions going on at first and I just don't know how to go about even talking about them, except in referring to them as something I've already thought of.  I, I don't know whether it's because I'm thinking that you don't want to hear about how there was a group of boys here screaming and a group of boys there screaming and a teacher doing nothing and somebody else looking annoyed or whether I'll just feel silly, kind of, relating all these little things.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why wouldn't I want to hear it?  You made that point a number of times, this, about you feel you don't want say because I don't want to hear it.  Why wouldn't I?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I s—, the first reaction I had was that, well, they're all such small and stupid things to be thinking about.  And so, so then I would think, well who, well I don't want to be appearing stupid and silly and whatever else might be described, for having these thoughts.  And who else would want to hear things that I think of as being this way?  Except I don't really think of them as being that way because I think about them.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you do but you don't really.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well, there's something very confusing about it but I'm not sure exactly what it is.  (Pause) And it just occurred to me too that in talking about something that's more of an action than anything else, uhm, sort of in, in giving all the details of it, I'm thinking of it, well, it's not the general action, the general action is what's important and, or the general effect.  And so all these other little details really are inconsequential.  But, but then I think of the fact that whenever I'm doing anything or — well, I'm sort of jumping into thinking, now, of if I'm writing a paper or planning something out, I do give attention to all these little things.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Exactly.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Feeling I have to.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Right!  And, and you feel they're very important, quite the opposite feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But I think maybe I'm very frustrated at feeling that way since I sort of miss the main point by looking at specific things so closely.  And because I feel that way, perhaps that's what I'm transferring to you.  I don't know, I'm just aware when I, when I think of them, it's alright for me to think them but I don't want anybody else to know that I am because of, somehow they're not very worthwhile things to be thinking about.  (2-minute silence) I feel at the point now that all I'm going to do is just go around in circles on this.  (Silence) And I guess by saying that, I'm really saying that I'd like you to help me get off it some other way.  But I don't like to say that directly.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why not?  You want to ask me to help you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, what if you wouldn't?  Then —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Then what, what would happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, that's the ridiculous part.  I'd be right where I was before but except that —</p>

<p>ANALYST: But what?  See, I think that's what's missing.  You'd be angry with me.  Wouldn't you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I suppose so, although I think my initial reaction is sort of, well, feeling rejected.  And then because it makes me feel, thinking of feeling that way, makes me feel so awful, then I would, in turn, feel angry.  But then, this is the part that gets back to something that I was thinking about several weeks ago and I think talked about a little bit, on, well, it's still so confusing, I don't even know how to talk about it now.  But I mean, thinking, where did all this begin.  And it must have begun at a time when what I needed was much more simple than now.  And sort of, what, well, just I was wondering why it was that, if I wasn't getting enough love, I suppose, or attention, or whatever from my mother, what it was that would make me react by being angry.  Why wouldn't I just become — well, I did become submissive an unsure but I don't know, I can't quite believe that what happened was that I did react by becoming angry, unless I can see what was happening to make me become angry. (Pause)</p>

<p>And, and, and this is when I'm thinking in terms of being an infant.  And, well, I, I keep thinking all that an infant would feel if, if they aren't getting that kind of attention would be to feel very bewildered and lost and insecure.  And so I have to sort of believe that they'd also, or I would also as an infant, feel anger, that I would feel already so, well, I want to say strong as an individual.  That's not quite right but that I already am something enough so that I would be angry.  I don't know, I just am very confused about this.  (Pause) I guess what it is, is simply, I have to, I'm, I want to know why anger's such a basic emotion.  And I just can't accept that it is and go from there (pause) and sometimes when I think about this too in terms of, well, now little bit older children, but children around the age I teach and maybe a little bit younger than that, and of their having such a strong sense of themselves already — I mean, that you have to, to some, you have to feel anger — it just, it sort of appalls me sometimes when I think of what adults do to children, just, uhm, I think, unknowing of what they're doing but so totally not recognizing this aspect.</p>

<p>ANALYST: D—, did you have an incident in mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, it was just sort of a vague feeling that so many adults don't think of children as, well, I want to say, human beings.  But that's, until they're adults they're somehow not the thing that they are.  (Pause) And, well, I think of mainly just sort of the way adults are so dictatorial and the way I used to be and sometimes still am.  But, uhm, at least now I'm aware of what I'm doing when I am.  But before I used to just assume, well, of course, you'd be that way with children.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And that sort of brings us back full circle to the beginning when in effect —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You were feeling I was dictatorial.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Laughs) Oh, is that what I was feeling?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I mean, you didn't say that word but in fact that's what you were describing.  I can cancel and leave you and not — you can leave and I charge you and —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well, that's it because I —</p>

<p>ANALYST: You want to change an appointment and I say I can't and —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  Because I think underneath I was thinking, you can do it in a way that somehow I'm not considered in this way — well, except that the reverse isn't really true.  Because what I'm considering is that I'm paying for something that I'm not having.  And it's not really considering you.  Well, in a way it is.  There is, but that this element of considering somebody as having wants and needs and so forth is, I suppose, part of what was bothering me that you could cancel and I couldn't.  And then this whole problem of the way adults treat children or the way so many schools are run — (pause) and certainly the way I was brought up because it was all, as much as my parents, I think, tried to, or had some vague idea that they should be, they did have a little mold that we were all to fit into.  And, I don't know, I can, it just seems like I don't have a memory of being asked, "Well, what do you want?"  Although I'm sure I must have been.  But that was not a basic feeling in the family, to consider what the children wanted.  But I do have a definite feeling that that's one of the privileges of being an adult, to then be able to have what you want.</p>

<p>And I think particularly of choosing what to eat and what not to eat, since it was a very strict rule in our house that you had to eat everything.  And my father almost took malicious delight in giving you a bigger serving of something you'd announced you didn't want much of.  And I used to always feel it was so unjust that they didn't have to eat something if they didn't want.  Not that they did it very much but they did have that option and we didn't.  And even today, if we're having something that we don't like my father is very reluctant not to serve it to us.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...11-02 - Emma... [inaudible]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, what's going on good?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Most things. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Without getting into anything too specific.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My skin is bugging me this week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, what's going on with your skin this week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the guy put - now I have like all of my pores plugged... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but I'm still having like a lot of redness and irritation issues.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, yeah, I don't know. I've done a lot of online research and stuff like that and it doesn't really - I've been e-mailing a lot of doctors and they all tell me something different, and it's just kind of like a lot of them are saying that maybe I have rosacia  but I don't have regular rosacia.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So now I'm like getting worried - this is like what I do. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like, it was like a perfect example, because when I was at work today I was like starting to get really, really worried and like down about the possibility of it being something like that. And then I just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now what is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The rosacia?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. [nonverbal 'yes'?]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I just like jumped to the conclusion that I probably have... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hold on now. I guess - what, what is rosacia? I'm not familiar with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like, it's like rosacia - it's like most people without rosacia don't get it, but there is occasion where you can get the major without the regular rosacia. It's just like a constant inflammation of like your lid margins, and like the glands in your skin that are supposed to produce oil aren't producing as much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So you get like the constant like red look, with like the irritation and then everything else that comes along with it. And it's like chronic and it's not something that can be cured... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you just can treat it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So being me, I like immediately jumped to the conclusion, 'Well that's probably what it is. Nobody's going to be able to help me.' And then I like got like really bummed out about it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bummed out how?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just thinking, 'Okay, am I always going to be dealing with this red skin issue?' And, 'Is...' </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me see your arms. I don't... </p>

<p>PATIENT: They're - I put steroids on them so they're pretty good right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. That's why I say, I didn't see any redness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And actually I'm wondering about that now, because I have this leftover steroid from the last dermatologist, so I put a little bit in yesterday and today... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and that made it better. So maybe it is something like - I just need to go to the doctor again next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just one of those - dry skin, like this chronic condition that there's not a lot of studies done on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like everybody will literally tell you something different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that must be frustrating?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's really frustrating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean especially if you're going to the doctors who, they're supposed to be the experts... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...supposed to be able to let you know when you have this thing wrong with your body, really don't know what it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you go to people who you think should and they don't, I mean that's... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] And then I get cold sores every once in a while from stress.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Basically, if I ever have like a physical ailment and it's obvious, it just makes me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Upset?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...really self-conscious, and makes me not want to like do anything or see anybody. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [nonverbal 'yes'] Well, now when you say that, 'Well I'm happy.' - I mean, let me ask you this. What caused you to come here today, although you have issues with your skin and you have this cold sore, I mean, usually?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I want to get to a place where these things don't affect me the way they do now. Like I want to like just - I've had a lot - I almost have an attitude, 'Well if you don't like it and you just, if it's going to change the way you think about me, then oh, well...' [0:03:06.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: '...like I don't need you in my life anyway.' Then instead I try to like, I kind of tend to approach things like, 'Oh my gosh, everyone's going to see it and everybody's going to judge me, and maybe it's going to like turn people off from me or...' You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like that's kind of where I go with it. When I rather would be able to just tell myself, 'Who cares? This is not something you can control.' And, 'Move forward.' But instead, it just makes me like the opposite.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well were you at all concerned about how I would respond or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I feel like I need to tell people like, I have a cold sore on my lip... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I see it]. (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...so they don't wonder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I need to like let people know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Why do you think it was important to let me know that you had a cold sore?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Because I have like a big red sore above my lip (chuckling) that seems hideous (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I just feel comfortable. So instead of like having people wonder about it, just telling them. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well it's fine. (both chuckling) I can see you with a cold sore or no cold sore, red skin, no red skin. Okay. Okay. But I can imagine, just hearing you describe it, how overwhelming that would be to have to always be under the impression that you have to explain what's going on with your physical self... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...if something comes up or that fear of how people will look at you or judge you differently or whatever, based on some physical things that you don't have control over.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, just how...that would be for somebody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, and like when I was at work and I was doing the research, I almost got like a panic, like panic, like, 'Oh, no. Like this is how it's going to be forever and I'm always...'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: '...going to feel this way.' And I'll like talk to my sister about it or Jerry about it and they'll be like, they're like, "We don't notice the redness." Or, "We don't..." And just, "How can..." And I just think, I just think like I have like magnifying glasses on me on the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they just try to tell me like, "Nobody's looking at you like that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because if you wouldn't have said anything, I wouldn't have noticed it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like today it's good. I need to talk to him. It clearly is, must be an inflammation issue, where my body is just like inflamed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well your skin and your cold sore, I didn't really notice it until you... [overlapping voices at 0:05:05.6]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: See but I think like - you know what I mean? Like I am so hyper self-conscious that I think like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know, like, 'Everybody notices.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it's about how to use, begin seeing yourself maybe - I would say maybe in terms of how other people truly see you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or just the reality of the situation, rather than looking through magnifying glasses?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly. I think that's one of like my biggest problems. I just want to be like secure on the inside, so that like these things - well, so I can just be like, 'I can't control this.' Like, 'Why are you like...' Because I will search and do research until I drive myself crazy, and then I worry about it. And my sister today was like, "Why are you scouring the Internet?" She's like, "If you're looking for a problem, you're going to find it."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's like, "You need to stop doing this. And you need to just be patient and talk to your doctor." She's like, "I would have never thought you had this problem. I don't notice these things about you." She's like, "When you were younger, it was your weight and then it was your acne." And then it's like, she's like, "And then it was your teeth." She's like, "There's always something with you that you're obsessing about." And she's like, "When you go tonight you tell her that, here you are again with..." [0:06:09.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Obsessing, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "... another issue like this." [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like what your sister thinks or her influence on you is pretty strong? That you value?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. She just knows me really well...like, yeah, she just really knows me really well. So she can look at me a little more...she can look at me more objectively, obviously, than I can look at myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it seems like you value her perceptions of you or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just somebody that close to me, I do value. Like she'll tend to notice like patterns in my behavior or things like that, and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then for her to recommend that you come here and share that with me, and for you to follow-up with that, I think says... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...a lot. What do you think that's about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: From her end?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, no, from your end. From your - I mean, her telling you something or recommending that you do something, and your coming in here and actually following up on it. Like what, why? Why do you think you chose to do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I just get like caught up in things and I don't take time to like look at the whole situation. Where Dorothy will come in and just kind of like put it in perspective like. And I just value that and her opinion, because I do tend to get like overwhelmed by it, and like things that I'm worried about or - and I just try to - I tend to be more in the moment and like panic stricken about things sometimes. Where Dorothy will just come along and be like, "Hold on." Like, "Why are you freaking out?" Like calm me down a little bit. Just kind of like a voice of reason in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What does that panic look like, little forms of panic look like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I keep it to myself. I just get like - like today in my office when I was doing that research, I just like was busy at work but I was like involved in like finding this information. Because to me it's like, 'Oh, I know it's going to be the worse case scenario.' So I'm like panicking, like looking on the Internet, and like trying to find out everything I can about these things, and then like, just feeling like totally distracted. And like people would come in and try to talk to me, just to say hi, and I'm like totally like - just like in like a tunnel, like tunnel vision, just trying to like - and I just get like - and then I just worry myself. And I'm like, 'Why am I doing this?' But I feel like, 'The doctor can't help me. He doesn't - it's so inconclusive and every - and nobody knows, nobody says the same thing, so I need to find out as much as I can.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Did it take away from the work you were supposed to be doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It did a little bit today, and I'm like, now I'm going to go in early tomorrow, and I'm like, 'That was stupid.' (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well... </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't have the Internet at home and - I don't know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean that's good, because the last thing I need to do is go do anything else. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you'd probably be up all night and all sorts of things... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...at home? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So as she said, that you hold it all in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm not really like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I don't want - I don't really talk about it. I won't like - I mean most people I have like brought out my irritated skin to, think I'm like being ridiculous, so I don't. But it's like, it is - it is a matter of my skin not producing oil and it's causing all these other problems. And then it seems to me like most people don't want to hear about it anymore, because they... [0:08:59.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it seems like it's significant to you though... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and that makes it a big deal... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...even if other folks don't see it as a big deal. Like for instance, where you said to me about the cold sore being red, I may not see it as being red. But I think what's important is the way you see it and how you feel with it. So I mean if it's important to you, it's important for you to share...that I can see how...you will probably not engage in more discussions with people who...will minimize your feelings or minimize your experience.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I just tend to not talk about it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that familiar, at all, to feel like your feelings or your thoughts aren't important or aren't significant?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes. It's like kind of like, I think when I talked about it before, and like sometimes I think people just don't - in my experience in life, most people don't want to listen to other people. And most of the time I'm listening to other people talk. So, I've kind of just thrown it off as to being like human nature. People are just more inclined to focus on themselves, talk about themselves, and generally, not everyone, but most people don't want to listen to other people's issues. That's what I find.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you find that in our relationship or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in this room?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's important Emma. You know a big part of therapy and, is not only looking at the relationships and how they play out in your past or in your present, but also how they play out here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm wondering if you ever felt as though I wasn't listening to you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or whatever the case is? How would you address that do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if I thought you weren't listening to me, I wouldn't come here. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So pretty much I would just stop coming here. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would tell you I wasn't going to come... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and I would tell you why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean if I, if I felt like that, I...I wouldn't come. So, yeah, I definitely don't feel like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'm just not used to people like - I'm not used to people checking in on me to see if I'm all right. Like...like I've, like I've said, home - growing up was chaotic. There was never really having anybody asking you how your day was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty much I just did what I was supposed to do. Nobody really questioned what I was doing. I never really checked in with anybody, aside to say like where I was going. But other than that, I mean, I've just been pretty independent and haven't really had like - my mom will call in and check up on me, but I mean...most people - and my sister will, but I mean, other than that, I've just always - even when I was in college, I'd go...nobody was ever calling me to see how I was doing. So I just - I don't know. I just usually don't tell people how I'm doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And who were those people back then that you would've wanted to check up on you or to see how you were doing and checking up on you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would've been nice if my dad and my stepmom would check in more, and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...my uncle who passed away. My uncle who passed away was probably one of the best people about being involved in my life. He would always come to my soccer games when I was little, and he would come see me at school, and he would call me, and he would - I'd go on vacations with him. And...he just would always like... [0:12:12.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By yourself or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] Sometimes I would go down... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...when he was in Texas, I'd go there for like my spring breaks and just hang out with him and my aunt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is your - is this your dad's brother or your mom's brother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My mom's brother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mom's brother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, I mean, he was always the person that was always...whenever there was a birthday, he would always make sure the family got together for your birthday. Holidays where his big deal. I mean he just always - he was kind of like the hinge of the family, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now that he's gone, it 's kind of like a free-for-all in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he passed away in November?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] two years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, it will be, yeah, two years this May.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. How are you anticipating that anniversary, with it being a couple of weeks away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think after the - I think it will be harder this year. Because I think after the first year I was just happy that he was no longer suffering, because he had really like - he suffered for a really long time. So I think after the first year I was kind of like at peace with the idea, but I think I'm - I'm like less at peace with it now I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just makes me a little more emotional now than it used to. I think it's like, his loss has like really like set in now, you know? At first it was like, 'Well that's good for him that he's no longer here dealing with all this.' But now it's kind of like, 'Well now I miss him and I want him here.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Well that's interesting [isn't it though?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How long ago did he pass away? You said two - it will be two years in November?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Two years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And you mentioned that he was in a lot of pain? How did he die?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He died of various types of cancer, for about like nine months. And I went there pretty much every day and definitely saw him - he was at the teaching hospital for a while, so I'd go there every day after work. And, yeah, so for a very long time he was just slowly going downhill and not being able to do things and mentally starting to lose it and - so, yeah, it was like a really long process.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Where were you - I mean, were you there with him when he passed away or how did that... [overlapping voices at 0:14:05.9]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I actually was there the night before and then he passed away the next morning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Were you able to go to the funeral and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and process some (ph) things... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and all that stuff?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you able to at all share with him how you felt about him or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, we were very close.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. Well I can imagine how it must have been a significant loss for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (getting emotional) [nonverbal 'yes'] I always get emotional when I come here. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, this is like the place to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel being emotional in here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like it's kind of like embarrassing. I feel like embarrassed when I get emotional.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What would be embarrassing about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's like - it's not that I feel like I'm irrational. Mostly kind of like, just letting emotion out in general, is not like very comfortable for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I need to have like a specific reason why or, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think losing your grandfather, who was that close to you, is a specific enough reason to be emotional?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is. It's just letting tears go though, you know? I've just been feeling like emotional today, in general I think. (trying not to cry) [0:15:12.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, Emma.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some days I just feel like, again, I just don't feel like - it's funny, because like when I was here like a couple of weeks ago, I'm like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I was talking about how I'll have good weeks, and then I'll think, 'Well, I don't need to talk to anybody.' But then I get these days where I just feel like, not hopeless, but - hopeless is a bad word. (big sigh) Not in - almost like defeated in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh? Is this one of those weeks?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Do you want to share more about why you feel that way or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I've just been thinking a lot about, like all the years I had acne, I just felt like I didn't want anybody looking at me, and again, it's like this physicality thing. And now like, these issues with my skin, I just get these, this sunken feeling of, 'It's going to be another thing, like when I had acne, where it's going to just get worse and worse. And as time goes on it's only going to get worse and I'm just not wanting to like face anybody again.' And I just - that was a horrible time in my life and I feel like - I feel like I'm - it feels like I'm going there again in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I like had a really hard time then. I didn't want to do anything. My - I didn't - people noticed these things and people would say things and I would just like want to die.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People would say things like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: People would just point out the fact that I had bad skin. And it's just really hard to face people like that. And now I'm like, if my - it's like I'm 28, and most people who have my condition get it when they're in their 70's. (sniffing) I'm like, 'Is this just going to be something that gets worse and worse as time goes on?' And if it is, I don't know how I'm even going to handle that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is it, for you that life seems as though you're doomed for these things or that it has to get worse? Where do you think you've gotten that information or that message?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So before, it seems like before you think about these things improving... </p>

<p>PATIENT: (sniffing) Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or getting better... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't have acne now. (chuckling) And I thought back then it would never happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It seems like it, they'd have to get worse before...for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that like if somebody else had this or had acne, do you assume that it, it will, it's the worse thing for them or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did your grandfather see you physically or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He would never talk, comment about it. [0:18:14.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean he just never, it just was never an issue. It wasn't something...if I was like dressed for a nice occasion, he would tell me I looked nice. But I mean he never - it just wasn't something he focused on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was non issue... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...he didn't comment on mostly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I definitely think something has set in my mind that my physical appearance is going to determine how people think about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that message or that determination has come from where? [silence from 0:18:47.7 to 0:18:54.6] This idea that your physical appearance will determine how people will look at you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [silence from 0:18:58.0 to 0:19:03.2] (big sigh) I don't know. I just feel like people have just always felt free to like say things about how I looked and made, just always made it an issue as I was growing up. And now... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: These people are significant to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like my dad or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I mean that's what I meant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...just people in my classes, and just people have always pointed things out to me, and so I think like people are always looking at me like that. Like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could that at all interfere in though the way that they saw you? Or what they pointed out, did it interfere in the type of interaction they would have with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just would make me feel horrible and make me feel like just horrible about myself. It didn't necessarily change how they treated me. Just like, why would anybody go out of their way to say something to you about the way you look, in a negative way? Because then you just think, 'Well that's what - that's the first thing people notice about me then.' And I just want to like not care what people think about, along those lines, but I have a hard time doing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So rather, being obsessed or obsessive about different parts of yourself though, is if it's not - okay, so now that you've got your acne under control, your teeth are straight, now it's this other thing. Or it wasn't - it was your weight before and now it's something else. What do you think you'll move to after that, after your eyes are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hopefully nothing. Because I - yeah, I mean - it's funny. Because like the whole weight thing, like I've gotten over that, like I don't care if I have cellulite. It's like it just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, what helped you get over that do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sniffing) I don't know. I'm just happy with my weight. I just...I know ex - eating healthy makes me feel better. I know working out makes me feel better. So they're just things I do, and I feel like I have the whole weight thing like under control pretty much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because of the exercising again, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have cellulite?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And you're okay with that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't see how I could possibly ever get rid of it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So once you've determined it in your mind that, 'Okay. This is - that I actually really don't have control.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I won't like flaunt around in like underwear or like a bathing suit or anything like that but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I mean... [0:21:15.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I guess it does like inhibit me to a certain extent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what about in your relationship with Jerrry? And this may be a personal question, but are you all intimate sexually... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...at all? Okay. How, and does this inhibit the way you present yourself to him or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I definitely try to hide it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. How do you try and hide it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Not like turning around or like - you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like while I'm standing up, where I just try to make sure that it's not apparent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Are you able to be completely naked with him or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...do you have issues?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there's like certain things that you can do to like - I mean, I won't just stand up naked in front of him and like turn around or anything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. Okay. Has it at all, your cautiousness around your body or being particular about how you present yourself, has that interfered in your love making or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'no']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...has he noticed anything or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'no']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'no']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I definitely feel like I need to control my appearance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's like I'm confident. Am I a nice person? Yes. I am a - I know these things about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know my - I know I have a solid personality. And I'm not - it's just like, while I know I have a solid personality, I also, it's not that I don't value that, it's just like - I'm also like a fragile person at the same time. I feel like I'm like really fragile.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Fragile in what sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just let dumb things like this, like effect me 100 percent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So it's interesting, because in previous sessions you've...presented yourself as being a tough person, right? A tough person and now I'm hearing...this perception of yourself as being fragile.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think anybody would - but I wouldn't show - I wouldn't let - I wouldn't share that with anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There are just like things I internalize and I don't - don't talk about to people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like that could be a conflict, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On the inside you know your fragile things are affecting you and you're hurt about things, but you can't present that to the world. What is that like? Or do you experience a conflict about that or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like when I tell people close to me or like some of my friends that aren't as close that I'm talking to somebody, they just say like, "Wow. We would've never guessed that you have - you need to talk to somebody. You just seem like you're really together and that you are - you just have it all together." So that's just generally the - I mean generally, people's perception of me is a lot different than how I feel about myself or how I...view things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do you feel like you have to protect that part of yourself and not present that to others? [0:24:19.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit, because I think people wouldn't understand. I think people would think I was shallow, when I'm - I don't think I'm shallow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just think I have some sort of like dysmorphia (ph) about how I am, about how I look at myself and I don't think that's a matter of vanity. It's like I just want what I have to be as good as it can be or at least, like normal. And like if I feel better about the way I appear to the world, I feel more confident.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that's pretty normal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that is very normal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, when folks, some folks have a bad hair day...that can affect somebody's whole day, right? Because you - and but if you just get your hair done or whatever the case is, then there is a sense, a boost of confidence and...you can be up front or out front and be okay with yourself, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] I just think I let that really impact my confidence, negatively, too. But people, like you said, I have a tougher exterior, so nobody would know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do you feel a pull, like internal conflict of this tough exterior and this fragile inside or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'm just used to concealing it or something, where I don't really even notice it anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Has that become like a defense do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe. Maybe so. I'm scared to talk about it because I don't want people to think I'm vain or that I value appearance that much. It's just like - it's not even like, do I care if somebody thinks I'm pretty or not? No. I just want to like have normal - I want to look - I want to look, in what is in my eyes, normal for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is, in your eyes, normal for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it wasn't having acne, I mean, that was not normal for me. And big cold sores on my lip, that's not normal. And red, itchy, irritated body isn't normal for me. And I just want like those things to be in line, so that I can like feel more confident. It's not like I want everybody to like look at me and say, 'Oh, Emma's pretty.' I don't care about - in that extent I am tough, like I don't care about that. It's just like when I think about, again, like if I think about going throughout life, for the rest of my life, with progressively drier skin, because that seems to be what happens, that scares me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it just bums me out and depresses me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it makes me like think, 'Well, how am I going to do other things?' And I feel like it's going to hold me back in a big way and I like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what ways?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just overall like satisfaction with how I feel about myself, like I don't - I don't know if I'll ever be okay with having red, like...irritated skin. I don't know if I'll ever be okay with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if it's something that's treatable, like a steroid something, does that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That makes me happy. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's like good. But it's like just based on everything I've read, most things, your body develops an immunity to or you can't use steroids for like certain periods of time.. [0:27:21.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because it puts you at risk for melanoma, and there's just like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...there's a lot of like short fixes but there's nothing long-term and there's no cure. So, but like I read online, like other people going through this and they get depressed and upset about it, too, and they just think... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...nobody understands. Like people think, 'Oh, dry skin isn't a big deal.' And like but, it changes your lifestyle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I have to like scrub myself and I have to put creams on all the time and there's like certain things - I can't be in the wind. I can't - and it's just like I'm really young for it, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. That's why I heard you say it's in the 70's, when people start getting it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like a lot of people will get it over a certain - well 50, between 50 and 70, but I mean that's what my doctor said. He's like, "Wow. You're only 28 years old." And so then I'm like, "Great!" And I know it's like bad to like think of worse case scenarios, but that's what I was thinking about today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're going to go to the doctor next week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And when will it be, next week be though?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Friday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Friday? Okay. [I'm sure that will be fine.] (ph) Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, I don't know. But I shouldn't let something like that stand in my way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. On an intellectual level, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Because every time I think about things a lot like - well, if I think about things on an intellectual level... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...most things that I get upset about or I let get me down, then don't make sense, but emotionally they do what they do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say - well you said something earlier about, 'you don't want people to view you as vain', right? What would it mean if they did have that view of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would just be inaccurate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm - because it's like again, I'm not looking for perfection. I'm not looking for everybody to value my looks or anything like that. I'm not looking for that type of gratification. I'm just looking for - I don't want people looking at me and thinking, 'She looks weird.' Or, 'Why is she always red?' I don't want people like staring my imperfections down because like they're inflamed at the time or I have a growth on my lip that I can't control. I don't want people like judging me for these things and like, you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...making assumptions about me, about those things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Making assumptions about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's difficult to say what other people's assumptions about you are, especially when...you know who you are or you try to be this typical type of person or a particular type of person, and for people to still make their own assumptions, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that, too, but the worse is like how it makes me feel about myself more than anything. Like it makes me like not want to go do things because I feel really insecure about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it because of the reactions you would get from other people or just? Because you're saying on one hand that it's not about their reactions or their feelings within. On some level it seems like that is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well their reactions make me more insecure. I mean... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I already get the insecurity and then I just get more, it makes me - it makes me not like look people in the eye, when my skin's all red.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. [0:30:22.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like, I'm not looking for them to say, "Andrea has pretty skin." I'm looking for them to say nothing about my eyes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. To not even notice, where this would be a non issue?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think the only way for that to happen is like for me to get the situation under control. Like and I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you almost want them to see you for you, whatever you - the you is or - you know what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I just - I don't know. I think I do - I think I feel like a lot, maybe I don't give other people as much credit. Maybe, and maybe I - it's me projecting that I think they are all vain and that they're judging me for how I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. How do you understand projection? How would you say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Me, well that would make it that I was vain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I - it's just me projecting my own insecurities on other people... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and me interpreting how they're looking at me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...as being vain and like judging me. I just think basically, it just comes out of my own insecurities. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. So you feel insecure about yourself, and so you assume what other folks would notice... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[also, a way you don't feel?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or like my imperfections.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I should view - I'm 28, I should be better at blowing these things off. I just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who said that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Me. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel like I should just not care, and just not care if that people - I just don't know why I can't be more - I just don't know why I'm not more secure with myself and like okay with who I am and all that, da, da, entails, but I'm not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well it sounds like have started making some connections on last week, as far as - well in fact a couple of weeks before, it sounds like have made some connections on, perhaps why you are so insecure with your body or unable to...gladly accept compliments. You had mentioned a few things from past issues or from your past that may be playing themselves out in how you think about yourself and really feel about yourself now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you remember those things you mentioned or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well, we talked about not being able maybe - now just last week talked about issues around your dad... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and his vanity, and how he would criticize... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...your physical appearance. And it sounded as though your dad's opinion of you mattered a lot. But you couldn't really quite understand or figure out why he was so focused on your physical self...with comparison, in comparing you to Jennifer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Teresa. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was going to say Teresa.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm like, 'Wait, wait, wait a minute.' Yeah, Teresa... </p>

<p>PATIENT: And Jennifer, you're right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and Jennifer. Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I was thinking of some another somebody. Yeah, you're right. [0:33:21.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. Then Teresa and Jennifer, and not receiving a whole lot of praise and compliments as a kid from your parents, when would you be able to be - wouldn't be acceptable of them now, if you don't really - if you hadn't had practice in just...accepting one (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it really is like things that happened when you're younger like that, do carry themselves into adulthood?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Definitely. How, and how come do you understand that happens? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I sometimes think about things back then and I think, 'Well I think I would've worked through things by now.' You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like - I guess I just always had this expectation of myself to just get over things and move forward.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like maybe you maybe have had to do that in that period to survive?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know because if you would've - if, I mean realistically Emma, looking at that time period of your life in the way that I understand it and that you describe it to me, if you would've stopped to think about some of the pain and emotional pain, you were going through, in that house and in the chaos or whatever the case is, do you think you really would've been able to function in school the way that you had or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...looked out for your siblings the way that you had?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. You know our bodies, especially as children...we view (ph) them, this is why defenses are useful in a sense...because the defenses help guard you and protect you and let you continue to survive and move on, right? But although the defenses are up and we really don't allow ourselves that time to process what's really happened, we're really experiencing, it doesn't mean that we're not being affected by it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just that our mind is working in a way to help shield us or help us store it away, help us...put it to the side so that we can function on a day-to-day basis, right? But somehow those things still leave imprints on us... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and they can manifest themselves in the way we see ourselves or in our relationships or in our job performance or expectations of others. Those things still leave a mark and come out in some kind of way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, a common thought I've always had was like, when I was having acne I would think, 'Well I'll just be happier if this goes away. I'll be happier if this goes away. I'll be happier if my teeth are straighter. I'll be happier if I'm skinny. I'll be happier...' Now it's like, 'Well I'll probably be happier if my eyes are better.' It's like that hope (ph) thing again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then that's why I ask, what will be next? What else will make you happier?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just fill in the blank. So we have to figure out, why is it that where you are right now, why is that never good enough? You know because once that gets fixed or that gets cleared it seems like something else will come in its place... [0:36:21.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that will just reinforce this whole thing about, 'I'm not good enough.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, or, 'I'm not happy.' You know, 'This one thing will make me happier.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and like, 'Why am I letting these things hold me back? Like why?'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>PATIENT: 'And what are they...' Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What I came up with - I know we talked about coming up with some goals and having this product of things... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...right? And that's what it seems like I'm hearing from you Emma, too. Where you talked about last week of having to have a product, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like you've gone through a series of products in your life to help yourself feel better about whatever the situation is. You got braces. You...a product that's helped you...with your weight or with these, your eyes, it's always kind of a product, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes sense in a...in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, to help you feel better, feel whole, there has to be something out there... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that will take of this, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a part of our therapy we talk about having a product, maybe coming up with a treatment plan or something that we can work on together that could help you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But this type of product, hopefully, will - we're going to resolve some of these maybe past conflicts. And they weren't resolved... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...initially? So that you don't have to continue to live life searching out products that make you better or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it sounds good to me. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or keep coming up with other things you're not...that you can't settle with being good enough with yourself or whatever.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay? So I want to take the last few... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...minutes to just go over that with you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and get your input... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because what you think is very important. So this is...your work, you're paying for it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know and it's - and...I really want to make sure that we're - well I've got it over here - working together. And this is really small print, so I hope that's - I was trying to get it all on one page, so you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...didn't have it on two pages. But basically, the treatment plan is a list of, what are some target areas? And over the time that we've talked, over these last past five sessions, four or five sessions, list some things of some things that you may have wanted to work on. And then what I've done is come up with...looking at what those areas look like, and then coming up with maybe some long-term goals?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then some short-term objectives. And then the actual ways that we can work on those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, now this is something that's not set in stone. It can be changed. We will look at it, reevaluate where we are, and maybe add or take away or...those sorts of things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the first one, the biggest one that you talk about, is insecurity and low self-esteem, as an area that you maybe want to focus on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And these are some of the things that I listed that helped me come up with that conclusion. You know, the inability to accept compliments. Making the self-disparaging remarks...see yourself as unattractive, worthless or a burden and unimportant. And that's basically what you were, I thought... [0:39:25.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that you were sharing with me, especially with, you don't feel as though you can talk to certain people about what's going on because they wouldn't listen or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know, those sorts of things. And identify - inability to identify positive things in yourself. And I put that - and it's good to hear today that you can say, you know, 'I do have a solid personality. I know I'm a nice person.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, because prior to this session, I didn't really hear you confirm or affirm positive things in yourself. And I think, and I actually asked you at one point, and you really, it seemed like you really took some time to really - I mean, I think I asked you, why does Jerry like you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or what would make Jerry want to hang out with you? And it seemed like you struggled with coming up... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know, coming up with a list of things. So does that part... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...resonate with you at all?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So a long-term goal for us, is to elevate self-esteem and really work on establishing this inward sense of self-confidence... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and worth and realize that you are an important person, significant or a good person or whatever... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...those things are. Okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And then just a short-term objective, increase insight into the historical and current sources of your low self-esteem or insecurity. And that's when we talk about, talking about these historical events, historicals (ph) have in your life that may have left these imprints on why you devalue yourself at some times or why you have an increased preoccupation about your physical self.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So again, I would talk about maybe your dad's issues or how your dad related to you, how your mom related to you, and I guess, stepdad related to you...how kids at school related to your physical self... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...if that's what you think is the...one of the sources. And then we put down here, as I'm thinking about it, not just your low self-esteem, but today you talked about like preoccupation, preoccupation that you have with your physical self.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [silence from 0:41:39.7 to 0:41:50.0] And, okay. We have some interventions that I thought about and to help you become aware of your fear of rejection and its connection with past rejection or of, may (ph) have been experiences.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, then talk about this idea that, if people see you and see this, then somehow...they'll make some kind of comment maybe that has some sort...that fear of losing them or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...the - then we talk about Jerry and this new relationship, how these insecurity issues may push him away if you... [0:42:26.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (emotional) This is really good. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You're crying again. What's going on with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like - well, this is really accurate, surprising you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Surprising?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (crying and chuckling) It's like you're totally, like you're 100 percent accurate. It's just like almost a relief, you know, to like see this. Well I think you've actually, like somebody's like heard me for once, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because you're the one who shared all this. I wouldn't have been able to... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like really amazing that - it's just like totally amazing that you, that somebody who doesn't know me though, like was able to listen to me and was able to like come up with something so accurate, you know? It's awesome. (sniffing) Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm like a wreck today. (crying and chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Now what is like - why is it that you you're a - why do you perceive that as being a wreck Emma?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying and chuckling) I don't know. (sniffing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sharing your feelings, sharing your appreciation or sharing this idea that you feel finally understood and finally heard and you have emotions, why is that a wreck?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (crying and chuckling) I don't know. I don't know. It's, obviously I'm just not comfortable sharing emotion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because - I know and that makes sense, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's why I'm trying to challenge that a little bit... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...to help you see. Because when I think of wreck, I think of... </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...disaster. I think of chaos. I think of people being hurt or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...turmoil.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was a bad adjective. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who (ph) - but it's an adjective that sounds like it's real to you, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sniffing) [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of how you connect experiencing emotion, not just experiencing it but sharing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's no wreck in this room. There is not - and it may feel that way... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know? But what you're doing is healthy... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...to be able to share yourself and share what you feel like and have emotion connected to it. That's a very healthy, human... </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) (sniffing) Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Crying's helping process.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay? Yeah. I mean I'm...and with that kind of stuff I think. But...I mean that's important and that's totally... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...understandable that you would have that emotional reaction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sniffing) Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay? Now is there anything you would add to this section up here that you want to see or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, I think that's really good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's really good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. One question I would - that came up as I was writing this, when I thought about the second incident - I mean the second intervention I have down here is, help you interpret incidents of abuse and how they impacted your feelings about yourself. And I know on the forms you completed, you mentioned emotional abuse, and I wanted to ask you, has there ever been any sexual abuse... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'no']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or anything like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. [0:45:26.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Because that's, you know... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because with females that's... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...very common, so I just typically ask.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. The other area was the family conflict. And you talk about long periods of non communication with your parents. And I'm not sure how much you wanted to work on that in here. Some of the things that I'm thinking about is, just resolving that fear of rejection, low self-esteem, kind of like what we talked about up here... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that developed in your family. (phone ringing) You know and understanding how it connects to...what's going on with them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is this because you're going away? (chuckling) Because we can - (phone ringing) do you want to talk about the home I came... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give me a minute. (answering phone - Hi, this is Betty.) [audio blip at 0:46:10.2 to 0:46:16.8] If you like we can... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...talk about this. But just look it over. You can take a little bit of it over with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look it over on your own and come back and we can talk about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I thought maybe at some point, later on down the road, even if it's in letter writing, like...sharing with your parents how you truly feel about some things, if you want to do that. Or maybe if they were interested in coming in for a session, where you could actually go through and have a discussion with them...I'd be willing to facilitate something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know but just look at this, take a look at it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if there's any area that you think is important that isn't listed here, outside of insecurity, family conflict and child trauma, let me know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it goes - or ways that you think you can be helped better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. This is great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And now I'm - [when I write I'm able to specific] (ph) area and I kind of play around with it. So for the weekend it's just the preoccupation and obsessiveness about physical self.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sounds good. Sounds really good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And if it doesn't you let me know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I will.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Because it's totally okay. This is a, like I said, working backwards... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and then come up with together, so, Do you want to come back next week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Please.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That is the 9th. I can't believe it's... [overlapping voices at 0:47:41.6] ...already.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I know. Oh, the snow was kind of rough on the way home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) It came down pretty fast but then it melted really fast, which is good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Do you like winter or no?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's okay. I don't like February. February is like the worst month.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just cold and it's like, just your holidays in November and December. (chuckling) Do you like winter?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (making noise) Well maybe, I think it's I just don't like driving in it... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Me neither.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and the fact that... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know, go through winter without driving on the icy roads, I'd love it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Me, too. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I like the holiday season and I think so. So... [inaudible at 0:48:16.5] ...Andrea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I will see you next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You have a good week and that (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Take care.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go over ever aspect of this thing (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Bye-bye. [0:48:28.5]</p>

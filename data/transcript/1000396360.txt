<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute Silence) Well, the (clears throat) first thing I thought
when I came in, I, uhm, I don't know, I (sighs) I feel sort of silly, I
guess, thinking that I'm ha—, it was sort of imagining something, and,
uhm, it occurred because of the odor I noticed in here which made me think
of cat urine.  And so then I began imagining that somehow, which I knew
must be impossible, cats had gotten in here and urinated on the couch.  And
then I had to lie in it.  And the other thing I was thinking it might be,
which seemed more likely, was somehow the wool or whatever the material is
on the couch had gotten damp or, I mean it had that kind of a smell, too,
of damp material.  And, uhm, well, I went into thinking about cats having
urinated on it rather than, I guess, thinking of maybe somebody had been on
it right before me and what they might have done.  I don't know whether,
uhm —</p>

<p>(Pause) Well, I was trying to think — because I, I thought of the
cats immediately — what I would have thought somebody before me might have
done.  And, uhm, it seemed to me I had mostly the idea of sweating
profusely, so that it would make the material damp.  Uhm, (pause, sighs)
because then, then the idea that comes into my mind now, which it didn't
consciously anyway when I first was thinking of this, uhm, is that
sometimes when we are making love, MSCZ will sweat a lot.  And, so maybe
there's some connection there.</p>

<p>And I, and I also had the feeling that — well, I don't know what I
would have done if I'd thought of that earlier — but (clears throat) I
almost have, I have this kind of feeling I don't want it to lead into that
kind of thinking.  And, uhm, almost if I'd realized I wou—, I might not
have mentioned having this idea at all.  Although I think if I'd thought it
I would have.  But, uhm, (pause, sighs) I don't know, the, the, uhm, still
feel so stuck there.  And the thing I thought next and, and I just thought
of it again, uhm, was this feeling that I'd — I m—, I think I mentioned
it yesterday but I was having it again today — of, of, uhm, well, well,
today it was more almost feeling a kind of panic in a way.  Uhm, because I
was thinking somewhat about yesterday and was finding it — probably partly
because I wasn't really just sitting down and concentrating, or lying down
as I do here and concentrating.  And at home, when I was thinking of it I
was doing something that involved my concentration to some extent.  So and,
and I didn't stop and try to recall.  But I was just, it just seemed to me
that yesterday was just, uhm, things I felt I was understanding yesterday
were just vague enough, or, uhm, out of my reach enough so that I was
losing it.  And, and, and just the feeling that I have to be coming here in
order not to lose it.  And then, that I won't be coming after this week. 
And, uhm, I guess it must be tied in with that feeling that if something
doesn't happen before the end of the week, it'll be too late.</p>

<p>But then I remember also thinking, which seems like a contradiction,
that, uhm, I won't continue to do certain things in the fall.  Or at least
it seems like part of my doing them now is connected with, uhm, I guess
testing you to see if you'll accept me back in the fall.  And then it won't
be necessary to do them.  Well, I don't really know how true that is but I
don't know somehow anyway, I have this feeling I'm on the edge of
something.  And if I don't get off the edge by the end of the week then I'll never get off it.  But I know I've had that feeling before, I mean
that sometimes I think I've had it just over a weekend, you know, having a
weekend coming up and thinking I can't not come between Friday and Monday. 
(2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Z,,,,, just now I was thinking about that room I'm redoing and I'm
almost finished now.  And, uhm, but I was thinking about a bedspread that
I'd bought when we were in PTN last, that I was somewhat uncertain of.  We,
we went to a store that has quite lovely fabrics and then she had some uhm,
well it's not a madras but it's, I think, an Indian type of material, uhm,
that, that were fairly inexpensive.  And I got one that I thought was very
pretty and might go in the room.  But now I was just thinking about it and
thinking it really doesn't and, or at least I'm less certain.  So I was
thinking about returning it.  And then it just, I don't know, it struck me
again, here I've just been saying something about feeling very strongly
about getting off the edge of some understanding and then I go and think
about what essentially is getting me into PTN.  (Pause, sighs)</p>

<p>Well, I, I was just remembering some things from yesterday.  And I
guess I was wondering, I started by wondering what in particular I'd been
trying to think about when I got that feeling that I mentioned.  And, uhm,
well, I'm not sure.  (Pause) Well no, maybe now I think maybe it was this,
that I just thought of, remembered this: that I was concerned with the
question of, and I think at the end, uhm, about that feeling I'd had when I
thought about not being able to share.  Mainly th—, it was then that
thought that had come to my mind.  And, uhm, I don't know, it seems to me
yesterday I was trying to separate that feeling of not being able to share
or else I was trying to, uhm, uhm, I don't know, somehow I was, there was
something that didn't seem completely clear to me and that I thought should
have been.  And I mean, it was to do with the feeling I couldn't share and
how antagonistic I guess it was that, that I decided I couldn't.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But, but that, that is a very specific thing, too, that I was
questioning yesterday.  And I think when I thought of it today there was
some,, something that I guess, maybe in my unconsciousness, I had been
pulling together of all the things yesterday.  And, and I didn't feel I was
quite getting it.  And now I f— don't feel I have it at all.  I keep
remembering little pieces of yesterday.  What I just recalled now was uhm,
your, your pointing out the way I was tr— handling you, I guess it would
be yesterday or maybe, uhm, for a long time recently — you thought must be
similar to what, the way I treated MSCZ.  And, uhm — (Silence)</p>

<p>Well I, I go back to that que—, the, the feeling I have some question
about, uhm, well, sp— I mean just generally, I guess, about my inability
to share and then specifically, uhm, that night when I thought of, I, I
think it was uhm, well, it had to do with my wanting you to accept me back
and sort of maybe I was being antagonistic to test you out and so forth. 
And, uhm, I don't know, just now it seems to me maybe two things were going
on and this is, maybe, what's been bothering me.  Because I keep trying to
make it one thing.  Because I think maybe when I thought of it, I, I had
this initial feeling of, uhm, "You probably realize it but I'll share the
fact I know it now, or thought of it, with you."  And then somehow I thinK I stopped that feeling of, of, that was the initial one of sharing.  And, I
don't know, somehow it seems like that, uhm, well I suppose it can't be
really separate, but it was a different thing from my, uhm, forgetting what
I'd remembered and using it in the way I did.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I, I kee-, I think I wonder because I think maybe I was
wondering this yesterday too, if, if I'm trying to separate the two
because, uhm, there, there might be something if I don't, that I don't want
to see.  I mean, somehow I guess it seems — I don't, I don't — uhm, maybe
I'm, I'm getting too tangled up in this but somehow, anyway, it seems like
there'd be something too antagonistic and, uhm, very consciously turning
off this feeling of sharing and, uhm, then going into the tactics that I
did.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, maybe we could, uhm, go back to something specific that you
started out with today.  In effect, what it sounds like is, you're saying
my place here stinks.  And then you become rather vague about these other
issues (pause) because the fact is that you are, uhm, being antagonistic,
or whatever you want to call it, in a whole lot of different ways.  One,
another way to summarize what you've been saying is that I don't have any
effect on you, that you can't remember things I say.  But on the other hand
you threaten me by saying if you don't really break through this before the
end of the week all is lost.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I gu—, the question I have immediately is whether or,
or not — if it's threatening or asking.  And it's sort of asking you
despite everything I'm doing.  Uhm, sort of overcome —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupts) Yeah, to kind of break through.  You are excited in the
movie "Frenzy".  You had been talking Sunday evening about the women of
Bangladesh.  The man in the movie was a big challenge, and you ask me to
break through.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   The fantasy behind this seems rather clear.  It's been consistent. 
You are acting in a way to provoke me to have to really forcefully attack
you, kind of mentally rape you, make you do what you want to do.  And your
fantasy in the movie was that, uh, that would give you an occasion to
really fight back.  And it's the details of that fighting that I put into
words and you said yes, that's true and you have avoided it ever since.  So
you keep, in one way or another, by your behavior, inviting me to, as you
say, break through, to rape you, to attack you, then you'll have an
occasion to fight back and kick me in the groin and destroy me.  And it's
this kind of a fantasy behind all the things that you're doing, I think. 
And now you're saying, you haven't got much more time.  I, if I'm going to
do it I've got to do it this week.  Ah, in a way this is very similar to
the way you've behaved toward MSCZ for years.  It's been a constant
invitation to him to have to force you, sexually and many other ways, to
have to break through this barrier you put up.  For a long time you felt
you always had to have a fight with him.  You even set up your wedding
night so that he would, in fact if he did anything sexual, be, in your eyes, raping you.  This is an old idea that you are now, in many ways,
really br— living here in indirect form.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well (sighs), I'm having trouble with one, I mean I do see what you've
just said but, uhm, I don't know, maybe this is just quibbling but I keep
thinking of the fact that in the movie, or when I was thinking about the
movie and that the man in it — and imagining fighting him — it was very
much of fighting him — and, and being the victor, so to speak and, uhm,
overcoming him or destroying him or whatever word to use.  And, uhm, if I
think of all the times or just, I mean I can't think of all the times but I
just think of times that, uhm, I've set up things so MSCZ has to fight me
or force me, uhm, well, I, I don't, I suppose they don't all fall into this
— but it seems like half the time, anyway, or many of the times I'm
wanting, I want him to be in a position where he has to force me but then I
want to be overcome.  I want to fight some but then I want him to be
stronger.  And, I don't know, because it, I mean it's just a matter of my
wishing it here — but it seems like it's the same kind of thing, that,
uhm, I mean I, clearly I am saying, "Force me to understand things that I'm
resisting understanding."  But, uhm, but then, I don't know, it seems like
I'll fight for a while but then I want you to overcome me and that I will
understand.  And so, I don't, it just seems like it, th—, with you and
MSCZ it's somewhat different from that fantasy wi—, about the movie.  And,
uhm, well, if they're really similar things I don't know why I feel there's
a difference.  Well, the, the thought then comes to me, unless the reason I
feel there's a difference is because you and MSCZ are real people that I'm
really fighting with.  And, uhm, it wouldn't be safe to carry thoughts
about that to the extreme that I carry over something that's pure fantasy. 
(Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was just thinking of, uhm, (sighs) well, setting up things so
that MSCZ has to fight me.  And, uhm, you know, I guess just wondering,
what, what I've just said too.  Ah, because sometimes things that I'm
forcing him to force me to do, uhm, I don't know, are things to do with
what I am and how I dress and so forth.  And I know sometimes I thought of
it that I'm not the kind of person MSCZ wants me to be.  And, uhm, I don't
know, sort of he's not accepting me for what I am.  He's trying to make me
into being something else.  But then it does seem — well, I mean that's,
maybe this is just because I'm in this kind of a frame of mind that I do it
with other things too, that don't really apply in quite the same way.  But
it seems often something I want, I would work it around so that he's
forcing me to have it, or get it, or do it, or, uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What strikes me about eh, the way you're reacting to what I said is
how nonspecific the things you're thinking are.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence, sighs, stutters) Well, this next thought, uhm, came out of
somehow wondering why I would be nonspecific because it would seem like
there'd be plenty I could be specific on.  And, uhm, I guess I thought, I
thought initially, well, it must be again because I feel safer in being
nonspecific or, uhm, easier or something.  And (sighs), uhm, then, then I,
I guess I thought well, what am I not thinking by not being specific?  And,
uhm, the thought came to my mind, which doesn't seem really connected with anything that I can think of specifically, but, uhm, that if I did, I'd
come to the conclusion that, uhm, h— how to put this?  Uhm, I, I don't
know, because I was thinking about this feeling of wanting to, to be
forced, to the end of something that I might want anyway.  And, I don't, it
has something to do with, anyway, feeling that maybe what I'm avoiding is
this feeling of wanting to be, I don't know, sort of already having
destroyed the two of you.  Or, uhm, I don't even need to have you around to
fight or to force me because I can do it on my own.  But then it's, it's
very much an idea of having already gotten rid of you, so to speak, and,
uhm, and it made me then think of how sometimes I'll feel when MSCZ doesn't
come home either because he's away on a business trip or because he's
working very late at the office.  And, uhm, I don'—, it's almost as if I'm
fantasizing that it's actually happened then.</p>

<p>And also I've been very, uhm, well, interest isn't quite it, but drawn
to thinking about the fact that my mother has been spending so much time in
PBD alone while my father's, father's in PNOTS.  And, uhm, I mean I keep
interpreting it other than that she's simply doing things that have to be
done before they move in.  Because I keep thinking of it that she really
prefers that and she feels freed by being up there alone.  But she has this
excuse so that it won't appear to be what it actually is.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, well, this is of course, what you're really thinking about. 
You see, you say you can't understand the difference between what you want
from MSCZ and I and what you wanted to do to that guy in the movie.  Well
the difference is very simple: what you eh, avoid is carrying your
fantasies about MSCZ and me to this conclusion, the one you just arrived
at, that in fact you have gotten rid of both of us and destroyed us,
(sighs) just wiped us out.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, then I was just thinking back, I was still sort of puzzling
over, the, because I think is, I really have often had the feeling with
MSCZ — uhm, and it might even be something like just I'm sort of sitting
around, although this has happened less lately — that I might be just
sitting around, uhm, oh, like on a Sunday reading the newspaper and if I
spent the whole day just kind of sitting around doing nothing and not
getting dressed, I wouldn't feel good at the end of the day but I might do
it except that MSCZ doesn't like doing that kind of thing.  And, and
instead of because I know that, getting dressed I would wait until he had
to nag at me and, I mean in a sense, set up a fight over it.  And then I
would do it and it would be, the end result would be something that, uhm,
even though we'd fought to get there, was one I really kind of wanted. 
And, so then I was just thinking now maybe I often set up that kind of
fighting because I couldn't really, because again, I mean if I wanted the
end result then I knew I'd, I would not do what I was afraid I might do if,
if I really were fighting over something that, uhm, that was really a
fight.  I mean, those things aren't really a fight.  Because well, I don't
know, I'm just thin— because I'm setting it up so somehow it's not the
same thing.  The, the, uh, issue that's really important to me is not at
stake.  I guess that's it.</p>

<p>But then I don't know, it seems like by doing that then, uhm, it makes
it easier to keep under control the thing that I'm afraid might not stay
under control, of fighting over something that really is at stake and which
would be in the end destroying MSCZ.  And, uhm — (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, the thing I'm thinking now, I, uhm, I can see it could be
interpreted two ways.  And I'm not sure, uhm, (sighs) but something led me
to, uhm, think back to what you had said that got, got us started on
thinking about these things, or me started, uhm, in the way that I am right
now.  And, I don't know, it's as if I'm, what I'm trying to do is replay
exactly what you said and then everything that's been said since then uhm,
as if it's a recording in my mind so that when I leave here I'll have it. 
And if I can't do that then I won't have it when I leave here.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, what does recording bring to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, that you'll have a recording.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't know, I mean there must be something more but I didn't
get further than that you would and I won't.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What's the connection between thinking of I have a recording and
your destroying me?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I mean, when I think of your having it and I won't I, I also
think of your having a penis and I don't.  But, I don't really see — I
mean I know sometime — well, uhm, (sighs) well, I mean, I think, well,
then maybe it means that I'm feeling you have control and I don't.  Except
somehow I don't quite see how in this particular instance that would work
that way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I don't know if I — because I just started thinking about part
of what I was thinking when — I'm not sure I said this uhm, because it
might have been something I was going to say after I talked about the
feeling that I wanted to take away a recording.  But, uhm, when, when I was
beginning to think all this I was wondering am I just feeling this kind of
feeling that — uhm, will I be able to hang on to what I've just been
thinking about, or was I really trying to say to you, even though I've just
been thinking about it I'm already forgetting it and, uhm, it hasn't really
made that much of an impression on me, or something like that.  And I'm not
sure because the feeling I had when I was thinking of it, was really trying
hard to recall everything that was said and, and, uhm, sort of get a mental
recording and, uhm, yet why would I suddenly think that in the middle of
thinking what I was?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, the recording for you is equivalent to — it's my penis.  I
have it and you don't and you want it.  And that's what the fight is about. 
That's what you want to get revenge for.  That's why you're trying to
defeat me, frustrate me.  That's what you want to do to the guy in the movie, it's what you'd like to do to MSCZ.  That's why you're thinking
this.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, I don't know, I mean maybe I'm doing just what we were
talking about in, in wanting to set it up so that then I could fight you
but I'm feeling I guess very resistant to, uhm, not everything that you
just said but, but the, uhm, the fa— connecting my wanting a recording or,
or trying to, to get what seems to me is like a mental recording of what
was just said here.  Uhm, and connecting that with why — my wanting your
penis.  And, uhm, I mean I know I did too, in that I, if I thought you have
the recording and I don't then it did occur to me immediately, well, you
have a penis and I don't.  But I still feel very resistant to thinking I've
made an equivalent of your penis and the recording.  Because it just seems
ridiculous.  I mean there doesn't seem to be any possible comparison that,
in that the recording isn't anything.  And of course then, then it, I, I
think well, maybe what's happening is, uhm, once you've exposed what I've
made a substitute right just this minute, uhm, for what I really want, then
it clearly is not what I really want.  I mean the substitute — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

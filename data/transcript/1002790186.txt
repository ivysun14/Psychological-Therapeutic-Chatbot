<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.</p>

<p>Dr. Harold Greenwald (1910 - 1999) was born on July 28, 1910, in Manhattan. In 1956, while in his mid-40's, Dr. Greenwald earned a doctorate from Columbia University. Despite his late start, he quickly gained prominence in psychoanalytic circles as a leading student of the Freud disciple Theodore Reik. He became president of the Freudian-leaning National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis early in his career, but later turned his attention to cognitive therapy.</p>

<p>He is credited with the development of direct decision therapy, a derivative of rational emotive behavior therapy. In his teachings of direct decision therapy, Dr. Greenwald specifically addressed the decisions people make. He saw all psychological problems as a result of decisions people have made.</p>

<p>Dr. Greenwald taught at Hofstra University, in 1968 and 1969, and at the University of Bergen in Norway as a Visiting Fulbright Fellow. He also taught at United States International University in San Diego and became a Distinguished Professor there in 1975. He served as president of the Academy of Psychologists in Marital and Family Therapy and as president of the division of Humanistic Psychology of the American Psychological Association.</p>

<p>Dr. Greenwald wrote numerous books during his career, including "Great Cases in Psychoanalysis" (1969), "Emotional Maturity in Love and Marriage," with Lucy Freeman (1961), "The Sex-Life Letters," with his wife, Ruth Greenwald, (1972), "Active Psychotherapy" (1974), "Direct Decision Therapy" (1974) and "The Happy Person" (1984).</p>

<p>This is an interview of a patient in therapy conducted by Dr. Harold Greenwald of New York, New York.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought when you called the other day did you mean that you had a special crisis today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I wrote you that letter I told you I wasn't going to come here any more, but I had to see you one more time. I just had to see you. I don't know why I was coming. I don't know what you need me for. I'm so boring, and demanding, and you're too busy. You're always so busy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. What would you like me to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I'd like you to do. I can't have what I want. [0:01:03.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want you to love me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think about you all the time. You're the only one I do think about. I write letters to you. I didn't even know what love was about until I met you. I couldn't even say I love you to my husband or my sons or anything until I knew you. Now I know it. I have to go away. I mean what am I coming here for anymore? I mean what's the program? I got rid of the claustrophobia. I can ride on the subways now. I got a job. I'm teaching. I'm successful. I didn't tell you. Something very good happened to me this week they offered me a scholarship to go on to college. So what am I coming here for? [0:02:14.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what are you coming for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm not going to come back anymore. This is the last time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're making it sound as if everything is going well with you and yet you're voice sounds as if everything is terrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't want to say goodbye to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you don't have say goodbye with me just because you get well. I like helping patients.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're just fooling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not fooling at all. Remember when you had the claustrophobia and all these other difficulties, who needs it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't have that anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. So what you seem to be asking for is that we develop some new problem that you can work on? [0:03:03.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have plenty of problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't hear any.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't look at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Where would you like me to look?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just don't look at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Where should I look? I have no objections (inaudible at 0:03:15.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm so ugly. I can't stand to have you look at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know how ugly you are even if I don't look at you. (chuckles) I remember how ugly you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know that's the kind of thing you say that just upsets me so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I have to upset you. If I don't upset you, you won't come anymore. You'll get well and you'll leave me. I don't want you to leave me yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to leave you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did I tell you to leave? I'm sorry I looked at you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can't go on. I can't go on loving you this way it's too upsetting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. I have an idea. Tell me how I can behave so that you can hate me. If you hated me, would it be just as upsetting? [0:04:10.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I think you can read my mind. I do hate you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the nicest you said to me in a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You ruined this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's great that you're able to tell me you hate me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have been wanting to tell you this, but I can't tell you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Don't. When you're ready, you'll tell me. There's no rush. We've got years ahead of us. And the longer you find it difficult to tell me things, the longer we can stay together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't look at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm looking past you. I'll be glad to run the session the way you like. All right. I think the mistake I've been making up till now is I haven't been listening to you enough and doing what you would like me to do. You know you've heard me say this many times, I've said this in public, I've written this, I believe that the patient knows best how she should be treated, and I haven't been listening to you enough. How do you suggest I treat you so that you don't find it so painful to come and you don't have to suffer as much as you do? What can I do? [0:05:37.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You do listen to me. You do listen to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, but I'm not treating you properly. If I did you wouldn't have to leave. Obviously, I'm doing something terribly wrong. You're being very kind and you won't tell me this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not being kind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're being extremely kind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, you're the one who's kind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. If I was treating you properly, you wouldn't be suffering so. You wouldn't have to leave. I must be doing something wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just that if I stay I have to tell you something. [0:06:07.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No rush. Don't tell me anything until you feel ready to tell it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm afraid to tell you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well then don't tell me. Just tell me when you're ready. Have I ever I tried to force you to tell me anything? I would be interested. Don't tell me this but I'd be very curious to know why you're afraid to tell me what it is that you're?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because you'll hate me and you won't love me anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then I won't love you anymore?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have I said that I love you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe I hate you already. Suppose I hated you, would it be easier for you to tell me the truth?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. So how are you going to behave to make me hate you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I already behave that way. I'm demanding. I don't pay you enough money. I know I don't pay you as much as the other patients do. I call you on the telephone all the time. I can tell you're busy, but you take the time out to talk to me. I'm boring. I don't think anything. I don't know anything. I'm stupid. [0:07:16.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that makes it a very restful change from my other patients they're all intelligent, who don't call me, who pay me a lot of money. It's a relief to have somebody like you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You say those things. I don't know what to do with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. You make me feel like?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I can tell you. Oh, I'll try to tell you. I'll try. You see it's like there's things about you that I think that aren't nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're being kind again. There's things about me that are lousy. [0:08:08.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're terrible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Now you're being truthful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean you're sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you're insincere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you say things that aren't nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I want you to be? And the other night when I called you I thought you were drunk and then I said to myself, oh my God, my own mother was sick and now I've got another mother who's sick. I don't need that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are some of the terrible things like that? Is this what you were afraid to tell me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's part of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean that I'm sick.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you drink. Yeah, I think you're sick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You see you said you're stupid, yet most of the other patients haven't realized how sick I am. I think that's great. As a matter of fact, if you must know, one of the reasons why I kept you at a lower fee, and why I like your telephone calls, and so on, because I think that you might be able to help me because you've helped me already. [0:09:14.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You saying things like that, that's part of what I can't stand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you talking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How I can help you huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By telling me that I come across sick.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't help you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, look at me. I mean my whole thing is to get to be like you and I can't. I get so hopeless.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Get to be sick and drunkard like me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I hope you're not sick. I hope you don't drink. Do you drink?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not crazy. You're not crazy in that way. You're crazy in other ways. You know what's going on. If you see me as sick, you must recognize a certain sickness in my, and I wish you'd tell me what it is. I think you can help me with it. Would you want to help me if you could?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're making me very nervous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The more nervous you are the longer you'll stay here. So let's not worry about that. At least?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't stand it when you say those things to me. [0:10:02.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look, if you get well you leave me right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you remain nervous, then you stay here. So when I make you nervous, I'm showing you how much I care for you. Look, there's one way in which I'd like you're help very much, and I'm completely sincere at this moment, and I think you'll know how sincere I am when I explain the help I want. There are many things about you that are extremely puzzling to me. I'd like you to make me into a better therapist for you. Now you can do this. Nobody else in the world can do this. It happens, and incidentally I'll be a better therapist for other people but never mind them. I want you to make me into the best possible therapist for you. In order to do that, I need you to tell me how to treat you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean it? [0:11:00.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well first of all why don't you ever ask me why I'm sitting on the edge of this seat? I'm very uncomfortable. You never think about me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know I've noticed this many times, but I always was concerned it would make you more self conscious. I thought I could get it over by my sitting back comfortably and relaxing and I thought that maybe you'd pick that up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I try to be like you all the time. I can't do it. I mean I'm trying. I can't catch up with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you think I should ask you questions like that? Incidentally why do you sit on the edge of the chair?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the chair's uncomfortable and my feet don't stretch all the way to the ground if I sit back but my back hurts. I go out of here, I'm exhausted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You know I got the lousiest chairs in New York. Some son of a bitch sold me these chairs six months ago and since then everybody's been complaining about them and I haven't had the time and the sense to go and get another pair. I think you've made a very good suggestion. [0:12:02.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everybody complains about them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They don't directly complain, but they made the same complaints about their back hurting them, about them being uncomfortable after a session, and nobody had the guts to tell me like you just did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you kidding me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'm not kidding. You think I'd hold on to them if they were that bad. I might. Not in your case. What kind of a chair would you like? What kind of chair should we get?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd like one like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like this one? You want to change? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'll come sit over there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Fine. How's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good. Well now that you're sitting in the analyst chair, I'll hope you'll be more of an analyst with me. You're being very helpful so far, thanks. Hey, you were able to sit back. You're right. [0:13:03.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels better too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You know I like this chair better than that one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. It seems to fit more comfortably. Maybe I like being a patient more than I like being an analyst.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what to say to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh? So far you're helping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know there's this other thing. I never mentioned it but a long time ago? Remember I told you that awful thing I get with school where the directors ask me what was wrong. The teacher I was assisting and I told her and I didn't tell the teacher that I said anything. I told her all those awful things about the teacher. They were true. She didn't handle the kids well. She wasn't good with them. And then they let her go, and she was so angry at me and I felt like such a?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Rat fink.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And you said I should've said to her well I'm just not nice, I'm mean. [0:14:09.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you were a rat fink I said you should've said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How could you say a thing like to me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How could I say that? How could I tell her I like to be mean? I like to be a rat fink, that's why I do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't like it. I don't want to be that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're crazy. It's so much fun to be a louse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It isn't fun for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't help it. It's because I'm scared. I thought about the kids. I thought it was the right thing to do. I didn't know what to do when that director asked me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You mean you thought that their responsibility was more to the children than to the other teacher?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's what makes you a rat fink? That you're more interested in the welfare of 20 kids than 1 idiot of a teacher?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I should've done something. I should've told her that I said it about her or I should've talked to her first. I should've gone to her and told her what she was doing wrong with the kids instead of just going to the directors and telling her. [0:15:10.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You never told her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I never told her. The directors told her. Don't you even remember? I told you this story.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So how come you were able to tell me all the things that are wrong with me today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how you wormed it out of me. You wormed it out of me somehow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I'm glad you told me. You don't believe that do you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're glad?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I told you, you were phony, and insincere, and that your advice is lousy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course. How else can I improve if you don't tell me those things? I told you I want to be the best possible therapist I can be for you. Now if you don't tell me, what the hell am I going to do? I'll continue to be lousy, phony, insincere, and making you nervous all the time. You told me about the chair, we changed chairs. Aren't you more comfortable? So why shouldn't I want that? [0:16:03.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course I mean it. Try me. Tell me more things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I feel better. I really feel better. I feel good that I told you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't believe that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some day you're going to try my patience so I'm supposed to be a very patient guy. Therapists are supposed to be patient but they never believe a word I say. Just because I happen to be a liar, you don't believe me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why. Why do I love you so much?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I'm a rat fink too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What am I going to do about loving you? I can't stand it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can't stand loving?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I can't. I think about you all the time. I want to be with you all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that shows very good taste for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It isn't funny to me. It's very hurtful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The love?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [0:17:02.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you came if you remember one of the things you complained about, in fact you mentioned it earlier in the hour, was that you couldn't love anybody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but this is very painful to me. I think about you all? I can't get you out of my mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. What can we do about it? What do you think we should do about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what to do. I've tried everything. I was even going to leave you. I thought you didn't want me to come here anymore. I thought maybe you were trying to get me to leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me make it clear right now. You can come for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it and you never have to get well if you don't want to. You can stay as crazy as you are and come here for the rest of your life. I mean it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But what if I'm not crazy?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you're well, that'll be even better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You think we could be friends? You know listen I wanted to ask you, could you suggest some books for me to read? I really want to get to be as smart as you are. I want to read all the things you do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait a minute. Why is that? Why do you want to be as smart as me? [0:18:03.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to be just like you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are we going to get along?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to be like you. You said we were both rat finks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I want to be like you in the other ways too. What do you think I'm going to college for? I wasn't interested in college.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to get to be like you. I want to travel all over the way you travel. I want to live an exciting life. I want people to look up to me the way they look up to you. It's silly. It'll never happen to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I don't think you've got the brains for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got the brains. I used to be considered a very smart kid when I was young.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're putting me on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. When I was a little girl my teachers thought I was very smart. Something happened with my mother. I started having those temper tantrums on the floor and everything. Something happened to me and I was never all right after that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean when she used to scream?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I told you when she laid down on the floor, and screamed, and kicked her heels, and I would do anything. It seems like it froze my head up. I couldn't think anymore, but I always did well in school. But at least that's when I started to feel so stupid. But sometimes I don't feel so stupid anymore. I'm getting straight A's in school. I didn't tell you about it, but I got my paper back, and I got an A on it. You know the one from that psychology course. [0:19:27.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I never got an A in Undergraduate Psychology. I'm afraid you're getting smarter than me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't believe you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm the guy who went to psychology never had an A.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't believe you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. That's the trouble. Nobody knows how much I had to overcome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why do you talk to me like that? I don't understand what you're talking about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll show you my record.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will you? I don't believe you. Show it to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll bring it in. I don't have it with me but if you'd like to see I'd be glad to show it to you. I was a terrible student in college; much worse than you. I was a little better with graduate school but with college lousy. [0:20:06.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I can get to be like you. I have to work awfully hard. That makes me feel like I'm still stupid that I have to work so hard to get those grades.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Only the dumbest do that. If you were really smart you wouldn't have to do anything. All you'd have to do is register for the class, the mark would come in automatically, you wouldn't have to open a book. If I was smart I would've been able to do the same thing. I couldn't. If you can figure out the way, please tell me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Honestly. I can't even talk to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel so happy now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we're making each other feel good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You made me very good tonight. I don't know how you did it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know I don't either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I should have an idea of being in love with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why should you move from being in love me? I don't think you think enough about me. [0:21:08.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel like a baby.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean I'm in love with you like a baby's in love with its mother. I mean I want you to hold me in your arms all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Never stop for reading or anything else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Never.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Holy mackerel. What else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want you to be around me and be with me. That's one of the things I pretend all the time is that you're with me. When I'm studying that you're with me. When I'm in bed that you're with me that you tuck in the covers at night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing. You kiss me on the forehead.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just on the forehead?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And what would happen after that? Suppose we did all those things. I would hold you in my arms all the time; I would tuck you into bed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just want to come and live with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. And then what would happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nothing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing. That's all I want. [0:22:01.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but I understand that that's what you want but what would you do for me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never thought about doing anything for you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just thought about what you were going to do for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. The things you ask for sound great. But I'm very interested, isn't there anything you'd do for me; any little tiny thing, not too much, not at the beginning?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What can I do for you? You've got everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I asked you to do something for me so I don't get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I asked you to make me into a better analyst.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I can't make you into a better analyst.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look you gave me certain suggestions on how to handle this session didn't you? I handled this session in the way you suggested. What were the results? You feel better. I feel better. Isn't that doing something for me? [0:23:02.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I suppose so. I don't understand you. So what else am I supposed to do for you? I can't think of anything I could do for you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know it seems to me you hate the idea that you helped me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't want to help you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want you to help me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Tell me how. That's the only help I want. Keep telling me how and you'll be able to keep telling me how.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I want you to love me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you said had to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Love me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How will that help you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want you to make me feel so I don't feel dirty like I felt with my mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She made you feel dirty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, whenever I came near her, she made me feel I was dirty like I smelled bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you? Do you smell bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well do I? Smell me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't have such a good nose. You ought to know. Don't you ever smell yourself under your arm? [0:24:08.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh please. Dr. Greenwald. I don't know what to say to you. I bathe a lot. What are you talking about?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Twice a day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not enough. That's not enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How many times should I bathe?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Every spare moment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have any spare moments. I take care of the children. I cook meals at night. I go to school. I work all day long. What spare moments do I have? I don't even have time to clean my house on the weekends when I do the washing, and the ironing, and I cook all the meals for the week. What spare time do I have?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that makes it tough. How long do you spend in the bathtub?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ten minutes; as little time as I can spend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes at night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Couldn't you spend more time at night?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I haven't got any more time. Do you think I'm dirty? [0:25:02.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I don't know. I haven't had a chance to examine you that closely but your mother must've known. Why would she say it if you weren't dirty? What mother wants to say that her kid is dirty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She didn't like me. Like even now I know I'm not dirty. My husband tells me I'm not dirty. When my mother comes near me, she moves away. She shies away from me like I'm something? I hate to have her around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How often do you see her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's got the key to my house. She comes in whenever she wants to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Comes in whenever she wants and tells you how dirty you were?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She tells me everything. She wants to know what I'm doing every minute. I can't stop her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does she feel about you coming here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't care. She goads me to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She doesn't mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't care anything about me. She doesn't care what I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you tell her that you come here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course I told her. [0:26:02.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she doesn't even ask you what you say about her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No she doesn't ask me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't mind talking against her this way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I don't mind, maybe a little. I mind a little.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well she's my mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I'm very interested in this thing. What do you think is the truth of the matter? Are you dirty? Is your mother telling the truth or is your husband lying? Which is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I know I'm not dirty. I'm very clean. But she makes me feel dirty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's the way she backs away from me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does everybody back away from you that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Only your mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. I don't let anybody else come in my house. [0:27:03.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a good idea. Very good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you know that I don't want anybody to come in my house. I haven't gotten any furniture in it. It's not clean enough. My house is dirty, sloppy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know next time you come I think it'd be a good idea if you combed your hair more carefully. That's no way to come in. You claim to love me. You don't even take the trouble to comb your hair before you come in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. I just went in the bathroom just before I came in. I always (inaudible at 0:27:35.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've got a compact, just look at yourself in the mirror.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's wrong with it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it looks pretty good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what to do with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come you admit it that your hair is all right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You won't get me to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Isn't that a?
CLIENT: I don't know how you do that. [0:28:03.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Isn't that a dirty trick on my part?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I apologize.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I'll just sit here for a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I love you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you tell the truth to the people you love?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're so good to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were going to leave me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. But I get this feeling that you hate me, that you're going to reject me, and so then I think I've got to go before you do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before I find out how dirty you are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're a jerk. You tell me to hold you in my arms right? If I did that I'd find out how dirty you are wouldn't I?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not dirty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're sure?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're positive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. If I tell you that our time is up now do you think I'm saying it because I think you're dirty? [0:29:08.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know I have to go because our time is up. I usually notice it. So I'll see you next week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Same time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. If you feel like calling me, please don't hesitate. Try to call me when with a boring patient.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I'll try not to call you, and I'll call you anyway. I always do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Don't hesitate. Try especially to call me to interrupt the segment of a boring patient.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I'm not going to call you at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're being difficult.</p>

<p>END SESSION</p>

<p>DISCUSSION:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know how you felt about it but at no time that I was sitting here, except for occasionally being conscious of the audience, did I have any feeling that I was with anything but a patient and somebody that I didn't know except as a patient. It was I felt completely in the role. Did you feel the same way? [0:30:23.1]</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wish I had been able to be as good a therapist as she was a patient. But I wonder if you have any questions about any of the things that I said or did? Yes.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN FEMALE: Well the patient asked you hug here would you eventually hug here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you all hear the question? The question was when the patient asked me to hug would I eventually hug her? That will have to be a professional secret. (chuckles) Actually being serious about it I don't believe that actual physical closeness is helpful for the patient. I might enjoy it.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: Doctor, with that kind of therapy is it possible to make any basic character or personality changes in the patient or can this merely give an effective way for the person to solve an immediate problem? [0:31:30.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I working on the? That's an excellent question. Thank you. I was working on time to make a basic character change in the patient. I was trying to? Now let's see, what were some of the problems she presented? One, she tried to relate completely to her suffering; constantly telling me how much she suffered. She was constantly telling me that she was ugly, that she was dirty, all of these other things. My aim was to rob this maneuver of any gratification. See everybody, her husband, everybody else has disagreed with her. The more they disagree with her, being a negative person which she illustrated several times during this session, the more they disagreed with her the more set she would become in her belief that she was dirty, that she was ugly, that she was unacceptable. I agreed with her, and I would keep agreeing with her, and as you noticed several times, she started to change. [0:32:33.6]</p>

<p>Now this is characteristic of patients. She wasn't doing this just to please me because she was playing it as somebody who's very competitive and was not out to please the therapist at all. And she was really in character throughout the entire production so she wasn't interested in showing me as a good therapist in this scene because she's completely with the situation. But as I kept agreeing with her, I robbed her of the gratification. I didn't disagree with her. And because of that she kept on changing, and accepting, and describing herself in more positive terms over time like the dirty thing. I kept asking her, and pressing her, and asking if she's sure she wasn't dirty until she affirmed this. This would lead to a basic character change if it was kept up long enough; not one session of course. Yeah. [0:33:29.6]</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: More of a therapy than a preventive meaning (inaudible at 0:33:36.0) or difference in the presentation than the average analyst, or psychiatrist, who has the patient on a couch whereas patients keep talking and the psychiatrist doesn't say anything just listens to the patient.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I said at the beginning that I was going to demonstrate psychotherapy; psychoanalytic psychotherapy; not psychoanalysis. What you are describing is classical psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: Well (inaudible at 0:34:03.6) differ in the application so far as the effect upon the patient is concerned.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well in theory the theory says that you get a more profound personality change with the classical psychoanalytic method. As they lie on the couch, they free associate five times a week preferably. Many of the more classical analysts? See I'm deliberately not using the word orthodox because that's for childcare. Many of the more classical analysts would not consider it analysis unless it took place five times a week. You can get very profound personality changes that way. With the kind of remember she stated that she was only coming once a week. With that kind of patient, you can't carry on classical psychoanalysis usually. You would have to use a modified method and that's what I was demonstrating. [0:35:04.2]</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: (inaudible at 0:35:11.0)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I didn't consider it the most superior method in this specific situation I wouldn't have used it. But whether it is superior or not is very difficult to decide because our tests, our different techniques, are not as perfected as they would be. This happens to be the method I find most useful with patients of this kind. I would not speak this way to every patient. I considered the way she presented herself that the plan that I worked out in my mind as we were going along was the one to follow and that's the one I developed. In this specific situation? I don't believe in using one method for all patients. The method has to be tailor made. Yes. [0:36:02.9]</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: Doctor, was your patient taking psychotropic drugs and would you have recommended that she take them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A drug.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: A manufactured drug.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No and the basis of how she reacted in the session?</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: Why not?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't let me finish which indicates your interest in this. If you feel that she should take drugs, it's alright with me. But on the basis of how she responded, she was in good contact with me, she didn't have a paralyzing anxiety, she was able to profit by the therapy, I could see no reason for the drug.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: Yeah, but there's something of hysteria in her voice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know that hysteria could be treated by drugs or that that is the treatment of choice. Yeah.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: I noticed in the conversation there was a high level of banter. Would this possibly confuse the patient that you wanted to give them something else (inaudible at 0:36:56.7)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. It would confuse her. [0:37:03.1]</p>

<p>UNKNOWN MALE: Do you like to confuse them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You see the problem is with most patients in therapy that they come in with a very rigid system. The problem is to break that rigidity. If I worked in one way and they are sure as to what I am doing, they tend to remain just as rigid. It becomes more difficult to break up the rigid defensive system. By asking in such a way that they constantly have to figure out what I'm doing, not being sure, and acting and trying to surprise them as much as possible, constantly bring surprise into the situation, I find that it helps break up the rigid defensive system. Is my point clear? [0:37:50.1]</p>

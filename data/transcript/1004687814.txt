<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where do you want to start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. I guess stuff with Sydney. (pause) I think that you're right about the whole depression making things worse. (chuckles) Like on Saturday, I was in lots and lots and lots of pain because I had my period. Sydney had said that he would go to the grocery store for me and get me some chocolate. This is like Trader Joe's, and my house is like two blocks away from it.</p>

<p>[01:01.4]</p>

<p>And he kept on putting it off and putting it off and not being able to. And finally when Shabot ended, we eventually went, but I had to come with him after all that. I told him how originally he said it wouldn't be too much for him, like I did deserve to be taken care of but that he just couldn't do it. He was all like "You always yell at me. You're never supportive." So then when I talked to him later, he said that he had meant that I was supportive. We sort of went back and forth because he also said that he was more upset, and like I said "If I'm yelling at you, that's my fault." He's like "Well, I deserve it." I said "No one deserves to be yelled at, you know. This is your depression talking."</p>

<p>[02:01.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're yelling? Is that a correct perception?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Not in a like raising- my-voice-really-loudly-insulting, like the way my mom would yell at my dad. Not like that. It might be like asking him to do things and getting really frustrated with him, but not yelling-yelling, per se.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what he really means is that he can sense in your tone that you're angry or frustrated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not that you're raising your voice and screaming at him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I'm raising my voice a little, but I'm not screaming or anything. So not visibly yelling. (pause) But, I mean, usually—- like in situations like that, we both end up getting upset. Yesterday was fine. There was also a lot less pain.</p>

<p>[03:08.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were really—- it sounds like you were disappointed on Saturday because he said he would do this nice thing for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, after I've been taking care of him all this time and did all the moving for him and everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels lopsided.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even then, you know. (pause) At this point, I don't even know what I can do other than wait for the depression to get better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't make depression go away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and you can't really make him overcome things. Part of him is saying "Well, you don't understand. Why aren't you understanding why I can't do things?" and it's like "You can do things. It's just the depression telling you that you can't do things."</p>

<p>[04:02.8]</p>

<p>It's not like I'm asking for him to go out and run a marathon. Not like I'm asking him to move all of my stuff from one house to another house and pack it all up and do all of the work. This was something very minor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that felt out of reach for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and originally—- I guess because he originally said it wasn't too much, and it wasn't out of reach, and it was something he could do, and then he changed his mind was the part that got really really frustrating.</p>

<p>And like yes (inaudible at 4:31.3) I did pull myself to the grocery store with him, but I was still in pain and it was still annoying that I had to do that. He did make me chocolate-covered pretzels, but I still had to go to the grocery store with him. It's not like I did anything there, other than keep him company.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what about it is hard for him?</p>

<p>[05:02.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I'm not sure. I guess—- I mean, part of it is the getting up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he getting up and showering each day? Is he getting out of bed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's getting out of bed. If he has to get up [until around eight], it takes a while sometimes. He's been showering on average about every other day. On some days it's just easier if we go out to eat or something like that then fine, shower when you come back. The shower when he comes back doesn't always happen, you know. He'll do it before anything social and stuff. But you know, if he's gone three days, I'll be insistent like "You need to shower." But he is getting out of bed, eventually. (pause) Yeah. But he does need a lot of lying down time and stuff. He keeps on doing the whole putting things off by Interneting or watching things or whatever.</p>

<p>[06:15.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this something—- I mean, this was not going on for him when you first started dating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it something he has experienced in the past?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. He said he's never been depressed like this. He's been more depressed in different ways, but part of it is the hopelessness of not having a job. But then again, he's only applied to one job. So, you know, considering that he got the second interview and the only thing that's holding that up is just the place being stupid, I don't think he really has the right to complain about not having a job if he hasn't done any work to find a job. The work he has done has gotten him way farther than all the stuff I've ever done to try and find a job.</p>

<p>[07:04.9]</p>

<p>Granted, I'm not doing as much as I could be doing, but he's not doing anything at all. Then he doesn't want to write cover letters and stuff, and he'd rather, you know, watch TV or something. Then he gets more upset that he doesn't have a job and the more he puts things off, the worse they get. I'm trying to be like "Okay, just do one task per day and see where it gets." He's overwhelmed with all the things he has to do, but it isn't like he has that many things that he needs to do. Technically, he doesn't need to go find a job right away. He has enough money to live off for several years.</p>

<p>[08:01.7]</p>

<p>I guess the only thing right now he really needs to do is call the landlord of the new place that he's going to, and give the landlord the social security number since he didn't want to send it by e-mail. That's the only task he has to do, and he was saying that was too much yesterday. So I'm—- like he has to do it before he moves in, and he's moving in on August 1st. So he has a little bit of time but it's like, you know. I guess I had trouble when I was depressed, doing harder things that required lots of different pieces and more work, but something like that should be doable, especially when he has the entire rest of the day to sleep or read things on the Internet or play video games or whatever. Like one task, you know, two minutes of work compared to like several hours of not work.</p>

<p>[09:08.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're really trying to help him set a very achievable goal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [He] must feel pretty badly not to be able to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, especially because—- I guess I can understand him not writing cover letters and stuff because you don't know what will happen with those. But this is a tiny little task that he has to do. I did all the hard work. Like I found him a place to live, I got all his stuff moved, and he can't even do that. I just don't know what to do, because at this point I guess there is a consequence. Or maybe the landlord will end up calling him and asking for his social security number, and then maybe he gets the phone call (inaudible at 09:55.5) because he's not as good talking to strangers on the phone. But I mean, neither am I, but I've gotten over it. (pause)</p>

<p>[10:13.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know that sometimes it causes you anxiety to have to make those types of phone calls that you have to be able to push yourself to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it's worse when it's like something like insurance things where you'll be on hold for an hour or something like that. Something this straightforward should be doable. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's your limit for coping with a relationship like this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I honestly don't know. (pause) Like I guess—- I mean, he's not actively doing things to hurt himself either. I think if he were like not seeking psychiatric and psychological care, that would be my limit. But I guess it didn't help that last week he didn't have therapy because his therapist was on vacation.</p>

<p>[11:13.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Because of the holiday].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which was good in the sense that we spent the entire time moving, but bad in the sense that he didn't have any therapy, and maybe he'll start feeling a little bit better again once he was seeing his therapist. But like, yeah. So I haven't hit my limit yet. And it's not like the depression is causing him to be mean to me or anything like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just feel pretty alone, it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's not like I—- well, you know, I was physically able to drag myself to the grocery store and stuff, so it's not like I needed him to take care of me. I just wanted—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want your boyfriend to take care of you sometimes. That's one of the benefits of being in a relationship, is that you can take care of each other and right now you're not getting that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's not like I even get my period that often. With one pill it's like every 10 weeks or something, so it's not like a quarter of the time I have my period and need to be taken care of or something. And it's not even—- it's usually just like one or two days that are like really bad. But right now he can't do any of that.</p>

<p>[12:24.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He can't do the things that make that more pleasant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, granted, before I was dating him I was just doing things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's in a sense why you really need it. You can be independent, but sometimes you want someone to do nice things for you like run that errand or rub your back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, he can rub my back and stuff because it doesn't require leaving the house. It's more things that require getting out of bed and doing things and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he anxious at all leaving the house?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe a little. (pause) That probably has something to do with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I ask not because it's necessary for me to know, but I'm wondering if you understand what exactly is making it hard for him to do these tasks that you feel like you've broken down into really simple steps, or what it is that's blocking him from being more engaged and active.</p>

<p>[13:32.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, sometimes it's like he feels he has to physically fight his body in order to get up, and that's part of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds really tiring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like even getting out of bed sometimes is a problem for him. It's not just tired, it's inability to—- he's tried to explain it to me and I don't really understand it, so I can't really explain it well because I have no clue what it feels like, but that's part of it. So he's fighting himself. (pause) Maybe it's good he doesn't have a job right now because he'd be fighting himself in order to get to work. (pause)</p>

<p>[14:27.1]</p>

<p>Like the new—- the Lexapro is helping. He still hasn't—- I mean, because he called on Friday and he said it would probably take the weekend for his psychiatrist to get back to him when he's supposed to go up to the full pill. So that hasn't happened yet. He says it's helping because it's dealing with the anxiety and stuff, but he still gets periods of feeling like he can't move and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That must be frightening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yesterday was okay, and he was able to get up and stuff . It took a little bit of coaxing him, but he wanted food too, and I did all the driving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are doing a lot of the work in the relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I just sort of freak out when anyone else is having me do things that I shouldn't have to do. So it just gets where—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you've hit your limit.</p>

<p>[15:26.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, you know, if some other housemate doesn't do dishes and it's my day to do dishes, and I have to do my dishes and their dishes, like I've—- I won't freak out at whichever housemate that isn't, because if the housemate were around, I'd be like "By the way, you have these dishes from last night, you know. I'm going to do the ones that are mine and keep these aside, and you can do your dishes." But if they're not around, I'd end up having to do them all.</p>

<p>Like Aaron has a baby now, and Aaron gets migraines. Even before he had the baby, he got migraines and sometimes wouldn't do his dishes. He'd end up having to lie down, so whoever had dishes the next night had to do them. We switched the schedule around because before, the night before, Eliza (ph) used to do dishes. If she had dishes that were around that weren't hers, she would end up doing all of them.</p>

<p>[16:28.3]</p>

<p>So that meant when I had dishes the next day, I only had to do the ones that had accumulated from the previous day. But then if I have—- like now, Aaron is before me and if he doesn't do any of his dishes, then I have to do all of his dishes and all of my dishes. So being directly after someone who is less good about doing the dishes means that—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You encounter that more often.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it wasn't fair to Eliza (ph) that she had to do that either. Like when Joan was on dishes back when she still lived there, like half the time she forgot to do her dishes. Sometimes she'd like—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That just meant that you were less aware of it because it got kind of fixed before you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no, I was very aware of it and sometimes I would end up doing some of those anyway because even if Eliza (ph) was on dishes Tuesday night, Rebecca (sp?) was on dinner Tuesday night and would freak out if there were no dishes for her to—-</p>

<p>[17:28.7]</p>

<p>Like even Joan, if she was going to do those dishes Tuesday night when she got back from work, it was (a) going to be back later than Rebecca (sp?) got back and (b) not be helpful for Rebecca (sp?) having to make dinner. I would do some of those dishes. So I was very aware of it. It just wasn't usually my problem. But lately it's been more my problem and I'm like—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't have the tolerance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I've done all these things for Sydney, and I've done all these things for the housemates. You know, I freak out when we run out of food or whatever. I always have to be the one who notices when we run out of food. So if I don't circle it, often it doesn't get caught because apparently I'm the only one capable of noticing that we're out of eggs or something and circling it on the grocery list.</p>

<p>[18:22.9]</p>

<p>Like I don't go and buy the groceries, but even more so that the people who buy the groceries should be able to notice that we're out of things. You know, people circle what they want but if you're about to run for groceries, it would make sense to check. Like hey, do we have milk? Do we have eggs? You know, even if they're not circled on the list. So then when I find that we have like five eggs in the house and we are wanting to make a large amount of challah, then I start to freak out, like why am I the only person in the house who is capable of noticing that we're running low on anything?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that something you say in your head or to someone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In my head, yeah. It's something I say in my head. It's not something I actually say to them. Though if Sydney was around, he'll hear it and I'm like "I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at my housemates. But yes, I am freaking out."</p>

<p>[19:26.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would it be something that's more effective to talk about at a house meeting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. The problem is that sometimes some of these—- I don't know if the noticing- things-being-out conversation has come up before, but the dishes conversation has come up all the time and still doesn't get fixed. We have policies and whatever, and like if you make lunch during the day, you're supposed to do your own dishes, regardless of who's on the dinner dishes, but that never happens. So, you know, whatever our policies are doesn't necessarily mean that's what's going to happen. People might be like "Okay, I'll be better about doing my dishes," but then they don't get better about doing their dishes. So the same things happen over and over again. So it gets really frustrating.</p>

<p>[20:24.7]</p>

<p>I was supposed to be on [big clean] on Saturday night and was going to do all the dishes. [Awesome, yes]. I was kind of pissed off at Aaron. He made this big meat Friday night dinner. We have a dairy dishwasher, but we don't have a meat dishwasher. We need separate dishwashers because—- yeah, there are various rabbinical opinions and I think you can have the same dishwasher, but the house policy is that there are separate dishwashers. Except the meat dishwasher doesn't exist, so only dairy dishes have a dishwasher. So Aaron—- I understand all the cooking stuff, fine, you have to—-</p>

<p></p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's backwards. If you have only one dishwasher, it should be a meat dishwasher.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but we eat dairy a lot more than we eat meat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just thinking about the sanitizing button.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know, with the oils and stuff it does make it hard. But then we have to use real plates for the plates for all the people, and now I have to do all these plates. He could have used paper plates, and yes I know we're hippies and care about the environment, but I care about my own sanity more than I care about the environment. I guess I'll have to bring that up in the next house meeting, like "In the future, if you're having a giant meal on Shabot, or even not on Shabot—-"</p>

<p>[21:37.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes it's easier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it's a meat, use paper plates because otherwise I have to do all these extra 10 or 15 plates in addition to all the pots and pans that I normally have to do. I still haven't finished them because I was in pain and an emotional wreck on Saturday, so I did some dishes on Saturday and put those away on Sunday. Then I did more dishes on Sunday to fill up the dish rack, but I'm nowhere near done. In that case, it's mostly my responsibility. There are also these few pots that are like—- frying pans—- that are from a previous dinner that also haven't been washed. So it isn't all me. Yeah, it isn't all my responsibility but I'll end up doing it anyway.</p>

<p>[22:26.4]</p>

<p>So Sydney had said that he'd help me with some of it, as long as I was around to make sure his things were correctly washed since I see things that he can't. But he still hasn't followed through on that either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I notice that when you're feeling more stressed out, these are the types of things that start to bother you. We start to talk more about the frustrations with, you know, just daily living, and it seems that's what's happening now. You're really frustrated with Sydney' continued depression, so things like dishes being left over, people making a decision that's different from what you would have made about paper plates versus regular plates, start to bother you more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that's one thing. It just sucks. Like the decision should be up to the person who has to wash the dishes, not the person who is making the meal, you know. I feel like that's fair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a reasonable plan.</p>

<p>[23:32.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that didn't happen. You know, because we do now have enough meat dishes, but we used to not. I mean, at least we have plastic forks and knives and stuff because we don't have enough meat silverware. But still, I have to do all those dishes. The dish rack only holds so many and—- if we'd had had a dishwasher, it would have been totally fine, but we don't. (pause) Which is so ridiculous, and I'm sort of—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I also wonder if it bothers you more because in your interpretation, you don't have to use separate dishwashers to follow the cultural laws.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, in my interpretation you would have to run them separately, like you couldn't wash meat and dairy at the same time. But yeah, you wouldn't have to use separate dishwashers. You'd also be able to use that dishwasher for Passover, which our house doesn't do either.</p>

<p>[24:30.8]</p>

<p>And then for Passover, we have real plates for dairy. For meat, we just have the cooking stuff and then we have paper plates. Then you also have to wash all those dairy dishes after Passover—- also during Passover because it's like a whole week long. But then there's all these more dishes that have to be washed because everybody is like "Oooh, the environment," and then somehow—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could find an article that hand washing dishes uses a lot more energy than dishwashing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not the dish—- but that's Kashrut. It's not the environment. No, the hand washing dishes is not for the environment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know you can't use the dishwasher because of the Kashrut.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't think hand washing dishes would be worse for the environment than paper plates, though. That's the argument I would actually need to make in order to save my sanity.</p>

<p>[25:31.8]</p>

<p>Because the Kashrut things you can't really fix, but you can fix hand washing dishes by not having those dishes exist in the first place. I mean, we go to Costco and it'll be like a big giant thing of paper—- like the nicer paper plates. I don't know. Maybe it would cost $5 for like 200 plates or something. Like it's really really trivial. Especially when you're splitting that $5 six ways, it's nothing. It's not—- we can definitely afford it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this really what you want to talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just don't want to deal with frustrations with anything, and I just want to curl up in a ball and not have to do any of it. Unfortunately, that's not realistic so I don't know what to do because, like—-</p>

<p>[26:33.8]</p>

<p>I can't change my housemates' hippie environmental tendencies, but I can at least bring up the meat dishes are really hard to wash. "If you're making a Shabot dinner, please use paper plates." But I can't fix the fact that I still have all these other dishes I need to do now, and I can't fix the fact that people don't do their dishes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are things that are not in your control.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really sucks though. No matter how many times we bring it up in a house meeting, it doesn't help. Like people still—- you know. Like Aaron—- okay, theoretically, Aaron has an excuse that he has a baby. But he adopted the baby with the knowledge that he still has all these responsibilities. Childcare is not our responsibility. It's his responsibility to figure it out.</p>

<p>[27:28.7]</p>

<p>Like if Eliza (ph) or Aimee (sp?) are around, they can hold the baby while he does things. Now the baby can be put in the highchair or the stroller, and he can do things. But, you know, I shouldn't have to hold the baby just for Aaron to be able to do the chores that he had agreed to be doing all along.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you being asked to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm not, though, you know, he will ask other people. He knows that I really don't like holding babies because I really don't like holding babies and stuff. But he was like "Oh, sorry, Joshua (ph) was going to sleep and I decided to sleep while Joshua (ph) was sleeping." Okay, that's great, except that if those dishes don't get done—- and it's summer now, so we really—- He doesn't have work during the summer, so he can theoretically do all his chores. But I can't fix that. So all I can do, I guess, is just do the thing that other people do. Just not do anyone else's dishes, in theory.</p>

<p>[28:44.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just because someone else doesn't do their work doesn't mean you have to take it on. That might decrease some of the resentment that you're feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'd still notice that people aren't necessarily doing their part, but it doesn't have to become your responsibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, unless of course I need those dishes to cook in which case it does become my responsibility. Though I could, in theory, use those dishes to cook and then leave them for the next person to wash since I already washed them once and I don't need to wash them twice. I guess I just feel bad about doing that, because Eliza (ph) will do all the dishes, including the ones that aren't hers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another perspective on it is what if we looked for things that would increase your sense of satisfaction in other areas, so that your frustration tolerance was higher.</p>

<p>[29:44.1]</p>

<p>Because I think we are noticing that your frustration tolerance is pretty low. So much of your energy goes toward coping with your boyfriend's depression and the ways your relationship has changed because of that right now. So you don't have much tolerance left over for anything else. If we can find ways to make you feel better in other parts of your life, you gain a little bit more perspective and a little bit more tolerance for these—- you know, these are the types of things that people deal with. These are daily life frustrations that, you're right, you don't have control over. No one is ever going to do their jobs perfectly or be thoughtful in ways that you wish they would be thoughtful about things. You don't have control over that piece, but you have control over other things.</p>

<p>[30:40.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think I currently have control over anything that can improve my life. I know I don't have control over the job situation, so that's not going to—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a big one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have control over Sydney' depression.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't think there's anything that I have control over that would actually significantly make me happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does make you happy right now? What are you able to enjoy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do enjoy spending time with Sydney, just it's sort of interlaced with the frustration of when he is avoiding doing tasks that would ultimately make him feel better. (pause) It's not like I'm always thinking about him not doing these tasks. (pause)</p>

<p>[31:39.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there anything you're enjoying for yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I'm enjoying my work now that it's finally happening, for the month I'm getting paid for it. But that's three days a week, and it's only four hours a day. So I still have the rest of the time. I mean, at least when I go there I feel like I've done something productive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you working on any projects that you're enjoying, outside of work? Do you have a knitting project going or a wool project?</p>

<p>[32:28.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually today I sent out—- someone yesterday bought $78 worth of wool from me, and I sent it off to her. She also wants this other stuff, so I made a custom order for her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that feel satisfying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does, except sometimes it depends on whether or not I have the energy. I guess the heat doesn't help because, sure, the basement is cooler than other parts of the house, but there's no air conditioning down there. So there's only so long I can work down there without overheating and stuff. I guess today at least is more mild than last week. The wool-dyeing stuff I can really only do if the weather is cooperative. (pause) And usually I'm only doing that for maybe a couple of hours at a time. I did some yesterday which is why my hands are still stained. (pause)</p>

<p>[33:42.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how is exercise and being active going? That is something that can sometimes give you a good feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not really coming because it has been too hot out. When it's 95 degrees, I am not going for a walk. You know, being outside is too awful and disgusting, and it also doesn't help that the only pants I have that fit right now are my corduroys. So I'm wearing my corduroy pants in 95 degree weather.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you buy one pair that is more weather appropriate? It might make you a lot more comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I guess I have one pair of like exercise pants or something that wouldn't be so ridiculous. The problem is that it requires going shopping, and going shopping requires effort, and effort is something that I don't seem to have right now. (pause) Like I really don't want to. I don't even want to know what size I am right now, so that's part of it. (pause)</p>

<p>[35:01.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like your fear of trying clothes on is getting in the way of doing something that might make you feel better in two ways. Just the added movement usually raises peoples' spirits a bit, but you'd also feel like you were doing something proactive toward a goal that's important to being healthier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm kind of—- I mean, it's also like admitting that I'm a larger size. Should I theoretically just exercise until I'm a smaller size and can fit into my old clothes, so that way I don't need to waste money on new clothes. Which isn't going to happen, but I want it to happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's not going to happen? You're not going to lose weight or—-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not going to lose weight without having—- like, I'm not going to lose weight quickly enough that I can just fit into my old clothes now, like my old pants. (pause) I think I do need to get something that I can exercise in.</p>

<p>[36:04.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you'll be more comfortable if you have, you know, not just exercise pants but weather-appropriate pants. Cords are hot. No wonder you don't want to go out in the heat when you're faced with not just the summer heat, but the summer heat in clothes that are not as light and comfortable, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, my shirts are fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's only half of your body.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the corduroys are fine when I'm like at work if I'm downstairs in the climate controlled area.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm wearing sandals.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's not addressing exercise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just really don't want to go to the store, and I don't know if I could just find something online so that I don't have to go the store and just guess that I'm a large or something at this point. (pause) I really don't want to go to the store.</p>

<p>[37:07.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I can hear a lot of hesitation in your voice when even thinking about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just such a big effort and trying on things. Right now I really don't want to go because I have my period too, and I just need to wait until my period is over before I can even go out and do anything useful. (pause) I could just maybe find something online that would work as exercise pants and buy them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, you could. There are lots of places that even have free shipping. Since you are often at the post office to send wool, you can coordinate that with having to return if you have to return.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't actually usually go to the post office. I only go to the post office if it's something international. Anything domestic I just print up a label and put it in the mailbox. (pause)</p>

<p>[38:11.8]</p>

<p>So I would need something with free shipping that also has free return shipping. Then you have to like, you know—- I guess buy things in a bunch of sizes at once and then return all the ones that don't fit, so that way you don't have to send things back and forth a zillion times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you could do. If you want to do this, you can do it. If you don't want to, there are lots of reasons that you could come up with that would get in the way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean, it also is hot out so even if I wasn't wearing cords it would still—- and I'm not going to go running in that heat. Not that I'd go running anyway, but even walking in the heat is already like—- I mean, I don't really, because it's been so long since I've had other pants. Like last summer, I don't even know how much the corduroys are adding to the heat and when they're not. Wearing something else would make it less bad.</p>

<p>[39:09.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I said, if you want to make it happen, you can make it happen. Because it's not 95 degrees the whole day long, and it's not 95 degrees every day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like 85.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And there are lots of people out walking in this temperature. It's also much cooler earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon when the sun is not as strong. Being out in the middle of the day is obviously the hottest part. So if being more active is something you want to do, I trust that you can find a way to do it whether that be shopping or online shopping or finding a cooler part of the day to get out there and get yourself a walk. If you don't want to do it, then you can look all the barriers which would be the heat in the middle of the day, the frustration of shopping, the disappointment you feel at being a size that you don't want to be.</p>

<p>[40:07.3]</p>

<p>I understand that all those things are very real, and they are barriers. They can get in the way as much or as little as you want them to. They can be huge hurdles, or they can be small hurdles that you can overcome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And even if I start exercising, I won't start seeing results right away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's not going to happen right away. You're not going to see weight results right away, but you will feel a mood change. That actually happens pretty quickly usually for people. Doing something proactive for yourself, being able to check off "I did that thing toward my goal today," that usually does give people a mood lift right away. But you're right that you're not going to see a change in your size or on the scale right away. That's a much slower process. You decide what's in your control and what's not. (pause)</p>

<p>[41:05.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know that going for a walk everyday will actually solve my problems though. (pause) Maybe it will make me better able to cope.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think that's—- there are lots of your problems that are not in your control because you're reacting to what's happening in other people's lives too. So you're absolutely right that going for a walk is not going to solve the problems. The angle I'm looking at is what makes you better able to cope with your problems. You're not going to be able to make all your problems go away. Problems are an ever-present part of life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wish there were an instant way to lose the weight that didn't take effort. But I suppose if there were, then there wouldn't be anyone who is overweight.</p>

<p>[42:06.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I wish it were easier for you too. That would be nice. But it's a problem that lots of people struggle with, and it's hard and it requires a lot of effort.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is just something that I've never—- you know, I've lost weight accidentally before but never—- except when I did Weight Watchers in like eighth and ninth grade. Other than that, I've never really dieted successfully and lost large amounts of weight. I really don't want to go to Weight Watchers because that would cost a bunch of money, and going to the weekly meetings, and staying on points and counting calories and all that, that I don't really want to do. And then also, when I went off Weight Watchers, as soon as I stopped counting all my meal portions and stuff, then my weight went up again. I really don't want to do that.</p>

<p>[43:06.4]</p>

<p>It's really not sustainable. Like in theory, sure, I could continue to keep track of points and whatever, but no one ever does. And then you gain your weight back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're right. Whatever changes you make have to be changes you can make over the long haul. I guess otherwise it goes back to where you were. It's not a short-term solution. You decide what you're ready to take on and what hurdles you're ready to overcome. Why don't we stop there for today, and I will see you at 4:50 on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

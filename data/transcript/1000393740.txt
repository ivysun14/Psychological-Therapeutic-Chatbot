<p>PATIENT: (4 ½-minute silence) Since I've come in I first start thinking of how I felt yesterday.  And I don't know, I somehow I think I'm comparing how I was feeling here to how I've been feeling with MSCZ.  And, I don't know what, well, I think there's something more there I don't want to think about because then I'll start thinking about school and how this morning was one of those mornings that was particularly hard to get up and to go to school.  And I don't, I mean Tuesdays are always the worst day of the week, for some reason, i've decided, and partly I guess because of the fact the boys don't leave the room necessarily on Tuesday.  And so I was kind of thinking of that anyway and then 2 classes were canceled, the 2 classes they have with other people, and we had a visitor unexpectedly.  And yet by the, I, I was thinking that by the end of the day, even though my feeling was that this whole day was exhausting and one I didn't want to be there for at all, by the end of the day I was thinking of — at 11:00 I uhm, had a small group working with clay — I was just thinking of my reaction to some of the things I made.  And I, I really enjoyed that period, although that wasn't something I'd thought at the time, or my impression of the day didn't get better as I would think it would have since I did enjoy that part.</p>

<p>And then I, I don't know, I just start thinking about yesterday and what happened.  And I don't know, I, I can't think anything more except that this feeling that I've been having all along last week or 2 — so it isn't something that just happened as a result — but of wanting just to be alone or maybe it's not wanting to but feeling I have to.  And, and how much lately if MSCZ's trying to bring me out of that mood, at home I've gotten angry at him.  And I don't know, I had the feeling maybe that's what was happening here yesterday too.</p>

<p>Because, well, this one thing in particular that I keep wondering about and I, I don't know whether there's something there or not.  I think I knew that it was close to the end of the hour yesterday when I let myself continue to think something that upset me.  And usually if I know it's the end of the hour, I'll stop so I don't go out looking as if anything has bothered me.  And so it made me wonder if I wanted to see, have you see me crying or, anyway that I didn't, in a way didn't want to stop.  And it makes me think of uhm (clears throat) — I don't know whether this had anything to do with the fact that I let myself cry too — but yesterday uhm, FHYZ always goes to, i guess it's therapy she's going to now on Monday, and yesterday I saw her af—, right afterwards.  It happened that I was planning to see her.  We'd planned that I would see her because she had something she wanted to talk about with me.  It was the business about the photographing the children, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>And uhm, when she came in she was going to call me, but when she called she said, she asked if I had any face powder and I didn't.  I didn't put the two together, that uh, something might have happened and she had to kind of get her face back in order and I just figured she forgot her face powder and needed some.  And so I said, "Do you want to see me right now?"  Thinking about the other thing, which is why I thought she was calling to start with.  And she hesitated and then said well yes, it's alright.  And I couldn't understand why, but when I got down there it was still evident that she'd been crying.  And I, I don't know where she goes.  I don't know how close it is to the school, but, and I don't know whether she came in looking like that or else when she got in something struck her that made her cry again, but I, I was just I guess amazed.  Or I couldn't understand her letting herself be so open, I guess.  And she obviously didn't like it at school except she hadn't gotten herself into control before she came in the school.  And the only thing I could think of was that she goes so nearby she hadn't had a chance.  But I don't know, it was because of my thought is always I try to get myself in control before I leave here, the, this room. (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's a feeling of not wanting anybody to see me out of control.And I don't know why I think it's so important, because when I thought of FHYZ's crying, I was thinking, well, if she doesn't want to be that way, then it's hard for her.  I was feeling sympathetic to her then.  But on the other hand, nobody is going to think anything awful of you.  I, I mean I, I didn't think anything of it in terms of FHYZ, except it must be hard if something upset her so much that she's crying in public, because of my point of view.  And I think I was sort of wondering if it meant that in a way she was stronger or freer or something about herself that she could.  But then when you asked why, I was thinking that it's not, it's not even when I'm outside of here, but to a lesser degree I think — well we've talked about other ways I try to control myself here — but also just in terms of crying too.  I don't want to cry freely here.</p>

<p>(Pause) And that makes me think of — I was just wondering, well, what do I think will happen?  And it seems to be connected with this fear of loss of control. And that made me think of something I just read in the book I'm reading, which was something I felt before my operation in the fall, about being under anesthesia and not having control and feeling anybody could do anything.  Anything could happen, which is what the doctor in this book was talking about, the fear patients have.  And I guess maybe I was just thinking that this fear of not having control, even if I'm conscious, is a fear that then others can do things to me because I'm not controlling myself, so I couldn't stop it or do something else.  Because then the other thing is that — I think I've talked about before too of — if I don't have control of myself I might do something that I don't want to do.  And I think of those times that I started beating my brother and the time I hit my mother, wanting to really hurt her, maybe kill her.</p>

<p>(Pause) I keep having this feeling about the book I'm reading.  I have it if I ever think of the book here or sometimes as I'm reading it, and it's touching on things that are closer to what I'm experiencing.  Generally it's dealing with patients that are — psychotic I guess is what they are — and I mean, it's something I don't know much about and I don't feel a personal tie with in the same way.  But I keep feeling otherwise ei_ either this book makes me think things I don't want to think, or else it's confusing me by making me think this is the way things should be or —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   That's the second time you said it made you think things you didn't want to think, but you don't say what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not sure what.  I was just wondering what it was that I'd been — it's almost just that I'll start thinking about the book and I can't even remember now what I had started to think about a minute ago.  And I'll just get this feeling I don't want to think about it.  Oh, I know what I was thinking about.  After I said that about killing my mother then I thought well, I'd want to kill her to get my father and it made me think of this thing I've had about having a baby and how you pointed out that one of the feelings anyway — uh, I don't know, I think I have more than 1 feeling about it — but recently when I was talking about it, it seemed the feeling was, I would have the baby replace something I didn't have.  That's why I wanted the baby. And yeah, I was thinking just now, well, if I wanted the baby, it would be to take the place of my mother.  And there had been something in this book where one of patients had, i think it was a boy, and he'd had this confusion about what he was and what he wanted to be and everything.  And at one point he was protesting against carrying a baby.  And then that just made me think again of my own mixed feelings and just — I guess I got to the point where I thought I don't understand them and I don't know what to do with them.  And then I'd think I don't want to think about that book anymore.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because the other thing I do when I think about the book and something will bother me and I don't know why exactly it is — maybe sometimes because of what it makes me think and then other times it's something that will begin to make me think that the author — I'm not sure, I mean they give a little bit about his background, but he's not a psychiatrist.  He's been an aide.  And I don't know what, well, at least I can't remember if they tell what research he's done and all this.  But the way he's writing is as if he knows exactly what goes on in analys—, in analysis, in, in the minds of both the person in analysis and the analyzer (sic).  I can't remember (chuckle) the — I just have the feeling that's not the word for your function and I can't remember what it is.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Analyst. I wonder why I did that.  (Pause) It's almost as if I couldn't think straight when I started thinking about you directly, because on the back of my mind is always this feeling I don't know what you're thinking.  And it's important to me to know or to be guessing or something.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, my first thought was because if I know what you're thinking then I can do the things that will please you.  If I don't know what you're thinking, I won't know when I displease you.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, last week you said it quite differently and oppositely — that if I don't say anything or you don't know what I'm thinking, you don't know what to fight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hadn't remembered saying that specifically, except I knew I had other feelings about it.  I think that's why I hesitated.  But this time that's what I was thinking.  And this just makes me think — that again yesterday, either after I got upset, or I did it on purpose, I don't know which — that I want to know your reaction now to me.  Which makes me think I was trying to do something, like make you feel sorry for me, I guess.  Because, because I wouldn't call that fighting, at least not in the way I generally think of fighting, where I would be just rebellious or nasty or disagreeable or, I don't know, much more aggressive anyway.  It was almost like — I don't know, because when I thought of what I, what made me cry — something about my father leaving me and your rejecting me — it, it, at least it seemed that at first my reaction was to feel upset before I could have thought of it.</p>

<p>But somehow once I knew the time was coming to an end it was almost as if I were someth—, doing something on purpose and in a way maybe trying to please you. Because all of yesterday I was very aware of not in the past having done the right thing and of having been awkward and so forth, and so maybe I was thinking that if I kept on with something that made me cry, you would think, now she's really trying and doing something, and that you'd be pleased.  Or wha_ what comes to my mind is that the phrase that I was working hard at the session as if the way to please you was to work hard at whatever the task is.</p>

<p>I just thought of something else too that I was thinking of at some point right after it happened.  And I knew what bothered me about it but I hadn't related it to myself personally so much.  But that phrase made me think of these, some of the ideas my parents had of what was good and what was bad and all.  And I was just thinking that today, uhm, a nurse called one of the boys, and uhm, I don't know whether the parents were just out for a little while or what, but she seemed very anxious over some problems. She wanted to see me right away and she implied over the phone it was because the parents weren't there and she didn't know what to do.  But it turned out she didn't want the parents to know because her feeling was the parents might make it worse.</p>

<p>And, and it, it involves a boy who's, I don't know, just adjusting, I guess, socially a little more slowly than some of the others and he's a tease a lot of the time.  And from what I've gathered he's often in the past not played with anyone but his sister.And my feeling was just,if he had lots of opportunities to be with boys his age and he knew he had friends and so forth, he'd get over this.  But apparently uhm, one boy in particular bothered him a lot and so whenever he was with this boy, he had found out that if he tried to kiss him, it would annoy that boy, and that was his way to get back.</p>

<p>And this was causing all sorts of talk outside of school, that here he wanted to kiss this boy.  And on the one hand the mother of the other boy knew he was doing it on purpose but yet she took it both ways — that she, that he wanted to tease her son, who didn't like it,and also that he had this need to kiss which immediately everybody got up in arms over how effeminate and all.  And the nurse was upset because she kept saying he's not effeminate and everybody is saying he is.  Yet I think she was afraid it meant he was.  And she, she talked about other things too.And, and I know the mother has this fear, because she's already said it before and this is why the nurse didn't want to talk to the mother about it.  And she mentioned something about feeling strongly that, that he should learn to share and when he doesn't want to she insists that he do it.  And he's always saying he doesn't want to because his toys will be broken.  And, and then she said, "And one time I insisted that he did and then the toy was broken right away."</p>

<p>And I have a different feeling about it.  And I don't know, it just got me — all these — they just seemed very Victorian attitudes about what's right and what a child should do.  And I just felt the nurse really wanted to do something; she really wanted to know what suggestions I had, but she couldn't hear what I was saying.  I don't think she really understood at all what I was saying because it went so against her belief about things.  And I don't know, this talking about working as a way to please, please you, I have this feeling, I know it was to please my parents.</p>

<p>(Silence) I was just thinking about that boy again and this fear that everybody seems to have around him that he might be effeminate.  And I, I — just anticipating from what I've seen happen to other boys at LKC he's just the kind that the men, starting next year, will latch on to and scream at because they have this fear of maybe he'll turn into something effeminate too.  Because he's slight.  His father is very teeny and I imagine he will be, and his, he's got a very gentle sort of delicate way of doing things.  And even when he's being tough — his nurse kept saying, "But he wants to be tough now."  — He's not, I mean it's just not his way to be rough and tough the way some children are.  And, and I don't know, it just seems so wrong to me that now this child has to be helped to accept that he's not effeminate despite these things, rather than just to accept that that's the way he is.  Or, I don't know, you have to, he's going to actually have to fight that.</p>

<p>And I was also thinking at the time of the way he is dressed.  And I don't know who he's to please by the way he's dressed, because I, I still don't think it's for himself.  Maybe it is now because it's such a habit, but he's very immaculate and neat and his clothes are the kind that, I don't know, would help children look very cute, and not that many boys have things like that.  And it, they make him look effeminate too.  And somebody wants him to look effeminate because they're dressing him that way.  And it's probably his mother, who has this great fear that he's effeminate.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I guess thinking about that principle of work, really it was in our family, made me feel very angry toward my parents.  Because the next thing I began to think of was partly because the boy I was just talking about doesn't want to play with this other boy at home, but yet is with him all the time at school.  And the other boy is extremely destructive.  I mean he just doesn't have any controls, and anyway, as far as I can tell, I don't think he's been taught many.  And he's the type of child anyway to find learning them hard.  And so then I think, I was starting to think about how could I blame his parents for the way he is.  And then that just made me think that if I want keep blaming all these parents, I must be awfully annoyed at my own.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose this is sort of what I've been doing here.  Because then I was thinking — and that feeling makes me feel I want to fight those parents.  Which I always have hated feeling, because I know it makes it much harder to deal with them then.  And then I, but then just thinking that this feeling about what I had to do to please and making it, me angry, would make me want to fight my parents, as I so often wanted to.  And yet I still would do the things, at least some of those things, that I thought would make them pleased with me, even though I knew it displeased them for me to fight and be nasty and awful to live with.</p>

<p>But I would still do the things that made me angry, like work hard, work hard at school work and things like that, things they had singled out as the things to work hard at.  And I've always had this confusion, which makes me angry too, because I felt it isn't true. And I know I've talked about it before — of knowing that when I like something or when I set a goal that I'm going to do something, I can work extremely hard on it, make work for myself depending on what it is.  But I found, doing some of the things I've done for teaching, that I enjoyed working hard.  I mean it would be a different kind of hard work, but I suppose it was different partly because I enjoyed doing it.</p>

<p>And yet all through, well I don't know, the whole time I lived on, in the, the house that we moved to after when I was about 6, all I can think of — well one of the things I think of is sitting in a certain couch and my mother telling me I was lazy.  Or not getting up in the morning and being told I was lazy.  I might be reading in bed.  (Pause) And then just knowing that there are times when I have a great deal of energy if I want to do something and, and when, it's when I don't want to do things that sometimes, sometimes I would still make myself do them.  And sometimes I would just feel I can't make myself do it anymore, I don't have any energy and thinking that's not laziness, it's something else.  And yet, it, it's always been labeled laziness and so I didn't know.  And being lazy was a very bad thing to be in our family.  It meant you were worthless.</p>

<p>(Pause) And I was thinking — I don't know whether it was because I used the word here, I guess it was yesterday, more than I think I've ever used it before, or just when I was thinking this but — I know one time when I was thinking about my father's calling me a bitch.  And I j—, I can't remember when he started or how often he did it but I don't think he really called me that very often.  Well, my feeling is he called me that every day and, that he looked it at me even if he didn't say it.  And I don't know, sometimes with MSCZ now, I have the feeling that it's almost I go around thinking I'm a bitch, and I'm going to prove I am now.  And since I already am, there's no point trying not to be.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you know, I have the impression that you were thinking of yourself as a bitch yesterday and thinking that I felt you were.  And now today you seem to be working hard at school, meaning here, to make up for it —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Or undo it, or —</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, that makes me think again of this feeling of being mad at my parents and fighting and then doing just the things that I knew were important to them, to please them, despite how much I wanted to or not, like working hard. And it's as if I, whatever anger I fear, whatever I think of myself maybe because of that I don't dare not please you or not please them.  And all this business of sort of trying to be on my own and everything, it's almost as if I'm trying to prove to myself I can be, but I never really dare to test it out or really believe I can be.</p>

<p>(Pause) And then I think about how I feel about MSCZ and I wouldn't — if I didn't draw away from him and push him away, just like I have been in the last few weeks — I wouldn't have to be alone.  And yet some reason I just haven't lately been feeling what would be a case of making myself not act the way I wanted to act, and that doesn't mean anything then either.  And I don't know, it would seem, if I have this feeling, I would want to form a relationship with him so I wouldn't be alone and yet that's not what's happening.  My first thought was then, well maybe it's because I'm afraid of a new kind of relationship.  Maybe it'll work out as badly as the one with my parents, but — (pause) I don't know, it doesn't seem that could be, may be part of it, but I don't think that's it entirely.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I just thought of another patient in the book, the one I've just been reading about late_ lately, because the doctor has begun to work with different ones.  And this woman — I kept identifying with her because her father had died when she was around 6.  And I do—, I immediately thought of my feeling my father pulled away, at least he had MLWZ at that time.  And then the girl's mother, this one's mother, had to work.  So she was abandoned in a sense by her mother.  And neither happened to me but yet I think I felt that my parents had turned from me something else.  And then this girl had a brother who she felt was the favorite. And finally the thing that brought on her mental state, where she had to be institutionalized, was she had a baby and she didn't feel it was hers.  Well, there was a problem with the mother-in-law too which I didn't feel as much.  But mainly what's been pointed out about this woman so far is her terrific anger and hatred.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You said she had a baby that she didn't feel was hers?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I felt afraid when I read that because I've been identifying, "Here I am like her,"  here — not as severely but —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What does that mean to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, when I think of what it means to me, it has nothing to do with that case and why she felt that way.  But immediately I think, well it would be the baby that really was my mother's baby, and I was trying to have in her place, so I would be with my father, or close to my father, get my father's attention.  And so it wasn't really mine after all.  I'd stolen her place.</p>

<p>(Silence) And I was just thinking about the woman in this, the book.  And I don't know if I fully understand why she had the feeling, except that it has something to do with pleasing her mother-in-law who had taken the place of the mother.  And because her — apparently she got married young and then her mother died right after she got married.  And then I don't understand exactly whether the mother-in-law didn't like the baby once it came or whether she assumed the mother-in-law didn't, but anyway, there was some problem there.  And it just made me think again of what, how I could feel a baby wasn't mine?  Because I've sometimes known I've wanted a baby just for it to do something for me that I can't do on my own, maybe a variety of things.  And if it didn't, which it couldn't possibly, then maybe I, I mean the only feeling I would have had for it was as an instrument to use for something else or as a way to get something else and so I wouldn't be thinking of it for itself.  And so I could see, if it didn't work out I would, could have, very well have that same feeling of not really being the mother or somehow not, the baby not really being there or — I think it's one of the fears I've had because then I think what would happen in the end would be I'd get angry at the baby and take out these frustrations of things that didn't work out, on it.</p>

<p>(Silence) I think of this now and I, I just connected it with something that I've been feeling at home a lot lately.  And I don't know if it has anything to do with the mood I've been in lately, but I was just thinking now I'm feeling cold in here.  And sometimes I'll have no sleeves on and not be cold in here.  And I've been feeling cold at home a lot even on days when it hasn't been that cold.  Maybe the heat hasn't been on in the house, so it has been actually colder in the apartment than I realize, but I've been having trouble sometimes sleeping at night because I feel cold in bed, where I almost never feel cold.  Well, I shouldn't say trouble sleeping, but, I don't know, I've just been very aware lately of feeling cold a lot of the time.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

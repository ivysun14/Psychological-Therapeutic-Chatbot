<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, um, seen [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] twice and he referred you to me and you've had this relatively consistent anxiety and then some episodes of sadness?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The anxiety started first?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Is this something you've ever had before?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've had anxiety before, yeah.  I had it in 2005, 2006, when I was in grad school, but it wasn't consistent like it is now.  It was around finals and when I was doing my thesis and so I attributed it to that.  But now it's more consistent.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now was that the first one or that's the recent one?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's, no, I would say that's the first one.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is the second?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I had it during finals my first year of grad school and during my second year probably for like four months towards the end.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When was that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, say February through May '06.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  The first episode was?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> '05 and it was probably around May.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So the '05 to '06 including both episodes when you told me '05 to '06?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, and the first one lasted four months?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Lasted like just a month?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And when did this start?  When were you last like your normal self, whatever that is?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't really recall.  Probably January.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And how did this start and progress and?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't really know [INAUDIBLE] [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not why.  Not necessarily why, but like when's the first time, I don't know how you would know this, but like the first time you realized, um, yknow, or did it just slowly came on or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I would say it slowly came on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's not like one day you woke up and it wham?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  When it's less severe, I just deal with it.  But now I feel like it's more severe.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How recently did it get more severe?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Probably the last three or four months.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, then did you do anything the other times?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, in '06 my primary care physician put me on Lexapro, but I probably only took it for a month, maybe two.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did it help?  I mean, it went away and stuff?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's not clear?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Attributed it going away to graduating and being done with what I was doing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, I mean, that may have been related to that, but it's possible the medicine might have helped?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But it didn't hurt?  You didn't have side effects?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How much were you on?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't remember.  Once a day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Pill?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, once a day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Gave you samples?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no, I don't think so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, where did you go to grad school?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> An MPA [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What are you doing now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm a consultant for a medical device company.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Medical what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Device company.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Um, travel a lot?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I used to.  I'm not currently on the project that I'm on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you work for yourself or you work for an agency?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I work for a company that does, um, like best practice research for hospitals.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So they contract you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The company, you're an employee of the company?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm an employee of the company, and then I do [INAUDIBLE] projects for medical device companies.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Now, somewhere you wrote, and currently this project, you're not traveling, but you're working long hours?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like what kind of hours?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Seven to seven, longer than usual.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, are you in one of those sad periods now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mm, it comes and goes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You get angry?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Suicidal thoughts, homicidal, ever?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, suspicious, paranoid, hearing things, seeing things other people aren't hearing or seeing?  That's good.  You don't need that excitement.  It's enough.  Um, so no drug allergies and how long have you been on the -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Trivora?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, Trivora.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, forever.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Years?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Older brother, younger?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Younger.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Coffee, two cups a day, no different than last year or six months ago or three months ago?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I would say I drink more coffee than I used to.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Since when?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Since I started working, so since summer of '06, although I thought that might be contributing, so I am starting to drink decaf coffee now, but that's as of about two weeks ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  You haven't [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That hasn't miraculously cured you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, okay.  Um, and do you drink soda?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, not usually.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, how'd you do in school?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, lost things?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Do I lose things?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Cell phone, your keys?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.  You have nothing similar to your father and brother in terms of -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, all right.  Okay.  So your focus is down?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think as of -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, before, general, normally it's good?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, normally.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now what's it doing now?  Has it been worse during this time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, did that same thing at the perfect times when you're taking finals, studying?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'd sort of get antsy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, did you have the depression with the other episodes?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, not that I can remember.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Any problems falling asleep, staying asleep, getting up in the morning?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Falling asleep, not usually, but I do get up probably once a night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You able to fall back asleep and -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes yes, sometimes no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have trouble getting up in the morning?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Appetite normal for you?  Any weight changes recently?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think I've probably lost four or five pounds.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Intentionally?  That's good.  Energy level?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's good.  Motivation?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, depends what it is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Different than usual or that's the same as usual?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'd say that's a little different.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I feel bored at work, so I think I have less motivation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  That could also be from the depression and anxiety.  Uh, libido, like your interest is normal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Crying, empty, desperately sad?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've cried and not known why.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And, all right, some.  Um, things you can't stop thinking about, worry over and over and over?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Obsessions, compulsions?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Long-term memory is good?  Short-term?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hasn't been affected by this?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, but I write everything down, so it's hard for me to forget them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You always done that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm a big list maker.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And if you don't?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It stresses me out if I don't write something down because I think of it and forget it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you ever forget things?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So what, what did, um, the doctor do, what did he think, he thought you had an adjustment disorder?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He said he thought I had depression with my issue not so much the anxiety, and the anxiety was coming from the depression.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But no particular reason to cause the depression?  Or there was a reason?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think we're trying to figure it out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's what you're trying to figure it out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  But you are most bothered by what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It seems like your anxiety is -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, the anxiety I can, it's more, um, stress I guess.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you have like these episodes or are you just always anxious?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, sometimes, a little bit of both.  Sometimes it's like a consistent anxiety and then sometimes I kind of feel like I'm having a panic attack.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But at the best, there was some anxiety?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, there are some days when I don't feel anxious.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, what does it feel like?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's like a tightness in my chest.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is the regular anxiety?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I feel like I can't take a full deep breath.  And it, it's just kind of an uncomfortable feeling.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Heart beating faster?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sweating more or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't think so with the sweating.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Tingling, numbness?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, my shoulders feel very tight.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And then, um, you have these intermittent packs or whatever of panic like stuff?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, where I feel jittery.  I actually can kind of see it and not just feel it.  And I have shorter breaths.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What do you mean you can see it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like I feel like.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can see your hands shaking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A little bit, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] for the breath [INAUDIBLE] sweating or is your heart pounding in your chest?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My heart's pounding, yes.  It's not often.  I mean, that hasn't happened -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you scared?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's just anxious.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It doesn't, I mean, from this it doesn't make you feel like something horrible's gonna happen or you need to go to the hospital 'cause you're dying?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't feel like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How long do these last?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, half an hour.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you had your thyroid checked?  When you had these things before did you get checked out medically?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I never, only recently like actually felt like I had a panic attack and I've probably only had two over the course of I would say four months.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Um, how soon do you think you're going to get a primary care doctor?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Soon.  I actually have been looking for an internist, but.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just that it's better paying.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have lists from who's in network with your insurance?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Say again?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have a list of who's in network?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They have one, but then every time I call they don't take the insurance anymore, so I've just been trying to get recommendations from other people and doing it on my own and just calling and asking.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What do you have, [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's a good practice [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, I have no idea.  I can call them and see if they take your -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm actually in D.C.  so it's easier for me to find somebody there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's where you're working?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My parents live out here, so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you live in D.C.?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I live in D.C., yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  Where?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, [INAUDIBLE] doctors there.  But it's true they change and did you used to have different insurance?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I was under my parents' insurance until I started working.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Um, so this episode has been four months about?  Is that what you said?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This current anxiety, when did that start?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Maybe longer.  No, no, no, having this episode since January.  But I would say I didn't actually have like felt like I had a panic attack until about four months ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Four months ago.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The last one was probably two weeks ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, January, okay.  Oh, there was more severe over the last three or four months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So this is by far the longest.  So in July sometime maybe?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, you weren't depressed much at all the last three terms or you don't know?  You were somewhat depressed or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.  I never cried before.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you have sleep problems during that time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I would, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We know that you don't have side effects to Lexapro.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't take it very long.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So and you probably didn't take it long enough to know if it was helping or not helping or whatever.  I mean, unless you, yknow, unless you feel like you really don't want to try that again.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't feel like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't feel like that.  I think that might be good.  I'd like to also maybe give you some, a little bit of Xanax in case you have one of those major episodes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is that more like a one-time deal and it makes you feel better right away?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, just, yeah, but the first time you use it you need to be at home, not driving so you can test it to see what it does to you.  Generally it's a 1/4 mg, if you take one, and two and three, depends what you need, but you'll have to be at home so if you happen to get incredibly sedated from one, which not everybody does, you don't want to be stumbling around work.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or crashing.  As long as, and if you have never taken, one doesn't work much, the first time you take two, same thing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Same thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just to be, yknow, be on the safe side.  But I think with the Lexapro, I'm going to start you a little slower I think than probably you started last time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because you weren't having panic and sometimes when you have panic, it's very rare, but it's also, you don't have that, um, sense of doom or death with this, so I'm not, yknow, it's not a panic disorder, you're just having like you're panicking.  But if you start on the full dose there might be a slight risk that you'd have an increased the number of panic attacks in the first few days.  So we'll just have you cut one of them up and take for a few days, okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, when you're having all this anxiety you can continue to function at least enough?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not getting fired from your job or anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Let me see, you're working 12 hours and it would take someone else five hours to do your work?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you can focus enough.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I'm definitely not as focused, and there's like, I definitely like distract myself with other things.  But I attribute that to enjoying what I'm doing and being bored.  But I'm also -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but it also.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Fidgety.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it also just is probably due to the anxiety and depression as well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, if you're anxious and you've got other things going on, it's hard to.  Okay, um, all right, so, um, all right, this and [INAUDIBLE].  Anyway, I, um, I'll give you some samples.  I think that'll be, and you can start it, not of the Xanax, of the Lexapro so you can start.  And you know you don't have reactions to it since you've been on it, so but still I think I'd like to, um, let me see, start a little more slowly.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So if we do, I'll have you break, you can break these in half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They're not the easiest to break in half.  They're scored, but they break [INAUDIBLE] in half.  And then with the first one you can either cut that in one of the halves in half or scrape part of it off, so you end up taking a quarter vaguely the first two days.  Then you can go to the half for eight days and then to the whole one.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right?  Start taking it in the morning.  If you're one of the small percent of people that it makes tired, switch it to the evening.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If you have any problems or have unusual side effects, call.  Normal side effects, it's very rare to have any stomach upset, headaches, you're not jittery but sort of like a little hyped up or agitated, not common, that kind of stuff.  All right.  Here's the directions which [INAUDIBLE] you can read them.  And the Xanax, um, is I told you about that.  The sedation is the main, yknow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And we know you don't have any drug allergies.  If you develop any while you're seeing me, just let me know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So I can keep up, um, up to date.  Read this thing and here's the pen.  Sign that.  That just says we talked about the medicine.  You're giving me permission to give it to you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So basically you're going to end up with an extra, did I write eight days on that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> On the other one?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Lexapro, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, eight days before taking the full one.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  Now I'll write the Xanax, it's one to two or a day as needed for an anxiety attack.  But you'll know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And, yknow, just keep on with.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And we'll see if it works.  If it's too sedating, even one of them, you can try a half.  All right, 0.25 mg, one to two.  All right.  There's this.  That's the generic.  And here's this to submit.  And let me know if there's a problem.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So do I need, do I fill any of this out or is this done?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I did it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You did it, okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> One of us does it, but this one actually has my original signature like that.  No, it's not.  All right.  So let's do -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is this for the Lexapro and the Xanax?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'm going to give you, give you the Lexapro.  I don't have samples of that.  But I'd like to see you back, I don't know, call if there's problems.  You wanted to go three weeks?  Normally I do somewhere between two and three weeks, but you all right with three or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm okay with three.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, all right, three.  So we'll do one in three weeks and then one three weeks after that, and then four weeks after that and four weeks after that.  Okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.  The reason I'm doing this is in three weeks there's not a whole, probably won't be a whole much of a choice when you can get in.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In six weeks and in ten weeks and in fourteen weeks there will be.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So if you give this to [NAME OTHER], she'll set you up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For those.  Okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, also going to give her this as well.  Um, Lexapro 10 mg.  She'll give you the samples.  Just give this to her.  She'll give you the Lexapro samples.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And I've given you a copy of those.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  And, um, I mean you're seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And if you have side effects or problems or something weird happens, yknow, call.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Will do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks very much.  Appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  If this doesn't work out I believe there's 50 other things.  I mean -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow, I mean the odds are pretty good it'll work the first time, yknow.  Other than that, but if it doesn't, then we'll try, yknow, until we get you where you want to be and you're functioning normally.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  Thanks, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nice to meet you too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> See you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You want this open or closed?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, open's good.  Thanks.  Bye.  </p>

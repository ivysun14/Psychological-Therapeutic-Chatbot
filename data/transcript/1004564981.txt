<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not a whole lot. One of the things I've been thinking about that we've been talking about is how sometimes people tend to show themselves in my life as not being especially - the word good is not really the word for it but have the most (pause) actions intentions being the most honorable that I sometimes still give them the benefit of the doubt. And I've given a lot of thought as to why I feel that way about that. And I think the big thing is, is that I by nature have had that experience in my life more than a few times like as in people have decided I was doing something - that I had a lot of less than kind (pause) intentions when I've not. I've either been oblivious of I've been this or I've been that and they've assumed that things are... And so I try really hard to give people the benefit of the doubt much longer than I should. [00:01:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So...</p>

<p>CLIENT: This hurt me so badly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You in a way imagine that the other person might be sort of in a situation like you where you're thinking they're malintended, but they're really not it's just that you're not clear somehow...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually especially if there's a zero energy lost from me doing so; not always though. But especially if there's a zero energy loss I will always treat them like they have good intentions. But if they don't - it depends - but a lot of times I'm willing to give people more chances than it's worth. It's just because the fact that it has bothered me so much in my life when I have been told what my intentions are and not only are they not true but they hadn't even occurred to me like kind of true. [00:02:15]</p>

<p>One of the hard things for me, for example, is I have been told that I am basically being very - how to explain it - snotty and kind of full of myself when usually I'm just so shy that I don't really - like I've always thought that was such a weird thing. But I've gotten this feedback from people, usually family members, not immediate, but my in-laws, but other people in my life too. When I'm feeling especially shy about certain situations that they perceive this as being very like I'm too good for you behavior when it is I am in a situation where I'm very much stressed out by. Or even just thinking that I'm being snotty and I'm ignoring you but actually what's happening is I am so focused on whatever I'm seeing in front of me that I don't even notice that you're looking or saying anything to me. [00:03:16]</p>

<p>And so I found that so hurtful that people had such (pause) - that people assumed such terrible intentions from me that I'm willing to give people a lot more of the doubt than most if that makes sense. To the day it's bothered me to find out that people sometimes think shyness is haughtiness and that's not the same thing at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, they both involve some reserve but (inaudible at 00:04:00).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's something where it's always bothered me. In general, and this is something that very few people in my life have really gotten. I've only had like maybe a handful of people outside of my husband who understands that I'm actually an introverted person who fakes being extroverted. And so when they find out that I really need the downtime of not being around people, they're almost always shocked like completely shocked. I'm like yeah I really like to read and sometimes at the end of the day I just need to be not interactive because I get a lot of my energy from being by myself. And I mean I don't need to be by myself a lot, but I fake being extroverted. I mean I kind of half to. But it's almost always a shocker for people to find that out that I do find sometimes being around a lot of people to be overwhelming. And so they perceive sometimes - now mind you this is my in-laws. This is crack. [00:05:13]</p>

<p>When I was at a family reunion, and I'd just gotten married, and we were out in San Diego, and I was meeting all these people and by hour two I'm like I'm going to go upstairs and lay down for a little bit. They thought this was an attention getting scheme. No, this was like as in I'm a only child from a family that although it's large it isn't that - I mean some of it's gregarious but not like this. And I'm meeting all these new people and I am physically exhausted. I just need some time not being on stage. It wasn't I was looking for attention. Actually I was trying to get away from attention. So I tend to always assume, especially if it doesn't cost me anything emotionally, at least at the time I think it doesn't, that it's going to be easier. But... [00:06:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think yeah you often have to work hard to be around people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I (inaudible at 00:06:22) figuring out what's going on. I don't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are certain situations that I am super, super comfortable in and I can throw myself into. And they're are ones that would most people would find to be very stressful. Like I had made jokes about the fact that I can socially engineer myself into jobs. I just put myself in the right situation. That to me is something that I learned at a very young age and, therefore, that doesn't bother me in the least to be in that kind of situation. Pardon me. I just need to make sure that isn't anything big. But it's normally the big things. It's the small things that I find to be very difficult like the high stakes game of having my in-laws come to visit and having to make small talk with them in the car. That's really hard for me. [00:07:22]</p>

<p>If it is something that is professionally or at least academically related, it doesn't bother me. One of the people out there who... It's a long story but my dad is heavily encouraging me to ask this author who used to be around here who... It's such a weird thing. Okay, there's an author that I read a lot of his books, and he's coming next week to town for his new book. I sort of know him by the fact that I knew... I think when we sat down I asked you if you were related to Doctor Goldberg from Brown; Harry Goldberg. [00:08:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have met Harry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I knew you weren't but... Okay, so he's colleagues with [inaudible]. I knew Harry Goldberg because I did a lot of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Isn't he a scientist?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I did a lot of neural network research and, therefore, we had big relations and we were asking questions about... Yeah. So I knew him vaguely related to that. But my dad's like why don't you just go up to ask him and see if you can interview for a job with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is with Shipman?</p>

<p>CLIENT: With Shipman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who's also a neural network guy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He also does a lot of behavioral. He's technically an economist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I heard his name.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He did "The Upside of Irrationality" and "Predictably Irrational". However, I would really, really like to work out basically because of all the AI things I've done potentially making neural networks that behave irrationally would be something that would be fascinating and would help for modeling. But he sort of combines game theory with social theory with economics because he does a lot of the stuff on a micro economics scale. And my dad's like oh just go right up to him and talk to him. And I was like okay, sure. And it's funny because that is exactly the way I was bred to do that and raised to do that. And I probably will actually ask him but that kind of stuff I have no fear about at all. Vaguely famous author but who I have a relationship (inaudible at 00:09:37) with that I can say hey I would love to be able to try and see if we could do some validation on a logic based scale. That would be cool. We'll see what happens. [00:09:52]</p>

<p>But that's kind of the thing that I'm not afraid of. I mean I grew up not being afraid of it at all. Like I said, part of it's the fact I was raised that way. Part of it was the fact that I think that in Montessori school that they really encourage that kind of behavior; that kind of thing. And so I kind of feel weird though because it seems so strange to be a in situation where I feel uncomfortable with all kinds of people in my life like my in-laws, and I have no problems at all walking up to people that I've never met in the entire world and just starting a conversation and seeing where it goes. And it's not like... I originally thought it was zero risk because I don't know these people, but it's not that at all. It's just that these people don't have a track record of hurting me. It's not that I don't know them or anything like that. It's just that I have sort of compartmentalized the whole poisonous behavior of my in-laws into being like some sort of creepy microcosm of themselves and just assume the rest of the world doesn't behave that way. I sure hope not because it's just really screwed up. They see things when things are not there and all that stuff you know. (Pause) And it seems to be that, like I said, with certain situations I am so awkward coming in here because I don't normally let people see that much. Although I'm very honest about things, I don't talk about these kind of things in such a frank way. And I actually end up spending about an hour afterwards decompressing and getting back to who I am. [00:11:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah which is weird. I am a person who thinks about just when it's on for quite a while and rethinks a lot. And so it takes me a while to sort of get that analysis of what was going on out of my system. I'm like this with many meetings. Whenever I have something that is very intense, whether it be like planning on a work related scale or something scientific, I always have this delayed action. If I see a movie that is especially cerebral or something it takes me a while to get past that. Not to get past but to sort of be done analyzing it and get back to who I am. [00:12:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine there are things that (pause) can be upsetting or worrisome (pause) about being here and talking to me in this way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is that. It's also the fact that I am making a huge effort and not to make things happier or to automatically switch things. I almost always look for the bright side of things. I try making a very big effort in terms of not making - trying to read what you want and get that exactly to you. I work in an industry where that's what I have to do for a living is figure out what they want and make them happy. [00:13:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So giving your more authentic version of what things are like and what's going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So (pause) I'm just naturally a positive person and, therefore, to the point of sometimes squelching the negative.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I appreciate your (inaudible at 00:13:57).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to have this much candor in my life because it's not who I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And that understanding like really quite unusually for you to do so really against the grain, and really a lot of work, and really... [00:14:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am one of those people that unfortunately sometimes focusing on the negative does not get it out of my system. Like there's a lot of times where people say oh well have you talked about this with this somebody? Not necessarily with a therapist but just like talk to a friend. Sometimes that actually gets me into this loop of self - like I come out of it feeling worse than I - You know what I mean? I can wallow if I let myself and, therefore, the mechanism of not letting myself do it is like that. The same reason why and I tell this to people well people always ask me you don't own a TV? Well part of the reason why I don't is because I can't afford a new one. But for a long time I didn't watch television. Why? Because I would sit down and I would not be able to get back up from it. I'd get stuck in the loop of whatever it is. [00:15:00]</p>

<p>And so same thing with the wallowing thing. It was very easy to just get into this giant pity party of myself and how sad I am about it and never really get it off my chest. I mean it's not always that way. I mean there's a point in which I've had the cathartic I've cried it all out of me and, therefore, I'm going to be okay. But most of the time it just never felt like it got better. Sometimes I felt like it got worse. And so I think that's the biggest reason why I do try and keep positive is because I know that I am so prone to get down into the negative. And once I start getting negative about certain things, especially certain people... If I decide that I get to the point where I've decided that they're negative, they can do no right in my eyes. And I don't like that because people do change. People have different motivations and different things. And a person who may be a complete and total jerk to their ex-wife does not necessarily mean that they are a terrible father or that they are going to necessarily be a bad person to their friends or whatever. [00:16:15]</p>

<p>I have a very close friend of mine who's ex-husband at the very end of their marriage became a complete and total jerk. A person against everything that I knew and it sort of galvanized me because he did not seem like the kind of person would hit anybody. And therefore, it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like his kids?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. At the very, very end yes. And so that sort of made me into the he can do no right. He shouldn't be allowed to walk around in society. He cannot be trusted around his children. The only thing in his life he ever hit that was ever well known was at the end and that was with one person, but I decided just like that. It's like sometimes when I let myself get to that point where I'm just like I feel like I should warn people before they date him that sometimes he hits people. [00:17:07]</p>

<p>I'm not really actually making that but I'm saying that if I was around a lot - and this is someone who I knew better than my friend Penny. I knew Even well before I knew Penny. He was my fraternity brother. I've know technically for years. I was in their wedding. This is not something that I would normally believe in. But once I heard that it just made me very much like a person who would hit somebody else who was defenseless is a terrible human being. That's not true though. That's not really true. But I'm saying I can swing the other direction and then someone could do no right in my eyes. I do everything I can not to... And this is what I'm saying for him because I'm trying very hard not to be like that with him. My instinct is to be like okay little bastard I should... If I get called up to ask him for anything related to security clearance which he had - I've been a reference at a security clearance before - hell if I'm going to be giving him anything good. [00:18:04]</p>

<p>But that's not true and it has nothing to do with who he is as a person in terms of being a security risk. But I fight that with certain people and that's part of the reason why I also try to see people in the best of light because I don't want to - I don't like the fact that I am, by nature, very much (pause) don't deal well with shades of grey. Because of things that are foreign to me like a person who is a cheater on one person to me is a cheater in general; not necessarily just because of that one person in that relationship. A person who will hit somebody in their relationship is a person who will hit for life. Because I don't understand in my own head why anyone would do that I sort of defaulted. I can't really say okay that's not necessarily true for every situation. [00:19:09]</p>

<p>(Pause) But it's (pause) something that I just instinctively feel and, therefore, I am instinctively positive because I know that I have a very dark side and I can be very negative to people. And therefore, I have to - I don't know - just have to keep looking to the positive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like being positive is one of the few ways you can sort of exert more control over the more negative.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not just the control of the negative. I can control how I view it in general because I can decide what angle I'm going to see this from the positive if that makes sense. [00:20:15]</p>

<p>And so it's a pain, but it seems to keep me from getting hurt. (Pause) Unfortunately it also allows certain people to consider me to be very immature because of that. I'm not really sure why but they seem to think that my black and white view of the world is very immature. But you know what it works for me. I'm not judging other people necessarily saying that they have to do it that way. It's just who I am you know. [00:21:08]</p>

<p>(Pause) It's actually really hard for certain things. I think the other reason why I get kind of like this is... Speaking of things related to game theory I could easily get into - I don't know. It's hard to explain this. In game theory there's a point in which you're trying to think so much about the options that you get that you become paralyzed. They refer to it as analysis paralysis. You try to think through it and you can't do anything so you do nothing which is often worse than nothing at all. If I let myself rethink things too much, which I can, I get stuck. And so it's sort of like this in the algorithm of how I think if it gets caught too far I just have to say okay if default this, then decide to give positive. [00:22:02]</p>

<p>That's the only way I can do it because if I don't I'll get stuck analyzing the most minute behavior which is exhausting. I'm not one for playing games in general, therefore, I try really hard to try and simplify things. (Pause) It does make it emotionally easier. It's hard analyzing different people to figure out what's going on. Sometimes it's just exhausting for me at least. I think that's the biggest reason why I am sometimes mind-blowing blunt about certain situations. It is because of the fact that I don't want anyone to have to think about that. If someone says oh what restaurant do you want to go to and I say I don't care. I don't care in many situations considered to be a manipulative tactic. I will never say I don't care unless I literally do not care about something. I try really hard to be as honest about that kind of thing because I find that kind of behavior to be annoying. And I really, really hate it when people think that that's what I'm doing. [00:23:31]</p>

<p>Also when I say something like I asked one to do something and I actually say never mind that is not a manipulative sting. That literally means I have rethought it and I don't need to do this after all. Please do not keep going with this. And it's very frustrating because even people that I know very, very well - even with my own family with the never mind thing - they don't really get it. They don't mean never mind it and oh I really wish you'd still do it. No, it's never mind I realize that I do not need to do this or things don't need to be done this way. But it's hard because I (pause) don't like the fact that the world isn't as straight and forward like that as possible because it's exhausting. [00:24:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure and it really isn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think you tend to work these things out in your head more so than (pause) - like I think you tend to be more on the kind of cerebral rational end of the spectrum about these sorts of things than on the sort of by feel intuitive end of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And one of the things that was a massive culture shock to me and I still get like this with some particular cultures - On my in-law side of things as you get further out from his nuclear family you get to the Italian side of the family and this is that kind of speak of you're dead to me and oh my God I'm going to go lay down and die kind of behavior that can drive me up the wall. Sometimes it's amusing because they'll say things like I am literally dying over here and I go if that were... Do you understand? Have you processed this? I know that English is your second language; that kind of thing. [00:25:44]</p>

<p>But those kind of phrases drive me up the wall and that whole oh my gosh, no, no, no, I understand that you're a big boy now and you don't need to be around me anymore that kind of stuff just makes me want to claw my eyes out and run away. I can't handle that. And I even get driven up the wall a little bit by on my mom's side of the family who are super, super well educated and then they do stupid superstitious things. But at the same time I understand that's part of a culture thing. I try really hard to the see Italian thing being cultural too. Like I have astrophysicists in my family who still when they lose things put candy in the mortar and pestle so that Baba Yaga can help them find things. They don't really believe that but these are like all of the things about these old stories still get passed down. They still do it. They just don't think it really happens. [00:26:48]</p>

<p>And so that kind of stuff drives me up the wall too, but since I've been doing it for so long it doesn't - I've got a thicker skin for that. That and nobody ever tells me that I'm drowning my mother or anything like that. I've heard that okay once you get further out from Mike's family some of them are not actually from the U.S. so you get these amazingly the translation of what's being said is a lot more horrifying to me than what do you do when you're drowning your mother. I'm sure that this is an idiom that makes a lot more sense in Italian. And I kept telling him well you know we can just cut off that side of the family, and we can just be French you know. And he is a super sensitive person in general and that kind of drives him crazy too. But that is a lot to have to deal with in terms of that. Maybe if I'd grown up in it I'd be a lot more tolerant. But he grew up in it and he finds that to be a very big culture shock too. So that's a hard thing to deal with. If I ever had my family saying things like that to me I would probably be in tears every day of my life because it seems like everything is being told that you're being destructive. [00:28:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's just very hard for me. And I'm saying - I'm generalizing on this. I'm not saying everybody is like that. But coming in as an outside doing that it was pretty hard for me. That's just it's hard. But yeah, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My impression is it gets really overwhelming really fast.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I try to keep it positive in me like well I was going to go see Don Giovanni but instead I'm going to go spend some time around the drama of this. Like I try to make it at least amusingly positive. It's the only way I can do it. Otherwise it's really not that charming but if I claim it's charming it makes it easier to deal with. Just like I have these generalizations that I speak of because it's hard really. [00:29:17]</p>

<p>I don't like to lie to people when people ask me questions about my in-laws like oh do you get along with them. I'm like not really. And then they're like oh well tell me. Well I should've just lied and said sure but it's not true so I have these quick things of explaining it's kind of like watching some sort of reality television show but with people of advanced degrees in terms of like Maury Povich or something that's really bad in terms of that. I mean it's the only way that I can explain it because I don't want to talk about it that much. But to explain how - I have to compartmentalize it. I have to find some quick way to describe it otherwise it's just overwhelming to me. It's really overwhelming to me. [00:30:06]</p>

<p>I really don't like to - I mean I have told people because everyone wants to know, but I don't really tell people much about it because it's just too painful but it's also too complicated. It is not like what most people have with their in-laws. Everyone understands the in-laws that want to come visit all the time and ask when you're making babies. If I said that everyone was like oh yeah. I understand that. But this is different than what is culturally understood and, therefore, this kind of behavior even though it is also just as dysfunctional, as someone who doesn't... It's just hard you know. I am somewhat grateful that this year I have really honest to goodness stopped giving a damn about my mother-in-law in terms of wanting her to like me. I give a damn about what she says about things because it's a pain in the ass. [00:31:07]</p>

<p>Like I spent almost 18 years of my life trying to make her happy and wanting her to like me or at least minimally not liking. But the point in which she said that she didn't have time to come out and take care of him when they thought that Mike was going to get some pretty invasive brain surgery, that's the point in which I realized fuck this. Honestly. Like later on she said well maybe I can take off a day or two. I'm like yeah that means you become a guest which is the last thing I need. I wanted you to come here and help. I wanted you to help me deal with it because at the time it was going to be a really bad open wound. I need someone who can help me not someone I have to pick up at the airport and entertain for a day and then send them back. So that really changed my mind about her and I have always secretly - I know I said terrible things, which were absolutely 100 percent true about her, to people I was close to I always secretly hoped that one day she'd wake up and like me and she didn't. [00:32:12]</p>

<p>And once I realized that no matter what she... I don't know if it was because of me or just in general that she is so damned selfish but I once I realized that she was not going to come and help him for things that he needed, and I had sort of almost forgave her for her bullshit with not coming to see him graduate but not really, but that's like life or death stuff. And that just made me realize you know what I don't care. That and she supposedly only gives a damn about two men in her life and she treats them both badly, and I've also seen that this year as she's been taking care of Mike's grandfather.</p>

<p>Since she decided to ignore what Mike had to say. Mike's grandfather they want to take his gall bladder out and Mike's like that's kind of dangerous at his age because you don't use general anesthesia like you're supposed to. And she's like oh yeah, I'll talk to the anesthesiologist. And then she called three days afterwards which when it was all said and done it was a manipulation tactic so she didn't have to hear Mike saying that this is a stupid idea. He knows people who work in anesthesia who said that post 90, 95 you don't do it unless it's life threatening or at least quality of life threatening. And so she just decided to call him three days after it to let him know that he had the surgery; that kind of stuff. Well obviously she didn't care that much. She wanted to have it done. I don't know why. And I don't know. [00:33:44]</p>

<p>If she started being nice to me and started liking me I wouldn't care. I would always be that I realize now that you abuse my husband. Whether or not you hit him, which I doubt, but you neglected him. You didn't leave him alone but you neglected him while he was in the same fucking house. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if you were 100 feet away and you neglected a shadow of my husband. And it makes me so angry that there is nothing that can make me want her approval and (inaudible at 00:34:22). Which is bad. I don't think I'll go out of my way to piss her off that much. But it's coming to light that - I mean - his lack of memory was a defense mechanism not just like a oh that's a weird quirk that he doesn't remember anything before the age of high school. [00:34:46]</p>

<p>But I've been really pressing him to go see a new - what's it called - endocrinologist. Hopefully that will help. And this is one of those things where normally you shouldn't be doing this but there is apparently a tremendous amount of memory leakage with one's cortisone levels. I mean there's a lot of... He hasn't been making cortisone all his life; not very well. So not that I'm looking for them to find a resolution as to why it is that he doesn't have these memories, but I think that there's something linked into that because his pituitary's not normal. I'm starting to think that maybe this is a biological reaction to his environment. It's the only thing that seems normal at this point; not that it's like that anymore but I mean during his formative years. And he needs to have somebody who wants to treat his problem with cortisone as opposed to just giving him testosterone which sort of fixes the problem but not really. It doesn't make it anything better just (inaudible 00:36:07) band-aid on the problem. So I don't know. We'll see. [00:36:13]</p>

<p>I hate when I have to get involved in these things though because I feel like I'm a pushy wife. I hate being that pushy wife. I sort of spend a lot of time trying not to be that way which, again, is exhausting. I mean I'm supposed to give a damn about what goes on (inaudible at 00:36:32) you know. But whenever I go with him to appointments it seems like everyone's always shocked that I'm there so I'm like well I'm so embarrassed to even be there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My understanding is that he can also be quite passive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Very passive. He doesn't have an active role plus on top of it he doesn't always remember things. The only people that ever really encouraged me to come in with him was the pulmonary doctor when it was sleeping because they almost always want the spouse because the person who's having sleep problems tends to not be - like notice if they're doing these things, but most of the time they don't remember that kind of stuff. So that's pretty much what's been in my mind lately. (Pause) I can't much. [00:37:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I do appreciate the way you're kind of - when you come in sort of letting your defenses down when you come in here and not being positive in that way sort of risking getting more in the muck of the bad things that you feel, and things that you feel, and things that can also make you not feel good about yourself, or you're sort of - maybe you also feel this way like not being as nice as you should be. [00:38:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I swear more in these sessions than I do the entire week. I'm not a swearing person. But in general though it's very, very hard to do this, and it's (pause) - because I'm trying very hard to spend the time reading you and giving you what you want, and I spend almost my entire life doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it clear what I want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I try not to think about it. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actively try not to even let that... A couple of times you've asked oh am I boring you and I'm like I haven't thought that far ahead. I'm trying really hard to limit my thoughts on that kind of stuff so that I don't influence my behavior if that makes sense. Yet I have to otherwise I will start subconsciously giving people what they want. And it's a pain in the ass but it's true. [00:39:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well frankly (pause) the irony is if you're speaking openly and honestly about what matters to you, what's really on your mind, with that much regard for what I want to hear it kind of is probably what I want if anything. You know what I mean? Like I don't think about wanting you to say anything particular but if I said something it would be what matters to you, what's on your mind, how do you really think and feel about things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I appreciate that because, like I said, I'm trying very hard not to think about that. So it's weird because if I start opening that door... I'm the kind of person, by the way, who has gone to massage therapy and has been stressed out because of the fact that I'm not relaxing enough. And I have to cut off thinking about or doing certain things in certain situations and compartmentalize it or otherwise the activity becomes worthless. So yeah... And it's hard but for certain situations I sort of have to cut off my over analyzation (sp?) of everything. [00:40:32]</p>

<p>Same reason why I always schedule surgeries as quickly as possible because I know I need them so I don't think about it otherwise I get time to be afraid. I do all the other things where I have to cut off any chances of me over thinking things. I have to put myself in situations where I cannot over think it otherwise (pause) it changes the way I do the task (pause) which is funny because I actually do that with the chronic pain. Although I'm in pain I do not think about it and try not to talk about it when I'm in a lot about things. People are like oh well do you want to talk about it? I'm like no. Talking about it actually makes it worse. I'm not trying to distract myself from it. I'm trying to not focus on it. They're like oh well are you sure? I'm like yes, trust me. [00:41:37]</p>

<p>I am sometimes (inaudible at 00:41:46)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're working, I think, working incredibly hard pretty much all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. My mind's always going, always looking to pick up some sort of... I do a lot of small consulting, or some sort of freelance thing, or trying to do something. I am working - like my mind is working all the freaking time. It is exhausting. Sometimes it's kind of awesome because I'll do something like I'll be getting a drink, and I'll notice the capillary action in the straw which is kind of cool, but at the same time (pause) certain things ruin it. [00:42:32]</p>

<p>Like my doing composite video special effects is really going to see explosion films because I'm like yeah now I'm analyzing it all. That is not that big of a deal because I haven't seen a movie in five years but at least at a theater. My mind is always working and breaking things out into component parts and figuring out how this relates to something else (pause) and I can't turn it off. I really can't. I was like that as a very small child, and I think, at least for me, it is better to embrace it and just be like well that's kind of is cool that I do this than to try to turn it off because turning it off tends to add more stress to me. Then I get upset that I can't do that. For certain things I have to but for most things I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:43:50).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tuesday. [00:43:52]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>THERAPIST: Client 0735-103, 1970, session number 12. You have to turn the handle, yeah. It's temperamental. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I didn't mean to interrupt your other session here.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's okay. We were just about finished. 

</p><p>PATIENT: There wasn't anybody downstairs to call up here. So obviously, take my chances. Oh, things have changed. Just a little bit about the not paying the bills, going to my boss seems to have taken a different outlook on me.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh really.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, he's given me a new project to work on. So, I've started that. I'm going to work this one different. Start it out in a real business like manner, you know. Actually and what has been done, sizing up what needs to be done and going about it in an orderly fashion just to kind of show him that I'm capable of something I think he hasn't given me credit for. But this just happened. He just gave me this project yesterday. So, can't really say how much his attitude might have changed for awhile yet. But it was kind of funny. (1:59)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Something about the businesslike way you went about exploring the project with him. Did you make him take the really different attitude?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, no, like I said, I haven't had the project long enough to explore what his attitude is towards the way I'm approaching it, but, like I said, I think I'll go about it in an orderly fashion.

</p><p>THERAPIST: I mean, you've decided to approach it with a different attitude. I see, I see. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And just in case I still am working there six months from now when the raises do come out maybe I'll, like you said, maybe he'll try to do better by me next time. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Is it sort of like you decided to try and give it another whirl? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Something on that. Just looking for a job is getting kind of discouraging. You know, I've been looking for another job for about (inaudible at 3:16) months now. I haven't made any progress. It's like well there maybe a chance that I won't find another job and I'll have to stay with this one. 

</p><p>Even if I do give it up and leave I'll still, if I'm on this for say a month maybe, I think I can still prove to him that he's losing something when I do go. (3:51)

</p><p>THERAPIST: And that would be a satisfaction.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it would be kind of a, it's a good way to leave anyhow. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you sound kind of happy about that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just the idea of having somebody have a little faith in you. It may be a project that they don't ever intend to do anything with and he's just kind of stalling me out, you know, just kind of giving me something to do, which in a way I didn't really have that much to do. And it seemed like up until oh, say this week for instance, they had kind of, well we'll just give him, you know, these little petty projects that, to me, don't amount to much. So, now they have seemed to developed a little bit of faith in me and decided to give me something that's well, to me, it seems fairly adequate for my ability. And talk about well I'll just take a last swing at it, you know. I've got two strikes maybe and I'll swing hard at the next ball and see if I can hit it. I notice you can hit a homerun with one swing. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like now that he finally is willing to pitch a ball at you even work's (inaudible at 5:29) alright you'll give it a try. I mean, it's the indication that some faith in you means something. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it does. I think most people are this way. If you give them a chance to prove their ability and they have the ability they'll prove it. Whereas, if you just give them, well this, is where I'd like to be in a situation where I could have two or three people working under me. See, where I could kind of prove out these theories, but you assay a person's ability and give them a project they're capable of handling and if they successfully complete it then you give them a harder one next time. (6:18)

</p><p>Some of the projects, I think, that he's given me up until now have been beyond my ability and of course I have failed, in my sight anyhow. And now he has, now, in there for awhile it was why we just won't give him anything important he might turn out. So now it's, well we'll give him this project and I guess maybe, you know, see how he handles that and if he handles that good why maybe we can give him something more important next time. And so I'm accepting it as if it was a very high priority project, which it really isn't and I'm going to work at it at that rate, see. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You kind of, like, see if you can develop more trust too.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, see, you never can tell I might have to be there until I retire. 

</p><p>Keep wondering what type of reaction my wife is going to have to this late hour session. And it's kind of funny, I guess you'd say, because I think that she's going to react one way and if she doesn't it's going to surprise me. (8:07)

</p><p>In fact I think she's already, excuse me, already reacted to it in a certain way. Some reason or other she got a hold of one of her old girlfriends last night that she used to run around with. And this girlfriend has a, plus she's divorced, and to me she has this sort of an adverse affect on her. And some of the people that this girlfriend associates with are not what I consider real, you know. Well, they'll say one thing to you and turn around and say another to someone else. And so, she wanted to go out and have coffee with this girlfriend last night. And I told her I didn't want her to and she didn't. She was kind of moody about it after that, you know, kind of she wanted to, but she wouldn't go against what I said. That's unusual too. 

</p><p>So, I think when I get home tonight there's going to be one of two reactions. Either the cold shoulder or an indifferent attitude, you know. And I expect to get the kind of cold shoulder and first chance she gets she'll try to come up with something where she can, you know, well for lack of a better word where she can kind of sneak off, you know. It's not really what she'll do, I don't think, but she'll react to it that way I think because I don't know if she really thinks I'm having a session or not, see. (9:52)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like maybe she's suspicious and she's going to want to get back at you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, she'll want to get back at me. That's the way she reacts a lot of times whenever I have something that she's suspicious of. She gets back by doing something equally suspicious. At least that's the way I see it anyhow.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Does that say anything to you a little bit?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, like I say, I have this set pattern I'd like for her to fall into, but she won't. For two reasons, she's not that type of person and she doesn't want to be that type of person. She's not really that type of individual and I keep trying to make her that type of individual and she keeps fighting it. 

</p><p>But I can see it all now. I'll go home and, of course, she'll fix me some supper and then I'll want to flop down and watch the TV, the football game, see. And I can just predict right now that I'm going to get static because she'll want to watch some other program. And our taste in programs don't agree, which is understandable. And right at the moment we only have one TV, see. So, we have to kind of fight it out as to who gets to watch their program that they want to watch. A lot of the times I'm not too relenting either. I could stand to watch Tom Jones or something like that maybe, but I fight it because there's a game on another channel. I like to watch games, see. I always get this oh, that's a rerun and I keep telling her nothing's a rerun until you've seen it. (11:49)

</p><p>Do you have classes all day on Friday? Is that why the late hour?

</p><p>THERAPIST: I don't have any classes, but I am kind of writing something and wanted a long stretch to work in.

</p><p>PATIENT: Back in grad school I used to have these study sessions. I had 30 or so students, you know, in the afternoons and they'd go from, I guess from 2:00 to 5:00 or something like that and 1:30 to 5:00. Anyway, it was kind of a late hour and at the time, well I'm still that way to a certain extent, whenever, you know, get rid of all of them so I could get on out and get home. And I think if I ever had a counseling session or, you know, help them out with their problems or something at that late hour I'd say well, can't we take care of it next week, you know, or a little earlier or something?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Were you wondering if you were only semi-welcome at that hour?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, in a way. I kind of suspected that there wouldn't be anybody in the office, you know. And I came down and thought well maybe they work until 6:00 or something down here or something like that. But of course there wasn't anybody there and so I go, well, I'll wait until about 5:30 and then I'll go on upstairs. I got here at 5:15, something like that. Thought well I'll go upstairs and, but when I noticed your schedule book the other day I didn't notice anything in front of it, you know. 

</p><p>I thought well, she might just have decided this would be after the 5:00 class got out or something, you know. Kind of when I got to the door and there was a do not disturb sign on it. Maybe she just left that sign out there by accident and I'll just tap on the door and see if there's anybody here because I thought there for awhile that you might have said 3:30 and I misunderstood you or something. I didn't even pay attention to the thing. I just took it downstairs and put it in the box. (14:13)

</p><p>The last few days I've had this, I don't know, more optimistic outlook on things. Where well nothing much happened today, maybe something will happen tomorrow type of thing, you know. And I don't know, this, is something I think you have to develop, have to work at, I guess. 

</p><p>It's kind of discouraging when you can boil all this down into ten minutes of meaningful dialogue because I sit here and think.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Gee, I don't feel like your sitting there and thinking is bad.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, but it has me on thinking. Maybe my mind's just blank and I'm sleeping. (16:00)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Is that what happened? 

</p><p>PATIENT: With my eyes open. No really. Who do you buy the copies of Seed from? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I think that's a girl that I've seen before.

</p><p>PATIENT: There's a whole stack of them down in the lobby I noticed.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no, that's a (inaudible at 16:22).

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh did she? I glanced at one and I hope she didn't mind.

</p><p>THERAPIST: I'm sure she didn't.

</p><p>PATIENT: Anything interesting in it?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Haven't got, you know, I haven't had a chance to look at it yet.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think I saw one one time. Somebody had one there at the lab. If I'd known that I would've bought one from her.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Were you thinking that we're not getting as much done as you'd like for us to do? You know, like when you said that about you're being quiet.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, you know, at first there I was curious about when we'd have this session where you tell me what my problem was and suggested some solutions to it maybe. And I've developed this different attitude towards it. Now it's just a session where we come in and talk to the tape recorder and I talk, you know, and listen to myself maybe. And sit here and maybe learn about myself. And so, I don't feel I'm wasting my time. I had my suspicions sometime that you might feel you're wasting your time with this.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well no. 

</p><p>PATIENT: So, that's why I bring out things like that every once in awhile. Like the other day I got off on talking about the trees and the rain. It has nothing to do with the therapy. (17:56)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well, you know, like if you never talked about anything but the trees and the rain I think I'd get a little antsy, you know, but I'd be (inaudible at 18:07) that you're entitled to a conversation about this trees in the rain once in awhile.

</p><p>PATIENT: I keep wondering, though, how long it's going to take me to get this idea out of my mind about the, maybe there's some girl that's just right for me someplace. And someday I'll meet her and maybe then things will just click, you know, and all, you know. Then when I start thinking about things like that I say oh, all kinds of confusion would be brought up, you know. Now you're married what are you going to do with your wife if you meet somebody that you really think you're head over heels about? 

</p><p>I'm just pursuing that same ideal a little further in my mind about the fact that I won't leave. She may run me off some day, but then I'll be able to say it was her fault, you know, because I couldn't leave her or the kids. Neither one I don't think. (20:45)

</p><p>I was reading a weird story in the newspaper, I think it was the other day, about the guy that had an affair with his secretary and his wife had found out about it. And the secretary threatened to kill herself so he divorced his wife and married his secretary. And now he was having trouble with her threatening to kill herself because of something else. I don't know. The guy jumped right out of the frying pan into the fire, you know. He divorced his wife and married his secretary because he also got fired from his job because he wasn't supposed to have a personal relationship with his secretary and all kinds of problems. Oh and he had a little bit of bank, money saved in the bank and of course when he had, when he divorced his wife he had to give her all the money or something like this and the poor guy was really out in left field now. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: That's what happens when you voluntarily leave your wife. (22:03)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, maybe not always, but actually I think when that guy, he really didn't seem to have any reason to divorce his wife, you know. And I guess that really she divorced him you might say. And he really got himself out of a tolerable situation into an intolerable one you might say. That's what it looked like to me anyhow because his wife was very unstable and she, I don't know, there was some problems. She was threatening to kill herself again and he didn't know what to do. So, I think the moral of the whole story was that you're never any better off so you might as well stay where you are when you get right down to it.

</p><p>THERAPIST: You told me as saying before, you said you think of pursuing that thought that it would be one thing if your wife ran you off then it would be her fault, but you never would leave yourself. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I said I couldn't stand to leave her or the kids, but if she runs me off then I'll just have to do it, you know. I'll have to accept it, but for me to initiate it I don't want to.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, then I guess the point you're getting across then is that while you can accept it if it happens, but you don't want to. That's not what, you want her to initiate it. And get you're mad. (23:49)

</p><p>PATIENT: Just like where I work. If I have to stay there until I retire or drop dead or whatever I may learn to accept it, but I can see right now that I won't be any further up the management ladder so to speak, than I am right now. And this, is one of the things that bugs me about the job is the fact that you don't have any potential to move up. And with that over your head then you don't feel like there's anything worth really getting in there and working for.

</p><p>THERAPIST: But there's no rewards for you.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, like we don't get any decent pay raises. That's the only other thing there is either a raise or a promotion or both. And with the promotions ruled out more or less the raises are all that's left and if you don't get those then you don't have anything to fight for.

</p><p>THERAPIST: So, there's nothing there to fight for. Well, what the hell.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's kind of curious the other day there when we were leaving Missouri, my wife said something about the fact that it wouldn't be really too bad to be sent back down or sent down to Missouri, you know, from here. I think the reason she said it was the fact that we'd been out to visit some people that I know down there and they're, oh they're younger than us, but, young couple and he and I have a great deal of rapport, you know, we are able to communicate, I guess you might say. (26:02)

</p><p>[How cool] (ph) is a wife had decided that maybe her and this girl could have a great deal in common too if they just, well had to, you might say. So, she said it really did seem like her it wouldn't too bad if we have had to come to Missouri to live. Like it was made up from this standpoint of this one couple that we know down there that we went out to visit, sit around and chitchatted and I tend to agree with that. I think, from the standpoint of one thing, this guy has a great deal of ambition and it could rub off on me and I'm might be able to be more ambitious than I am right now for one thing. For another thing, I think we might be able to live on what I'm making there where you can't seem to here because it's a small town and might be cheaper to live there. 

</p><p>In fact this couple's living there very cheaply and what they say is true their folks are paying a little bit of nothing for the rent for this house that they live in, you know, and it's an old house is what it is. And they rent the thing and it had all kinds of land around it because the guy that owns the place rents them the house and leases the land to somebody else and the guy that leases the land has given them a half acre so just to have a garden in if they want to. So, they got what seems like a really nice situation. And my wife was raised on a lot of land, a ranch or whatever you want call it. So, she likes this idea of having lots of room around. (27:51)

</p><p>THERAPIST: It would be a relief not to have to spend so much money and be able to catch up with yourself for once. There's something else you said about the guy being more ambitious and maybe that would rub off. I guess that's one of the things that you're really concerned with about yourself is, like, you'd like to be more ambitious and you're not.

</p><p>PATIENT: I was thinking just today that when my daughter left to go to Arizona we promised her or we said something about we'd try to paint her room while she was gone and she's going to back in about two weeks and I haven't even touched the room yet, you know. And I just don't really care except for the fact that, I don't know, I'd like to kind of have it painted so that it would be something new for her to come home to. Because I like the kids, you know. 

</p><p>And so, but my ambition just lags. It just seems like I don't care whether I do anything or not. This, is, I think, from two things. My wife seems to be that way to a certain extent. She'll do what she has to and that's all. And I have gotten to be the same way. To me, you develop the habits of the people you're around. And she does what she has to and that's it. When it comes to darning socks, you know, which you don't really have to do well she won't do that. Sewing on buttons, you know, like a button on a pocket that doesn't really have to be sewn on why she won't do that. Cleaning up the house it gets cleaned up when it's necessary, like, somebody's coming to visit us or if it gets so dirty that she can't stand to look at it anymore or something like that, she'll clean it up. And I've gotten the same way. (29:51)

</p><p>And at work I'm the same way. This guy at work that kind of goofs off and does a little bit of work here and a little bit of work there, I said well okay, if he's going to do it then I'll do it. So you develop the habits of the people around you. And right now we don't have any real close friends, you know, as far as couples go. And I want to get to be, you know, close friends with somebody who's really ambitious would make me be more ambitious. 

</p><p>This guy who rented that house and fixed it up, you know, so that it's real nicely done. It's not anything exceptional, but it's nice looking for an old house and he took a bunch of steel, an old motor and stuff and some tires and made myself a garden tractor out of it and this guy just seems at times to bubble over with ambition. So, I learned it wouldn't be a bad situation to be there where you could kind of get this ambition rubbing off on you. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Because you picked up the, I don't know, laziness or nature that you...

</p><p>PATIENT: I picked up all the bad habits I can find from people around me.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Even though that's not really the way you want to be.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Right after I got out of high school, I ran around with a guy that was always wanting to do something and I just, you know, okay let's do it, you know. And I'd come home at night from work and take a shower, change clothes and jump in the car and take off. Of course, I was single at the time, but this guy had ambition enough to get me to do things, you know. And we'd go out and just stay out until midnight, 1:00, 2:00 in the morning, you know, not thinking anything about it, come home, sleep a couple, three, four hours, get up and go to work.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Always going. (31:54)

</p><p>PATIENT: And maybe it's got some disadvantages to it, but it's also got some advantages to it if you have the ambition to do things you're liable to do something constructive once in awhile. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: And something about bubbling over, your friend, it's a nice thing. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know, I think a lot of married couples (inaudible at 32:30) over here, but they have a tendency to only do what the other one will make them do. And this couple that live down the street from us. We can call them up and say hey, let's go to a movie and one of them will be all in favor of, the other, no, no I don't care if she wants to, you know, we'll go or the other way around. We call them up one night and he wanted to go jogging with us. We were going jogging over at the high school. He wanted to go jogging with us, she didn't want to. But she went, you know, because he wanted to go. So, if you have somebody around they're kind of, you know, spark plugged you or you'll do a lot more. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You sound like somebody to be spark plugging you a bit. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Just a little bit. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: And you get some turning.

</p><p>PATIENT: A lot of times I've looked at myself and wonder how in the Sam Hill (sp?) I ever had the ambition to get out of bed in the morning as lazy as I am. Sometimes I don't. I know one thing if I didn't make my wife get up and fix breakfast for me I might never get up. But she doesn't realize it from this standpoint. She thinks it's my own selfish attitude towards having breakfast on the table. I think that's what she looks at entirely. (33:49)

</p><p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 34:00) is some selfish than you want.

</p><p>PATIENT: Beg question. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: She says she's more selfish than (inaudible at 34:06)

</p><p>PATIENT: I think so. I think, she thinks that I'm looking out for myself all the time, whereas, I look at it as the point that I'm looking out for myself maybe 50, 60, 70 percent of the time. You know, she thinks it's 90 or 100 percent I'm looking out for myself because I'd do a lot more if she would just prod me in the right way, not nag, you know, but I don't know she just doesn't approach me right on some things, you know. And instead making me want to do it and I turn around and want to rebel against it more than anything. But the way she wants, approaches me about doing something just turns me off. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Is there anything that you could do to get her to approach you differently?

</p><p>PATIENT: Not directly. I think I'd have to approach her through a third party because I don't think she'd change for me. It's just the way I looked at it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: And you're saying it wouldn't do it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Because I've said lots of times things that I wanted her to do from the standpoint that it would make me do things differently, but she looks at it strictly from the standpoint if it's something I want her to do for me and that's all. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: So, she's very much absent and misunderstands the same way. (35:53)

</p><p>PATIENT: I think if I had or if she had a real close friend that I could go to and say now would you get her to do this and this close friend, you know, would understand why I was getting her to do this, trying to get her to do this and if she could get her to do it then it would change me too. 

</p><p>I don't think our problems are really as much financial as we admit to or as it would iron out in the wash, let's put it that way, if it really came down to it. The nitty gritty of it I think we could probably live on what I make if we just tried, but neither one of us had the ambition to really set our minds to trying at the same time. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I suppose it's not so much with the money, not having enough money as the amount of energy each of you is willing to put into making things work. 

</p><p>PATIENT: We'd have to change our attitudes on a lot of things and I don't think either one of us are willing to do this on our own. And we don't know how to motivate the other one to do it so they have to motivate us to do it. She likes to impress herself and her friends, I guess you might say, as to the fact that she's got a great deal of intelligence, but this, is, I think, one of the things where she lacks because she doesn't grasp the whole situation. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I guess you've tried and failed to motivate her. 

</p><p>PATIENT: She took one course in biology and she thinks she knows all there is to know about biology now. And when I bring up the fact that I've got 24 credits of biology and she really doesn't tell me anything, you know, when she tries to explains something to me. She gets rather irritated at me about it. (38:02)

</p><p>THERAPIST: I guess it irritates you in the first place that she kind of is like too (inaudible at 38:07) or something. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, she's like don't question me I know what I'm doing type of attitude. When really, to me, a wife should, to her husband at least, be able to admit her deficiencies. When you live together day in and day out you know what the other person is and what they're capable of and where they're lacking you might say. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's irritating to see her pretend to be more perfect than she is. 

</p><p>PATIENT: There's this whole song and dance about if your friends knew everything that you know about yourself they'd never be your friend, but then again if you knew everything that they know about themselves you might not want to be their friend either. So, they just live in their little shell and paint the outside the color that you want it to be and go on. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Were you applying that to you and your wife? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. This body language thing they had in the paper the other day it told about this little shell that you live in, you know, and how if anybody else interrupts your shell while you immediately go on the defensive. And it's something that you know that you never stopped to think about until it's really pointed out to you. (39:59)

</p><p>Like this thing pointed out how everybody has their own little sphere, you know, and they, say for instance, if you and somebody else got on the elevator and you wanted to have a little fun just move over real close to them, you know. And you get the off looks and you touched them while in there you have their wrath down on you because all that elevator there and you had to be right in their little sphere. I don't know, I like to, like, work say for instance I try to say hello to everybody that I pass in the hall whether I know them or not and I feel like I like to incorporate everybody around me in my little sphere, you know. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh, like you're not for pushing people out. You starting to pull them in. 

</p><p>PATIENT: When you really get down to it though there, somebody, say for instance you're sitting at your desk, this happened the other day, and somebody walks in that you don't know, you know, you immediately go on the defensive. You are what do you want? You're interrupting my sphere and all. And it it's just something you have to overcome I guess. (41:18)

</p><p>It's an idea that I have that I'd like to have a female that I can talk to. This, is one of the things that a wife doesn't fulfill. I want her to be a life lover and a girlfriend and all this, you know. This girlfriend thing she doesn't approach it from the same standpoint I do. She could be the girlfriend that I can go and talk to and pour out my problems, you know, and sit and listen sympathetically and all this. But she just doesn't adopt that attitude, I guess you'd say, whenever I tried to create this situation. But I think that's one reason why I feel oh there's got to be somebody else in this world that I can go and talk to at least. Maybe that's just my own selfish way of reasoning. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Why is that your own selfish way of reasoning?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know, I keep thinking maybe I don't want her to be my girlfriend, this girl that I can talk to that would feel very sympathetic to me. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh, you mean like maybe you don't really want her to be in that sort of an excuse or something or (inaudible at 43:45) (43:45)

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Like I said, maybe I don't perceive that she's being warm and sympathetic to my problems when she really is. Maybe I'm just not perceiving it because I don't want to. This girl at work said something to me today and I kept trying to get back to talk to her later to find out what she meant by what she said, you know. And I never could because she was always busy, but she threw out a key word, which struck me and I kept wanting to talk to her about it, you know, but I never did get the chance. 

</p><p>This key word thing comes from these ads that you read in the papers about a young couple wanting to meet other young couple or broadminded that's a key word, see. And after, you know, meeting some of these couples and talking to them you can tell right off the bat what the idea is, you know, more or less. This, is the key word that she threw out was swinger. You know, I said well her boss walked in and I didn't get to pursue it any further, but I just wondered what she meant by this term swinger. And I was going to ask her just to get, approach her kind of tactfully and see what she's referring to. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Sort of like the idea of swinging with her kind of appearance. (45:46)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, she's a nice looking girl. I don't think that's what she had in mind because she's only been married about a year and a half and just most people who swing have been married five, six, seven, eight years at least, you know. And they get into a point where well we've done it every way possible. So, you know, they start, both of them come to the idea that maybe somebody else is more exciting than the partner that I now have, you know. And this girl's only been married about a year and a half. I think that's what she told me one time. But I don't think she was referring to that at all. She was just repeating something that she heard, I think. And I just wanted to check out and see if she was. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible at 46:37) what you were getting at when you're saying something about not wanting to see your wife as being sympathetic. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think you hit it on the head there. I kind of want to play the field and I don't want her to do this, you know, this confidante. I want somebody that's outside the family life that I now have, see. I think that's more what it boils down to if it's completely analyzed. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're looking out there for someone new, something exciting.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's kind of the way I look at it. Like I said, in the last week or so I've kind of developed this well, never can tell who you're going to meet tomorrow or something like that attitude, you know. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Okay, kind of hoping somebody nice might turn up. You keep telling yourself well, you know, it could happen. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, you keep reading these stories about the guy that worked at the (inaudible at 47:54) for 15 years and finally the guy across the hall hired a new secretary and the next thing you know this guy and the secretary across the hall are having an affair, you know and let's see I've only been at this job five years. So, I got all kinds of time. (48:07)

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy. Noted therapist Carl Rogers takes part in the excerpt of the final session.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is a sequence of five excerpts from the first nine interviews with a 19-year-old young man. A brief description of the tenth interview is also included. These first ten interviews represent to me the gradual development of a potentially therapeutic relationship. The five excerpts here seem the concrete steps in the progressive development of that relationship.</p>

<p>This is from the first interview.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Jack-ass seems to me a pretty  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it feels stupid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, what kind of a jack-ass would go around saying things and never knowing whether he believed them or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know how to tell if you really believe in something. I mean, I feel that I believe him but when I really sit down and say now do I actually truly, completely believe and so I just, because so many things that you do believe in you've been conditioned to believe in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then if you try and break away from your conditioning, you're trying to be sort of an individual then you, at least in our day and age right now, you start to think well am I doing this because I really want to be different or am I'm doing it because there is such an emphasis placed on individualism. And you don't even know that so you don't know if you're being an individual because you want to be or because people think that's the thing to be or just what the deal is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you don't know how to break through this contradictory mess  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and really find your own authentic individuality. That is not a reaction against something or cover up for something but is you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I just don't know. And, you know, because right now it is very easy to be a non-conformist or an individual, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not go along with what everybody else says.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can play at it pretty easily, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then, you know, I don't (inaudible - 0:02:14.1) be funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or (inaudible - 0:02:16.5), you know, really bothers me. And yet I don't know whether or not I am a hypocritical, I mean I can't tell, I have no way of telling, you know because I just say, you know, well am I doing this or am I not doing this, it's very confusing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you can't go to the book for an answer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And some how we, if it's to be found you have to find it within yourself, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't know if it's in myself because there is so much to a person, so many different streams of thought and so many beliefs that I guess you really believe in. But there are so may beliefs that you're suppose to believe in that you don't believe but you don't want to admit that you don't believe in them, and, you know, how do you separate the two? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you present the problem pretty clearly, not be able again to break sort of a net that's holding you, a net of many possibilities. There's a break through that net and be those possibility that are really you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the problem is how to break out of this net. The solution is something, I guess, I certainly don't know what your way to break out of this net is but I sort of have a feeling that maybe you'll find a (inaudible - 0:03:47.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but to do that you've got separate off every single little stream of consciousness, every little thought that you think, you have to compare with every other thought. And then you have to stop and think why you thought that. What was it that lead to your thinking?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's one method of solution is to sort of keep everything in your mind and weigh it against every other thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but you're not aware of every other thought either. I once thought the way to do it would be for me to be hypnotized and just to go ahead and sort of explore your mind completely  -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - because there are so many thoughts that you're not even aware of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. And you wanted some way to get to those sort of unavailable thoughts  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that you're pretty sure you're experiencing in some way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I thought was feared but the person keeps hidden away and never admits and never looks at it and you can't, just sitting by yourself, you can't go right in your mind, at least I can't I don't know if somebody else can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again, how to sort a dive down and get your hands on a fear or an anxiety. Like you can at times get your hands on it feeling a little intense, jealousy and anger and insecurity that sometime just, you know, even if you can dive down it, it seems to come up and almost knock you over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it takes quite a shock to do this, you can't get a shock like this for everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So  -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That method doesn't seem again �</p>

<p>CLIENT: The only one I think that I ever thought is hypnosis, but I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This would certainly again, you fell sort of free you from the restrictions that fear you have  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's just  -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - more open to exploring your.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought it essentially just the ability of the conscious mind being able to go into the subconscious and that is where you keep all of your, at least I think, is where, you know, most of the fears are hidden.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, you stuff them away back there somewhere and � well, like right now, you know, just the thought of trying to get in there I don't know it can be done, how you can turn your mind and go into your subconscious because it doesn't really manifest itself when you're awake. And, you know, it sure, your conscious mind without any kind of aid, a shock or something, isn't going to admit all these.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you think that, again, hypnosis could knock down that barrier?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because then I guess your conscious mind, I don't, I don't know that much about hypnosis actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I wonder what makes those barriers there is something I don't know what you feel keeps those barriers, what keeps these fears from coming into your awareness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, probably because the fact that if you were, if a person were, didn't have these barriers well supposing they suddenly broke  -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would probably scare the hell out of somebody and literally drive them insane to the point where they would retreat from everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, is this the way you really sort of feel about yourself? Remember we said you couldn't get this anyplace but in you, you can't get this from anything you read or anything that people have told you. Do you really feel that if you really let down these barriers you would be overwhelmed by your fears and maybe go insane?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no, of course not. No person feels that anything can actually harm them. It's like I know I'm going to die but, you know �</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is all a bunch of intellectual bullshit then, isn't it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, well, yeah well, I don't know see right there, I don't know. Obviously, there is some kind of a barrier which keeps me from being completely aware, because I'm not completely aware so obviously there's something stopping me from being completely aware. I don't admit that I could ever go and say no matter what happened to me, you know, from a (inaudible - 0:07:47.2) point of view I sort of consider myself above that. Like I don't believe, you know, I know I'm going to die but I'll be damn if I'm going to admit it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I can't conceive of myself being dead or being insane, it's impossible for me to conceive it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think insanity, you can sort of get away maybe with saying well, I feel I'm really basically stable and I'm not to really be overwhelmed. But, you know, a little more difficult problem of avoiding your ultimate death don't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, I know I'm going to die, you know, this is sort of inescapable and yet it's, you know, to sit here and damn myself that tomorrow, you know, maybe I'll be dead, well, I've never been dead so I have actually no idea what it's like. And to imagine being something which you have never in anyway experienced for me is very difficult, and just a completely, you know, an egotistical thing. I was saying that I couldn't possibly go insane I'm sure that I could and yet if somebody were to say to me that no matter what happened to you would you retain your sanity I would probably, well I would probably say no because that would be the thing to say and I'm sure I wouldn't believe it. It wouldn't happen to me it's like driving an automobile, other people have killed one another.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As I told you, I got the feeling you were crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I am probably a little crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't seem overwhelmed by that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why should I? Supposing you told me I had the black face or pink eyebrows or purple hair, I don't give a damn what you think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you said you thought you were crazy too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought you said, well, sometimes you think you're a little crazy too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you overwhelmed at those times?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were a little frightened really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really was. In fact I was quite frightened. But then it's one thing for you to sit there and say something like that because you don't know me at all. But when I say something to myself I have quite a reason, you know, good reason for saying it. Instead of (inaudible - 0:09:57.1) what other people say about me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least I will pretend to myself that it doesn't make any difference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah. I think I can get that feeling about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What, that I'm a little crazy?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think, yeah, I'm pretty crazy too and I'm not afraid or ashamed of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As long as it doesn't bother you but when it becomes and you can't cope with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have this fear that it could get � I mean can you even in a vague way get a feeling for that fear or. Even though you haven't been insane can you sort of get a feeling that you could be overwhelmed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, put it this way I've come awful close to having it happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, when I get depressed or something. And afterwards I just felt the same, you know, but Jesus I was pretty close back there. And there doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it. I decided that all I need is $7 million and I'll be all set.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you will be a crazy millionaire.</p>

<p>The second excerpt is from the fourth interview.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The nuts and bolts feeling I had � that's the way I want to know you, but not because I am a person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And as a person I really want to know you. That doesn't come across to you at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't see why you should. (Inaudible - 0:11:44.9) I don't know but I don't, you know, I don't see why you should. I don't want to know every person I knew.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you're not sure whether you want either me to know you or if you want to make me a real part of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I mean for selfish reasons (inaudible - 0:12:14.9). Obviously I need something. I'm not here to help you, you know, I'm not here because you were looking for somebody I mean because I wanted to be here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But at least now you're not sure though whether you really want to be here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah I do, you know, but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean let's say you really want to be here but whether you want to be a real person here or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know if I know how to be a real person, you know, there is so many of me. I'm a real conglomerate, whatever that means.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most of the time you don't want to be here with me, personal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Personal?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Personal, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's probably good, so far I haven't been (inaudible - 0:13:21.8)? I don't know. So far I haven't been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you don't trust my reactions to you as a very personal person or your own reactions to yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know what would happen if I got very personal with you I don't know how I would, unknowing that we have to (inaudible - 0:13:45.2) that I was being personal with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I imagine it would be a very mixed kind of feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I would just shove it out of my mind because I wouldn't want to think about it. But, you know, I just shove it out of my conscious (inaudible - 0:14:01.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wouldn't really deal with the fact that I got (inaudible - 0:14:05.1) with each other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually I don't even think about no problem. And that can have all kind of disasters consequences, maybe it wouldn't have any.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By the mixture I was thinking it certainly does, it sounds like it would be a real dangerous venture for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, you know, I happen to prefer (inaudible - 0:14:30.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be sort of, oh you're feeling a monster that might be a mouse or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to take the chance right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it turned out to be a real monster then it's no fun that you are with monsters.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. May be my monster that I have to deal with. Maybe the fact that I recognize the fact that just telling you things (inaudible - 0:15:10.1), you know, wouldn't be good at all (inaudible - 0:15:18.2). That's what I said about feeling insecure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We both sort of got it that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, it doesn't do me much good that way, for me anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I sort of feel well the reaction to that sort of personal for you not to (inaudible - 0:15:40.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, again if you're wasting my time you're wasting your time. If I'm going to be like that I shouldn't be here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you can be like that any place else but maybe make a couple of hours a week where you're not quite (inaudible - 0:15:59.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I don't mind, you know, spending a couple of hours a week here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I get one feeling that I had is that, this is my feeling, and it may have nothing to do with you again, I hope you feel free to tell me, I have a feeling that getting close to me would be very frightening to you in many ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would like to answer that but I would answer it subjectively so I'll let it go for awhile. I mean I would answer that, I would fill it out and it wouldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would defend yourself against that and given you a number of logical �</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I could tell you yes that it is frightening and I could say why that it would be difficult for me to tell you why because I would be doing it very objectively.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you're right. And the first time it could come out just directly from the subjective reality of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would have to sort of come out �</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just like telling somebody, you know, anybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if you just like throwing out insecurity at least gotten into the room, it has only been not a very active forum but it was there for us to maybe �</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it was a thought or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm sitting here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And I wonder if this kind of fear would be another start even though it's a small beginning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, okay. I don't trust me particularly. This is ridiculous I really got the thing going about queers and I have some run-ins with them. And being an older man I have, you know, kind of half worried about, you know, we're just going, you know, home and playing the make on me or what. And, you know, (inaudible - 0:17:58.2) something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when I said I really wanted to make you a real person in my life, I really wanted to know you, to you it has sort of an overtone of maybe I'm really trying to queer you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I can't help it  -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - this is the thing that I just inside me and it really bugs me because sometimes I think I got, you know, bad homosexual tendency and this bothers me too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, you're not sure again whether this reaction is always in the other or maybe in you. Where is the darn thing is the thing that worries the hell out of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want anything to do with queers, you know. Anytime my sexual activity (inaudible - 0:18:44.1). They're going to be like that and, you know, I'm not going to bug them for it, but I don't want to be in it. Again, I can't, you know, I sometimes wonder, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're saying you can't really come to realistic terms with this whole issue of homosexuality.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I can't believe you (inaudible - 0:19:06.2), I really don't know. You know, it's kind of for me it's frightening, you know, not to know, you know, what to do or.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not to know when you're with a man whether he's going to try to seduce you or you're going to want him to seduce you or  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - know exactly what his sexual business between you and the man might be all about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then if (inaudible - 0:19:32.2) like a girl sometimes which has happened well then Christ I just, you know, I'm really bugged by it then. Then I start thinking Christ, you know, maybe I don't dig girls at all and it's embarrassing besides.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When something goes bad with a woman that's painful enough in of itself but it makes you think that maybe these fears I have are real.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and it really bugs me. But I try not to think about it if I can help me, if I just sort of forget about it, you know  -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is what you told me about the general (inaudible - 0:20:03.9) start to drift away like some of the other  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I brought it out in the open. Well, no I don't think I have ever sent flowers (inaudible - 0:20:19.5). And that really had me worried the first time it happened. The second time it really bugged me. I don't like to think about it. If I ever, you know, it's kind of frightening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, for someone who spends so much time involved with women �</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, exactly, you know, because, I, you know  -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of an older guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. And then to have a girl (inaudible - 0:20:47.1) you can't do it, well shit, you know, and after sort of getting yourself built up in her eyes as a big Don Juan.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can do everything but  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then, you know, and the excuse I came up with sometime, I come up with some of the most beautiful goddamn excuses in my life, you know, things which they believe completely but they were just so weird, you know, and I knew I was making an excuse, you know. So I sort of save myself in her eyes but then I didn't save myself in my eyes at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And it was so painful that I guess you couldn't just be straight and honest with any woman, you never trusted a woman that much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did one girl I was just lucky I was just talking to her about the other day. I don't know how we got on the subject but, you know, well we're pretty close anyway, you know. Well, we have a really weird, completely plutonic, you know, no physical thing going with her at all but we're very, very close.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she has enough so then distance from being a real woman in your life that you can sort of explore this with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I know that she is not going, you know, she's not going to think anything about it or, you know, hold it against me or.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She is going to accept you just the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible - 0:22:05.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it's not threatening to her because she's not directly involved with  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the same with me so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think she is the first girl that I ever discussed that with at all. The first time I discussed anything about my sex life. I use to worry about masturbating so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a little easier to deal with masturbation then with the, sometimes with women having the fear of homosexuality. Those three kind of things that has all caused you some concern.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The thing with masturbation, you know, I, you know, when you're a little kid you're always told a whole bunch of shit about it. Well, you know, I had read, you know, this is, it was it was such a crap. And yet I couldn't help wondering well maybe down when held down deep inside I am being bugged by this thing and I don't even realize that it's bothering me. That's what gets so confusing the fact that I realize that maybe things really are bothering me but I'm not aware of the fact that they are bothering me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, do you think maybe way down inside there is some truth to those little wives tales  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - about (inaudible - 0:23:15.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, it's bothering me, it could effect me without my even being aware of it. That's what is so (inaudible - 0:23:22.6) about knowing myself is I never know what's way down deep inside and how it, you know, how it has effected me. I just got the purpose, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds as if  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can control that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like you're pretty sure that way down in there, there is quite a bit of fear about some of these things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There might be getting from my reaction yeah. But I can't get at them, you know, look at them, examine them and then push them out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't really again come to direct term with these things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to do it sort of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do it objectively.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sort of you looking at them through  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Somebody else's.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - fences or  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - screens, but you're not tearing the screen down and just living with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think these may be some of the monsters I guess you're afraid might really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's something that I got like prejudice, you know, I'm not at all prejudice as far as I know. But maybe way down deep inside again I am. And that would make me, well, it would sort of almost make me a hypocrite and, you know, that really bothers me. It's about everything, you know, that I feel strongly about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Almost everything you really value is potentially unreal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't you think if you really knew the real you about these things (inaudible - 0:24:51.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But, you know, I never can get in there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the real you might be prejudice, masturbating, inadequate homosexual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. This is not a very pleasant thought, so I won't think about it, to hell with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Make sure those screens and barriers are up there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They are up there and they better stay there. And yet I want to know is the funny part about it. I would, you know, I sort of, I would like to know just what the holy hell it's all about inside down there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really give you a feeling I guess of open space and freedom if you really just stood there all with yourself open.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think, you know, hypnotism could do it, get you down in there I don't know. Besides if you could wash away all of those things, you know, and understand them � well, actually I think when I first started thinking about this I read a science fiction book once which was fascinating. One part of it was (inaudible - 0:25:54.8) saying they discovered some weird stuff that produced hallucinations directly from the subconscious mind and this guy fought with, you know, all the little monsters and the trash and everything and all the horrible things that were stored, you know, in the mind of the person. And, you know, he made me sort of overcome this thing and it, you know, much more powerful mentally but that was just because he used this other thing, you know. But anyway it sort of started me thinking and (inaudible - 0:26:19.5) hell, actually that's very logical, you know, all this shit should be in there it makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm sure the person realized because there has been a lot of good science fiction books where they would talk about this. And there are so many people, you know, even would use this as part of a plot that means that they have thought about it. And I'll say thought about it chances are it exist. The more I thought about it the more convinced I seemed, you know, that this is in fact reality.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that description story struck pretty close to home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, at the time I don't suppose I was quite aware of it but, you know, after I started thinking about all of this I, you know, I just started thinking about it I never said any about what might be in me but I just started thinking there would probably be a lot of crap (inaudible - 0:27:03.1), all the shit that we store up.</p>

<p>The third excerpt is from the sixth interview.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I see do you think maybe you I see it yeah, yeah. So maybe we aren't so far from agreement then that when you talked about your sexual experiences and the difficulties that they bring you were a little more there (inaudible - 0:27:42.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's very real to me. And I really have been thinking about this, you know. I think there are probably three possibilities what the deal is. One, you know, that credible I hate when women (inaudible - 0:28:03.4) which I don't really think is it. What I think it is that I really have to be emotionally involved with a girl (inaudible - 0:28:09.2), I think that is probably what it is. It seems to me that this would probably be it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's the problem and how to be emotionally involved.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there's no problem if that's why I can't make love to a girl, you know, is because I'm not emotionally involved with that's no problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean to learn how to be emotionally involved with people is no problem?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no I didn't say that. It's just that some people you fall in love with and some people you don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if I can't make love to a girl because I'm not in love with you well I'm just not going to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean it's not you it's something that happens to you, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just means that I have a certain, so I got it figured out that I'm really sort of a prude in a lot of respects. I don't want to go out with girls, go out and drink and swear (inaudible - 0:28:55.8), you know. I'm shy, modest and everything else, you know, everything that I spend a lot of time saying is a bunch of bullshit and is ridiculous, you know, I'm all those things. Even if I'm a hypocrite says it well that's what I am and I'm not going to say differently, trying to pretend differently to go along with a certain imagine that some people expect and which I think (inaudible - 0:29:25.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean, you really think that again, I guess I want to be careful how I say it because I, I don't want to really be taken in by you and yet I don't want to discourage the possibility that you may be discovering something real about yourself, but are you really saying straight then that you think maybe you are sort of a private, delicate, sensitive guy where women are concerned?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it could be because I, you know, it's easy to, you know, to say I don't worry about a girl watching me undress or something like this. It's very easy to say and to do it even and yet I feel funny, you know. I know that I'm forcing myself to basically guard it, you know, to act as though I have no modesty at all sort of speak. I know that I am consciously unaware of when I'm doing it, you know, and I feel funny, you know. Like I actually would prefer if they weren't, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I will sit on this picture and it doesn't bother me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any feelings of why it may bother you more then it might?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anxiety, you know. Of (inaudible - 0:30:33.3), hurt, you know, you don't display your body to people of the other sex, you know, so, I don't know why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's that generally, it's not anything specific that worries you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I could probably say no and get away with it but I don't know I have always sort of have this feeling that I am not adequately equipped sort of speak.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but I don't know if it bothers me or not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can act like it doesn't, you know, I suppose it really does, you know. It would be nice to be quite large I suppose, but, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think all these things about you being inadequate and homosexual and now you don't even have a big cock.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Right. But I don't know how much that worries me, you know, because � well, I could always use the excuse before in a way of it's not quantity but quality.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But shit now I can't even make (inaudible - 0:31:31.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before, the old adage it's what you do with it  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but what you have sounded good to you, but now even that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, I'm, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you can't even fall back on anything (inaudible - 0:31:48.9). Not only are you not driving a get big penis but you're a guy that doesn't even know how to use what he has.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I know how, that's not the problem, I know how.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't work out right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. I don't know what this thing should bother me, you know, why I shouldn't I mean why (inaudible - 0:32:05.4) how large it is or isn't. Except that there is I suppose because there is so much emphasis, you know, (inaudible - 0:32:12.7), you know especially wives get together, you know, bragging and everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The bigger the penis the more masculine the guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not really what you call a masculine looking person anyway, you know. And all of these things, you know, sort of ganging up together seem to be creating problems maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you're getting a lot of pressure toward thinking you're just not a man at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that � But damn it, it shouldn't bother me I mean, you know, rationally speaking, what the hell does it make what size it is, you know. Some people have big ones, some people don't everybody is suppose to be able to do it anyway but I can't even do that. So (inaudible - 0:32:54.1) but I have to be in love with a girl as an excuse, you know, for my own benefit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, all that we do when we keep bringing up these things is just sort of filling in more possible reasons why you might be insecure and unable to find a definite way for yourself in the world, and yet all we do is compound the picture, we seem to break through at any point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What really bugs me is that in the beginning when well I guess toward the beginning of the relationship I have with this girl she once said to me that I was well endowed (inaudible - 0:33:33.5) endowed is the way she put it. Well, it sort of surprised me, you know, but if a girl is going to say that to me then why the hell should I go out worrying about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really dumb, you know, to worry about things like that, you know. I can't figure it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you sort of have enough for her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Now I can make love to her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She really put you on the spot she said you're okay that way, now show me who you really are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (Inaudible - 0:34:05.2) about this weekend. She can't get in it if you know what I mean. I'm just saying things to her she doesn't know what the shit means really, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to expect probably I imagine a young girl.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it makes sense.</p>

<p>The fourth excerpt is from the eighth interview.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This could be, you know, I get along with people pretty good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, enough fucked up con man's way that's the most gee most out of touch then what I could imagine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What the hell. I can get through to a bunch of phonies, they are phony then I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you get through to yourself? You say you're as phony to yourself as you are to other people that's what worries me. That's why I can't meet you because you hardly ever come out real here. Maybe you come out real to your buddy when you are both talking screwed up stuff and when you're talking screwed up something you're really feeling, I feel with you very much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I get to the point where I feel this I'm not here, you see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has nothing to do with the fact that you don't sort of, I'm sort of a suspicious guy to you in some way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I can't, I don't, nothing happens, you know, three or four hours before I come here that has got me in any kind of emotional state at all any kind of real state.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't just �</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't build, I can't, man here I come.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More just (inaudible - 0:36:06.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is nothing to happen, I'm not in a, no problem is the only way I can think of which doesn't not what I want to say but there's nothing that, there's no situation here or this happened shortly previous to my being here that builds up anything, any tenseness or anything in me that shows.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's it you don't live with the basic problems you only live with the immediate pressures that are exerted in the body and as soon as those pressures are gone to hell you're happy as a bird. The underlying problem is still there, you're going out of the moods, but you never touch the underlying problem as it seems to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what the underlying problem is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There must be one there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, undoubtedly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe there is, I mean if, if there's not then okay your future life will work itself out as you say it's the best of all possible worlds. You have no reason to be at all upset, you're going along.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't like it. Whatever goes on I don't like. I don't know how to say it. It's not right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know it's not right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it doesn't feel right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you certainly make the best of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well Christ almighty I mean, you know, from a financial standpoint I'm fucked up fairly, you know, I don't have a steady income. I've got to be happy as much as I can. I can't go around being depressed, people don't like they don't want to be with you and I want to be with people. I've got to make the best of everything, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you do make it the best possible thing for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to, I couldn't live otherwise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That way you stay in this sort of not right mood I guess. It's right enough to keep you going, right enough not to really get to you, certainly not right enough to feel right either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't understand me is what I'm trying to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Very true I'm just �</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I can't say it, if you can't get it I don't know what to do, that's what I tried to tell you. Do you understand what I'm trying to say? I can't say it, there aren't any words.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know I get it sometimes and I get the, just a mess, a mess of glob stuff around here. And you just sort of not even in it you seem to be out not even in the glob, the shit or whatever it is, you're out some place not even getting in that either. So that you might even drown in it or get suffocated in it, instead you're walking around and tipping your toes in it and then saying your feet smell and so the world isn't quite right to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible - 0:39:36.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just trying to get some feeling for it and I don't really, to me it's a lot of things it's just not enough solid anything anyplace. There is nothing I can't, nothing we didn't touch anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What is there to touch? Man, all there is bod, you can't touch thoughts anyway. What's feeling?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feeling is about the most touchable thing I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, what are feelings?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, they are ones that you can't put into words. If you don't have them you can't talk about them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You can have them and not be able to talk about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you don't have them, you wouldn't know what they were you couldn't ever put them into words.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I can't put them into words anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you have them and don't they seem real to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Damn right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then who cares what they are, I don't. I just want to see them, feel them and touch them, but you don't want me to touch you, you don't like me around you I don't think. That look you give me is a pretty good sign something is wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you're just saying (inaudible - 0:41:19.3) I'm a bastard and I'm not coming through, you don't want to have anything to do with it, well, all right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there anything else that I want something to do with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fuck no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't hear the I would really like to hold you some way and that repulses you that makes you  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: That doesn't repulse me but you're not doing it, right? Are you going to blame that on me? When you say what I say I'm an asshole because I won't, I can't put it into words, that I don't feel anything really, that I'm just fine and dandy. All right, I'm fine and dandy, you know. I'm not going to argue with you about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible - 0:42:27.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you need, you act as if you're fine and dandy half the time in here. And you don't seem fine and dandy to me at all. Well, I'm just saying you're  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible - 0:42:41.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you really think I think you're okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know. You set over there and tell me I'm just fine and dandy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's you � that's you. You come in here and had a great day yesterday and I'm up now is my up phase, the world is great, who worries about anything I never really get frightened, well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm never frightened when I come in here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe we're picking the wrong time for me to come in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think it would be good if a guy could be with you when you're really pushed, but I don't know how to do that so I guess we better, I mean it would be, since we can't do it that way, how else can we become real to each other someway, I don't know? I don't think you, I don't think you really want to, to be with me I get the feeling you don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but I appreciate that because your coming does mean something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What the hell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just, you don't, you don't really come out here, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that my fault?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would never be just another person's fault it would always be our, my fault in not making it more possible and your fault in not venturing as more.</p>

<p>The fifth and last excerpt in the sequence is from the ninth interview. Carl Rogers is co-therapist during the last part of the interview and the few minutes of his participation are included here. Near the beginning of the interview there is a five minute silence between the client and myself. We are looking directly into each others eyes during the entire silence. I have kept a token two minute silence in the recording, just the silence seems central to the development of the mood which followed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking last night that this thing of not being able to become really involved in anything why would I, you know, be real sort of speak. I had this sort of thought out pretty good last night. I don't think that that's really the problem but rather why can't I do it, you know, I can't or don't do it. But there has, you know, there's a reason for this and it's, you know, I don't know if I can do anything about it until I can find out what the reason for it is. You know, I'm not trying, I'm not consciously saying to myself don't be involved, you see, or don't let off your emotions, that's just something that generally happens now, you know, because I have learned to control everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I don't know exactly how, what it makes you to find the reason, I mean what that reason would it be something definite or like some?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't, I started as soon as I reached that little conclusion last night of trying to think now well why can't I, and it's fear. But I don't know what it is I'm afraid of exactly. Probably I'm afraid of, when you lose control people generally, you know, say well you're very immature, etc., etc., etc. and I have had a lot of nasty experiences with this losing control from girls parents saying I was unstable and that's why you are never to see me again and things like that. Whenever you lose control people punish you for it or they punish me for it. If I get very mad with a girl over at her home I was punished for it consistently and I think maybe now I'm just completely afraid to lose control of myself sort of speak because if I want to yell and scream I won't because I don't want to have to face the consequences of that any more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So even when you are confronted with a new situation in which punishment might not be part of it you just have a hard time really believing that's the case?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. I'm use to being punished. I think this is what the thing is that I'm use to being punished or rejected for losing control of myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel that, well it seems that Rogers might, if he had been here and you had been emotional punish you or in some other way I might try to punish you if you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't believe this, you know, I'm here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you feel of it some.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This might be, you know, this is why well nothing do I, you know, because if I let it go a lot (inaudible - 0:48:38.1) want to see me again I just kind of smile, okay. Or if a girl's parents know what to say she can never see me again, okay. Before I yelled and screamed, got very violent. And maybe I wasn't, you know, punished physically but, you know, people would, you know, reject this they didn't like it they wouldn't want to be around me, I need to grow up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They didn't do it with their hand they did it with their words or their feelings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they didn't do it with their hand, as I got older it was grow up, act like a man, men don't get upset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, you're growing up the hard way I guess by just forcing a restrained kind of control and I guess it's working pretty well, you can look pretty good most places I gather. You aren't blowing up very often any more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not where people see it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I get drunk I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. But you are even trying to stop drinking too  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - so that that won't happen even now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's one reason I'm trying to stop drinking because I generally been making an ass out of myself. Every time I start thinking about, you know, this question always come up to me you once asked me is why am I afraid? Well, what am I so goddamn afraid of? I can't, I don't know, you know, I can say I'm afraid of being rejected which is true but there's something else that I'm really afraid of which I can't get at. And I (inaudible - 0:50:40.5) I'm afraid of holes in me. Every time I look at this hole a weird feeling comes over me it's frightening, Jesus there's a hole in me, it scars me. I don't know if it's because I expect it to hurt, you know, because it is a cut type thing or if there is something else for it. Because it doesn't hurt, you know, I should have gotten use to it now, but I look at myself Jesus, there's a goddamn hole in me it's scary and I don't know why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you have a hole in your finger and evidently that means a lot more then that to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it seems to. I don't, I can't put the feeling that I get in words I just. Not deep fright where I but, you know, to look at that and say, you know, what have I done goddamn there is this hole.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of guy am I?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it just, it's the hole, it's not me there it's the, it's this hole that I'm, it's in my finger in me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean it's not what kind of guy am I that I have a finger that I can look into but there's a hole in it and everything is crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No the fact that I got a hole in my finger and yet, you know, I don't know and I can make sort of guesses about what it might be, you know, but I don't have any feeling about those guesses.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The only feeling you have is that  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like the hole.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you look right into that hole in your finger and it strikes you as?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of frightening, not overpowering like so, but I get, you know, I don't like to think about it any more, I want to push it away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what I was doing is guessing of what it might mean to you but you're saying you can do that too but that doesn't help any. The only thing that is real �</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel certain about the guessing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we could guess all day both of us, but the only thing that is real is and not overpowering but sort of shakes your world in someway when you look at your finger and it means something to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a weird feeling, it just I got a fucking hole, not a particularly deep one now. (Period of silence here) I can't keep any thoughts going. I guess (inaudible - 0:56:16.2) two seconds ago. Everything was very different all of a sudden for a second. More substantial instead of being sort of existing and sort of, you know, pretty good, sort of rose tinted but, you know, not with a color and everything was just for just a second sort of changed and it became just that. That's what I mean I don't know if I'm getting my (inaudible - 0:56:59.1). It really just all of a sudden was different looking, not in its shape that it has been changing its shape but in context I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds touchable to me, tangible, I mean change of density.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it became, I guess, maybe it became more real it just was, all of a sudden this room and everything sort of became a little more substantial I guess, a little clearer, a little more body to it, that it became not quite as airy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible - 0:58:24.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was gone almost when it happened. Just for a second and then I thought about it and it happened again for another second, just sort of changed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It happened to me a little when I was looking at you and you were looking at me, kind of blur, things blurred a little. Part of it was just the strain of it kind of looking. Maybe some of it was just and you maybe some of the, to me maybe some of the concrete things that keep us apart were blurring too. So I guess for me and my moments were more things became less structured, less dense, less hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One reason it is harder for me to establish anything with you, and with most people probably, that aren't like me and that's why they're not kind of bummed or screwed up or wondering or anything, they're more I guess stable then I am really bothers me. Maybe that, you know, maybe I feel that I can't trust them because it would be so much easier for them to reject me. It would be so easy for them to say, you know, here's this guy is all screwed up so I don't want anything to do with him. People that I go around with, you know, are all screwed up themselves so they can't see that really. Oh he's a bum he's wasting his life and everything and trying to give me lectures about it or I don't want to have anything to do with him or anything. But people who aren't like this can't, you know, they can't. And I guess sometimes they do they don't want to have anything to do with me. And I just don't (inaudible - 1:01:19.2) establishing anything I don't feel an immediate  -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - bond.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess people that aren't all fucked up themselves turn you back pretty fast if you try to get to close.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I try hard enough to get close.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you feel, you mean if you did they would.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is sort of a vague feeling that I get that maybe this is it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't feel that I know what it is to be fucked up right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course I, I know that but it's a question, not a question of, you know, me sitting here saying to myself that I know and, you know, that you know what it's like to be fucked up and everything, but that has nothing to do with it what the hell so I know this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you don't feel that I as a person  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel it consciously but what about inside? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fucked up me and inside yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And you're, you know, like with � he's all screwed up but immediately I felt sort of a something between us, you know but with most people I don't because they're not like that. And consciously say to myself, you know, that you can understand, etc., etc., etc., etc. but where is anything between us?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I have to look at you as something different from me to understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that is it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can't feel with you the way he does and you don't, you don't feel that part of me ever really gets through to you I guess all the unknown, ambiguous dark corners in my life, my past, my present and possible the future that you don't sense those.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. As a matter of fact I never have at all. And maybe it's also because I can't help you with your problems sort of speak which is something I do, I guess I like to. Because it makes me be able to say that other people are kind of fucked up too and I can do something for them, maybe this is sort of trying to help myself or trying to say well, you know, maybe I'm trying to prove myself better then they are because here maybe I'm all fucked up but look at me I'm helping them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can always get one up on them I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if this is what I, you know, I don't think this but maybe this is what goes on inside.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And with me even though I may be fucked up in a lot of ways our relationship is not one where you can take me over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not like take over, like I don't let but we can talk about things that are, you know, things we're going through, problems we're having and have had and make suggestions to each other about or guesses about well maybe it's because of this, maybe it's because of that. Like yesterday we sit down at the beach for awhile and we both were very tired, we both didn't go to bed until about 6:30 in the morning yesterday either and we just sort of looked at each other and said how fucking ridiculous. We're wasting our lives (inaudible - 1:05:27.5) and all we could do was laugh about it. And finally I said shit this is ridiculous we're all fucked up and we know it, we didn't care enough to do anything more then laugh, just sat there and laughed, hey wow we're all fucked up, telling me what we're doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really get a kick out of that, that kind of shared realization or just craziness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we just sat there and we were laughing at ourselves sort of, we don't even care enough, oh but, you know, we care so goddamn little that we just sit here and laugh because we're fucked up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you both believe most of you at that moment just doesn't give a damn about the fact that your lives are nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even care right now. I'm laying in that warm sand and the warm sun laughing, laughing at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And each laugh sort of sinks you deeper into the sand until finally you probably can't be able to breathe but you don't really care you're still laughing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's not that you want to take me over like you do some people when you help them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But even that makes me a little bit closer with people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you get a hold on them yeah. And also I guess I my problems aren't laughable to me the way they are to you and your buddy so I can't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, they aren't laughable this is what pissed me off yesterday because I said what the shit am I laughing at them for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I had to admit right now, right then I just couldn't give a shit less, so I'm all fucked up big deal am I going to sit here and laugh about it. I'm laughing at (inaudible - 1:07:18.8) and that's all we could do about it was just laugh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you can't find someone who and the person I guess you feel closest to now is someone who can really be with you in that, because that's his attitude towards himself as well and you both share that crazy mixed up attitude. So here I can hear it but that's not me, you're right. That's not a fucked up part of me and my problems are serious to me and I guess before we could share something the way you do with him your problem would have to be serious to you too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess so because they are not serious to me most of the time. Once in awhile I get sort of pissed off overwhelmed with them mainly because I can't point my finger and say well I don't like hitting walls, I hit walls because when I was little I had to take out my anger at my parents on some things and I had to take it out on (inaudible - 1:08:33.3). My parents and everybody beat me or rejected me. I could do the same to somebody, I use to fight other kids a lot when I was young and then I would always attack, you know, objects because they frustrate me, they do to me the same thing my parents would do or anybody in authority would (inaudible - 1:08:50.7). But when I look at myself or laughing at myself over this shit, I don't know why, every once in awhile I things happen that I don't like and I don't know really why and I can't help them from, they have happened and I didn't like it, they frustrated me and they were wrong and I was an asshole and all fucked up and being phony or not being phony or something. But then I don't worry about my problems then even I guess I worry about well why did this happen because it makes me feel wrong, I know I don't feel good sort of speak I'm not happy, I'm bothered which I didn't like. But even then I can't really, all I do is feel very, very fucked up and I don't know why or anything. Well, it might be because my I can't pinpoint everything, you know, I can't say well this is a problem and this is a problem because of this, because of that and it manifests itself like this and manifests itself like that. So now that I know all of that well now I don't have to do anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean when you can't do that, that's when you get overwhelmed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I can't do it even when I'm overwhelmed with something that has happened to me, I can't ever do it. The rest of time I just sort of shrug it off with this control thing that I've got, no big thing, you know, sit up here and talk to you about it. But don't worry about even to me the problem. I guess one time I did was because I was worried I couldn't make love and I was worried about being a homosexual. Then I worried, you know, but the rest of this shit, you know, I've seen my mother beat me, I hate my mother, my father was just very nothing so I don't like my father I suppose and I hate her more. I mean I hate him more then my mother but I just say that, you know, because I guess I don't know. And I talk about him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you can't really get involved in those things I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't worry me any more, I mean I don't let them worry me any more, I'm not bothered by them any more where it showed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you mean �</p>

<p>CLIENT: So my mother hated me so what, you know. So my father was an asshole so what.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has nothing to do with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, big deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But being queer and inadequate that has something to do with you right now. It's harder to turn that away then something that happened in the past.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't like to be bothered by it either so I don't bother with it. I'm not a queer, of course not, why should I be. So I can't make love what a joke.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're an inadequate queer, so what.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not so funny really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't see why not. What's wrong with � I mean I really don't see, you know, I can get a little feeling that so what you're an inadequate queer so what, I don't even care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're horrible. So, I should care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who told you that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No shit. I don't want to be a queer and I want to fuck but, you know, it's like so what, what piece of shit that is. If I can't feel something about that for Christ sake I mean about fucking. God, fucking is a weird word, what a weird word.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fucking asshole strikes me as a weird word too I don't know why.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But fucking what a sound, what a sound. I don't even fuck. God it's so feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We don't know which came first but the feeling or the word but the word is  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: But when I think of the work fuck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mother fucking, I like mother fucking too. You don't like mother fucking as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't use it very often I don't think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I even like cock sucker too but I don't think you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mother fucking cock suckers is a good one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You like them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It has got such a sound, such a funky rocking sound to it. It's so dirty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean when I think about making love to a girl I don't really think about fucking I don't think. Fucking is an insult, fucking is dirty, filthy, and rotten and mean and evil and everything else. Fucking is taboo.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your body would be there when you fuck is that it or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fucking would be dirty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fucking is filthy, it's a filthy sound.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It even sounds, you know, the actual process is juicy and it could be (inaudible - 1:14:32.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Juice comes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And cock and all the goddamn words for sex is so fucking filthy sounding. I don't know what the fuck we're doing on that subject anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. But it does have some reality to it, I think for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And I think for everybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Power, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, when you want to say something bad to a girl especially man fuck you. That's the most expressive shitty thing to say. And why should that be an insult? That's amazing but boy it is. And if you really want to put a cross on feeling man there are nothing better then four letter words, nothing better because they are so real, so rotten, so unsurgary. Everybody gets that, everybody does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you're saying and I'm wondering too why is that these words are supposedly descriptions of something beautiful supposedly and maybe it is in that that they get their intensity that have vulgar it's a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>Shit is just a natural process but when you say shit that means something else. And I gather �</p>

<p>CLIENT: And shit I would say is one of the very dirtiest words. I mean, people don't get upset if you say hell or damn, goddamn or Jesus Christ which is amazing because religions have "They shall not take the Lord's name in vane" and it really stresses this. And here you're calling on the supreme being and sort of lowering him down to you by taking his name and using it for something dirty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a vulgarization suppose you have the highest  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and people don't care but you vulgarize shit or fuck and they jargonize it to hell.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I mean. So many people think that fucking is wrong and shitty is dirty and everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: God people are so weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I gather that these words have much power to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I'm mad or anything except when I'm just (inaudible - 1:16:43.7) I'll stick in the conversation, you know, what the fuck are we doing or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can use it in many ways?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then they're just, you know, when you're with boys you just naturally �</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now there are some people because some people can't deal with the reality of fucking or shitting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No maybe because they don't like these words because to them it shouldn't, these words are dirty. Now you say love, if you're talking to a girl who is a pretty sweet girl and you say, you know, something about making love it doesn't upset her, but if you say fucking for it they don't like it. I imagine it probably affects girls more then boys because to them they want to be pretty  -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - a very nice thing. And to say fuck really screws it up for them and they don't, it's such a filthy word. In any part of society it's a dirty word.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. What I went to go in they're power words. Come in.</p>

<p>CARL ROGERS: Maybe you are all through.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I arranged for the next appointment to come at a little later so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have 10 minutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: His hand got stuck in a car door.</p>

<p>CARL ROGERS: You didn't hurt it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I dramatize the whole damn thing anyways. Watch me close up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we are sort of discovering that we made, may have avenues of knowing each other that I could certainly be as fucked up and crazy as he is and that part of me is and so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You probably piss me off because you don't show it like I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I have now cultivated distances and know how to handle it. As I said the first day you seemed crazy to me, I feel crazy too but it doesn't frighten me, it doesn't bother me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't bother me all the time because I just don't let it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But mine is a different way in not letting it I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, it is very different. You're able to, you know, it doesn't fuck up your life for you. You're still able to proceed and understand it.</p>

<p>CARL ROGERS: If you, whatever the kind of craziness is you have it kind of (inaudible - 1:19:09.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, right. It doesn't louse up my life I louse up my life. And I pretend to be happy with it, you know. Shit look at me I'm a vision above. I can lay in the sun in the hot warm sand and you assholes are off working drawing your paychecks living in nice houses and I envy the shit out of you and I just won't go out and do it and I just sit back and say I wish I had them, and I wish I had that, all you assholes you work for it and I lay in the sun and never get it. I'm very envious it pisses me off. They have what I want, but I can't go out and get it because if I laugh at them.</p>

<p>CARL ROGERS: You say you can't go out and get it and also you feel more like pretending that hell you don't (inaudible - 1:20:11.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I sort of I admit that I want what they got but money is not important to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lie on the beach and laugh they get together and they really get in mood of laughing it's the fact that they are no good bums, their life is going down the drain and they laugh about. They just really have a good laugh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we laugh at the fact that we're laughing at it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And I think, I felt some of that laugher today, the possibility that you're an inadequate queer (inaudible - 1:20:39.6) I think it's funny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do too you were, you laughed about it as I did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's funny here maybe. But if some man makes a pass at me it's not funny. And if I can't fuck a girl it's not funny. I may make it funny then make it easier on myself, it makes it much easier on myself. Anything that hurts me is much if I can laugh at it and big joke, God it is so much easier. And I don't have to face it and say wow it's me, big deal.</p>

<p>CARL ROGERS: Big jokes are not jokes inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hell no, not at all not really. But I make them jokes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They may not be a joke inside but you don't know that. They seem a pretty joke way down deep in you that  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bullshit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - (inaudible - 1:21:40.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're not. Not being able to fuck a girl is no goddamn joke. For whatever goddamn reason it may not be a joke maybe because I don't want to feel inadequate and it's still not a joke no matter what the reason is that I can't fuck a girl.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you just, are you saying that you know it's a joke or you really I mean it's not a joke or you really feel frightened and worried about, that's what I want to know. I don't know what you're saying there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know it's not a joke, it's never a joke really. But it bothers, I can feel it that it's not a joke, you know, this is not a funny thing any more then wasting my life is really a funny thing, but I got to laugh at it and make it a joke. And I'll find somebody else who is the same way to laugh with me. We can laugh at ourselves and each other and lay in the warm sand and the warm sun. You make ourselves out to be just a little bit better then the rest of you people.</p>

<p>CARL ROGERS: Well, it doesn't sound to me at all as you're laughing at it way down inside. It sounds like tears inside but it sure sounds like pain inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what the tears or pain are exactly because they don't want to come up.</p>

<p>CARL ROGERS: Nothing leaks through the (inaudible - 1:23:31.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Once in awhile not every often. I guess I'm with somebody that don't hold it against me and it goes through themselves and understands, maybe not completely, but, you know, understands how I feel about it and understands I do laugh at it. Somebody just as fucked up as I am. Then I can, you know, drop this by on a big laugh. But even then it becomes sometime to much word, to much saying well maybe it is this, maybe it is that, maybe I did this (inaudible - 1:24:22.0). But still if it's a little closer then it is with everybody else then it's no longer. And even then we can still laugh at it but my God I realize that I'm laughing at it and I can see well why am I laughing at it but I still laugh. What an ass when I'm laughing at my, you know, laughing shit who laughs at themselves for Christ sake? Gets down and gets all fucked up, knows they are all fucked up and laughs about it and then says to themselves, I don't really care about it I'm really laughing at myself over this thing, right now.</p>

<p>CARL ROGERS: Whatever works to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, even the laughing. And Jesus I really am weird I'm really just (inaudible - 1:25:12.9). I can laugh at all this fucked up shit in me and laugh at the fact that I'm laughing at it and realize that I'm laughing at it and everything else and I keep laughing, it's a big joke.</p>

<p>CARL ROGERS: Big joke and who is the joke on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's on me, naturally. How could it be on anybody else?</p>

<p>The next interview was the tenth interview and it was held five days later. The client and I spoke only rarely during the entire hour. The client stretched out on the floor for the whole interview and I stretched out in my chair and did the same. It was as if we had struggled up on to a kind of interpersonal plateau and was stretched out there, both of us very, very tired.</p>

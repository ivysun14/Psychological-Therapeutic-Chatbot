<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so, since I saw you last month it seemed that you were, your mood was much, you were doing more things, and your mood was, was, kind of, happier related to the fact that you were doing more things, and you weren't, uh, the, the time that you were doing other things was less.  It was taking up a lot of time and effort, right, before?  So have things changed at all since then or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're good?  Okay.  Um, that's good to know.  Um, all right.  There is, um, I mean, are you, are you, um, I don't know.  I, I guess, a lot of time you were, you, you, earlier than when I saw you, you were, you would have a lot of trouble deciding things.  You'd get, sometimes it would make you really, you couldn't decide, you know, um, has that stuff gotten easier?  Yeah?  All right.  Um, has your sister been behaving?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, yes, maybe, usually?  I hear she's special.  Oh, my goodness, look at that smile.  Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She thinks she's special.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She put her shirt on backwards.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very nice.  Is it inside out too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And backwards?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  It's nice though, with the hood especially.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She talks [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm?  Oh, there you go.  That's funny.  Um, all right.  So you're playing soccer?  You doing well?  Getting a lot of exercise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Having fun?  Um, [INAUDIBLE].  Okay.  Are you, um, let me see, where was that thing, uh, hmm, maybe this, no.  That, um, at one point we were talking about, I don't know, it was some bad thoughts you were having, and this was a couple of months ago.  Like, they, it, I don't know, you didn't seem to be bothered, it was, you were still having some of them, but they didn't seem to be bothering you quite as much.  Have, are you still having some of those thoughts or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not really, they've gotten less, a lot less?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.  Um, are you having any problems with the medicine, side effects?  No?  Do you go around smiling all day now?  Just part of the day?  Nice smile, you should go around smiling if you, she's been a lot happier in general?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think so.  I mean, she—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Definitely has some good days and bad days—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But pretty normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, but I think it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thanks.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not as intense—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	As it used to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, like the, the different kind of swings, mood swings, or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, it's not as intense of mood swings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That's good.  And how about, um, let's see, um, um, when she does, like, are they, the, the, the swings are less intense but less often?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I would say less often and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not as, like, when she does—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not as—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Get upset—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's more of a controlled upset.  It's not the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, very good, not completely—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not the super, oh, my gosh, where has our little girl gone, crazy.  Right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not possessed.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that's a good, good way to say it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I know that all too well with my now 19 year old, um, god.  So, all right.  Um, are you having any thoughts about wishing you were dead or anything like that?  No, I didn't think so.  Um, did it, no worse depression or anxiety, like nervous, sad, it's not worse than before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it's better, less, okay.  Restless, agitated, like you can't be still or calm?  No.  Your mother, actually, we could ask mom to, to help out.  Like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm sorry.  What's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, that's all right.  Restless, agitated?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Wow, you have some June birthdays, huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	June birthdays.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's a good time to have a birthday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um, all right.  No extreme increase in activity, talking or other unusual changes in mood or behavior?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Keep an eye out for these, tell me if you see any, don't stop taking the meds suddenly and all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, she's delightful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's the greatest, mom.  Um, oh, boy, all right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Why don't you tell him you made all A's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	On your report card, straight A's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Awesome.  That's amazing.  Wow.  Did you know how smart you are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did, okay, that's good.  Sometimes it's hard when you can't, like, put much effort or as much effort as you need to into your work because you're busy doing these other things, you know, it's hard to, you know, you have a lot more free time now to do stuff probably that you want to do instead of things that you have to do, right?  Wonderful, okay.  Um, all right so, how long has, does this—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, does this thing last?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What's that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The medicine, the bottle.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, we probably have 1 more dose in it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is this the first one?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, this is the last—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did I, I gave you refills?  I haven't, no.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You haven't given us refills yet, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Did you give us, was it 2 or 3 bottles, I think was the last, first prescription.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got all of them at once?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, I'm just saying—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, oh, oh, you—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That we've gone through our last 1.  We have no refills after tomorrow's dose, and then I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no.  You, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I called you about the dose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I mean, the first, the first thing I gave you, they gave you 1 bottle—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So we finished that and got another 1, but I can't remember if it was 2 or 3.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Uh, so, okay.  Do, I mean, let's see.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I guess I should've brought in the bottle.  I thought, uh, having them filled we would fix it, and it's just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I think—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Two a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because this says 60 in ml, our, in this refill thing that they faxed to me, okay.  So do you have more appointments?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't believe so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So let's do, I don't know.  Do you want to del, you want to do a month and then, and then if things are going well, we'll stretch it over the summer?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, whatever you think is best.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's good.  Um, very good, very good.  Okay.  Okey dokey, well, that's easy enough.  All right so, let's uh, one, a couple more things I might have to ask you.  How tall are you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	How tall are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fifty six.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Fifty six, is that what you think?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're at 42, it's just we're talking about [NAME OTHER].  Forty eight?  I know you're at least 50.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, 50 is good.  How much do you weigh, just, do you know, any idea?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you know how much you weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Around 64, I got checked for school.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There's someone there doing that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's all right.  That's close enough.  Um, all right.  And, okay, so 1, uh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, I've seen you 5 times?  Okay, and the last time [DATE], for 5 days.  Okay, sounds good.</p>

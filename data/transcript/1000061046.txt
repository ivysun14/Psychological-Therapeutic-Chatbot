<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 0222-115. Interview number 17, April 8th, 1971</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow, it has been long time. How long has it been - a week; two? It's a week and a half I guess. Well, Carmen's trip came off okay, I guess. After I went and got her home, I haven't heard from her where Jessica stands. I am just now starting to have things gel as to how I feel about them, from as far back as when Jessica and I had that showdown about a month ago it seems like now. I am kind of bummed out. She left me with the impression if you don't have something good to say, it's best not to say it. In other words, don't cry on my shoulder, or vice versa. Which just sounds real cheery but it is unreal. I just don't want to be happy all the time when I don't feel happy all of the time. I feel that much less connection. If feel bad, I've got nothing to do but sit there and feel bad: I can't even express it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, that's frustrating and also...what is the word I am looking for...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow, how can you do that? When I can't remember a word, I just go crazy for hours trying to remember the damn thing!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes I do. This apparently wasn't (Inaudible 2:40).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just seem discouraged.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am. I felt really strange all day long and it is just in the last hour or two that I am just feeling discouraged but I suppose the closest I can come to saying why is that I feel like I am always having to salvage relationships with people. I am always having to be the one to do something to try and I don't know whether it is because it is not worth it to them or whether they don't want to bother, or the don't want the relationship to break up or what. It is not just Jessica - it's all kinds of things. I am getting bummed out altogether. I just feel like, f***, if that is all there is to it, I would just as well go somewhere else. 0:03:38.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not sure...I can see why...like, you're the one that is responsible for all of the work going on. It would start to make you even angry. I am wondering also if there is something about that: other people must not care about you if they are not going to put something into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not even to the point that they don't care about me so much as they don't care about the relationship. I don't feel remorse or anything about how they feel towards me, I guess. That's a kind of strange way to say it but it's just that whatever the relationship is worth is the point where they are as willing to forget it as anything else. There are two very old friends of mine who I have jut recently given up on altogether. The only way I could coax even a word out of them, in the effect of a letter or anything else, is to demand it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is almost as if you didn't exist or if they never knew you or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. I feel that way just about everything I have ever known. I have just been separated for so long I don't recognize it and vice-versa.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that ever since you've come here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not ever since. I have thought recently this is about the time of year when I was first starting to feel - familiar is sure a strong word to use for the way I felt - say, familiar with New York.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have about somewhat adapted to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, much better! It was probably mid-summer before I felt like it was anywhere near a home to me. Looking back, I can't imagine how I survived it - I just have no idea what was going on. The only thing I can think of that kept me going - and I knew it at the time then - is that I really was refusing to be aware of here. I was just tripped into my head with all the things that I wanted to do and all the things I was hoping for. I was too f****** scared to really look around me and see where I was. I don't know: now that I have, I have decided that if I can make it here, I can just about make it anywhere. I am not saying I have! (Chuckles.) I haven't done any worse than most anybody else I know. 0:06:14.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is a really hostel environment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't like cities and that is terrible to start with. Central Park has about as much affinity - as part of the social atmosphere of Central Park - is just like water off a duck's back. I could go right through it without it even touching me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's interesting you say that. There was one day - I didn't not tell you this for some reason; I just never thought of it. I was sitting outside the laundry room (ph) on Seventh Street and I saw you walking - I guess it was between Fourth Street and Ninth (ph). You looked as though...something weren't there at all; as though you were not at all part of the neighborhood or something. I am not sure what gave me that impression, but it is like this image flashed into my mind - just (inaudible 7:04).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's possible. I always feel a little bit distanced with the other people around. I really don't belong here. I mean, I work a patronage job with a bunch of Poles and Greeks down south so...I don't know. About the only similarity between me and the people around here is age. That is a pretty thin line to go on when everything else is so different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's really missing though? There has got to be more than a patronage job.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is more than that. People around here are...perhaps have something to do. They are in school; or they are into a racial thing; or they are into a revolution bag; or something like that. I am just used to being into people; being around people and knowing as many people as possible because it is fun and people are really a gas. But nobody has ever caught on to that around here, evidently. The people that they know...they change too much I guess. Nobody's here long enough to know each other so they are not really interested in bothering to try to get to know one another, or something like that. Or maybe I am just not around at the times that that happens. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Also it sounds like you see them all being involved in some sort of (inaudible 8:40) thing which (inaudible 8:42) each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. They are headed somewhere so they don't really have time to look to the sides. I got a letter from my attorney a couple of days ago. I have to be in Boise - I have made arrangement now; I will be there on the 16th. Oh, that's right, so on the 15th, I won't be here because as soon as school; work; school. (Makes a whistling noise.) 0:09:18.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You work that day?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, now there's a trippy one! As soon as I get out, I will be sailing from here. I have to go back there and start the wheels rolling on the civil case of the car accident now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Will you be there for a while?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it will take about an hour.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I have to pay my way down there and I have to pay my way back. Josh's not going, so I would feel like I would be imposing to stay with his folks. I don't know what I will do when I get there. It bums me out entirely: I have half a mind to go down and come back just to let people know that I am pissed off. I don't know whether they would notice or not but it would be an ego trip on my part.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean (inaudible 10:15)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am forever getting this "drop in next time you are here" bit, or something like that. Or, "When are you coming back?" It is the only thing they have to say to me anymore, so that should I drop in - which I used to do - (inaudible 10:38) there is absolutely nothing happening; nothing to talk about; and we don't have familiarity anymore so it is an absolute dud. so I just make a point of saying I probably won't have time. There is probably only about four people left that in that city that I really give a shit about seeing anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not that they maybe don't mean the invitation - because like I guess they sort of do when they say it - but when you get there, it is like you don't know them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I realize better than they that we really don't have anything to go on anymore. They say it because at one time we were friends, not understanding that we are completely different than we were at that time. I am really mixed: I am going back and I don't know whether to make something out of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean try and go and get in touch with some people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know whether to try and do a big reconstruction thing or a re-orientation or whatever you want to call it and get things straightened out, or whether to say "to hell with it" and go back and do whatever happens and leave. I have done that before: just go down and think, "Well, what happens...something is always happening." Nothing happens! I really wouldn't mind that too much. 0:12:04.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, you wouldn't mind just going and coming back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty near. I might stay a day just do nothing - just to be there because I will be there during the weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just has a very futile sound to me as you are saying it. "Well, I might stick around but I get the sense that nothing will happen."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I am sure nothing will happen, unless I arranged it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unless you have it worked out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A-ha. Like, even trying to arrange things for two months in advance...I go down there and there is maybe a better chance than usual that it will pull off but it is sure a long ways from a sure bet. I had a really strange experience this morning. I know I have been dreaming an awful lot lately. I will wake up every night and, "A-ha, I hope remember that." And, of course, I don't. Sometimes I remember waking up, saying that to myself. I never remember what it was. This morning, I was typing at work and all of a sudden I remembered part of a dream where I walked into a room at Jessica's house and her parents were there. It was a super-tense scene and although it was as it should be happening - and as we were expecting it to happen - it was still real tense. </p>

<p>It was obviously the first time I met her parents since last October when the shit hit the fan. That's all I remember of it but I don't remember anything going wrong. I just remember walking into the room and realizing the situation and her parents were there. I don't even know if she was there. But immediately after that, I flashed real heard on...I think I was telling you about - a while back - where a friend of mine, Steve Svetz, refused to tell me whatever it was he had found out from his girlfriend's father. And I don't know why I connected them but I remember the dream and immediately - very strongly - I flashed on whatever that was that Steve had said and it left me in a super uptight mood. I had no idea what it meant but for some reason the two of them fit together immediately and it left me feeling uptight. It is almost like seeing a deja vu from the other end! 0:15:00.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing that comes to my mind is something unspoken: he was keeping something from you and I am wondering if there is anything in that dream that is being kept from you? Did anybody say anything to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There were maybe very perfunctionary "hellos" or "how are you doing?" or something about the weather.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is clearly not what was not going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, the very act of us both being in the same room without physical violence was the big issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You meant what the three of you are really feeling towards each other?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The three of whom? Oh, you mean in the dream?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, in the dream and maybe in...I have gathered that there is no love lost among the three of you: here parents and you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: None. I am afraid there is an awful lot of energy towards the opposite clause between us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know they are probably negative and probably hate your guts and all that: is that how you feel about them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I really feel sorry for the whole scene, especially what is doing for Jessica - Christ.! It is like living in an armed camp here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do me this favor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you can. Pretend that you are yourself in that dream and say whatever you would say, as yourself in that dream, to them. I mean, if you begun a conversation in that dream what would you be saying to them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I remember saying maybe a couple of things. I don't remember them replying for sure. What I said, I was very cautious to avoid making any reference to our past feelings. It was, like I said, it was all very, very perfunctionary. I can't remember what I was doing. Like, I only remember just a very short span of it but it was just kind of to the effect of "hello" and "what have you been doing today?" or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, and after this and after the flashback, or whatever it was that produced...you woke up feeling uptight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not woke up - I was awake when I remembered it. 0:18:01.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was awake, typing at a typewriter and I remembered that and then all of a sudden, for some reason, immediately after I remembered that, Stevie came to mind in that situation there. I don't know why but it was just very immediate and very strong - a clear image just together. Without understanding either one or even realizing that one had brought the other one on maybe, I became very uptight. I was very curious - tense and curious - as to what it all was supposed to add up to. It never did make any sense!</p>

<p> I started typing a letter to Jessica - in fact that is what I was typing at the time I think. No, it wasn't, because that's the incident that made me later on start writing her the letter. Eventually I was typing her a letter and I kind of explained what had happened and made the comment that I didn't understand what it all meant, to the effect that, "That's no surprise because I seem to understand very little of what's going on anymore." And I went on a couple more paragraphs, and then just tore the letter up and just threw it away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, because it wasn't happy. It pissed me off to throw that damn letter away but I realized that mailing it would be just what she said she didn't want me to do. I won't do it. I will let her know that I am really against the whole situation but it is kind of like I am contracted to go through this relationship until arrangements are made for it to end, or until it improves - one way or the other. I would be a kind of a SOB to just go off on my end without at least having an understanding to that effect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you have lost me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am not sure that I followed it myself but it's a really ridiculous game of nobility, I guess. If she should ask for something, why then it is supposed to be me that even does it, or whatever it is she asks for. That's because that's the way things are just taken for granted to be between us right now. The reason that was taken for granted is because it wasn't expected that one of us would be asking something of the other that wouldn't be done willingly anyway. Now that that situation has arisen a couple of times, I will correct it if I can to the effect that either we get an understanding, or that doesn't happen, or we reorganize the understanding where I won't be expected to do it if I don't want it. Like I figured, it would only be a week; I just don't write her any letters unless I can write one that is happy. I don't know: it just grates on me so bad. And it is not so much her fault: I am sure that that's me interpreting her maybe in a way that she didn't mean. But it is what she said to me. I have no idea of what bounds I could take other than that. She undoubtedly didn't mean that...I won't say that...I hope she didn't mean that hardline a course but she didn't give any alternatives. 0:22:17.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, are you saying until you discuss that demand of hers, you don't feel free to violate it; you feel that you must accede to it but you are also mad that you do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I don't know, it is such a paradox.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's so gentlemanly - I don't see how you can do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am so f***** polite I make myself sick! I mean, I like being that way and yet I hate doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't mean to poke fun at you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My first feeling was I didn't think that you would do that. I guess I see you as usually trying to express what you feel and it felt like...you were saying that sometimes you do do that but it just doesn't sit right with me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, normally I wouldn't . Normally I try to avoid a situation where I wouldn't be able to express myself but it's just kind of a paradox that an arrangement that was made for better expression, where you could ask something if you wanted has kind of turned tables on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see what you are getting at. You are saying that you wanted to set it up so people would be free to ask for things and now she is asking for something which is very disturbing to you to go and do. Alright, I am very slow today - you should pardon me!</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that is probably the first time that I have looked at it that way but it is just exactly what's happened. I tend to manipulate - I started to say control but that is not true - feelings and I don't know whether it be successful or not. 0:24:35.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yours or others?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mine. If something should anger me - and I don't really want to be mad, but I am - I will try and understand it so that I will I feel something else. I will feel pity for whoever the idiot is that angered me first, or something like that. Be that as it may, there is always an energy of emotion that is in one form or another - and denying that it is there. Some people say that it wouldn't be right: if you are angry, don't deny that. Only I find that I would spend too much of my time being angered and too much of my time being depressed, or something like that. So I do this type of thing but I still refuse to deny that I do feel something. If I feel it to the point that I would like to express it, what I dislike even more is not being able to. Not so much that someone should...well, not be able to...it is hard to define. Like if I am really pissed off about something but there is nobody to yell at about it - because nobody else had really anything to do with it - I will end up writing. If it was someone that I feel I should be able to express myself to and they don't, that upsets.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They say, in some way, I don't want to hear it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's just an example of what is happening there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, that is what just hit me. But when I first said that, it wasn't the situation that I was first thinking of. 0:27:01.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think...one thing I was thinking a second ago is that you were just saying, I thought, "Look, I don't deny that I am angry but when I am in a situation where I am frustrated and I can't express it, I sometimes put my feelings into other forms and try to...it seems like an adaptable way to handle it." But it sounds like, "Look, this one is just not working that way; this one is much more frustrating." I don't know, there is something about this particular situation that is making it harder. For some reason, this particular thing is getting to you more than some others do, I guess is all I am saying. I don't know whether that is because it is Jessica or because it has accumulated a long history of this kind of thing happening - or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Both. Both because it is Jessica, which makes me that more sensitive to any trouble there; and also because time and time and time and Christ only knows how many times over again, we have said, "Let us do something about it," thought we had, gone on and we would fall back into the same God damn dirty little trap. I just don't understand it. It is as much being lost and frustrated and just absolutely and completely baffled as it is anything else. I just don't know what the hell else to do. Everything seems to just...it is a very temporary thing so that you can turn your back to go back to whatever it is. You have to concentrate everything you have got for a little while and it does its thing and then it starts sliding right back down. I think I remember saying once a while back that it seems to go in a month and a half, two month, cycles. You bump up and down and every time you get not quite as well as off as you were last time. It is just a very gradual decline of steps.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like you are, sort of, right now standing back and watching the relationship deteriorate?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt that way for quite a while. I feel so objective to Jessica. She and I, our relationship, is such a thing of symbolism to me, more than it is real anymore. It has been God only knows how long since I have been able to see her for any amount of time or regularity. It has just been whatever I have wanted to make it for so long, without having any reality injected into it. If someone were to answer my letters, I am not even sure I would need Jessica for this relationship anymore. I am sure that she is feeling - whether she realizes it or not - she's feeling effects of exactly the same thing on the other end. 0:30:17.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like there is this shadowing thing that is 900 odd or so miles away and you are not really sure what it is. You would like to hear from it but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I just hardly even know Jessica anymore. She's as much as what I dream her of, or what I want to remember of her, or what I am hoping it to be as she is in reality. We are finding it hard to make everything fit together. Boy, that's an infectious saying: "I don't know." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not sure what you meant by that. You mean it spreads to everything else about your life?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, to the effect that you reach a point where you say "I don't know" and all you can do is back down all the way back down the line going, "I don't know, I don't know" until you don't even know what existence is anymore, or whether...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the stuff with Jessica in your relationship is just a part of that process that you get into sometimes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no, no. It might affect me in a way so that I would be upset to the point of where I might get into it. I haven't lately, by the way. I have thought a few times where the biggest hang-up in people is doubt. It's scary and I think it is screwed up because of it. The basis of almost any doubt I can find is in the doubt of themselves - or about themselves. 0:33:03.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you reach a point where, on something about yourself or something concerning yourself - not concerning you like, "Will I be cold tomorrow?" Concerning you like, where you have part of the action in it and you get to the point where you say, "I don't know." "I don't know if I can be happy tomorrow. I don't know if I can maintain a relationship with such a person." All of this kind of stuff and it just backs down - the "I don't know" is filtered all the way down through you. And I hate not knowing. I thought often that the idea of innocence through...innocence of idea or innocence of mind; stupidity; the responsibility of knowledge, whichever way you want to look at it. </p>

<p>I remember when I was a real young kid...I don't know, I did some LSD a while back and I was walking along the midway and there was a real bright sun. I think it was last weekend - Saturday - just a beautiful day. I was walking along and I noticed...I had a look at the pavement and I would see patterns in it just flash real hard that I could remember when I was a very young kid. A dirty crew cut little tub headed kid running around and the sun would be so bright that the glare...you could never really open your eyes; you always had to look through your eyelashes. I would look at those patterns just like that when I was a little kid in the pavement. I am constantly amazed at...I was just such a mindless creature until I was probably in high school. I just went along in a little daze of self. I never looked around at the world or realized where I was, who I was or what I was doing - or anything - else until I was until at least half-way through high school before it even started occurring to me. I had insecurities up to that point. I look back at when I was a very young kid - like I was just talking about - it was just a daze. Not happy; not sad - just there. If I got hurt, I cried. If I was happy, I was happy. I kept thinking that getting back to that kind of innocence is such a security. You have to give up being happy and sad but, you know, you are safe from being sad at least. 0:36:10.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I also remember...and this is what really freaked me out...I remembered so clearly how my mind worked then that not only was I content to be happy or sad - just myself - but also, all of my thoughts were just self. Everything: I wanted it or I didn't want it. They wanted it and I wanted it. I wanted it for me and I didn't care whether they got it etcetera, etcetera. It really shocked me. I used to consider that I wish I could unlearn many things so that I wouldn't have the responsibility of having to decide on them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like you are talking about unlearning a dimension of awareness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very much - very much. I have kind of decided that there is no way I can really accept that as the plausible direction I would like to go in. The only other direction to go would be to be all-knowledgeable and also to be all-powerful so that you could control it. It leaves me in an absolute dilemma: I can't go back and there is infinity in front of me - so I am screwed. All I can do is muddle through and I am going to have to accept all the pain that goes with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And live with the not knowing - the many times of not knowing I guess is what I am hearing you say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and I'll never be at the point where I know. I will always be doubtful and I will always be completely free of having a solid base to stand on. If something hits me, it will always knock me back because I will never know how to...I could see that one but I couldn't say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that is sounding a little different because there is doubt and it is agonizing but I am hearing you say...you are adding something to it now. For me, anyhow, it is like saying there is not only a lot of uncomfortable, painful, doubty type things in the world but it sounds like you feel it is impossible for you to be sure of anything. Like, there isn't any one solid thing to stand on - you just used. Did I just hear that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. It was a thing that kind of hit me in my mind more than I knew how to put into words but it is like if a person...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have an image of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell me what the image is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you could imagine a contained infinity. 0:39:01.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is that for openers?! (chuckles.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told you this was a trippy one!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, so the more a person feels of it, the more knowledge they have and I feel like a very small speck in the middle so that any situation, crisis, problem - whatever - would be coming at me like a light ray and it should hit me and I have nothing back here to stop me. It just rebounds me. Now, if I were all knowledgeable, I would be...there is no way it could breath down me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would be right up against the limits.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and I know that I will always be...In the same way that it is infinity when you are all of it, when you are not all of it, there is no bound so you will never be up against a side that you can use to brace yourself. You will always be just a free thing that always gets beat around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are infinitely knock around-able!</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckles.) Yeah, right! </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thought of that kind of existence is what? Frightening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Depressing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have said one time the thing that scares me...well, I am not sure it was a very, very partial thing to say but I was talking to a guy who was very uptight - he was on LSD and very scared. He had asked me how it was I had gotten scared one time. I kind of knew what he was asking because he had just gotten so stoned that he didn't know whether he was tasting or seeing or hearing. Not being used to it - I think it was the first time that he had ever gotten ripped - it just really scared him. He didn't know whether reality existed or whether he would ever get back to it. The strange thing is that although we can symbolize an infinity, being finite, there is no way we can encompass or understand. It is kind of that way that...although infinity by theory made up of finite, there is also no end to it, so being finite, there is no way to attain infinity. There is no way to get there from here, kind of thing. That is the direction I am headed and yet from what I see here, there is no possible way of getting there. 0:41:56.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh! That kind of fits in for me somehow with your saying, "The number of times I am just waiting: my goals are so far in advance that I can hardly imagine them sometimes." It is like a philosophical statement about what your everyday life is like in some ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, actually, that is a strange...well, it is part of what I would consider a religion to me. If there is such a thing as an after-life - whether it be through many more lives or something else like that - then a person is headed towards infinity. They will eventually be enough or something like that.</p>

<p>It is like from this side, there is no way of understanding the other side - there is no way of encompassing it. It is just another "I don't know" - the final basis "I don't know." It is the one of that kind of philosophy, just like...is reality of another "I don't know" that you just have to put at the base and go from there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well, I guess what is missing for me right now is I am not sure...I hear that it has some impact on you in terms of, I don't know, what you think about your life in general but what I'm groping for is: what is that? That's why I keep saying, "Does it scare you? Does it depress you? Does it do such and such to you?" Apparently, I think it does something but I am not sure what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like, right now I feel waiting is a waste of time. I should either do something in the meantime or I shouldn't have to wait. It is my incompleteness that puts me in that situation. I just don't know what else to do or what I should be doing instead. That was the same thing that went in two different directions. It is like you go through life and there are points. Very occasionally, they seem to make so much time worthwhile. It has been quite a while since I have had one of those. 0:45:00.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can have a good day at work or it can be a pretty day outside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I suppose it is like, "What the hell does that mean?" Those are like almost isolated, random events that don't do anything for you - or in the core of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it is like trying to base a day on somebody smiling: there really isn't that much in it for me. I hate to be...I won't say I hate it...I realize every bit that a person goes through life with themselves number one - and that is the way I feel. Be that as it may, with whatever love is supposed to mean or anything else, I think that just because of the fact that you can't be someone else, a person is always the first thing on your mind. Even if it being sacrifice, they are still what's on your mind. There's just...nothing that seems to make it worthwhile for me. I guess I am...the problem is, I could be happy with a smile if it meant...if I could mark it off as I am so much farther towards my goal but I have seen circles of five years that go down the drain. I would have to see something very substantial before I would really feel that I have made any headway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would satisfy you something substantial? Do you have a sense for it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would have to be something very lasting. I don't know if I could point something out that would make sense or make meaning. I could say anything but mostly what I would look for is something that would satisfy me and would last. It has been quite the contrary for the main part and those things that are satisfying to me are usually just random incidents that don't really mark any advancement - they just happened. I was able to enjoy them at the time but that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am connecting this up with what's been happening with Jessica. I guess I hear that relationship - particularly being with her as having been what you were calling "points" - something that you hope to attain that would be substantial. I guess I am wondering if you are looking at one of your points - glimmering and fading in and out. 0:48:18.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm - in a way. I am kind of torn between "there goes another point." I don't want to blow it again and I am also to the point where it is really f***** up and as long as I don't want to really lose, am I really wasting time on it? That is a very cruel way of saying it: that eliminates all that I feel about it s far as emotions go. Logic and emotions are two very entirely different things to me - very different - and I get very confused as to when to use what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like whether you ought to make one of these rational decisions about pay-off and waste and that kind of thing when really, the most important thing is how you feel about Jessica and is it worth all that energy for you. It seems to be worth a hell of a lot - it seems to have been anyway.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that is true. I have got so much...I am indebted to it so much. Everything that I have started here is for that. I would be in the army if it wasn't for it. I am not saying that is a terrible fate - it is, but I won't say that - but not only would Jessica and I's relationship - but the meaning for a lot of what my life amounts to right now - would fade. I could very quickly establish something else maybe myself but that is all I have got to put in its place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are not talking about a small event even if you could replace it. That would be a very major kind of a shift.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have a feeling - maybe a feeling...I wonder sometimes - sometimes convinced and sometimes the other stream - that it's maybe beneficial that all of the troubles and things that I seem to be hassling with now; sometimes I am convinced that the longer it takes me to get them cleared up...well, that's not the way you say it. The troubles that come from Jessica and I being separated: the longer it takes for she and I to end our separation, the longer it will take us to clear up the problems that were brought on by it. And at other times, I feel that the longer it takes - that we should last before we are back together - the stronger we would be once we are together. Like I say, I shift on that quite a bit. I am kind of shifting three feet one and one back and I am slowly deciding - slowly to the point that I am not always convinced of it anymore - that the longer we are apart, the more trouble we are going to have ever managing to get it together. 0:51:51.0</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if that isn't true about just that satisfaction that I was talking about - just being happy for a change about where I am in the world. I wonder do I ever reach a point where I am not going to be happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean where it will be impossible?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, where I am always going to be so hassled with one thing or another that I just never will get it all untangled. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My association to that is something like, that's a hell of way to live a life, or that's sort of an inhuman existence where there is no possibility of feeling right about anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it also puts more anxiety and more pressure on me now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That it's not only to the point that if I looked at it one way, the sooner I get it done, the sooner I will be happy. But also to the point that if I don't hurry, since I don't know where that point is that I could ever be happy past - I don't know where it is: t might be tomorrow; it might be a year - I have got to do it as quick as I possibly can. Of course that tangles it up too. I can't be happy and be pressured. 0:54:01.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and I guess the thing that is completing the vicious circle - at least for me - is the part about, after a while, it gets to be such a way of life - or life becomes so complicated - that you can't turn back. It's irrecoverable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes...a while back I was having an urge to just, like, take off - just disappear one morning; just walk out and have nobody hear from you again. I really didn't know why or what: I just wanted to disappear and change completely - start all over again. I often think that just being by myself; go somewhere and find an island - this is completely symbolic. Well, better yet: I have a friend that I always thought was an absolute "nowhere." He's not doing anything. He's going to school and I ask him why: he is majoring in psychology or philosophy. But all he's doing - he admits - he just wants a (inaudible 55:18) from it. And when he is 26, he will find a small farm and just live there and I thought what a nowhere way to go. He said that he doesn't have to bother with the 10,000 billion other things that people would have to if they were to try and put up with society as it is now. </p>

<p>I keep thinking: the only thing that keeps me going is just plain greed. If I could ever convince myself that I don't really want a stereo and I don't really want a climate controlled house etcetera etcetera, I don't think I'd hesitate to do that. Because I am sure that I don't have to take 16 years of school to be happy. I can just sit and think my thoughts and as long as I can think them, so much the better. Or better, I should say, that an education of my choosing would be better than what I would have to...Instead of taking a med degree, I could take whatever I wanted to. I wouldn't have to be governed by my greed!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess we better stop. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 0:56:44.7</p>

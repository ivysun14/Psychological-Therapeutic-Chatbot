<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm OK. It's pretty much the same as last week. So I might not remember where we left off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's OK. I'll let you know if I go lost or need catching up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In terms of the sad situation, he sent me an e-mail about something a day after we met and it was really sort of obnoxious and he was in this room and I said, "Could you not send me e-mails about every little thing, please?" There were three pairs in the bathroom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a bathroom. [00:00:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I was like "Could you not send me e-mails like this? It sort of makes me feel sort of uncomfortable to not feel like I can be at home in my house and I think it's a little bit weird," and so he's like, "No, I'm going to e-mail you every single time I find something to e-mail you about because you're really bad about doing this stuff." And I'm like, "Oh, my God." I didn't know what to answer. I started getting so angry - really, really angry. I didn't know what to say and I just walked away muttering rude things. I was like, "OK, I better not say that to his face so I'm going to walk away."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like a pretty unsuccessful conversation, I'm guessing, for the both of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. So then I went to my room and he comes and knocks on my door and we have this huge fight, really big argument where we yell at each other and we say a lot of mean things. That was really unsuccessful, and at the end I was like, "I don't think we're getting anywhere. (chuckles) I don't think we're going to get anywhere, so what do you want me to do?" And so he left and after that he hasn't really sent — maybe he's sent one e-mail or something — but I think that he's sort of resigned, and so we're sort of just pretending to be nice to each other (chuckles). And we had a house meeting a few days after that and he was like, "Yeah, I'm moving out May 1<sup>st</sup>," when he told us he was moving out July 1<sup>st</sup>. He really wants to get out, which is fine. [00:02:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he having similar issues with other people in the house as he's having with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's mostly me. I mean I'm not the only one, but it's mostly me. So he really wants to leave, which is fine, I guess, but he gave us two weeks to find a roommate, which we did because we have a good house and the price is really nice. But still, two weeks to find a roommate is not very nice. I guess now we're like kind of awkward, so we're just pretending to be friends. Once I had time to cool down I thought like, "Well, maybe we're not great roommates, but I wouldn't be good roommates with half of our friends and maybe we could still be friends." And so I sent out a house e-mail and I was like, hey, his thesis defense is at such-and-such time. If you guys want to show up I'm going to go. And I went and asked him some questions that were good questions but not super hard to pin him. I don't know. I've been trying to make an effort to be friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did he respond to that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He sent out a thank you e-mail to everyone, but it's still kind of awkward, which is fine. During our fight he was like, "I'm not the one who sends out really hurtful e-mails," and I was like, "Oh, God." My response was, "Yes, you do, because your e-mails hurt my feelings," so I think that he's still really sore about the e-mail, which is fair. It's not a fun place right now. (chuckles) [00:03:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's a really difficult relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the thing is now that Tim, who's staying, is actually starting to sort of side with Phil, and he even told me . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . continuing [ ](overlapping voices at 00:04:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so I'm really starting to get worried because Phil is moving out in two weeks. Fine, I can deal with it, but Tim's signing another year lease with us and so I really need to make sure that's not going to be an issue. I don't quite know how to do that because certain things he brings up I sometimes I don't feel like I can talk to him because I feel like what he would say is something like, "Oh my God, you're so emotional. Why would you overthink things?" because he really just says what he means. I mean he can be blunt sometimes, but also it's pretty easy to know what he's thinking. So I don't know. I'm really not looking forward to that conversation, especially because the bug situation is continuing. Julia found a bug and she ran down the stairs and yelled and was like "Oh my God guys, there's this bug," and asked the two guys, "Oh my gosh, will you guys come?" and Tim's like, "So go kill it." (chuckles) I mean it's not my place to be offended for her, but that would totally be me. That's what I would do and if he responded to me like that I would be really upset, and so I'm really wary of going forward. (snickers) [00:05:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What conversation do you feel like you want to have with Tim?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess I want to talk about not feeling uncomfortable sharing my feelings with him because he sort of makes me feel uncomfortable about some things. I don't know. He sort of just . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you feel like he's judging your reactions?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I'm a pretty logical person, I think. I have issues understanding where my feelings are coming from because it bothers me that I don't know where they're coming from. I like logic, too, but he's like the extreme version of that - almost logic to the exclusion of feelings. That's hard to relate to or have a conversation with. I think that for him "why wouldn't you just kill a bug?" is the equivalent of "why wouldn't you just sweep the stairs?" but it's really not for me or Julia or something. He doesn't seem to really want to budge on that and so it makes it hard because I feel like I'm going into a conversation knowing where he's going to be and it's going to be difficult. I guess I also know that I'm not supposed to be thinking for him. I don't know. I can still be weird, right? [00:06:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course you can. You're absolutely allowed to have your feelings. Maybe it's harder for him to accept feelings that he doesn't understand, but you're absolutely allowed to have them - especially in here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) OK. Yeah, so I guess that's sort of where we're at. We found a new roommate who was my friend in college. We were friends but we were not best friends. We're friendly friends. One of the things we stressed when we were moving in was we really want to have really open communication, like we want it to be a good community to live in and we want to make sure you're not feeling uncomfortable, so we stressed that a lot. That was the biggest-stressed thing. And it was funny because, I don't know if you remember the Julia, Maggie and Charlene thing where it just built up and then I had this big conversation with him about all these things and it was really overwhelming for him, which I understand. (chuckles) He brought it up and he was like, "Yeah, we had this one incident but it was really sad because I really like Leanne and after that we became really good friends again." That came back in a nice way, so that was kind of nice even though it was not the ideal situation. [00:08:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but what made that work in a way that this conversation with Phil didn't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that we were able to find compromise or common ground. I said, "Oh, I feel this way," and he was like, "I didn't know that. Let me do this thing to make that not happen again." It was more of an awareness thing and Phil knows that he's pushing my buttons. He knows that these e-mails make me angry and he still does it. I think that's different. I feel like it's different with Phil, even just from my side, because I'm angrier with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if your anger with Phil makes it harder for you to have a conversation where you are sort of expressing your feelings and not just expressing the anger. [00:09:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The first conversation that was mildly successful that we had I did sort of tell him, "Oh, I asked for space because I'm so angry that I didn't think that I could have a productive conversation with you." He was like, "Oh, my reaction is just immediately take care of things, but that would make sense that you would need space for that." I feel like if I had had space between knocking on his door and walking away muttering and the five seconds, that maybe would have been a better situation. I feel like I'm arguing to have a dirty house, which I'm not at all. I think it's fine. What had happened was that I made pasta at two in the morning or something and I forgot to wash the pan and I left it in the sink for the next morning. As soon as I remembered at like nine-thirty or ten in the morning, I went down and washed it. In between him seeing it and going downstairs and seeing that it was clean, he sent me that e-mail. I was like Phil, it's OK to leave something in the sink for less than ten hours. I know that that's against community expectations, but everyone else seems on board with this except for Phil. Chill out. There's four other people who live with you. You have to be a little bit lenient. I'm not saying I want to do that every time. That's not fair. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is if it happens I don't want to feel like, "Oh my God, someone's going to be angry at me." I don't know that he understood that, though. (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if he didn't understand what you were really asking for or — because it sounds like you didn't really even get to that part before he was already really mad. [00:11:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I mean it just happened so quickly, which is also why it was sort of difficult to have a productive conversation because it was so fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Because it sounds like you even started right in with "could you not send me those e-mails."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was after he'd sent me the e-mail about the downstairs. This is after I already asked him not to send me e-mails, and so this is really frustrating. I don't know that there is a "fixing it", you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially with him leaving so soon, there's only a couple weeks before May — that's really soon. There might not be any fixing your relationship with him in that time, but this kind of communication problem is not isolated to Phil. He's an extreme example of something that's happening in other places, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I was sort of hoping for the "never having contact with someone else ever again" to go away. [00:12:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it might. There may be a chance at some point to reconcile things with him, but you might need space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things have gotten really heated with him in the past month. You've made some efforts but they haven't worked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also think that we're both holding onto stuff for a long time, and I didn't know that he was as well. And so apparently this is . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That really fuels the fire when both of you are doing that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So that's difficult, I guess. (chuckles) But I don't know, I guess I was trying to think like what if there are things that you can't really fix? I guess there are, but how am I supposed to handle that in terms of . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, there are things you can't really fix if there's violence in the relationship unless both people are dedicated to working on that, and that's not something you can fix one person. Is this thing with Phil something you can't fix? No. But it might be something you can't fix in two weeks, which is really the time you have before he moves out. And I think if both people want a relationship to be better there's very little that can't be fixed, but relationships go two ways. You need both people to be invested on working on it. This is not one of those extreme examples, it's just that it's heightened by this urgency of time. You kind of want to get things smoothed over before graduation and that's like even . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm actually feeling better about graduation because he won't be in the house. (both laugh) [00:14:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now that he's gone there's sort of a different timeline.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess I don't really feel urgency. We have similar friends and stuff and I don't want him to like . . . I don't know . . . because he talks a lot of crap about people, and so I don't want to be that person that he's like, "Oh my God, I used to live with her. She's a terrible person." You know what I mean&nbsp;? Not that I can control that but . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, but if the relationship cools off a little bit and there's time to actually process what really is the problem between the two of you, that will probably calm down. You're not a terrible person but he is really angry with you, and that's probably what he's talking about. If he's talking about you people — it's that anger coming through and that will probably subside with distance, but also, hopefully, there will be a point where you guys can have a much calmer conversation about what is this thing between the two of you that's so difficult? [00:15:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, what I was more asking if there's a problem and I feel a particular way and someone else feels a particular way and they're different, I'm just thinking like moving forward with Tim I can see this being a problem. Julia and I were thinking about having - this is really embarrassing - a house meeting about bugs (laughs) and how to handle them because it really is terrifying for me. If there was a roach, I could not handle it. It's actually really terrifying. I can't even see pictures of them, like I'm really scared of roaches, and so bugs that kind of look like roaches freak me out, but not as much as actual roaches. This is not like a minor thing that I'm trying to blow up or anything, it's been like years; and so anyway, if he's like, "well, you should deal with it," his attitude about the rat was like, "Oh, why don't you just deal with it. When I was growing up they just told me to deal with it and I had to do that. Why wouldn't you just deal with it?" And so I don't know what we can say to bridge that gap, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does "deal with it" mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't bother me about it and handle it yourself or go kill it yourself or whatever. I think that's what he means.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And is this like a random bug or does an exterminator need to be called?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) No, random bug. Like I mean it happened with the rat and I guess I should have mentioned it when we were having a conversation. I don't know. It was weird. He didn't really apologize but he seemed like he was saying I was crazy and agreeing with Phil or something. And so, that kind of bothered me and I feel like that's still going on. I don't know. (chuckles) I talked to him also and he was like, "Oh, yeah, I feel like it's you and Julia and, like, me and Phil, and Charlene just doesn't care. I feel like I'm losing my ally in the house." And I was like, "What?" That really surprised me and I feel like I can't bring it up because we were having fun and a happy conversation, so I feel like if I brought it back up he's like, "Oh my God, you take everything I say so seriously," or like [ ] (inaudible at 00:17:39)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the idea of having a sort-of house meeting is that's a neutral place. You can call a house meeting and invite people to bring any house-related topic. You're inviting sort of a neutral forum to discuss things rather than having it feel like it's a battle between people, and so one of the topics certainly can be "how do we deal with bugs?" And then there can be a discussion about "Some people have phobias about bugs, some people are more comfortable with them. Can we find a way that works for the house to deal with this situation if somebody finds something that they're afraid of?" Then it's rather than being a fight about who's right and who's wrong about their reaction, it can be like, "Here we have this thing. Let's try to recognize that people do have different reactions to these types of things — kind of come up with a protocol." You might say the protocol is if someone finds a bug, they deal with it. Then that can be like, "Well, for some people that's harder than others. Maybe there can be some give and take here. I'll do a chore that you don't like — maybe you hate vacuuming. I'll do that if you can be in charge of the bug on the wall." Try to make it less of a personal he said/she said type of thing. More of like "the house has an issue," inviting other people to bring other topics to a neutral house meeting makes it less of a "here's my issue that I want to talk about."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's usually what we do anyway. Let's have a house meeting about whatever. So that's good, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you have a forum in place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I can do that. (chuckles) I'm like, "OK, I can have a conversation and talk about how I'm feeling" to resolve conflict, but then I'm like, "Well, but in this case that just wouldn't work" or like "But in this other case, that just really wouldn't work." I guess I just have to expand the boundaries of what would and wouldn't work. (chuckles) Like now I think it could work. I think it's a perspective thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're talking about different kinds of confrontation. I think confrontation is really hard, especially when there's a lot of intense emotion behind it. It sounds like one of the things that went wrong in your conversation with Phil after he sent that e-mail, is you kind of jumped to the third step of confrontation, which is problem solving. Your solution to the problem was "can you just not send me those e-mails," and that problem solving has to come after those people air what their feelings are and really what the issue is. You kind of jumped ahead in that, probably because this isn't a new conversation. This is sort of versions of conversations you've already had, but then you sort of jumped over the first couple of steps and that makes it really hard because neither one of you really got a chance to talk about what you were really feeling. You jumped right to what would actually make the problem work better and I wonder how it would have gone differently if you were able to have a conversation where you actually got to talk about what you were feeling, what he was feeling, what you both thought the problem was, and that didn't have a chance to happen in that conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know if that would work with him right now because things are so heated, but let's see if we could practice one. What could you have said when you knocked on his door that would have started maybe at a place of "can we talk about what's going on here?" [00:21:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I mean, because we talked about it before. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe like, "Hey, we talked about these e-mails. Is there something new going on or something?" (snickers)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. How do you think he would respond to that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (snickers)(pause) I don't know. I mean it could have gone the same way or not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So try another version that you think might have more of a possibility of going differently. [00:22:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) I don't know. This is really hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is really hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) "Hey, can we talk about the e-mail that you just sent?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See if you can come up with a sentence that doesn't have any "you's" in it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) "The e-mail that you sent . . . " That's not an acceptable "you"?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's an acceptable "you", but there are ways that create even less defensiveness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (laughs) I don't know. "I wonder if we could talk about the e-mail I just got."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow, that's really good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But isn't it the same thing? [00:23:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It means the same thing but because it only focuses on yourself it just engenders a little less defensiveness, and that's kind of the whole purpose. I don't want to take away what you want to say, but I want to help you phrase it in ways that are least likely to create someone to feel defensive, because that leaves them more open to actually hearing what you have to say. So opening it up with "Hey, can we talk? I want to talk about the e-mail I just got," there's no blame insinuated, there's no way that can be perceived as if you're saying that he did something wrong because you're really not saying anything about what he did. We both know that the e-mail that you're talking about is the one that he sent, but because you haven't labeled it, you haven't brought that out, it just creates a lot less potential for him to feel like "oh, she said I did something wrong", because all you said is you got an e-mail. So it's just about packaging what you're saying. You want to make the package feel really nice. [00:24:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I thought of that in the "you are rude" or "I feel like I'm not respected" - there's a huge difference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. This is much more subtle. The reason that we're kind of working at this level of subtlety is because the feelings are so intense. If this was a situation where there wasn't a lot of intense feeling, this kind of subtlety probably wouldn't matter because things aren't heightened so much. But because there's so much history and you guys both feel like you're hanging onto so much from the past, these little tiny things actually get blown up really big. And so almost anybody would respond to "You're really rude" feeling pretty defensive. Would somebody who is not feeling defensive at all or not feeling angry at all respond to "Hey, you sent me an e-mail that I found hurtful." Probably not. But someone who is really geared up to fight and really angry already is probably going to respond to almost anything. Just like if you have any open wound and you touch it really lightly, it hurts a lot. Someone brushes against your skin and you don't have a cut there, you don't even notice. When things are already difficult little things can make a big difference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would have been the ideal way to prevent this heightening? I don't know what I would have done. I don't know how it could have gone different. I guess I do, but I don't really. [00:26:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have 100 percent control. I don't know that there's any one way that you could have gone in and totally changed the outcome, but you have a better shot at it by going in in a non-defensive way. What you said to me is you sort of knocked on his door and said, "Hey, can you not send me those e-mails?" I think one way that might have felt a little less aggressive would have been knocking on the door and saying, "Hey, can we talk? I just got an e-mail from you and I was wondering if we could talk about it." That might have felt a little less aggressive. Maybe he's so mad that it doesn't matter or maybe he would have been, "Oh, yeah. I sent an e-mail because you left a pot in the sink overnight," which would have then given you a chance to come back and be like, "Oh, yes, I realize that I did that," and like you said to me "I get that that's against our general community rules. I was hoping for a little leniency because I hardly ever do something like that," or "It was 2 o'clock in the morning and I cleaned it as soon as I remembered it." It might have left a little room for that conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do remember trying really hard to be nice and stuff and I think I did ask him, "Hey, do you have time to talk," or something like that. I did say some of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it didn't sink in for some reason? [00:28:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And maybe I just didn't really fully explain (overlapping voices at 00:28:23) but I did do some of that, which I was really happy about, and so that's actually why I was so angry because I was actually really trying, "How do I say this in a nice way? How do I say this in a way that's not offensive?" And so I would say things and I was even speaking really slowly at a certain point. "I . . would . . like . . it . . if . . " sort of like that, and then once I got to a certain point I was just like, "alright".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're trying really hard and it wasn't working. It's frustrating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I think that that's why I sort of walked away — stormed off or whatever, which I get is not constructive, but it would have been worse to yell at him or something. So I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you have said before you left the conversation something like, "I'm trying very hard and the conversation's not going very well, so I'm going to take a break from it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could have said that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would that have felt like for you? [00:29:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would have been open, I think, (laughs) probably right to the limit of where I'm comfortable with. I guess I could have done it. It would have been hard, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think it would have felt like for him? Would there have been a difference in what you did and then saying something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it may have been frustrating for him because he does like to (he told me) take care of things immediately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why I think you have to take a break.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I did think about it and it was like if he hadn't come up to my door five minutes after I stormed off, then I probably wouldn't have yelled at him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he wasn't giving you the space that you really needed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that it's his fault, either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard when you have different needs. He has a need to really wrap things up right away and you have a need for space, and those are both legitimate needs. It's hard when there are competing needs like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I guess maybe that would be something I could do before exploding in someone's face the next time. (laughs) I guess I never even thought of that as an option, sort of like this [ ] (inaudible 00:31:02) level of conversation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That might be a big piece, because I know we talked about feeling like you have options and being able to take the options that you have as part of being assertive about your needs and also being responsible to yourself. You have a need for space because when things get really heated you don't feel safe. You don't want to explode at somebody and you don't feel safe in the conversation anymore once it gets too heated for you, and so being able to tell someone, "This is what I'm feeling and this is why I'm leaving," rather than them feeling like you're running off or abandoning them in anger, you're being honest about "I am feeling really angry" or "I am feeling really frustrated" or whatever you're feeling in the moment, "And I just need to take a break from the conversation," then you're kind of asserting the difference between leaving them and leaving the conversation, especially if you want to be able to come back to the relationship and salvage the relationship. That can provide a nice description of what's actually going on for you in the moment. You're not abandoning them. You're not running out on them because you can't stand them. You can't stand the intensity of the situation, so you're taking a break from it. [00:32:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I guess I never really thought of that as being an option. After we had that yelling match, he came back 20 minutes later before he was going to leave. He was like, "Well, I'm leaving. Let's figure this out." (chuckles) I was like, "Well, I don't know if that's going to happen," but I did say, "Okay, I'm really busy right now," which I felt really good about. And he was like, "Oh, well I'm leaving." So I was like "Okay, well I don't mind then," so I walked to the door and sort of walked outside, which felt better for me than him walking in . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Into your space? Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . which is where he yelled at me so . . . (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At least he wasn't yelling at you in your room, I guess. But those are both little ways of you being able to assert some of your boundaries and at least being able to make him aware that you were busy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you said you were. At least he heard that even though you didn't get to search a time when you would talk, and you got a little more control over the way the conversation was going to happen even though it didn't go well. You can't control everything, but those were ways that you used your voice. [00:33:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt good after that, because we didn't yell at each other. We had 20 minutes to cool off and he was like, "Hey, I didn't mean to make you angry," or whatever. I said something else kind of nice. That felt a lot better, I think. But anyway, that was good. Oh, and I think the Tim thing that we talked about last week when he yelled at me and I walked away, that was a really fast conversation we had. I talked to him and I said, "Hey, Tim, can we talk?" And he was like, "Oh, about the thing the other night? Yeah, I shouldn't have yelled at you," and I was like, "Oh, okay." (both laugh) And I was like, "Okay," well I guess I'll still tell him whatever. I thought about it. It's not that I don't feel safe. It's more like I think I leave because I'm scared that I'm going to yell at them in that "times a million" way, so it's more of a "I really need to not kill this relationship in the next 10 seconds" sort of thing, so I'm going to leave. I said something like . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Afraid of yourself more than being afraid of them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. And so I changed it a little bit and I don't exactly remember the words I used but it was something like, "Oh, I feel disrespected when you yell at me and that makes me uncomfortable in the house," or something like that. He was like, "Okay, I'll keep that in mind in the future," and that was pretty much the conversation. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how did you feel about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did apologize for if I'd said anything that made him angry. I thought that was really good. [00:35:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like it was a nice interaction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was kind of strange because I had sort of imagined this elaborate conversation. (chuckles) It was 10 seconds. It was fine, but it was different, I guess. I can't really plan it out the whole time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's hard to know how people are going to respond. You can make some guesses, but you don't really know until you actually go into the conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But after that we've been fine except for the whole "I'm a kind of ally of Phil" kind of thing, but that's been for the past couple of days. Ever since that, we were fine. I was actually surprised at how fine we were. It was like, "Oh, I'm not angry at him anymore?" It was unusual.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you think made it possible for you to let go of your anger toward him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Apologies haven't really worked that effectively for me before. Once someone apologizes to me I'm usually like, "Oh, that's okay," but I'm really not. I guess maybe because I told him why I was really angry, when he apologized it seemed to encompass everything that happened, so then it was okay. [00:37:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It felt a lot more genuine than it sounds like most apologies feel to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Because he knew what the whole thing that happened so it was like the apology covered all these things that happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Suddenly you felt like he really knew what he was apologizing for, rather than just hearing this, "well, I'm sorry," and not knowing what actually are you sorry for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think feeling understood is a really big piece of being able to let go of some things. He really understands what you're feeling. It's easier to let go. Otherwise, if they don't really know what you're feeling or you don't really feel like they understand what transpired, you're still holding onto it because it's just words that have been exchanged rather than feeling the feeling really got aired and acknowledged.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that was surprising. That was new, which is good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's nice to know there is room for new things — different reactions to happen. [00:38:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I've always been the kind of person — and I guess this is something my mom taught me — like Phil talks a lot about other people and not very nicely, so I never told him anything that was extremely personal that I wouldn't be comfortable with everyone else knowing. So I guess that that is almost like "I'll still be your friend but I'm not going to forget that this is not where I'm going permanently." That's something that I've had for a long time. Not that I'm not going to forget that we had this conversation that he yelled at me once in the living room, but it seems so insignificant now. It doesn't seem like this huge deal that I should never forget that he yelled at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't necessarily create a marker for the whole relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. So that was different. [00:39:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I did want to take some time to follow up on what's happening with graduation because last time we talked about graduation, you were feeling very conflicted about whether or not you felt you should invitee your dad. I never found out what happened with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Okay. I have a lot of frequent flyer miles and so I paid for my mom's and my brother's flight. It was free - $20 or whatever — so I used my miles to do that and they are going to stay at my house so that we don't have to pay for a hotel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember you asking your housemates if they could stay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also made sure that it was okay with [inaudible], [00:40:09] who is moving in, too. I was like, "It's totally cool if it's not, but I just wanted to let you know that we had sort of agreed to this before. It's okay if you're uncomfortable with it, but I was just wondering . . ." So she was okay with it as well. So they're going to stay with . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're getting who you wanted for graduation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And my brother and his wife are coming as well, so that will be good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad you found a way to work that out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't even think of frequently flyer miles. I guess I was so focused on what wasn't happening that I didn't really realize what could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does your mom feel with that? so focused on what wasn't happening that I didn't really realize what could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does your mom feel with that? [00:40:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think she felt a little bit . . . because I have 150,000 frequent flyer miles, so I used 100,000 for both their flights and she was like, "Oh, my gosh, that's so many miles. They were for you." I was like, "No, no, no. This is fine. (chuckles) Really, really. This is fine." And so I think she felt a little bit bad for putting me out like that, but it's not how I feel. That's just sort of like the way my mom I relate anyway. It's like I'll do something nice for her and she feels really bad; then she does something nice for me and I'll feel really bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you feel relieved.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, definitely. Unless my dad magically shows up, which I wouldn't put past him. So, that's okay. At least I feel like that would be more clear — like where I stand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You haven't extended the invitation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel kind of cornered into extending an invitation that you didn't want to give.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I guess it would be different if he comes anyway. And I wouldn't know until the day before because he doesn't book flights until the day before he goes anywhere. It's almost like [teaming] (ph)(inaudible at 00:42:09), but I feel a lot better about it — a lot better about it. It seems like my mom, after we had that conversation where it was really awkward a week afterwards or whatever, I think that she understood that I have a different opinion from her and that she can't really make me change my mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a big change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because she hasn't brought it up. I think if she really wanted me to change my mind she would have brought it up again. That feels really nice — to feel respected. (chuckles) That was really good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it will be fun. It will be busy. I have another friend coming in and one of my friends who lives here is coming. It's going to be big. There are a lot of people. (chuckles) Thanks for your helping me figure that out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're very welcome. I didn't come up with that idea. You actually came up with that on your own. (both chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But still, that was helpful. I feel like I've been thinking about it in small ways in my expressing myself better. Almost like I'm a little bit more than trivial — not so trivial — but not like huge things are at stake sort of stuff. I feel like I can sort of say what I'm feeling, so I guess I'm feeling a little bit better about that kind of stuff. There are some other times. It was actually when he was yelling at me and I said, "Can you please close the door," but it was something that I'd been saying to him four or five times before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He actually did it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he did. I remember I sort of thought about it and it was like, "Oh, should I ask him to do that right now?" or whatever. That's sort of got me thinking about this whole "close the door" thing. And the first time I asked him to do that it was really uncomfortable. I was like, "Ah, Phil, er, could you, er, kind of . . . " And he was like saying, "Do you want me to close the door?" I was like, "Yes, please." He was like, "You can just ask for that." And so he closed the door. Ever since I've been asking him to close the door. Nicely, not when we're fighting usually, and he doesn't. I don't feel uncomfortable about that anymore. I don't feel like that's an unreasonable thing to ask, which I think is a step in the right direction. [00:44:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. We tend to focus on the things that didn't go well in here and the things that are really intense, but sometimes you see the changes, the differences, when you look at the things that are a little bit less intense, and obviously when you look at the things that go right rather than things that went wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's part of why I was obsessing over this terrible situation in our house and I was like, "My gosh, all these terrible things. I'm a terrible communicator. I'm never going to be able to really express what I'm feeling," and I was like, "Okay, so have I been doing this in any other way?" (chuckles) It was just like well, I have the door thing. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the door thing, and being able to kind of step back and think outside the box and come up with a different way to work out the graduation thing and still assert with your mom what you were feeling and why. Those are fabulous examples of things that are a little bit different and you'll keep adding onto those.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You will. Just thinking of graduation and timing, I know you're staying at the extension school next year but are you here for the summer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm here for the summer. I might go home in June or July for a week or two, but I have a job that I can't really leave for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you staying with the medical job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I'll be staying with that and I've actually been trying to decide. This has been a huge point of conflict for me recently but I don't know if that's relevant. It was like, "Should I do the program in one year or two years?" There are very intense advantages and disadvantages for both. But anyway, I'll be around at least one or two years. So, yeah, that should be happening. I think that might be a little bit difficult in terms of scheduling for graduation because I don't exactly know when the dates are that . . . well, actually, we meet on Mondays, so that might not be too bad. But anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have we scheduled?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so. This was the last one we had scheduled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see what we can do and if you need to avoid weeks or we need to reschedule stuff, that's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess going forward in the summer, it might be more like creative scheduling, because I have a job now and I'm going to be babysitting and I'm applying for a research assistant's position, so . . . (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll do what we can. My schedule will also get a little bit more flexible after the 18<sup>th</sup>. I'll be able to work with you a little bit more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So two weeks plus April 30<sup>th</sup>, which you should be booked for graduation mayhem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's also right in the height of finals. Would it be okay to meet at the end of next week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Unfortunately, that would be the 27<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The 7<sup>th</sup> of May?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's do that. So did I put you in here just pretending that I knew? Because I have you in here for the 12:30 on Monday, May 7<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That sounds good. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I may have been utilizing my ESP or . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: 12:30?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's skip the next week or two because the next week after that on the 21<sup>st</sup> would be crazy graduation stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The 28<sup>th</sup> is actually Memorial Day, which is one of the Monday holidays I actually do take off. We could meet on Friday, the 25<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the day after graduation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Try for Tuesday, the 29<sup>th</sup>?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That sounds great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I should have, let's see, I haven't filled some stuff in that probably exists, but it looks like I could probably do a 3:30 or an 11:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or we could schedule it on the 7<sup>th</sup> if you like that, as well. The 3:30 sounds great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's do that and hold the space and when we get a little bit closer we'll both . . . so 3:30 on the 29<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, thank you so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're welcome.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Adjusting recorder] Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it is already so warm. </p>

<p>[Door closes]</p>

<p>CLIENT: We just picked up our car from the mechanic. It is my first time driving it, and I'm a really nervous driver. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, [chuckles] it just makes me really nerv—I didn't learn to drive until I was—well, I didn't get my license until I was 18, and, um, then it was, like, the third day I had my car, I knocked the mirror off—like, the driver's-side mirror—and then it was like [chuckles] something constant. Like, it was like, you know, speeding tickets and [shifts in seat]—I'm—and then I got—like, I was just always getting into little problems with my car, and then I eventually got a DUI when I was 20, and then [clears throat] I couldn't drive for a really long time, and then I was just terrified of driving, super afraid. [00:01:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I'm still really afraid, but I knew if I got in the car, immediately when we got to the mechanic, then it would be a little bit better for me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so we got in, and I s-s-spun the car around to get some gas, and then—usually, I always want Chris to drive every—everywhere, and, uh, but I just—I immediately decided that I was going to do it 'cause if I didn't do it immediately, then [pauses] I wasn't going to [car honks outside] I wasn't going to—I just—it was just going to keep building up and building up. [Clucks] Yeah, it—now, I'm really excit—before, I was, like, really nervous about the whole thing about getting the car because of then [slaps hands in lap] driving the [chuckles] car. Um, and so, right now, I feel really excited about it. Um, I hate driving in the city—that's the only thing—and I hate, like that all—I'm always—like, there's [slaps hands in lap] people, and then it is just like I don't feel like I have a full awareness of—anyway, I get really nervous. Um, but I feel a lot better now after having driven, um, out [pauses] here from—where we [slaps hands in lap] honestly [it has been like] (ph). [00:02:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe I'm the mechanic, and you're taking your car...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Got it fixed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're taking it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:02:24] [sniffles and exhales] Uh, yep. So this is the last session. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] I've been really emotional the last few weeks [inflects, becomes emotional].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is—[slaps hands in lap] feels pretty natural, just like how I normally [chuckles] feel. Um, [pauses] just really easy to—to do this. [Sniffles] Just smacked my hand really hard accidentally on the counter this morning, and it really wasn't really hard, but I just like immediately dissolved into tears. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:02:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I don't really cry about physical things, so that was kind of surprising. [Shifts in seat] Um, [pauses] [sniffles]—yep, just easy to cry these days. Um, [pauses] why did I put mascara on? [Sound of rubbing hands together, inhales] [Pauses for eight seconds] [I better do], uh, [inaudible], and I was just doing really well. She really likes it. Yesterday, she did say—when I picked her up, she said, "I want to go home," but she's never upset, and she's never sad; she just looks exhausted, and they're both really tired. Um, but Sadie was—stayed for a nap and went [through the first time] (ph) yesterday, and she was so tired and so out of control with her emotions [slaps hand in lap] that it almost made me a little uncomfortable, like, because she [pauses] just couldn't process or handle anything. [00:04:00]</p>

<p>And, uh, she's not that kind of kid. Like, she just normally will be be, like, kind of whiney; she [chuckles] whines a lot, but she's not one to melt down and to not be able to work it out, so [sniffles] um, I don't know. I think she'll be OK. I think she's really confused. [Pauses for five seconds] Mm, but, yeah, they're very (ph) [clucks]—and [pauses for three seconds] Andrea wants to lie. On Friday is my last day [slaps hand], so [clears throat] I told them, in order to stay for this week, I needed a commitment of at least 30 hours for this week, to make it worth my while to stay. [00:04:56]</p>

<p>And she promised me that—and, uh, but she wants [pauses]—Hetty has been getting picked up at noon every day, is going to—be picked up at noon—or, at noon, she'll pick up at noon on Monday, as well, because Sadie has a ballet recital, but she wants to try the—try Hetty going for a full day, 8:30 to six on Friday, to see how she does, you know, in case she freaks out. And my fir—you know, so I don't really understand it because, [clucks] like, in case she freaks out, it would indicate that there would be a backup plan, but there isn't a backup plan; like, this is what's going to happen. Like [pauses]—so, um, like, she's—she's going to have to go to full—I feel like it is just going to confuse her to go on full day on Friday and then [slaps hand in lap] just go back to a half-day on Monday but a half-day with Mom. Like, I feel like it is more consistent to half-day, half-day, half-day, and then spread her for a full day, [clucks] 'cause if she has a meltdown on the full day—which she is going to; she is going to be a wreck—like, she is going to be ti—really tired, probably, I mean, if Sadie was any indicator. [00:06:09]</p>

<p>Like, there is not much that is going to change about that whether we do it Friday or Tuesday [inflects]. I don't know. So I'm a little bit—and I spoke to Hetty's teacher about it, and she was thinking, like, "Yeah, that seems like it would be a little confusing for her. Why don't we just do it the full day on Tuesday?" [Sniffles] Selfishly, I want to spend time with Hetty and, um, [clucks] [pauses] and on with the hours. And we're all having dinner together Friday night, so I'm seeing this is, like, [pauses] just a terrible idea. [Chuckles] And so I'm trying to—you know, I said to Andrea, the mom, "You know, like, maybe it might be a little confusing to her to do that on Friday," and, um, [pauses] I don't know. [00:07:03]</p>

<p>She said, "We'll talk more about it." It is her call. It is her kid. But [mostly it] (ph) like my last time with them Friday evening. That's like my goodbye dinner with them, and they're, like, in total meltdown mode, it is just going to be kind of worse than [chuckles] we're even anticipating it to be. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [becomes emotional] [pauses] anyway, [pauses] um—[sighs] [pauses] so I feel like I should be talking more about, like, grander things. [Chuckles] Like, is the la—since we last meet (ph), I should be talking about more like, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] I don't know, like reflecting more or something, um, or being more, [pauses] um, thoughtful about my time with them (ph) to—I don't know. [00:08:05]</p>

<p>[Pauses] Uh, [pauses] yeah. I don't know. [Sniffles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're anxious about getting in your car and driving it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although, it sounds like, as you say, you should let Chris drive, and you're saying, "Nope, I'm going to get in the car and then drive it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Silence for 15 seconds] [Inhales deeply] [slaps hands in lap] Um, [as I've, too, an] (ph) anxiety a little bit that the woman that I was talking to from Sadie's school, to do the preschool groups, she's not contacted me, or at least she won't respond to—I e-mailed her two weeks ago, maybe.[00:09:08]</p>

<p>[Pauses] And she—I saw her at school a couple of days later, and she said, "Let's try to get together," and then, when she was here, I wasn't here, and then I texted her and called her, and she didn't reply. And then I saw her yesterday at school, and she said, "I'll e-mail you tonight about what's going on," and she's just not responding, so it makes me think that she has some other—you know, like, this maybe isn't happening anymore, which I wish she would just get on with telling me already...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because I don't—I'm not [device tone sounds] I'm not—it makes it a little harder for me to drive my car when she [becomes emotional, about to cry] e-mailed (ph) what is going on. Like, I don't, um—you know. [Shifts in seat] I would just like to know from her end. She doesn't want to talk about it at school 'cause, um, it is just not really—you know what? I think she doesn't want them to know [pauses] that she's leaving quite yet, but I don't even know if she's going to—so, anyway, the only times I see her, it is very quick and awkward, and [sniffles] [shifts in seat]—anyway, it is just making it really difficult for me. [00:10:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was something that I'm really excited about, but [pauses] [clucks] if it is not happening, I really need to know that so that I can [slaps hand in lap] start work and remind her of some other options. [Pauses] Um, [pauses] but anyway—I'm just a big ball of emotion. [Pauses] [shifts in seat] [inaudible at 00:10:56] [00:11:00]</p>

<p>[Pauses] [sniffles] [exhales] [slaps hand in lap] [sounds as if she is crying] It is sad how much stronger I'm feeling [chuckles] the last couple of sessions, [slaps hand in lap] and I just don't feel like that today, but—I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have to be strong?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I guess not. [Pauses] [Device tone sounds] [And I've got to stop] (ph) [sniffles] [shifts in seat] Um, [fidgets] [pauses]—I guess not, but it feels like I should be. [Fidgets with objects] You know, I'm feeling like I just want to [pauses] enjoy my last few days here, and I feel like I'm just [pauses] wracking myself with emotion. [00:12:03]</p>

<p>[Pauses for nine seconds] I do want to thank you for everything. [Pauses] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has been such a pleasure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because this has been [becomes emotional] [pauses for three seconds] [becomes emotional, about to cry] really helpful for me. [Cries] I'm very, very grateful. Um, [pauses for eight seconds] [shifts in seat] ['cause he was definitely] (ph) [pauses]—she could (ph) try to see myself and how I seem about my relationships, and I'm grateful for that. I mean, I just don't think, you know, I was quite ready to do that on my own. [00:13:03] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So [pauses] [crying] [sniffles] but I do feel a lot better about so many different things now. [Sniffles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, [pauses] I'm so glad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, me, too. I'm going to sit here with you. [Chuckles] [coughs] I just think things like that are funny. [Chuckles] I [sniffles]—uh, [pauses for three seconds] yeah. I don't—I don't want to lose that; I'm really afraid of losing that. [Pauses] I'm really afraid of, um, having to come—having—I feel like I rely on you now... [00:14:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Rely on this, and [clucks] [pauses for seven seconds]—but, uh, you know, I know that pauses]—I'm just a lot stronger. It is just not [becomes emotional]—[shaking it off] Uh, but anyway, I am—I am a little afraid [sniffles] so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you afraid of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, [pauses] going backwards?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Just regressing or [slaps hand in lap] forgetting things, forgetting [sniffles]—[pauses] forgetting [pauses] [slaps hand in lap] just kind of like realizations that I've had or [pauses for six seconds] just things that I think about myself, that I didn't think of before. [00:15:13]</p>

<p>And, um, kind of really leaving you and this to going back home, like it is almost—it is almost the same feeling I have. Like, with going back home, I feel like I could just turn back into another person that I was before, and that's kind of how I feel about [clucks] [sniffles] being here, is that I'll just turn back into a person that I was before. Neither of versions of you, [shifts in seat] don't—that people I want to be, you know, [pauses for three seconds] and I'm still not necessarily, like, the person I want to be, but I certainly have a clear, like, sense of self and more confidence than I have even really ever had. [00:16:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses for six seconds] so—I don't know—I just, mm [sniffles]—I [could take off] (ph) really good that I can make it sound really sad. It is really amazing how I just am able to do that. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure. Where did—where did that come from?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] 'Cause it is like I'm saying how I feel really confident, I feel really good, and then I—but I'm, like, spinning it into this, like, [chuckles] negative form, like I don't want to lose. It is like I'm just, like, afraid of everything 'cause it is, like—it is like even though things are better, like, then I'm afraid that they're not going to be good. Like, I just have this fear and an anxiousness about me that just—it is like—it just still, you know, hol—it just dig—dig (ph) right in with that. [Shifts in seat] Um... [00:17:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, you do have anxiety, but—I don't know—it seems pretty natural, at least sometimes, to feel worried about losing something that you really want...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And have, and feel good about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it is in the context of, you know, dealing with a lot of loss...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And a lot of change. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] Yeah. I would just like to be a person who is more in the moment, I guess [slaps hand in lap]... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And is more grateful for things as they are. That's just something that I—I don't do well. Um... [00:18:00]</p>

<p>[Pauses for six seconds] I'm really a planner, and I even, [claps hand] you know, plan for the negatives, or I'll plan for them, but I couldn't see all of them. [Pauses for 20 seconds] It is just [pauses] I 'm really feeling like the—there—like, I really want this week to, like, move on. Like, I'm like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I just want to go to sleep, so I'll wake up, so it is a new day. And I want to, like—I just want to get on with it, [pauses] but I'm feeling like [sniffles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're just—anticipating leaving is hard. [00:18:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is really hard. And, uh, I'm, like, just—I think I'm more anxious to see what the next thing looks like. Like, for me, that's really a part of it. I want to, like, be into the next thing 'cause I can't see that, and I want to—I just want to see it so that I know it. [Pauses for eight seconds] 'Cause this, like, middle phase with staying here still but not in our home was really just kind of like [pauses]—it just made me feel really displaced and, mm, [pauses for seven seconds]—did better than I expected throughout all of it. Um, you know, we had that—that fight when they were—maybe the first weekend we were there, or the second weekend or whatever. [00:20:04] </p>

<p>[Sniffles] But it was much better than I expected. [Pauses] Mm—I told my dad we'd bring him to the [next thing] (ph). He sounded terrible. I called him for Father's Day. He talks like he has no air left. He smokes a lot, so he talks [imitates someone without air] [high pitched] really like. He's out of br—he'll talk himself out of breath. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but he's started talking that way, and he just sounded really bad. But—and I just said it, later [down with one of them] (ph), and I just [pauses] [claps hand] I don't know—I just said to Chris, like, "Yeah, my dad sounded really bad," but it wasn't in this way that normally feels like, [said sadly] "My dad sounds really bad. Like, we need to bring him dinner." It was like—I don't know. [00:21:00]</p>

<p>I don't feel cold towards him, but I just feel like [pauses] just how it is. Like, there is just no real relationship there, and so it is all kind of obligatory at this point, for me. It is like—you know, he—he told me—we talked for a minute and 22 seconds, and he, you know, said he is really lonely, and he is really bored. He is up on our property, trying to get stuff cleared out for [slaps hand in lap]—for it to be sold. But—so he's bored and lonely. And, normally, that really would have—like, that really would have bothered me. And that makes me sad for him. Like, you know, I wish, for him, that he didn't feel that way...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But it doesn't really make me sad. That may be cold, [pauses] but—I don't know—I'm going to bring him dinner, and maybe that will help him a little bit. I will sit through bringing him dinner to make myself feel better and think I'm not a terrible person. [Pauses] [clears throat] [00:22:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not sure what kinds of feelings you should have toward him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it is very unclear. [Pauses for five seconds] Our relationship is really unclear, [pauses] which makes it really tricky to navigate. [Pauses] And once—since I've had—like, I feel really obligated to [pauses] take care of him or to—not even take care of him 'cause there's—I can't take care of him, but to be in his life, I feel really obligated to be in his life and, um, to provide things for him that he has never provided for me, and [pauses]—mm, [clucks] that makes me really resentful and angry. [00:23:06]</p>

<p>So there's a natural part of me that is just his child and just can't help some of the feelings that I have, but, like—but mostly just kind of like—I don't know—I've never had a relationship with this man. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, you want things from me that you have never given [pauses]—you know, you've never taken care of me, so I don't know why you expect me to take care of you right now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't see it that way, but, um [clears throat]—you know, he needs a lot from my brothers and I. He asks for a lot with absolutely nothing in return. I mean—and I'm not even exac—I mean, like, absolutely nothing. [00:24:00]</p>

<p>[Pauses] So it is hard sometimes, but I just know that he is not capable of anything else. I don't know. I am really confused about how I should feel about him in a relationship. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [Pauses] Well, it seems like that are moments you have clarity about how you do feel, but then you feel guilty about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Because I never want to [pauses] appear cold or to—you know, I don't want to feel, like, shut off [shifts in seat] from him because I know that's cold, and I know that coughs] it is still the part of me in my head that says, "Don't be like them. Don't be like them," and to be emotionally disconnected from your [pauses] family is to be a little bit like that. Like, they're [so involved] (ph) in coming by, but they're, like, physically and financially, and, like—you know, they're like emotionally dependent on each other in this weird way, where it is like who is more of an addict kind of way, but they don't really support each other, if you know what I mean. [00:25:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They're kind of cropped (ph) from each other. Like, they don't—they are cold to each other, [shifts in seat] and, uh, [pauses] to be, like, cold to him would see to fall in line with that. [Pauses] [sniffles] I also just don't want to be the person who carries around, like, [pauses] mm—the baggage that was my child—like, childhood. I don't want to carry that anymore. And, like, I'd like to put that down now, and I'd like to leave it, and [slaps hands in lap] mm, feeling angry at him [slaps hand in lap] or pissed off, or resentful feels like something that I'm still carrying. It feels like I've still got a little backpack on me or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:26:00] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [clears throat] [pauses] so I'm trying to really—really trying to shake it off. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know. For the most part, I just don't really think about him anymore than, probably, I'd say I had to. [Chuckles] But that's the [effect it is] (ph). I'm afraid about being there and not being harder than me not thinking about him, because that feels great; it feels great not thinking about him. It is much easier to put that baggage down. Um, being there, knowing that I can just drive—you know, him knowing that I can just drive 30 minutes to see him—it is not as easy, 'cause that's when the—then you get the phone calls, and then you get the [inhales]—so that's not as easy. And it is not as easy to [pauses for six seconds]—for me to draw the lines for myself. [00:27:10] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>[Silence for six seconds] </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps hands in lap] [shifts in seat] Oh, [pauses] I don't know when I decided [to get here] (ph), I stopped calling him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I called him when I needed to [clears throat]—you know, the birthdays and the Father's Days, and all that, so the same could happen there. [Pauses] And I can just say to my brothers, like, "I don't really want to be around Dad much." [Pauses] That's OK to say. [Sniffles] [fidgets] 'Cause there's a lot of that, too—like, "[I don't have enough time that I can make] (ph)." [00:28:02]</p>

<p>You know, and then John gets upset if I'm not around my dad. You know, [you don't live here or whatever] (ph). Like, if there is a thing that we're all going to do with my Dad, you know, if he doesn't want to do it, he gets mad if I don't want to go do it. But, [pauses] like we talked about last week, that's just not really—like, if he's upset [pauses for five seconds]—I just need to take care of myself, and so if that offends other people, [claps hand] I just need to be OK with that. [Pauses for ten seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] Yeah. I'm also just, like, OK with just really spelling out exactly what it is that I need without a whole monologue of ev—like, things to back it up. [00:29:00]</p>

<p>Like, you know, without getting really emotional and getting really, like—just saying, like, "Well, I don't really want to go do that because it doesn't make me feel good." And then I know you can't get out of it that way, saying, like, "I don't want to go to a family barbeque [chuckles] because it just doesn't feel –"—you know, I don't really feel like going to a birthday party; it doesn't make me feel good. Like, I know that I can't get out of everything in life that way, but, um—but I think there are [chuckles] a lot of things that I just used to do because, you know, for whatever reason, that I just don't really need to. [Clucks] [[pauses] there are definitely just a lot—a few things that I don't need to do anymore because [slaps hands in lap] they don't bring good results. [Sniffles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel like you're a little less weighed down by guilt. [00:29:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I used to feel guilty for a lot of things. [Slaps hand in lap] I don't know what that was. I used to feel guilty for so many things, always, constantly—and guilty for other people's emotions and, like, responsibly—really responsible for other people's emotions, and really responsible for other people's [pauses]—I still do. That's still something that I have a really hard time with, but [pauses]—yes, I just used to feel really responsible for people's, like, well-being and how they—just how they felt all the time. And that made me feel really guilty if there [wasn't a good] (ph). You know? And I almost always took on the nega—you know, it is like I felt a need to fix other people's problems. Or, if they were mad at a situation that I was involved in, it was because it was my fault, [pauses] and it is not always true. [Clears throat] I—I let myself be a punching bag more than I realized. [00:31:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I would kind of throw myself in front of a lot of stuff because it just felt easier. It felt more—like, it felt right. It felt like—like that's how I identified mys—like, I was the problem; I understood that. Like, I—"I am the problem in a lot of things." [Shifts in seat] [sniffles] And it felt, like, natural that, like [shifts in seat] [snaps]—like, I just didn't know I was doing it. [Pauses] Even if I took my brother where—it was the two of us fighting, like, I think I would get in front of other stuff for him. [Softly] I don't know. [Sound of leaning back in chair] [sniffles] [pauses for eight seconds] [00:32:00]</p>

<p>Yeah. [Sighs] It kind of makes me [chuckles] tired. Like, I'm always tired the rest of the day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday, I was exhausted. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It can be a big workout coming here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I also ran, so I had that other physical workout, [chuckles] too. [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, it really can. And then if I was off to a—like, you know when little kids have a temper tantrum, and then they come down from it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do it for the rest of the day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I also do that emotionally inhales] noise if I've felt like I've needed to cry, but I don't cry; I'll do that. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'll have that, like—it is not like I do it intentionally; it just like—my body just does it, um, [pauses] and I know it is very strange. [00:33:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I know, it was very strange." I didn't think it was strange. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're like—when you say, "I know, it was very strange," it is like you're responding to something that you think I said. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, I would say, "It is very strange," and then you say, "I know, it is very strange," except that I never said that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I know. [Sniffles] [slaps hand in lap] I think I think it is really strange. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] [sniffles] [exhales] [sound of rubbing something] Yeah, maybe I project feelings onto other people, huh? [Pauses] [whispers] I probably do. I absolutely do. [Pauses] I have to leap pretty far with, like, little things that people say. I, like, start here, and I go—wazhooop!—way over here. [00:34:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you trying to identify things that are wrong with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, pretty much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Am I breathing? [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some of the things that you say are, like—they're just universal. Like, you know, it is like you're saying, "The problem with me is"—how did you put it? That—oh, you project. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm thinking, "Who doesn't?" [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, what you project and what it means to you—I mean, these are important things, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is a piece of—you're sort of feeling everybody else is normal, and then there's you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. I'm so good at that. [Sniffles] I am very good at that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, but it has been wonderful to see how far you've come. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] Thanks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has been wonderful. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've worked so hard. You work so hard. [00:35:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you really think that, or are you...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I—I hope you feel and know that I don't say anything I don't believe. I'm not here to just "make people feel better"; I'd like to, but I don't say things I don't believe. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I have a hard time believing things that people say. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, especially when it is good stuff. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If I could physically turn away from you [slaps hand in lap] right now...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] ...Just to—that's what I do when people say those things to me. I have to, like, not look at them. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you—what is it like to look at me while I'm saying nice things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me uncomfortable to look at you while you're lying to me. [Chuckles] Just kidding. Um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is hard to look at people when they're lying to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But what if I'm telling the truth?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels really great, because, you know, [pauses] that's what I—I don't know. [00:36:00]</p>

<p>It is nice to hear that you think I've done some good work, because it feels like I [slaps hands in lap] did some good work. [Sniffles] It is nice to be recognized for your work, I guess. [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I think it is more than just some. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks, I think so, too. I think it is—it is absolutely good for me to launch in [slaps hand in lap] place for the next phase. I feel more adult. I feel like a grown-up. Like, I feel less [pauses]—it still just felt like a kid, like if, you know—I think I saw people—when they would say that about my parents, they had kids so young that they could never grow up—I think that it is hard to heal from things, and if you don't, then you just stay—stay a little bit young. [00:37:03] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't mean that in a good way. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'd like to stay forever young, actually. [Clucks] But, um, [clucks] now this feels much better; I feel much like—I feel ready to be [pauses] better. Yeah. That was—I didn't even mean to say that, but I do—I feel ready to be better. [Slaps hands in lap]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clears throat] </p>

<p>[Silence for 12 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] It was really a bad idea to put, like [sniffles] [fidgets with object]—[exhales for five seconds] now I've just got to get Chris [pauses for three seconds]—it is hard to—this is a good idea for him. [Chuckles] [00:38:00] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was an interesting look. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] 'Cause I know that you're thinking that I don't have to get Chris to do everything; Chris has to want to do it for himself. Chris also should want to do it for me, [sniffles] in my personal opinion. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why is that what I was thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know; I just decided it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [exhales] well, I think we've had—we've had another conversation one time [pauses]—[clucks] we had one conversation one time that I was saying that I—I said the complete opposite of what I just said to you, the exact opposite. I said that shifts in seat] I can't make Chris want to be better for me; like, I can't make my dad want to be better for me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm saying the exact opposite of what I just said, that are completely—you said, "I don't think that's entirely true," and I gave it some more thought, and I agree. [Chuckles] sniffles] [leans back in seat] And, um, [pauses] so I don't know why you were thinking that—in my mind you were thinking that. [00:39:11]</p>

<p>Uh, [pauses] I think Chris—I think what I want from Chris is for him to, at least, want to make our marriage the best that it possibly can. Whether he wants to make himself the best he possibly can, that's his choice, but I need for him to want to make our marriage the best possible marriage that we can make it. That's what I need. [Claps hand] I need to write that down, [chuckles] so I don't forget that. [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, this issue—I think I mentioned this last time—the issue of what you're going to lose and what you're going to take with you is really very prominent. Like, you can remember this or forget this. And you said earlier in the session, like, you know, you hope that some of the things that you thought you were going to keep with you are the things that I thought, like that it is rare—are very prominent in your mind right now. [00:40:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Clears throat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, how much are you taking with you and not just losing or leaving behind. I think you're taking a whole lot with you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [pauses] I hope so. I don't—I feel like I'm a person—I don't remember things; I just don't remember them, and I lose myself into these, like, just feelings before I can even notice it, and that just scares me. Like, I'll just wake up and be—like, [pauses] having such bad anxiety that I can't get through a single day, and—and then, all of the sudden, I'm like, "How did I get here? How did this happen? How did [pauses]—?"—I don't know. But, yeah, I'm really afraid of those things, of just like—of not remembering or of—next (ph). [Slaps hands in lap] I'm really afraid of not remembering stuff [rubs hands together]... [00:41:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...'Cause I don't feel like I'm remembering. [Pauses for five seconds] Is that normal from] (ph) your childhood? [Chuckles] Can they put that on something? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe, but I'm also thinking how so many of the sessions, you started by saying—with saying, "You know, I really thought a lot about what we were saying last week," or—so that sort of shoots down your theory that you don't remember anything. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] You often say that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You almost always reference, almost every session reference previous sessions. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're clearly very much in your mind. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it is—it is a whirlpool effect. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it is there. It is not like it was not there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. When I leave every session, I think about it almost the [inflects] whole week or, like, until the next session. [00:41:59]</p>

<p>So [pauses] I pull out things that I want to think about. It is like I pull—I don't know. It is like with—mm—and then I'll—I'll leave and I'll think about one thing that, a lot of times, didn't even, like, make a—wasn't a big topic or a big thing, and I'll leave, and it is usually something small, and I'll think about it for whatever reason, and then that's what I'll kind of, like, work through for a while. [Clucks] I know that was a separate topic, but [pauses] I'm really not—I think that I just don't want—I don't remember a lot of things that I want to remember. And I don't—I think that the biggest thing is that I just don't—still don't really trust my mind. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I don't trust [pauses]—like I don't trust that I remember things right or that I remember the things that I need to remember, or that I, um—or that I've rewritten something to make it seem how I want it to seem. [Pauses] But I [do that] (ph). [00:43:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah, and you're talking about feeling like you—you want more confidence...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...In your abilities all around. And you're feeling you have more confidence, and you'd like to build more confidence. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah, [pauses] [softly] I think that would be better. One day, I came in here saying that, "I don't want to feel like this forever, and I don't want this to get worse," and now I'm leaving and saying, "I think that'll be better. I think this is good. I think that will get better." It is just a complete 180. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I—and I remember you saying that, "Why would you feel like this forever?" And that was such an enlight—an interesting idea to me... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That, like, I ne-ver thought of that. It (ph) was brilliant. To me, I was like, "I need to write that down!" [Chuckles] [shifts in seat] Like, why would I? I don't know. I didn't think of that because this is how I feel right now. [00:44:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Well, one definition of trauma is believing that the past is going to be your present and future... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Which is such an interesting thought, I think... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...That trauma is about not thinking that your future can be anything different than what your past is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Pauses] Yeah, it was—[slaps hand in lap] it is very interesting. [sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I need...</p>

<p>CLIENT: We've got to stop. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've got to stop! We've got to stop for today and stop [pauses] for now, at least. We've got to stop. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] [Pauses] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll really miss you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Becomes emotional] [sniffles] Thank you so much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll really miss you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Emotionally] Can I give you a hug?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course you can. I'll really miss you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Begins to cry] Thank you so much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Please make sure you get situated well. Please feel free whenever you want to let me know how you're doing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Thank you so much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, take care. [00:45:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have a great summer. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. You, too. [Pauses] Bye. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Whispers] Bye. </p>

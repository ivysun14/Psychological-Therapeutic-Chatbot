<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so how are you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's good.  I think you, when I saw you last you had, you had gotten your [INAUDIBLE], that was the week of vacation I think, something like that.  So school is going well, you got your grades?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How'd you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had three A's, two B's, and two C's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Three A's, two B's, and two C's?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two C's, are you happy with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, good.  All right, you've been doing weekend stuff still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just or coming up or what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Coming up, I leave June, the last week and go back to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I get out of there in August.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Phew.  Wow, do you have any weekends before that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, a couple more, like [DATE] or something like that is my next weekend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then you've got to do one in June before you leave, just one more, you did [INAUDIBLE] already?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, where'd you go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, yeah, where is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED], it's down by [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's not that far past [DEIDENTIFIED], right, a little bit—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But not too much, yeah.  I'm trying to remember if I was ever there.  I was at [DEIDENTIFIED] a couple of times but, all right, so everything is set for the fall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For August when you get back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When does school start?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	School starts [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's amazing, I haven't heard of, every place is starting closer to the middle of August now, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good, you don't get a fall break?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, we get, I think we get like a really small Thanksgiving break—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three days or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So you still have to do weekends and then this whole summer again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Summer, I won't be doing the same sort of thing again.  I can apply for [INAUDIBLE] which I'll probably end up doing so I won't have to do this, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean by the time, somewhere where the weather is better, by the time you're done, you should have active duty, something like that, close, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, the meds are working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they seem to be working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We have to do the same thing we did last year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so when is school over?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	School for me is ending on like [DATE] or [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Do you have finals?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I should be exempt from most of them, I may have to take more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Precalculus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because he's [INAUDIBLE] I've missed, like I missed one of his class for a school function activity but he didn't want to count it as an exemption so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of activity?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was setting up a sound system for a school assembly during first period that we were going to have like during second period.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As part of a committee?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you talk to your guidance counselor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but they don't really have any pull, it's up to each individual teacher to count [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You asked him ahead of time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I talked to him about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Before and he said he wouldn't count it, he said before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I just told him that I was going to be doing, like I didn't find out this until the day before and I told him that day, like I told him that morning that I had to set up this assembly and he said well fine, do what you've got to do and told me that he might or might not count it as one of my exemptions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he's taking, so that's a third day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was my second.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you took another one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, another for, I don't remember what that was one was for, I think I was sick that day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's not, if you're sick, it's not an excuse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sick isn't excused.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many classes does he teach?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three classes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can you go sit in another one of his and make it up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you don't want to study for a final, God, that really sucks.  You talked to a guidance counselor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they can't do anything about it because the exemptions are up to the individual teachers, not to the school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there a written policy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] policy, Jesus.  What was the first time you missed, sick?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The first one was sick, the second time was I had assembly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And like who, what was the assembly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The assembly was, it was a junior/senior talent show.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who sponsored that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sponsored by the junior class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was there like a faculty sponsor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Somebody you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, sort of, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You should talk, do something, talk to her and see if, you know, if she'll talk to this guy and find out if there's something else you can do instead of the final.  I mean that's, gosh, that sucks.  Anyway, all right, so that's going to be, that'll make a difference I guess.  When would the final be if you have to take it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The final would be like the first week of June or the last week of May.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, so we could basically start to taper right after you did the final, if you have to do it.  I'm not sure I'd want to do it before that.  What do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We could start tapering [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'd do all right on the final if you have less?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, I mean what did we do, how quickly did we do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think we did it over the course of like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A month—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A month—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Three weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three weeks, I think it was three weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So we've got till [DATE].  So [DATE] is when you get there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh and I'm going to be out of town from [DATE] through April or August.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's funny.  So we've got May, [INAUDIBLE] something like that, all right, so if we do, let's see, if we go to, say we go to 80 for seven, five days, I'm going to try to figure out.  60 times seven, then we can go to 40 times four, and then 25 times, seven 25's and then if we go to 10, I mean 20, just two 10's times four which would be eight 10's and then 10 times six, actually, let's see, times five we'll make it, so that would be 10 and then 10 times four, four days equals, okay, so four 10's.  All right, so basically we need to give you ten, fourteen, two 40's, one 60, one 25, two 10's, all right, so basically on [DATE] start 80 mg a day for five days, that's two 40's, then 60 mg a day for seven days, then 40 mg a day for four days, then 25 mg a day for seven days, then 20 mg a day for five days, two 10's, then 10 mg a day for four days, then stop.  So basically we've got, this is twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, twenty three, thirty two days, that's too many days.  All right, so we have to back it off, no, if we start, when did I say, if we start on the thirty, twenty nine, twenty eight, twenty seven, we've got one, two, three, four, oh, I'm in the wrong month, hello, go back to June.  Okay, one, two, thirty one, thirty, twenty nine, twenty eight, twenty seven, okay, so if we start on the [DATE], we've got one, two, three, this is twenty eight, twenty nine, thirty, thirty one, so we've got to start on the [DATE] maybe, something like that.  All right, so we'll start on the [DATE].  All right, all right, give this to [NAME OTHER].  When are you leaving?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] vacation from [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so before [DATE], okay, and [NAME OTHER] will give you the Strattera and I'll make a copy of this thing and we'll see you then, all right.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now where should we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm, I don't know. There's not really been a lot, but I guess that means something too. Like the whole Julia thing is still like in full force, and I feel totally out of control (chuckles). Because I just, I mean, I haven't seen her since we last met because I like hide out in my room when she's over. </p>

<p>My room is like in the middle of the house, so it's like the loudest room. It kind of makes me feel better because I don't like being alone because I'm like, what if a murderer comes in and murders me? (chuckles) So I always know who's home is what I was trying to say. (chuckles) So yeah, I feel like a two-year-old kid hiding out. It's so - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you hiding - - what are you afraid will happen if you let yourself be out and about in your house?</p>

<p>[00:01:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm probably going to be like rude to her and I don't want to. I mean - - but like I do - - I'm super embarrassed about this. Like it's really embarrassing. (chuckles) But I like feel so angry towards her and I don't know - - I don't really know why. It's not because she's not spending time with us anymore. That's not - - I don't know. I don't think that's it. I don't know. So I'm feeling really angry about that. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems like an important thing to note, and we'll come back to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. (chuckles) (pause) Yeah, I don't know. That's pretty much it. And then I guess recently I've just been like kind of macro-life thinking (chuckles) and it's just so depressing. Because I got in - - well, I got rejected to one of the programs, like flat out. I mean - - I wasn't expecting to get in anywhere - - or everywhere. </p>

<p>[00:02:05]</p>

<p>Like that's not kind of what I thought would happen, but I thought I would at least get an interview because I thought my essay was good and my background is interesting. I kind of expected to get interviews. I guess maybe that's a lot to expect. But still, I was like real disappointed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what is the - - I don't know what the typical rate of interviewing, rejection, acceptance is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, this is the most selective program, so they get like 6 or 700 applications for like 30 spots.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) But maybe I'm not as disappointed for like that one because it's the most selective. It's also the most expensive, so I wasn't really considering - - like if I got in, I would really probably go somewhere else. But I guess it makes me nervous for the other two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's always a yucky feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a yucky feeling anyway, even if you're somewhat prepared for it.</p>

<p>[00:02:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. And it kind of feels like oh well, if they didn't interview me, then UPenn - - that's my first choice, and they usually get the same number of applications but they have like 90 spots, or 85-ish spots. And I applied like two days before the deadline, of course, right? (chuckles) So I'm like well, they're never going to like - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that make a difference? Is it - - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, it's better if you apply early because they still have all the spots open.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so they decide on a rolling basis?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I don't - - (chuckles) So I'm like well, you know, if I didn't even get an interview at this other place, then I probably won't get an interview here because they're pretty much equally-selective except for the larger spots. And then Vanderbilt [ph], my third choice, I like haven't even heard from.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really hard to wait. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate the waiting. It sucks. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The waiting is really hard.</p>

<p>[00:04:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But anyway, so then I'm like - - I started thinking, and I was like I don't even have a Plan B. Like I don't have a Plan B. (chuckles) Like if I don't get in, I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm virtually unemployed. So - -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened? I thought you had a temp position.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the temping - - no. So, I mean, they call me like once a week for a one-day thing, right, so it's not really enough. I did that for Thursday and Friday of this past week, and they thought it would take me like five days to do the job that they needed me to do, and it took me a day and a half. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to work slower.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, right? (chuckles) Like I was wow, this is probably like the one position that efficiency is not rewarded. (chuckles) But the lady that I was kind of working for at that place was really nice, and she was like "You should clock until 5:30 cause, just do it." (chuckles) I was like "Okay." (chuckles) But still, it was like pretty much data entry, right, and I was like if this is what my whole life is going to be like - - (chuckles)</p>

<p>[00:05:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's a big leap there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, I know, I know. I meant like - - I didn't mean like this is what it's going to be like. I just meant like if this is like - - like if I don't get into med school, then this is what I have to do, even if it's for a while. Like I was so unhappy. Like I just cannot do 9 to 5, like I just can't do it. Plus it was data entry, so it was totally brainless and it was just the most - - of all the shitty jobs I've had in my life, this was by far the shittiest. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's not going to be the Plan B. But if you had to come up with a Plan B, you would.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this right now is just a holdover. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It feels so weird, I guess, the waiting, because like if I still had the other job or whatever, like I would at least feel like I'm doing something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I wouldn't feel like suspended, do you know what I mean? Like I feel like I'm frozen or something.</p>

<p>[00:06:03]</p>

<p>So that's kind of been on my mind and the whole house situation. Then I realize I'm pretty much friends with my house, pretty much exclusively, so I don't know. It's just been like - - I just feel like my whole life is flying by a little bit. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel pretty down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that's pretty much what's been happening (chuckles) in the past two weeks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you stayed connected to some of the people from work? Because I know you felt really friendly with the other people in the department.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, we're like friends online and so we chat sometimes, and I do hang out with one of the - - well, she's a editor. She actually took my position after I left. She's really nice. I really like her. And she just got into school, so that was really exciting. We've gotten together a couple of times and gotten a few drinks or whatever. (pause) Sorry. (chuckles) But yeah, not really extremely - - other than the time I visited. So - - </p>

<p>[00:07:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard because they're far away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. So that's kind of sad. But, I mean, I'm trying to move anyway. At this point, like that's all I can think about is like I'm moving out, I'm moving out, I'm moving out. (chuckles) Hopefully. So I might even move out even if I don't get into post-bac programs. </p>

<p>Since everyone else is leaving, I might stay because one of the old roommates that I had is coming back. Like she moved to China and was "Okay, I'm going back." I was like "Okay." (chuckles) So now she's trying to move back into the house, and I really liked living with her. She was really nice. (pause) Yeah. I guess that would be like Plan B, like don't do anything. (chuckles) Yeah, that's pretty much - - I don't know. (pause) (chuckles)</p>

<p>[00:08:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it seems like the big thing in the room is feeling angry and not knowing why.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yes. I mean, I think it might be another - - like with Phil, all these little things kind of piling up. Like for example, the other night - - I don't know if I told you about this or not, but I was downstairs with Charles, one of my roommates, talking. We were just talking about, I don't know, stuff. Probably history, that's all we talk about. (chuckles) And Julia - - it was like 12 to 1 in the morning, like we talked for like an hour - - and Julia was upstairs and she's like the lightest sleeper of all time. She texted me but I didn't get it because my phone was in my room upstairs. She lives right above me and then it's me and then it's the kitchen or whatever. </p>

<p>[00:09:04]</p>

<p>So she texted me and was like "Hey, can you guys keep it down?" and I was like - - when I got it, I was like "Oh, well, we weren't being loud" or something. What did I say exactly? It was like - - oh, she thought that I meant that it wasn't me or something. I was like "No, it was me but we weren't being loud." Like that's unreasonable because we were speaking like we are now, like normal volume and she was on the third floor. I just think it's crazy. </p>

<p>Like before, the time we were kind of having problems before, she was complaining about the cat bells and I'm like "Are you kidding? Like cat bells?" (chuckles) And so I don't know. At a certain point I just think that's totally unreasonable, and she's always the one asking us to be quiet or whatever. But then she's like the loudest person of all time. I mean, it probably doesn't help that she's right above me and I can hear every single thing.</p>

<p>[00:10:01]</p>

<p>But I mean, I don't know. It's super annoying, especially when Sergio is over. I mean they don't - - Sergio is her boyfriend - - they don't sleep apart or whatever, so when she's there Sergio is there and obviously my whole room shakes which is really annoying. So I just go downstairs for a while because I'm not going to tell people "Hey, can you have sex less loudly please?" Because that's mean, you know. But it is annoying and I think, at least in my opinion, like that's part of living in a community or like a group. Like you live with four other people, of course you're going to have to put up with some noise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You impact one another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly. And it's not that big a deal for me to go read downstairs or something. So I don't mind. But like if every little thing is going to bother her, then I'm going to start to mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But you do mind because you feel like you're not being given the same latitude.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I've also never told her like "Hey, just so you know, this is kind of what I do every single time that you sleep over here." You know what I mean? So then I don't know if it's exactly fair to expect her to like - - </p>

<p>[00:11:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She doesn't know that you're putting up with this stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you kind of want her to realize it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I don't know that - - I mean, I think at one point I tried to tell her because one of the loudest things that she does, besides super loud sex, is her drawers. At least in my room, it sounds like she slams them or something. And that's like the only thing that wakes me up from sleep. Like I'm the deepest sleeper ever. (chuckles) </p>

<p>And I tried to tell her one time like, I don't know, a long time ago. I was like "Oh, yeah, I can kind of hear you when you wake up and you're slamming drawers" or whatever. (chuckles) I said it like in a nice way though. And she was like "Well, I should be able to slam" - - not slam. What is it called? Close. "I should be able to close drawers in my own room, right?" And I was like "Oh, yeah, sure, definitely" and that's kind of where that ended. (chuckles) So I don't know. I'm probably not helping the situation.</p>

<p>[00:12:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it feels like the resentment is building up as you feel like you're kind of imprisoned in your room.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. But like I honestly wouldn't care about the noise. Like I don't mind going downstairs. But like I think it's crappy like if every time I do anything else, she comes down and tells me to be quiet. (chuckles) That's not fair at all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess that might be one of the bigger things because I keep coming back to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you think is underneath that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like - - I mean, you feel like her expectations are off maybe?</p>

<p>[00:13:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yeah, I don't think that we're on the same page about like living in the house. (chuckles) And about noise levels.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder if you could have that conversation with her. It's not going to be productive to tell her that she's being unreasonable. But maybe a conversation about what's reasonable to expect from one another and how can we, you know, sort of acknowledge what we're doing to try to be respectful. </p>

<p>Because I think part of your resentment is that she - - you don't feel like she notices or is aware of the things that you do to kind of cope with some of her noise or the ways that she affects you. Maybe if you guys could kind of come up with "What do you do when you can hear me and it's not going to be too loud that you can hear me" because it sounds like she could hear you at night whenever you were talking. </p>

<p>[00:14:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't feel like you were being unreasonably loud, but she was still being kept up, you know. She can't help that she's a light sleeper.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, she already has a noise machine and everything and I'm like "Oh my God, like at a certain point I feel like it's not my fault that you're a light sleeper."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's not your fault that she's a light sleeper.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles) Maybe I'm being reasonable, I don't know. (chuckles) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think you both have - - she has the expectation that she's going to be able to sleep when she wants to in her house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you have the expectation that you're going to be able to talk to your roommates when you want to in your house. Those both sound like reasonable expectations to me, but they're bumping up against each other. This is just one example where it sounds like your expectation and her expectation are bumping up against each other, and neither one of you is really crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You both want - - you want to be able to talk to your roommates. That seems not crazy to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She wants to be able to sleep at 1:00 in the morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems not crazy to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you have to live together.</p>

<p>[00:15:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. That's right. I guess I don't even know how to go about that because I'm like avoiding her already, right, so does that mean I come down and I talk to her - - I don't even know what I would say. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would life look like if you weren't avoiding her? What would've happened before you got really angry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I hung out downstairs a lot so when people came by, I would say "Hi" or whatever. I think we all used to do that, but now nobody is home ever. So, yeah. Maybe that was just one part of it or something because - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you miss hanging out downstairs?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I miss hanging out downstairs, but I can't tell if my problems with Julia are just situational like last time or if it's like - - because right now everything about this is like I don't want to be friends with her anymore. Like I don't want her in my life. I don't want to talk to her at all. I just want her to move out or me to move out. Like one of us to move out.</p>

<p>[00:16:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why don't you want her in your life anymore? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. We just have like - - we're just really different people. (chuckles) And I don't know. I guess maybe I didn't notice before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did one of you change?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think she did. I mean - - I don't know. Obviously I'm biased. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're mad at her that she changed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. But she changed like to - - like what we were talking about last time - - to this person that reminds me of all these terrible people. I don't know. I don't know. Like this one time Sergio was at the house and I happened to be downstairs. This was after they got back together. And he starts talking to me about school stuff because that's the only thing he can actually hold a conversation about. And he starts to basically tell me and Angela [ph], who is the other roommate - - I know, there's a lot of us. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[00:17:10]</p>

<p>He starts to tell us - - he basically starts to say some things and I said ultimately, I was like "Are you insinuating that you're smarter than us?" and he said "Yes." I was like "Excuse me?" (chuckles) Like that's so rude on so many levels, first of all, and like we're all good at different things. I don't know. And Julia just stood there, like quiet. Quiet. And I looked at her and she didn't even change facial expressions, nothing. I was like "Are you kidding?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wanted her to be mad at him too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I wanted her to say something, like to have an opinion either way. I don't know. It was just like, that's weird, you know what I mean? Like I would have an opinion. (chuckles) Even if it was defending him, like "Well, maybe he doesn't mean that he's smarter than you. Maybe he just means that he's better at philosophy than you." And then I would say something like "Well, that makes sense because he's much better at that than me" or whatever.</p>

<p>[00:18:13]</p>

<p>And there was a lot of animosity in this discussion. It wasn't like a normal academic discussion. There was a lot kind of underneath.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you felt personally attacked, it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. Because he was literally saying things like "People who really understand this" blah blah blah, but saying it like kind of loudly. We were kind of half-yelling but not quite yelling. Like it was like tense. I don't know. It's just - - I guess it might just be a lot of little things. I don't know. I don't want to be friends with someone like that, you know? I don't know. I don't know. That's really embarrassing too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What feels embarrassing about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because like - - I don't know. Because it sounds like a lot of the past way that my friendships have ended and those have all been my fault, I think.</p>

<p>[00:19:14]</p>

<p>But I feel like - - I don't know. I feel like I don't want to be friends with her anymore, but that feels separate from all the anger that I feel towards her. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that feels different than previous friendships that have ended.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, yeah. But I don't think I would know how to tell the difference, so I don't know, you know? Because I remember feeling the same way towards Phil, and now we're going out to get drinks like every other week or whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What feels similar - - so there's some things that feel similar but you're also wondering if maybe something is different about this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I'm wondering if this is one of the cases if I - - I guess I don't know how to tell the difference between friendships that I'm just - - I can't tell the difference between when I'm just like exploding and being annoying and like doing stuff that I need to work on, or if this is really a friendship that's over.</p>

<p>[00:20:10]</p>

<p>Like we've had a lot of problems before and they're pretty much the same now, and it seems like a negative - - like we're really different people. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what felt different with Phil? What made that something worth going in and talking about with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think in a way, Phil and I weren't as close as Julia and I were when we were close. Like I don't see her now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you used to sort of be inseparable from what you're describing here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's what I mean. I mean Phil and I weren't as close as - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you and Phil were never inseparable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly. So I think that could be something. I don't know. (chuckles) That could be something different. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take me back to when you and Phil were having problems.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did that feel like?</p>

<p>[00:21:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I can remember. I mean, it felt like fiery. It was like - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember the mouse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh and the rat, oh yeah. Oh my God. Yeah, that was a big deal. I think that's kind of where it started. But it felt like - - I think with Phil it was almost like there was an explosion and then it took a couple of months, but the dust settled and now we're - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the thing that you were really angry about with him - - I have to think back - - it wasn't so much who he was and the decisions that he was making. But you were really angry about the way that he was speaking to you, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. That he was really rude.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and it felt very much like he was being rude to you. And it sounds like with Julia, part of it is that you feel like she's being unreasonable with regard to you and kind of your behavior in the house. But another piece of it is that you feel really disappointed in some of the choices that she's making for herself.</p>

<p>[00:22:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like one of the things that's really kind of making you want to like back away or shake her and say "Are you kidding me?" are some of the choices that she's making about her relationship and some of the choices that she's making about - - I think you mentioned something about waiting to see where he got into school or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you didn't like that she was kind of waiting on his - - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she wished that he didn't get into school. (chuckles) And I was like - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay, and like you were so shocked like what girlfriend would say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I don't remember you saying things about Phil like that. It was "I can't believe he talked to me this way." But not so much "I can't believe he would go and make a choice like that."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. Yeah. Like we talked about last time, I know that it's not my place to make these judgments, right. Like I don't - - I can't just - - like I guess I feel disappointed but it's not any of my business. </p>

<p>[00:23:14]</p>

<p>Like I don't think it's any of my business, you know. I don't know. Just like Tim's relationship with his taken girlfriend. Like that's not my business, you know. So - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, is there a difference between judging somebody and wanting to be their friend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean? I don't know. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I can understand kind of the value of not wanting to be judgmental of others, but we don't have to be friends with everybody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess I'm wondering how you can separate not judging somebody for their decisions so you can feel good about yourself and being a non-judgmental person, but that doesn't mean you agree with everyone's decisions or that you want to necessarily be friends with somebody. There are people with whom you are going to have ideological differences.</p>

<p>[00:24:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can kind of give them their right to make their own choices, but that doesn't mean that you necessarily need to enjoy hanging out with them. Sometimes it's nice to hang out with like-minded others.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. (pause) I don't really know what that means. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you separate judging her? So you're clearly feeling both. You're judging her decisions but you're also judging yourself for doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it sounds like part of you feels like you should be able to be friends with her even though you disagree with her decisions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm wondering if you really have to have that expectation of yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Well, yeah. I mean, like for example, like I wouldn't be friends with somebody in the KKK, right? That's an extreme opposite example, right? </p>

<p>[00:25:05]</p>

<p>But, I mean, if you take that back from the extreme, I would like to be friends with people who think differently than me. I would like to be able to be friends with like a Democrat. (chuckles) Like somebody who I disagree - - I don't know, that I disagree a lot about - - because I think that there's a lot of value in those kinds of relationships like in the way that you can be pushed and kind of grow that way too. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that makes sense. So this is hard because here is an example of someone that is making choices that are different than yours and the pushing doesn't feel - - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it doesn't feel like anywhere I would like to grow. Like if that's what growth looks like, I don't want to. (chuckles) You know what I mean? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't want to become more like her. You don't want to make a decision like that. But maybe growth isn't necessarily changing yourself but being okay with the difference.</p>

<p>[00:26:08]</p>

<p>But both people have to be okay with that. Like if the other person - - it's not really just about Julia - - but if the other person can't respect the difference and needs you to kind of come on, you know, see if from their perspective or take on that perspective, then it feels like you're constantly trying to be convinced that their way is the right way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then - - yes. But then how do you support somebody who makes decisions that you disagree with? Like when Julia broke up with Sergio and she wanted to move out. I thought that was the worst idea of all time. She kept asking me what I thought, and I was like "I'm trying to be quiet because I disagree extremely and I'm trying to be supportive of you, and the way that I'm doing that is by being quiet."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's hard if somebody is asking you - - if someone is asking your opinion, pretending that you have a different opinion than what you have is not support.</p>

<p>[00:27:07]</p>

<p>I think that's a difficult situation because if someone really knew what they wanted for themselves and it's different than what you would choose for yourself but they say "This is the right thing for me," then you can be supportive and say - - </p>

<p>CLIENT: "Good for you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I'm glad it's the right thing for you. It's different than what I would choose for myself, but since you know it's the right thing for you, let me know how I can help you. I'll help you move your stuff."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But when someone is vacillating or unsure, then supporting them means helping them come to a decision that's right for them, not necessarily pretending one thing and that's hard. I mean, being asked for your advice or your opinion and then being told that it's not okay to give your opinion if it's not the opinion that they want to hear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like that's the position you're put in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's exactly how I felt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She wanted you to say one thing. It's not what you felt.</p>

<p>[00:28:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What you were saying right now about like if somebody is like telling me like - - I was just thinking about like if Julia had said "Hey, I'm deciding to move out of the house and this is what I want to do and I know it's right for me" and whatever, then that would've felt so much easier. I think I could've gotten behind that. (pause) </p>

<p>That's interesting. I guess I could never kind of peg why I felt so uncomfortable in the situation. I don't know. I mean, I was really trying to figure out how to do that. This wasn't one of those - - like I was actually trying to figure out how to be supportive, but I don't know. That makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it feels really different if somebody is vacillating versus someone who feels they know what's right for them. It's easier to be in a situation where someone feels very certain and it might not be what you would choose for you, but it seems like it might be a great choice for them even though it's different for you.</p>

<p>[00:29:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So could I - - if somebody was, like for example, with the situation that happened like - - then if I say "Well, I would stay because of A, B or C" then that's a reasonable thing to say, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're saying what you would do for yourself in that situation. And I think if someone is unsure, reflecting back the things that they're saying sometimes allows people to figure out for themselves what they want. Polling people and getting a majority opinion, that just tells you what other people want. It doesn't really tell you what you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And a lot of people do that. They feel ambivalent so they poll to find out what the majority would do. It's usually not very helpful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because then you found out "Okay, so six out of 10 people - - 6 out of 10 dentists like Aim."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>[00:30:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you hate the taste of Aim, it really doesn't matter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) (pause) Okay. (pause) Yeah. So anyway, I guess I've been thinking back to that as well. (pause) Yeah, I don't know. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, these things stick with you because there are things that have never really been resolved so they build up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think that we talked a lot about things, and there was a point at which we were totally back to 100 percent normal friends, like it was nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did that shift again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) When she got back together with Sergio, I think. Because for like months and months - - what was it, like two months. I don't know however long they were broken up. She was telling me all these things like "I'm so sad. I'm so depressed. I've never been this sad in my entire life."</p>

<p>[00:31:02]</p>

<p>And I was like trying to make her feel better. I would kind of go out of my way. Like I went all the way to where she works - - she works at Yale Medical School - - so I went all the way over there, and I would have lunch with her all the time and tried to make her feel better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you were being a really good friend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Well, right, but I don't know. I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did that feel good to you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it wasn't nice to see somebody so sad. I think we got a lot closer. It felt nice that I was able to kind of make her feel a little bit better because she said "Oh, I feel a little better, thank you." Like she'd say that all the time. So that was nice.</p>

<p>But then she got back together with him. Well, while they were broken up she kept telling me like "I wish he would just get back together with me" or something and I was like "Oh my God. This is totally like not" - - and like I did actually voice "Well, that's weird because that totally puts you out of control. Like if you said 'We'll get back together if I feel like it,' that might be the same situation but then you're in control a bit."</p>

<p>[00:32:13]</p>

<p>I don't know. Like I didn't really understand it. You know, sometimes when somebody breaks up with someone and you're like "Oh my God, they're an awful person" or whatever. Just like my friends when I got rejected from [inaudible at 00:32:26] and they're like "And it's a stupid name and it's the worst school ever" and you're like "Yeah," you know, even though it's a good school or whatever. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It felt nice to have people on your side.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles) (pause) But I remember this one time when we were talking about like the possibility of them getting back together, even though they hadn't talked about it or whatever at that point. And I was like "Well, you probably wouldn't get back together with him right away if he asked you to, right?" And she was like "Yeah, I would" and I was like "What?" (chuckles) Like that really - - </p>

<p>[00:33:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That really surprised you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot. I have a terrible memory, right, but like I remember that moment and I was like "Wow, that's really" - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you feeling? What's the "wow"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I was really surprised, I think. But also like - - (pause) Like that's a big difference between she and I. Like I would never put myself in that situation of feeling so relying on somebody who I'm not even speaking to at the moment. I don't know. Like that felt really weird. That felt very uncomfortable. And then they got back together and it was that moment had come to fruition. I think it's almost like seeing that every day - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's really meaningful to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, yeah. But it shouldn't be, right? (chuckles) I don't know.</p>

<p>[00:34:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, rather than judge it, let's look at why it is. What makes it such a big issue?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I think it's because I was in that same situation in college and it was - - well, not the same situation. But I mean it was a really crappy relationship. It was like really bad. And I felt that way and while I would take him back or whatever, I would still - - I would see myself doing it, and I would feel bad about it. I was like "I shouldn't be doing this, but I am anyway." </p>

<p>And I think the subsequent awful relationship that happened has put me in the position to where I never want to be anywhere like that again. So, I mean, I think I learned the hard way but I really do think I learned my lesson. Like I don't ever want to feel that disempowered again or feel like I'm waiting for somebody who like may or may not come back.</p>

<p>[00:35:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're watching her do this thing that felt so damaging to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I still think about that all the time. Even just the other day, I found out that this guy had been with this girlfriend or whatever but then they broke up and he was so heartbroken, and I felt really bad because I felt good about that. And that's not the kind of person I want to be, right? Like I mean, this person hurt me for a really long time. But even still, like - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't want to feel vindictive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, exactly. (pause) But anyway, it's like I'm seeing it all over again and it's really - - I don't want to be anywhere near that. Like I don't. I don't know. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that, I think, explains probably some of the intensity of what you feel and why you're hiding from seeing it. Because it's not just what you're seeing in her, but it also really brings up this echo of what it felt like to you in college.</p>

<p>00:36:01</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, definitely. (pause) I mean, there are definitely a lot of differences between the two relationships. Like I'm not saying that - - I mean, their relationship is probably much healthier than mine with him. (chuckles) Like they're very different plus - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there is similarity in that you felt like she doesn't have a lot of power.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly. Exactly. That's the part that I think is really similar. I don't like it. And if that's okay with her, then I don't want to be her friend. (chuckles) I don't know. (chuckles) That's also really shitty to say, but I just don't, you know? I don't know. (pause) (chuckles) (pause) I don't know. I don't know at what point that's okay as well.</p>

<p>[00:37:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and that's for you to - - there's no right or wrong there. That's for you to decide, and it sounds like your gut instinct is telling you that one difference that you can't tolerate is this issue of power in a relationship. It feels really hard for you to be around someone who would stay in a relationship where they don't have power or don't have enough power.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really hard for you to see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like part of what feels so difficult for you is that she's making a choice to be disempowered.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yes, exactly, exactly. I mean - - yes. I think that's kind of really gets me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the question you asked me is "Is it okay?" and I'm going to kind of throw it back to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) </p>

<p>[00:38:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it okay to decide that you don't want to be friends with someone who would choose to be disempowered in a relationship? How does that feel for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) That's a hard question. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's why I'm not answering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is a really hard question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean - - (pause) I don't think so. I don't - - that's not the kind of people I want to be friends with, no. I mean, I really, really believe in "You are the company that you keep" kind of thing. Just because I've changed so much since I came to school, and that has nothing to do with class. (chuckles) I think that has to do with the people that I've been around. And so I've always taken really - - not always (chuckles) but I learned my lesson about the people I was hanging out with. Ever since, I have been very careful to like select the people that I want to have relationships with. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:39:06]</p>

<p>I don't know. I mean - - (pause) Like my mom's friends are like that all the time. Like I think that's kind of where they live, right, but that seems like more of a cultural situation. Like Julia's mom got a perfect score on the MCAT. She was a doctor. She was like this behemoth of a woman (chuckles) and it seems like more of a choice than like a cultural situation. I think that's part of what bugs me more about that, but I still spend time with my mom's friends and feel totally like - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels less like a choice. It's this choice piece.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I don't feel like I want to continue to be her friend, but I also don't want that to be just because I'm angry. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm, right. You want it to be because it doesn't - - you want it to be a reasoned decision of - - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>[00:40:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - - who do I want to be friends with, not who am I angry at.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, definitely. Because then that would just be like oh, this is easier. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I see the difference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you are angry, so it's hard to know which piece is driving the decision to pull away from the friendship. You know, is it the anger piece or is it the "I've learned something about you that makes me not want to be close friends with you."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but that sounds really harsh. (chuckles) I mean, just the way - - that sounds really harsh. But, yeah. (pause) That sounds really intolerant too, to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there are some things that we'll not tolerate. The idea of tolerance sounds really nice, but there are a lot of things that we're not tolerant of in this society, you know. We're not tolerant of people who hurt other people intentionally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're not tolerant of people that abuse children. We're not tolerant of people - - you know. It's great to be tolerant of some things, but there are some things that it's okay not to be tolerant of. Your example of the KKK.</p>

<p>[00:41:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, that felt really clear to you. That's something that you don't feel like you need to tolerate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or support. This is - - you know, when you get further away from the extremes, it's pretty easy to say "I'm not going to be tolerant of somebody who abuses a child. I'm not going to be tolerant of someone who rapes someone else."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are pretty, you know, easy examples. You get closer in the middle in the gray area, and are you going to be tolerant of someone who chooses to be in a relationship where they have less power than what feels appropriate to you? That's grayer. I'm not saying - - there's not a right answer to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not wrong of you to decide that's not something you'll tolerate. It's a hard - - since it's a less extreme, it seems less black and white than people who rape and murder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's easier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I guess like time in school - - I mean, there's so many different - - I mean, there's more differences than there are similarities between people at school. It's such a diverse group and I really enjoyed that. I think that's why I found it to be so rewarding.</p>

<p>[00:42:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So the diversity in that group were things that you wanted. The types of diversity you met in that group were things that you wanted to be able to tolerate, learn from.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean, even though a lot of the differences were like mutually-exclusive from other people like, you know, as belief systems go, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so there was a lot of conflict and pushing up against and like - - (pause) Sometimes like it wasn't pretty, sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were some of the things that were hard for you? What were some of the differences that were hard for you to tolerate or respect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (chuckles) I can think - - I have one, right? That was easy. (chuckles) Like my favorite professor of all time, Shania Franklin [ph]. We were in class or whatever and then there's this guy who runs like this anarchist school, which is kind of ironic. </p>

<p>[00:43:05]</p>

<p>But he basically called her a fascist because - - this was the week that she assigned one of her writings. And so he called the writing or whatever she had written "fascist" and I was like "Whoa, dude." Like you can say how you disagree with it. There's ways to express dislike for a text or something that are - - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you had a problem with that label.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, not the label, just that that label was not supported by anything else. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that seemed unreasonable. (pause) So I think approaching differences without having respect is like the number one thing. (pause) That's not something that I approve of, I guess. I don't know. And maybe that's - - I think that's part of like the whole Julia thing too. I can't respect that decision. I just can't. </p>

<p>[00:44:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because? What feels disrespectful about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I just - - I don't know. (chuckles) I can't - - (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's your homework.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. (pause) Yeah, I guess. (pause) Even if I were to decide that I don't want to be friends with her, the problem is that I still have to live with her. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) And so I think I need to be able to talk to her, right? That seems reasonable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would probably be more comfortable for you in the house, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think one of the things that's also making you feel angry is you feel like you're sequestered in your room.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The discomfort that you feel, you know, making you hide.</p>

<p>[00:45:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's really hard to move a relationship from one of friendship to one of civil roommate. But yeah, I think you do need to be a civil roommate. It would be more comfortable for you both.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to be friends. But you do probably have to acknowledge that there's going to be - - you have to acknowledge something in order to allow you guys to move. Because right now what you are is friends that are mad at each other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) I don't think I've ever gone from friends to not friends without having them be like friends to "We're never speaking again." (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you've always had these really dramatic cut-offs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. I mean, it kind of feels like that a little bit. I don't know. I guess I'll have to think about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so figuring out a way to acknowledge that there's been a shift. Clearly you're not spending as much time together anymore. </p>

<p>[00:46:08]</p>

<p>And then maybe try to reinstate something new that feels comfortable. Like being able to say "I know we're not spending as much time anymore, but I would like to be able to be friendly when we're in the same house."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure what would have to happen in order for you to be able to have that conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) Well, maybe the first step is seeing her. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That helps.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe spending some non-confrontational time together. You know, see if there's something that you can kind of see each other or do something that doesn't require a whole lot of depth right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have something kind of neutral.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like being in the kitchen. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it would also be easier if you could have some time alone with her without Sergio because that dynamic - - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's not going to happen. (laughter) I mean, not unless I ask for it, you know. (pause) Okay.</p>

<p>[00:47:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let's stop there for today. We're on for next week at 4:20.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, can we - - (voices overlapping) (chuckles) Yeah, I really like every other week. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just I think not enough happens and I like to think about things a lot before. I don't know. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that puts us - - so if we do every other week, it would be on Tuesday the 19th and you can have - - let's see, I have an 11:30 - - a 9:30, an 11:30, 12:30 or 3:30 that day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On the 19th?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had us scheduled for 10:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, there you are. Right in my book. Leanne. That would be you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm like assuming that you wouldn't be there because you hadn't been on previous week, so I was just giving you all the open spaces.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there you are, in your spot, so let's keep that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wasn't even reading the names that were in my spot. I just thought it was taken by someone.</p>

<p>[00:48:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Oh no. So I have this from the previous thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my goodness. That's a lot of money. So that's - - is that assuming that they're only going to cover the two?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, no. They sent me checks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, they did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they sent me - - they covered for - - so what happened, the reason I e-mailed you before and asked like "What were the ones you billed them for?" was because they sent me - - they only covered two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like - - I called them back and I was like "Hey, what happened?" So they sent me a check for the other two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so they reimbursed you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're paid. Alright, makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And for today's. I haven't written that one, sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay. Do you need a pen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got it, thanks. </p>

So at any rate it was, I don't, you know she acted like she really didn't want to have intercourse, she really didn't want to have intercourse and when we went to try it, we both burst out laughing and it was  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:03:29.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I also sense that you feel sort of terrible (inaudible - 0:04:24.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it did. It really didn't. Because she kind of like understood and just sit there and laugh about it, it was really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's not such a serious  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the thing I was trying to tell you  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - is that it's just not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Really, I can tell you it wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, to make it into the most important thing it's just  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - really distorts.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but leading up to this I was a wreck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were so nervous  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, really I was nervous about it. And I just had to like keep on going to the bathroom, I was really nervous about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of the idea that boy what's going to happen when you guys have intercourse?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:05:10.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. And nothing happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It scared the hell out of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It did, it really did, it scared me, it really did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you not able to have an erection?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I wasn't able to have an erection. And she just like and then the fact she says oh, like she didn't know what to do or anything. I always thought that, you know, I never really quite knew if she was a virgin or not. And then when she said that I said oh Christ, you know, the two of us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like she understands when you talk to her too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not something for you, just you or do something  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - the two (inaudible - 0:05:57.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, that's the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not the kind of my problem (inaudible - 0:06:05.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a kind of nice way to think about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really, it is. Well, it was kind of, it was kind of funny that I, she kind of like more or less took the initiative which really, you know, like made the first suggestion, she said oh Christ let's go to bed. I said okay. And then she was well she noticed my apprehension like what's happening. She says you don't parade around naked hun  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and I said not in front of women usually. And she said well it's kind of, she said well I don't know if I'm in front of men all the time either. So it was kind of funny that way, we had that and everything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:06:59.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. You know, it's an embarrassing thing. So like after it was all over, you know, like after it got started or anything then the embarrassment was just gone, just the initiative stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's kind of the way, you know, that things don't feel as nervous after awhile and that goes for a lot of people too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, really. The next time I won't be so apprehensive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of when you were, you know, before you tried (inaudible - 0:07:38.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you thinking, was that on your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah, it was. I really ... it was great yet really it was great just turning her on, it was really kind of nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seeing her get excited?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:07:59.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really did, great. One thing she was, like she wanted to have oral intercourse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it all come out (inaudible - 0:08:18.6) and I just felt, you know, I didn't want to, you know, I said I would rather have regular intercourse and I said well, no I just couldn't explain to her like, you know, I've had it many times before and I would rather do something different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But she was very persistent. But it was nice, it really was. It worked out very well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:08:46.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, we did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And were you able to have an erection?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:08:53.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no there isn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just sounds, I mean this doesn't sound kind of (inaudible - 0:09:00.4). It's unquestionable it's making you not have an erection.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being nervous.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, that's it, really, that's the truth, that's the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not being attracted to women.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. No it isn't. It was interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's also like kind of you don't feel exactly, I guess it was more then just releasing for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:09:32.7). Felt good about actually (inaudible - 0:09:35.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Like there wasn't anything I guess something wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No it's not quite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:09:42.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you can do it right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. But I still have apprehensions about having regular intercourse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess, you know, I don't know why but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, why don't you talk about it and what's different about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, you know, there isn't, really there isn't anything different about it but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:10:06.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow kind of like that feeling means something  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - kind of see that as some kind of ultimate test as well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. It was really kind of nice just going on for hours.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:10:48.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I had a feeling that, you know what, as far as she was very, she was kind of apprehensive a lot of having intercourse too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I thought to myself, well, I guess I would be too if I were her. That's the first time for her too so, I would be too. And I thought well there's always a chance her getting pregnant and stuff like that which could really bother one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:11:57.4) a lot of women.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, really. I can understand why she would feel that way. And I thought of bringing up the subject of, you know, alright well birth control but I don't know why I just couldn't bring myself to say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have you ever thought of pregnancy (inaudible - 0:12:16.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow practicing, why do you know (inaudible - 0:12:24.5)? That's probably a religious thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For her?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: For me? No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no, no. I mean  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow kind of if she's practicing birth control you should be having intercourse.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. But I didn't  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:12:36.6) at that stage (inaudible - 0:12:38.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right well I didn't, I presume she's not really if she's a virgin I presume that she's not practicing birth control. But as far as I'm concerned if she intends to have intercourse she should practice birth control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you didn't want to say anything what you just kind of felt what too embarrassing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of like it was at the wrong time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I guess, I felt why I'm not going to bring it up now. That well I know like I know that you may be afraid of becoming pregnant and I would be afraid of your becoming pregnant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And asking well are you, you know, are you protected or something like that. That we really have to be crazy sitting there laughing at something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it kind of seems so useless actually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of thinking that so much (inaudible - 0:14:00.6) and found that it didn't work out and you were still able to laugh about it. It's a nice, you know, (inaudible - 0:14:10.6) couldn't be better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true, that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean do you feel kind of bad about it now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really kind of do but then, then the, the fact that she really didn't seem interested in having intercourse  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and I was the one who had brought it up and everything  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - she didn't (inaudible - 0:14:33.7), having intercourse. In fact when she said oh let's go to bed or something like that and I said well you know what that means and she said oh not necessarily.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I really don't think that was her whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That she didn't want to. Maybe she was afraid too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:15:01.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not an unusual thing I think for people to be afraid of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was really kind of disappointed she got this thing going to Spain. I told her, well she had been, she had gone away last summer too and she said well you just have to go on like you did last summer well that's another different story.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:15:47.4) found like you feel it's a whole new world.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's only one relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not the last time  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's definitely not the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - you weren't involved with anyone and you want to see (inaudible - 0:15:59.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Keep going.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. It's really a different story. And it kind of worries me too that she will be gone all summer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:16:15.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know and I feel that I can run with it, I just don't want fall back into my old patterns.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you kind of like see yourself maybe getting having gotten somewhere but you're not sure enough of (inaudible - 0:16:32.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Completely going back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:16:35.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not really (inaudible - 0:16:41.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sure was. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be your (inaudible - 0:16:47.2). I mean you would do that in yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true, yeah, that's true, really true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Knowing that it makes you (inaudible - 0:16:55.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:17:00.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:17:10.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:17:12.7). If I could make it with Tanya there is always other women in the world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:17:17.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. That's what I really and I thought it was kind of, I was really rather lucky that, everything is happening so fast.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It really doesn't give you time to sit back and think about things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:17:43.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and not really worry about it. And everything is happening so fast and I thought if I didn't have Tanya well then I wouldn't be able to do anything. There wouldn't even be, I couldn't, I wouldn't, there wouldn't be any women, anyone I could.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:18:01.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Heterosexual, I wouldn't have anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you might have to find someone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, I would, I would have to find somebody which would even be more difficult. But I thought to myself I'm really kind of fortunate in that respect that there is someone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:18:22.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, right. Because it amazes, it really it amazes me to think that changed so fast and things are happening so fast.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And things are kind of scary. It really is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:18:44.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right it really does. Just like overnight. It's weird how it can just change your whole life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean does it kind of change the way you look at everything?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like instead of seeing the world as a gray you kind  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - it looks kind of nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really nice, it really, it just.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you kind of look forward to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Just a feeling like you can wake up in the morning and just wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel happy, happy to be up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:19:50.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess because then you have to be yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's really, it's unbelievable. In fact the, two women that I work with, well Monday I came into work and we went into the lounge and I came in and said Hi, how are you and all this stuff  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And Sara was there and she's another person that's very observant and she says, she's standing up at the time, I said I'll let you know let me buy, she was having (inaudible - 0:20:20.5), I said oh Sara let me buy you your orange juice and she says oh wow she said that's really nice and I want to thank her too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she knew.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she really, she said she  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like she knew.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like it was written all over my face. I said how the hell did she know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it showed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It must really show.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:20:45.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. It was really interesting. But Tanya is different the subject of marriage again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I asked her, I says well why? She said well I told you before, and I just don't remember you responding before. I told you before and I said well why? And she says well I want to spend the rest of my life with you, that's her reason why and I said oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds a good reason.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's a good reason it really is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're not sure of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow kind of like you, now it's just business (inaudible - 0:21:36.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it doesn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I don't know what do you think, you know, when you sleep with her don't feel any different or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like because (inaudible - 0:21:46.1) previous and quite awhile before you talk well, I don't want to marry anybody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You fear that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:21:53.7) have her sexually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:21:57.9), is that the opposite or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know it  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or she just not (inaudible - 0:22:03.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is a good reason not to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. I'm really not sure that I'm ready to spend the rest of my life with somebody. But the thing is I do intend to sleep with Tanya  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and I like to go on (inaudible - 0:22:22.0) with Tanya.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like with that, you know, there's a lot more to marriage then that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I don't know, maybe, I don't know if she feels, I don't even know if she would feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sleeping with her (inaudible - 0:22:38.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mean should get married, yeah. I don't know if really would mean that much to her or not. I mean from what she has, from the way she had talked before I mean she doesn't see anything wrong with having premarital sex or anything like that. And like her best friend is running around with a priest  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - of course, she doesn't like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She thinks, yeah that's, yeah, I can see why she think that they, you know he's taking her for a ride and he should definitely become defrocked and  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - marry her and all this stuff, but he's not. She is really disgusted, she really gets up tight about the whole thing, you know, that he's pulling this stuff, which he may and he may not be, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It does have implications that he is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean it's kind of like he can't push that's makes her (inaudible - 0:23:35.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That they are not married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean he's a priest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true, that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean she doesn't disapprove because of true people  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - versus the  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, yeah, yeah, right. He's married to the church and he needs to get a divorce. Yeah, I can understand what you're saying. Right. That is really a different situation. I guess she really doesn't feel there is anything wrong with that.</p>

<p>One thing that kind of bothers me is that I don't know that if you really, you know, if you're really suppose to be in love with a person you want to see them at all times, just time like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean sure it's fine you're going to go to bed and everything but I just couldn't see spending a whole weeks or something in bed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I thought to myself well maybe I'm just not that, what's the word, you know like I don't know, what word I'm looking for, like you don't need sex that often, you know, you don't have to have sex that often.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what the word I'm looking for but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:27:35.1)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Something, something like that, or.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel there's something wrong with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Feeling that there's something wrong with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you had a honeymoon or even now it sounds like it's nice to be in bed with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and like I don't even go running.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some other things (inaudible - 0:27:52.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like don't have to call because I come over everyday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:28:19.5). I don't ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's the American way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The mythical American way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The mythical American way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean life if both people wanted to be in bed with each other all the time it would be boring.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And second of all, then why aren't people being so rich and don't have to work, why aren't they in bed all the time and they're not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They are trying to find other ways to amuse themselves.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. But, you know like, they say, you know like just the all it's a high school teacher, he was kind of an ass, but he use to give sex talks every Friday, he was a physics teacher and all it was, they were, you know, really down to the earth sex talks and he said the first word that they all, the first couple of years that you put a P in a book on a jar every time you had intercourse, the first five years it would only take you 25 years after this first 5 years to empty them all out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you took them out every time, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, if you took one out after the first five years. In other words, like the first time you should be just so excited you just want to go on and on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I do, you know like I do intend to but  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you said stuff like you're going to, you don't sound like you feel any kind of pressure  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - (inaudible - 0:28:19.5)  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I sense that (inaudible - 0:29:53.4) you think you kind of (inaudible - 0:29:55.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right something abnormal, if there's something wrong that I don't want to, you know, like every day or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess it's a matter of, I mean it's certainly probably true that I mean (inaudible - 0:30:13.7) like in marriage the amount of intercourse does decrease over time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And at most maybe function (inaudible - 0:30:22.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that doesn't mean that the people are, you know, even though it doesn't mean that number of Ps in the jar are so astronomical  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - (inaudible - 0:30:32.6) you see what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true, that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of relative to how much people do it, maybe more, maybe less  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - but that doesn't mean that they are doing it all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But somehow you just kind of feel like  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - you can't see yourself doing it all that much  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and perhaps every now and then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. And it was, it's kind of like it was weird the fact that you know like I hadn't had any sex for like weeks  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and it wasn't really upsetting me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. You didn't feel frustrated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Frustrated or anything else like that. And it was just by the fact of being with Sheila  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very satisfying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that was satisfying in a way. And it wasn't the fact that I was frustrated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, it's kind of like, you know I mean, you felt satisfied and it's not kind of like, I don't know exactly (inaudible - 0:31:32.3) it's like the fact of being with her made you feel satisfied, maybe you didn't feel sexually frustrated it's not like sex is such an isolated  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - just like a feeling, like you felt pretty happy  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and it wasn't as if except for sex.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This thing where you  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - it was totally different  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - all over you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, yeah. It's really it's a weird thing sex.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know you just, it's like you can't isolate it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It entails, it just enters into everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or everything is, it's a part of it's not by itself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you can be satisfied just by being, or at least I can at any rate at this point be satisfied.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just being there, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just being comfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if that's abnormal or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, you're kind of wondering if you're abnormal because of, you can feel good and not feel sexually frustrating even though you're feeling good and not having sex?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like when I guess sounding like when you're feeling good  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - you're thinking about the good things and not thinking about what you're lacking (inaudible - 0:32:51.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some people no matter what, how good things are, are just constantly pick up thing they don't have and being happy about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things that never happen (inaudible - 0:33:04.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the truth. I guess I should just be satisfied just being, you know, satisfied.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kind of get the sense of (inaudible - 0:33:18.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How you feel inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How things are going.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how fast it has happened too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really. This one, this girl that use to student teach at the school and she met a teacher, (inaudible - 0:33:49.9). She goes well she had a very bad afternoon.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she was at the show. And my god what is she doing at this show.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. (inaudible - 0:34:03.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. She's not (inaudible - 0:34:04.9) in bed, she just got married why isn't she in bed. And I guess it really doesn't, it really doesn't mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't have to mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Obviously or most always people have had sex before they're married  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - so like it's not anything new or anything, so they went to this show. I can honestly see why they make all these studies about sex, but they couldn't pinpoint to just sex.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I imagine there's really a hell of lot of people in the world who do have a sexual problem but other problems entailed with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of they made you specialty, you hear a lot about sexual liberality but you don't hear as much about there's not a big to do made about it, especially since they're going to keep their sexual problems to themselves.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not what you hear about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-uh, uh-uh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you get talking to friends you don't unless it's a great sexual friendship they're not talking to you about  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - their sexual problems.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you were to share a sexual problem with a friend you very well (inaudible - 0:35:49.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess Tim was right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He always is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sex with (inaudible - 0:35:56.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sex was always so important, like ... I remember reading a couple of books by him in college, I don't remember what it was, but I always remember like sex, sex was just entered into everything. And subconsciously it must, I don't know if it does well, I heard (inaudible - 0:36:18.2) where they said that sex in the male is constant, there's always this constant sexual ideas within the male. And without the brain in order to regulate these ideas  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - they would be running rampant or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:36:35.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. But I think that like as far as the definition of the word sex, it's very difficult to define.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You just can't say sex is based on going to bed with someone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. (inaudible - 0:36:59.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. Really it's sad that (inaudible - 0:37:13.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feel bad about all the  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - years spent worrying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Worrying about it and being hung up about it, like it was such a big thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When it's just a part of everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's nothing to be, I mean it's (inaudible - 0:37:30.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it seems to make it so important but yet (inaudible - 0:37:35.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. I think that's what, I don't know if you could teach it to a person or a person has to learn for himself that it's but I think just being with a person or if you have a person who you really love that just kind of, then you probably know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And also I guess if you found yourself important because people love you but just like you did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why all these things that we hear about makes us think that we don't hear about them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. When it was there all the time but you just didn't know it, you didn't know what it was and it was there all the time. I've got one or two questions that he wanted, something about they wanted to get right down to the nitty-gritty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So how could you describe it to them or tell them. I think it's like everybody must be, it must be different for everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just, it couldn't be possibly the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One thing that worried me, you know like without having intercourse it worried me if I was going, if I was satisfying her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I was satisfying Tanya.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:39:35.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:39:37.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, uh-huh, uh-huh, really. She was happy so I guess I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's kind of again I sense that's probably something that you were scared about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scared about having intercourse too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of and that's another thing that (inaudible - 0:40:01.8) having intercourse (inaudible - 0:40:05.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's something (inaudible - 0:40:14.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and it's something that you really shouldn't worry about, because the minute you start worry about it, it just doesn't, you know like spend, it's not going to happen, you aren't going to satisfy anyone (inaudible - 0:40:35.3). Like ran into my teacher and she said her son can't sleep and the doctor recommended sleeping pills and she didn't want to give them to him, from high school. And we were trying, the only thing if a person really learns how to relax.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All he has to do is really learn how to relax and everything will be just fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:41:00.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really. It's just like everything would just be fine. And we suggested let him run around the block or something to get himself physically tired or something like that. Or give him a couple of aspirin and tell him they are sleeping pills. It's all psychological. I don't know if it work or not but.</p>

<p>I often wondered if sex plays that big of a role in other societies. Like outside the states, you know, like everything, you know, like marriage and when marriage bad and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:41:53.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And a lot of so called primitive societies just don't make such a big to do about it and it's sex built in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People don't have such sexual hang ups.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But like I was reading these books and everyone stands by it to see if a marriage is consummated that especially within royalty or something like that (inaudible - 0:42:17.8). If it wasn't, you know like it would be the end it really, you know like it would really feel that something is wrong with these two people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:42:29.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But yet there was a really great importance put upon it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's such a big thing (inaudible - 0:42:34.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And everything you know we turn around today and everything is (inaudible - 0:42:44.4) and made a big to do about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're trying to nail it's like seem to have (inaudible - 0:43:05.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Big to do about it but it's.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just a nice ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's really different, it's a part of your life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of when it's a problem or when it has been a problem you felt like much more important  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Really, really. Can we play those back?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:44:04.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:44:12.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Aren't they in the file or something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your tapes are part of the research project.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they get some research done on them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, it's all confidential (inaudible - 0:44:36.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Exactly what happens (inaudible - 0:44:45.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would be interested, I mean, you know what could they do with it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean when you think, when there are three other things that we don't know anything  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - science is just has no interest (inaudible - 0:44:59.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. When you hear somebody different. That's one of our problems, there's something wrong with me that I see, you know like why should I feel that there's something wrong with me or that I'm so different, that someone is going to listen to me rather then someone listen to someone else. But that's just my hang up that I'm really  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:45:31.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I just, you know like I'm, like I'm different but then I have to, I think back well there's nobody the same everybody is different so anybody who would talk into that tape would maybe have something to offer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sound different to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see what you mean it's kind of like, you know what I could have to offer but then the fact that you're you  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right yeah. But I have to go back and think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's not like you really just know the feeling yourself (inaudible - 0:46:08.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to kind of like think it out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, right, right. As if, you know like (inaudible - 0:46:18.8) abnormal one and listening to what I have to say because I'm abnormal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But everyone is abnormal or everyone is different to some extent. And I believe everyone needs a little psychiatric help, psychological help whatever you want to call it. That everyone can use it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like they get (inaudible - 0:46:48.0), you don't feel like you're sitting on the bench unlike the other person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:46:55.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. In fact we were, I was talking to this one teacher and this other teacher use to teach at the school, he's having grade problems and all this stuff (inaudible - 0:47:05.8) and all this stuff and we were talking about. And I said had you ever thought of seeking professional help and she said yes that his sister had herself seeing a psychiatrist and she said he use to be living with her and she said that (inaudible - 0:47:24.4) come in, he's not going to be able to live with her until he does, she said. (inaudible - 0:47:31.3) because we all could use it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said something like tell me about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:47:39.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. I was going to say well I started to say there are places you could really seek out, you could really seek out help (inaudible - 0:47:54.2). But then I stopped and I don't know why, why I should.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:48:02.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. But it's like, I would like to tell people I would say well you know I'm seeking psychological help and I'm not, it's not like I'm alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. It's like (inaudible - 0:48:21.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like I'm not alone a lot of people do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't, you shouldn't feel like more happy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, yeah, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:48:35.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really should but it's like I'm afraid what they thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, it's kind of like that's your standpoint but kind of like there are stigmas attached to some of this stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And people think oh my god you must be (inaudible - 0:48:53.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's not a matter of being afraid.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's really not. It's funny how, the subject just keeps on coming up and it's like this other one was saying a friend of hers who couldn't sleep, she hadn't slept for months  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - she had committed herself to some hospital or something like this and some friend of hers calls her up and says (inaudible - 0:49:14.2), she's a teacher, I don't know what the Board is going to think about this, you under psychiatric care, you know, like bingo, that' means your job. The minute they find out  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I don't even know why I feel like the way I (inaudible). I don't know why (inaudible). Ahh. Let's see. We left our story I think last week at the point where I was to determine whether or not you wanted to get into the real heavy thing with (inaudible). And I think that depends on (inaudible) the actions on that (inaudible).</p>

<p>I'm a little bit reluctant to commit myself. You know and say, "Okay. This is gonna be a real heavy (expletive) " (inaudible) chat for two hours. I'm really not sure exactly what I have to say (inaudible) . I don't want to get into a point where I feel like I got to push it. I shouldn't push it. I don't want to give a command performance (inaudible) to myself or to you or ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You're saying that you've decided not to see me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just to play it by ear a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're operating on a level that you want (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ideally it would be great if we felt we were really getting somewhere to kick it over for an appropriate time and just say, "(inaudible) ". At the same time, I'm a little bit reluctant to you know ... I don't want to make it sound like it's a really major (inaudible) . I suppose (inaudible) . I just don't want to kick it over and you say, "Well we ran up two hours" or something (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you willing to go into wherever you're going (inaudible) one hour?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I agree with you. And it is silly for me to try and (inaudible) . I don't know myself (inaudible) shut up because it gets (inaudible) . So with that understanding (inaudible). I think. I mean I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell me more about (inaudible) understanding (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The understanding will be that if I more or less choose to ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: The understanding is that if I choose to (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. That's the thing. I didn't get that from you. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a very mild way of (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That leads me without any ... completely (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>0:03:27.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In other words, I can't make (inaudible) 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. In other words, if it's okay with you and you choose to (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) I really don't know why I'm so ... it's (inaudible) to me that I feel so nervous about this. I think I do and I don't know why that is or how it is (inaudible) . But I just seem to be (inaudible). I feel uncertain (inaudible) I say I just don't want to sit around (inaudible). But ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Another way of putting it is that you're (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I am. Maybe I am. You know, I'm a little bit reluctant. You know these things do have a way of reverberating (inaudible). I'm a little bit afraid that that if I really were to allow myself to get too deep into it, it might be a little dif ... might be very uncomfortable for me. Not just talking about it, but later on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Remembering what haunts you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The memory of it and the emotional reaction of it would be difficult. And I think I say that partly because I can see in my ... empirically from my behavior that and things that are going on in my head frequently. I think these sessions are causing me to be a bit, causing my defenses to be somehow diminished and my behavior certainly has improved to some extent (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because not ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I find myself even more agitated than I was before because you seem to work kind of more to the core and obsessing (inaudible) a little bit. Whereas previously I can't. So I was a little bit (inaudible) partly for that reason too. I feel one or two things; either that I'm a fraud and I'm gonna talk about a lot of things that aren't, that don't make sense. Number two, I only talk about things that do make sense and mean so much to me that they're gonna have a bad affect on me. I'm nervous even now just talking about it. But I feel that way from things that I've seen myself through recently and it's my state. I get more likely to be despondent now than I was before and really that (inaudible) anger.</p>

<p>I say this partly because I'm under the influence of some strange ... well, let me just tell you this. I had stirring incident over the weekend. The reason why I feel this way is because of that. I was partying and smoked a lot of dope, and I tried some stuff that I never tried before. And I really got completely shook up. I just had to leave the party. I didn't know anybody there and I felt a little threatened anyway because they were strangers and not at all like myself. So I just observed. I just wanted (inaudible) I just left the party and walked back to my building, and spent an entire evening higher than a floating kite. Peering out the window and listening to records, and I was extremely negative about myself. I just was, you know, felt like a terrific void and I had absolutely nothing in the world outside and extremely very very cold. I was getting all these strange and drug-induced, partly they were manifestations of the emotional thing I was feeling (inaudible). The party was probably the cause of this. It really did disturb me.</p>

<p>Fantasies about suicide, little childish things, and obsessiveness about suicide. How exactly I would do it. Could I do it? I just went over and over and over. (inaudible) disturbing to me. I think as I said there are reverberations there. I know there are (inaudible) . Dreams that I've had and madness, and (inaudible) .</p>

<p>0:08:26.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Reverberations from the therapy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think there are. I think that (inaudible) ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is kicking in a little bit. You know, it's beginning to have its affect and (inaudible) mire and muck of getting stirred up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't like it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. Because it's difficult to cope with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uncomfortable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what are you saying there may be four bucks every four weeks?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean two. What it does got to do with it is I'm just striking out. That's all. I think it's worthwhile, like you said (inaudible) the problem. But I think that obviously the defenses that we discussed before or I discussed before, the defenses that I manipulated to date have been obviously number one (inaudible) . And number two, there is certainly no basis on which to (inaudible) . But and I think I experienced that (inaudible) .</p>

<p>One of the things that the drug made me feel was the ... really vividly a certain desperateness in my mental and emotional situation, and how very nearly the edge I could go.</p>

<p>0:09:41.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Vis visa vie my job or problems in terms of my appearance (inaudible) . I must tell you that I have no job problem when I'm doing my work. I do it well, but my problem is (inaudible) . I sometimes just don't show up and give no reason for it. That's a problem probably from my tablets (sp). I'm aware of that. You know, that's sort of frightening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's frightening that you don't have more control over (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And really there's the situation I think the therapy makes me realize is the situation is a lot more bleak. Maybe it's self-pity. I don't know, but the situation is a lot more bleak than I otherwise given credit to it. Sort of (inaudible) troops (sp) and all of a sudden I realize that I really don't have any connections and things really could go seriously awry. So that's what I mean by reverberation (inaudible) .</p>

<p>I'm a little bit frightened to start to talk about some of these things that relate to my feelings about my mother and my father, and myself that affect me very strongly, because I'm afraid, you know, unless it's happened (inaudible), I'm scared (inaudible) . I don't know if that makes any sense, but I think that ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're a little afraid to trust me to go into that with you just for fear that you've got so much to lose and feels like the little chance to (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know where I'm going. I'm wandering through it blindly and really ... you know, you say you're going into it with me, but you're not. I'm going into it myself. You're probably skillfully or whatever helping me along, but I'm down here alone. And my reaction is that things can't be altered by really, ultimately by what you say. Just how I deal with myself and you're there and it's fine (inaudible) depend on it in a certain way for that same (inaudible) . Maybe I'm just overreacting to the experiences that (inaudible) of that drug. I never had anything that strong before (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I felt a little bit funny about you're talking about the fact that you're emotional swings and that, and then suddenly saying it wasn't the affect of the therapy. I mean they're confusing things going on here. I'm trying to separate what's the affect of what. You know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. Well, maybe that's (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not saying ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just a bad trip on something. You know, something's that causing me to ...</p>

<p>0:12:41.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not saying that you're whole change in the last few weeks is a result of the drug that you took the other night. I'm not saying that. I would be last to say that this hasn't changed you or hasn't made any affect on your life. I'd feel funny if it hadn't. I would be ... I would've done something wrong if they had.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I was just ... well, the way I think of it is that I was just more susceptible under the influence of that drug. Totally got lost in my reverie for a long term. (inaudible) So anyway that's the way I feel about. (inaudible) It's difficult to try to get a handle on some of these things to begin to talk about them or to just make sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I tell you a little bit about what my reactions would be? One of my reactions is I wonder what you do want out of therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You had me (inaudible) on me. It made me feel uncertain. Maybe I'm ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I just never heard. I never head what you want out of it. My worst fantasy is that you want to tell yourself that see you did do something about your problems and help me ... and to have me see to it that you don't do anything about them or ... You know what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes I feel like I'm an accomplice. Like you want me to make ... like you want to make me an accomplice to doing nothing about your problems.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's really pretty ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that ... right. That may be. I certainly (inaudible) mission. What my (inaudible) mission is to rap with someone that I feel understands the terms of problems as it were and just let me chew my mouth off and think about the things, and try and put me on a good track of thinking about them. Hopefully a profitable way to think about them, pointing out certain inconsistencies or whatever is there that you pointed out that tells me (inaudible) . And let it go at that.</p>

<p>At the same time, I feel on my part from you that you're asking me to just ... at the drop of a hat on Tuesday night, all of sudden really go into these ... into some things that may or may not even be bothering me. I don't know. I'm utterly confused at this point. But in some ways I feel like a fraud. Maybe I'm talking about a lot of things that are just a result of my self-absorption and nothing else. Sometimes I feel that way. So maybe it's just kind of a waste of time from your point of view and from mine. But at the same time, why not simply get on the train and come on it and sit down for an hour and suddenly get into an enormously deep problem and then stroll out the door. You know. I mean presumably it's not just something where you're going to relieve yourself and all of a sudden you've got it all and come out and really get into it, talk about a lot of things that's (inaudible) ...</p>

<p>0:16:46.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then go home.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Either go home and eat your dinner and go to bed, and get up and go to work the next day. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like if you're gonna do that, you would need more time than an hour on Tuesday nights. It would have to be a more total ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If I can finish that. I think ... I don't know what you're concept is, but I'm really just like you in talking about this because we (inaudible) gone through this before. But it just seems to me that continually (inaudible) the grounds of the thing, unless you're just at a loss, it's harder to see because you expect me to react in ways that I'm not really acting. You know, I don't know what I expect to get out of this therapy. Hopefully some kind of an understanding and answer something. I don't know. You know, it's a shot in the dark. I don't know how these things are supposed to proceed. I don't know how to proceed with your ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can you have the answers?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... with your other people and if it goes differently or if there's something that I should be doing or if you feel that I'm ... As I say, in many ways, I have copped out. But there are reasons for that. I'm not just doing it just to ... I feel like as though you might be regarding this as a rich kid getting kicks or something and coming out or reacting and then enjoying his self. And saying just what he wants to say and then going home. When you want a lot more from me apparently or feel what I say or (inaudible) if I understand your operation. So I'd rather not ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you think about the rich kid getting his kicks? Do you say that's a fantasy that you had that I hold? Sometimes I wonder. Sometimes I have thought that. You know, I wonder about that because it feels like when you start going into something a little bit deeper, then you say, "well ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if I do that ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: " ... I can't get up and go to work at three. Handle that one".</p>

<p>PATIENT: It certainly isn't that I'm getting my kicks. It's just that I am ... it's just my way.</p>

<p>0:19:29.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's just your way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if I decide that I don't want to go into it, I'm certain that I don't want to do it now because I'm too fastidious or I'm too something. I mean after all that's me. So ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I should accept that and I will.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To a certain extent, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well see. I feel that it is very important for us to both know what the (inaudible) of therapy are and what we both intend to happen. And it'll help me get what you want if I know what your goals are and if I agree to those ... agree to help you get those. I have asked that because sometimes I think a lot of times that I have asked that because sometimes I feel that you're avoiding things. If you don't, but you just want to tell me about things and don't want to go into them, (inaudible) too scared that something bad is gonna happen. Then I, part of me kind of resents that or builds up inside and I'll think, "well golly. He doesn't trust me". You know and that just ... (inaudible) scares me not to be trusted.</p>

<p>After all, I guess I've always I feel fairly efficient or good at this. And the fact that you won't trust me to help you do that, makes me feel mad. Makes me feel really pissed off. Okay, then we have to come to some kind of context about what is suitable to both of us ... what we both (inaudible) were willing to work out now. And that's what this conversation (inaudible) is about. So I've justified myself and tried to answer (inaudible) your question of why are we going into this again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let me say another thing. Okay. I'm understanding from what you're saying now that ours is a fairly limited contract in that you don't want to go into (inaudible) ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except when I decided to (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. It's okay. But I feel a lot better that we've got that on the table.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Once and for all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you and I both know and agree to that's what it is rather than my thinking and pushing you, and (inaudible) .</p>

<p>0:23:02.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Well, you got that (inaudible) on the tape.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A contract.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if you do this two weeks from now, play that feedback. So, now we've reached the first stage.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I've also got one other thing to ask and that is I hear you saying one thing that I intend to get out of this is (inaudible) positive (inaudible) I better be, have behavioral changes in the right direction. Or I better be at a better place and yeah. I intend that. Intend that for you, but I also have some feelings that you're not totally willing to go to rough spots to get there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understand your point of view and maybe I'm not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what I'm saying. I can't do ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I understand that. You know, what ... we already learned a side of (inaudible) as far as that goes that within the (inaudible) goes is as far as we can go. As I say, I disagree (inaudible) . See I just don't know how to respond to you in some of those instances. I don't know what exactly your saying or what. And it's just a feeling of confusion as much as (inaudible) something I'm accustomed to, to dealing with things and that (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In terms of feelings and stuff like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going to check with the research guy to make sure that it's okay that I view this with you. But I have an idea of something we could do to help you (loud background noise), which should be interested in doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What is it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's an exercise just to feel more (inaudible) with whatever you're feeling. So that you would be able to ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Sure. Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. We're not going to do it tonight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're not going to do it ... (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>0:25:42.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? Were you (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was gonna (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've didn't get all that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said I thought you were gonna run right out the door and get ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I guess that I think that I do feel (inaudible) in somebody that I'm not entirely candid with. As I say it's difficult for me to do that. One of the reasons why I should have called you sooner, (inaudible) distasteful for me in some respects to talk about some of these things that are floating around in my head with anyone but myself. You know. And that's the reasons. Just got accustomed to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You're saying that it's hard for me to be able to say something and you feel bad about it, but it's distasteful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's part of what I've been trying to do is trying to break some of those barriers against what is distasteful or (inaudible) the distasteful criterion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that you know succinctly stated, obviously the chief problem with my emotional (inaudible) is that at least the way I feel about it is they were and are stunted as a result of some difficulties in our relationship with my parents. I disliked my father and my thing with my mother. Feeling about her. She was (inaudible) . One of the things, and this is probably cheap of me to mention. I just have to make allowances (inaudible) . One of the things that's distasteful to me is that you have these (inaudible) that are drawn from that, make me very awkward.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are thousands of conclusions I can draw from that. Tell me what you're concluding?</p>

<p>0:28:12.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: My conclusion from that is that there is some kind of classical appeal, cataplex or something, or something (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Catapult complex.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Catapult. And ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's extremely distasteful, fit into the classical.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Not just doing the (inaudible) because as you saw, it's so obvious. Certainly I do a lot to not have that be the case and I would give a lot to be able to go into a very loud, tortuous explanation as to why that is not the case. In a way, trying to throw myself off the track. It's probably a very simple thing. And so this is probably one of the reasons why I'm so tortuous about it (inaudible) . I'm going to try to go around the block and through that door, and catch a glimpse there and ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Catch a glimpse there and work my way around it rather than go through it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about ... what about your relationship and your feelings toward your mother? (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I could confront and I think I have my, at least to overt dislike of her and her work. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you confront that right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) . We talked about a plan at that time and (inaudible). So that I can confront because that I can make some sense of it. But at the same time, the thing that I cannot confront is that she is a nervously compelling person for me. That's what's difficult for me to adjust to. The compelling aspect of really. That's why I said once, now I'm going through things that other people got over when they were 12 or whatever. You know. So that I'm saying that I think that apparently my life has been stunted by ... it's difficult for me in a certain way to acknowledge the whole issue (inaudible) . As much as I dislike her, she is the most important person in my life. You know. That's the king of confusion that's (inaudible) .</p>

<p>In a certain way ... well in other ways I think that relates to it too. Because ... well I don't know how proper it was to talk about this aspect of it, but I can just see it in certain ways in me, in the kind of friends that I have adopted to in my role that I play with them. It's always ... I always manage to find people that are ... that have that quality (inaudible) sort of dynamic personalities. But I myself never play that kind of a role with them. I sort of give them the feedback when we share certain biases that we have discovered together. But the role that I have is always the one who's cheering. The one that they're reacting to in a certain way. At least in one level that appears to be true. I'm sure there's no relationship that works that way (inaudible), because it doesn't happen. But I think that's part of the problem. So I've come around to a point where I have defined a lot of other relationships in terms of relationship maybe I had with her because of this, the dominance that I feel that she expresses ...</p>

<p>0:32:37.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you end up (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... and my relationship with other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... subordinate to other people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's been a kind of ... yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I noticed that in connection with my brother, with my brother especially, one of the things that I think is maybe good about these sessions again is that at least I am able at this point to become angry with him when I see these efforts in that regard because he very rarely has very much to say to me that's encouraging. At least with him now I get to realize what he's doing and become (inaudible) at it. So that he really shouldn't short-change me like that because I'm not ... you know, in many ways I'm better than he is. I'm a better person in some ways, probably as a result of being especially so passive sort of and then tolerant in those kind of things. But those aren't the kinds of things that I want admire myself for. So that's probably what's involved there.</p>

<p>I also feel that she, at the same time, she feels a special relationship with me. I think that when I was younger, sort of regarded as a ... you know, their hope. The other children had all their problems. My brother certainly had his problems and he was just four years older than I was. So they could look to me and kind of think, "well Johnny's gonna make it up". And I was more bookish in a certain way, although I never got to (inaudible) this stuff before. But I do feel that they had to ... that she had to and to a certain extent my father had put a special glow on me that the others didn't have. A different glow anyway there (inaudible).</p>

<p>So that's really the long and short of it. And that's the thing that's difficult for me to kind of negotiate around. I don't know how to negotiate around. I'm not really sure if everything I just said in the last (inaudible) is even true or not. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you not sure?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I probably is. It probably is true. I don't know. I just felt .. I get terribly confused about this. It might be true in certain ways. Not true in the way that I'm thinking of it. It might be (inaudible) things that I've said that are true. On the other hand, it might be ...</p>

<p>0:35:23.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might be true that your parents see you as in a special glow, but may not mean the same thing to them as it was to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's pretty hard to decide on that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It may be that a lot of this is just made up in my own brain. But as you said before, we're not going to seek objective verification of the way I feel about them, but at the same time, (inaudible) how well I'm related to what's really out there. But you see a lot of the things with that is the reason why I feel special about it is that I think that I ... and as I say in many ways I was their darling, at least her darling. And I was the one that was going to be a priest, which was a big fiasco. And I was ready to kill her.</p>

<p>This is again why I resented. I was going to do that because she had ... I just thought maybe (inaudible) . She determined that it would be very gratifying to her if I did in fact become a ... no become a priest. I had no notion prior to the one she interjected that. It was not her dream to doing such a thing. Then all of a sudden I did. In fact, went to school for a few days and then I finally blew it off sort of by dragging my feet and pleading every excuse that I could imagine. I got out of it, after having worried about it all summer as to how I was gonna get out of it. She probably (inaudible) error and so I got out of it. But she did say those things to me and it did mean a lot to her at that point that I do this. I was the one that was going to fulfill these things for her. That's one concrete incidence of a certain specialness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Specialness that ultimately ... part of that specialness that ends up in her wanting you to do what she wanted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not what to do like what you wanted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the heavy edge to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's probably (inaudible) together difficult (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And the difficult part of it too is that I think a lot of people go through this and I think that it has had a stronger affect on me than it has had on others. So I'm sort of uncomfortable with myself as a result of that. You know, really it isn't all so awful the experiences that I've gone through. A lot of other people have been through a whole lot worse and come out of it all right. And I'm not. I'm wallowing in it (inaudible) . So there's something sick about, to my mind, about that. Maybe I'm attaching a lot of importance to it merely to mark myself up for myself than somebody that's special or in fact a (inaudible) special remarkable.</p>

<p>0:38:49.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give yourself a kind of out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A kind of out and some special distinction of ... So those are the things that ... and the reason why it is difficult for me to talk about it is because that's going through my head. Because I dislike myself when I talk about other people because I'm making a moral judgment on myself. As I talk, that this is unworthy of me in a certain way. I'm worthy of (inaudible) in any way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's unworthy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm unworthy to in a way to get so screwed up as a result of that. I'm unworthy ... maybe I'm indulging myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should have done better than that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe I'm just indulging myself (inaudible) really a miserable little weakling. I don't know. And just sort of waddling around in it and getting such gratification that I can (inaudible). Something like that. It's a very bad syndrome (inaudible) . I don't know how ... I just don't know how to deal with it. I don't know whether that's so or whether I am just a weakling in some ways, unable to face things that others have faced successfully to a large degree or whether maybe I'm constitutionally now a weakling, but maybe I constitutionally I'm more a sensitive fragile flower type, where ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like one thing that you're doing and that is looking at your behavior and saying, "I'm really judging myself (inaudible) . Oh bah. How could you?".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which makes you (inaudible) that choice of (inaudible) making your world even more because the (inaudible) that kind of judgment that your (inaudible) helping you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm sure it isn't. I'm sure it isn't. So it's just like the thing that I've gotten in the habit of doing is not proper. What I'm trying to think of is what I would do alternatively and then I can ...</p>

<p>0:41:17.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Let's think about that for a few minutes. Think you can come up with a few things (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You think you can really (inaudible) do that because (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that you can come up with some alternatives?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That would really make it work. I mean picking some kind of approach out and besides tacking the tape?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think it might help you get lots of help (inaudible) right now. I'm not saying (inaudible), but it can help you. See what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. Well. I could just say, "Well look. This is the way it is". And because you feel that way or don't feel that way is not really a moral or ethical question. And the thing to do is to deal with it, but how do you ... now what does that say? That doesn't say anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that it says a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think it says, "Hey John. This is why I'm doing it." And that's okay. And then get on with thinking out a way to work on it instead of (inaudible) . When you do it, it doesn't seem like you're really getting past (inaudible) and then you give up. I mean you're not giving yourself much credit. (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or there's just think of this difficulty as sacramental sign of my special very sensitivity to things that go on around me, which is generally thought of as positive virtue rather than negative virtue. And it's actually I'm extremely, I'm more perceptive than these others that have (inaudible) character than others have and their able to wistfully throw off their shoulders (inaudible) . That has an attraction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: An attraction?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You might be a little more scarred (inaudible) from this because you're (inaudible) being in the business world and not (inaudible) to each other, etc. Because you're somewhat more sensitive (inaudible) aware of (inaudible) failures. What other ways to dealing in that situation. (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. I suppose.</p>

<p>0:44:53.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) That's what I thought for a while (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it's. No. You're right. I think it's true. I couldn't (inaudible) think of myself that way. That's ... I mean those are the two alternates really. For me, those are the two alternates.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What are the two alternates?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The two alternates are that either (inaudible) a priest (inaudible) because I (inaudible) . Because I've had these difficulties and a weaker person in making judgments on my parents that aren't really valid or true to serve myself. Or that I really am in fact a more sensitive type of person that recognizes a lot of falsity and crudeness in the way that people handle themselves and what they do. In a way it should be either or and like he said it probably the (inaudible) one or the other. The chief one being currently the one where I'm an illusion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The one where you hit yourself over the head.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And feel the pain.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's amazing when weirdly you apparently inside that is. I think one of the bad things about my outlook is that I think it's ... maybe I just to blame it on something, (inaudible) . Maybe it's an old Christian (inaudible) mea culpa (sp) mea culpa. Maybe that tradition is what made me who I am, because I think sometimes I never feel better than when I'm downing myself. There's really nothing more (inaudible). Look what a retch I am. At the same time I'm doing that, there's a certain part of me that because of that I can see myself in the lowly transcending certain baser instincts and saying that I know that I'm really a sinner. But the mere fact that I know that and do I ever know it is a salvation of some sort.</p>

<p>So that sort of transcend my recognition of those others (inaudible) more humanistic and more oriented to things that work for them than flying in the face of reality and truth. The truth being that they're really retches too, but they don't recognize it and I do. So therefore I'm special in the eyes of God and in the eyes of myself. To me that .. I don't know where ... as I say, I don't know where this downing impulse comes from. Maybe (inaudible) . The other thing too is that when you do down yourself a lot and ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I down myself a lot, it does relieve you of a certain amount of responsibility.</p>

<p>0:48:51.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not trusting is (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not trusting (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're really feeling joyous and spontaneous (inaudible) . Certainly because you know you just really get into that (inaudible). ... how that always happens, but well you just really get into it. That's what I've done to date. Anyways there's the sense of when I do think negatively about myself, there's a certain enjoyment that's inherent (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it would be important to you to be aware of (inaudible) path and when your young you still step back and say, "Hey. I'm downing myself. I want enjoyment". And really look at that. (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think that's true. Again the difficulty is things are (inaudible) say ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things are very what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: These things are very easy to say and so much more difficult to effect. I suppose that's too demanding an attitude. I mean I'm not gonna go running out and say, "Ah ha. I've gotten you. It's written right here. See". (inaudible) This is ... I seen the words. So you got to make me, make me fall. (inaudible) too demanding attitude. So I (inaudible) . Right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the kind of things that you're tripping (sp) up, sometimes it takes a lot of (inaudible) . I don't expect my father to be curious like that. You know? From (inaudible) If you decide that you want to do more of this, (inaudible) . You know. (inaudible) make that decision.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think the one kind of true thing that I could do would be to try and start being self-effacing in conversations with others and be a little bit more assertive rather than let them get away ... in fact, making me (inaudible) . Maybe go around making (inaudible) you know to my own negation of myself. Maybe I ought to be more assertive. Sometimes that simple act of being assertive, whether you're right or wrong on the issues, is irrelevant. (inaudible)</p>

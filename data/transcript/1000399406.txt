<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Uhm, well I'm thinking about what, something I was thinking about during the day today, you know, after school.  And uhm, well, I guess it a—, it all just comes from the fact that I, at school today, I, I uhm, the feeling built up more and more, of you know, that I was just, well I put it in terms of being annoyed about various things, and then eventually, you know, that I was getting annoyed enough so I thought I would just explode.  And I finally did explode in a minor way, with the kids.  But I really wasn't mad at them.  I was really, in a way, annoyed at FLMZ, feeling she wasn't doing certain things she should have been doing.</p>

<p>And I really didn't stop thinking of it that way, uhm, until, w—, you know I mean, I was just thinking that she really wasn't doing some things she should have been, and uhm, so you know, I was kind of justified in feeling so annoyed.  Except I was out of proportion annoyed, and I don't know, I don't think I've felt quite this way for awhile.  And, and then later, when I was just thinking about it now, because uhm, when I got home I tried consciously to calm myself down, and not carry it over at home with FTM and with FSO, who had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>And then, uhm, well because tomorrow we're having parents' meeting, and various things.  I had to do the shopping today.  And FSO turned out to have taken a later nap today than usual, so it meant that I had less time for the shopping.  Uh, but then in a way, I wanted to be rushing and busy that way, because then it didn't leave me time to be feeling that I was about to explode.  You know, I could kind of direct that feeling into being rushed, and hurrying and having specific things to do.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then coming down here I was just thinking about it again, because in part, I was thinking well, (Clears throat) if this really annoys me that much with FLMZ, I've got to say something, so I don't feel that annoyed again.  Because it wasn't fair to the children.  Uhm, but she wasn't helping them do something that, that they needed her help, in a way, to do.  And, and I couldn't do it by myself, and so in the end I shouted, almost, at the children, and you know, sort of scared them into doing it without any extra help.</p>

<p>And uhm, I was thinking about it, and then I realized, well in a way the whole thing was my fault, because I've been aware of this problem with FLMZ before and I never really directly handled it.  I don't know, I guess uhm, just somehow, maybe partly because she'd been teaching a number of years before she'd even worked with me, I just assumed she'd know certain things about when you're working with some children, how you're watching what the others are doing, even if you're not actually directly with them, and various things of that sort.</p>

<p>Uhm, but I don't know how much I've really said anything specifically.  And something was said in a meeting by Mrs BBF, about, if yo—, you know, assistants especially not just being with one child, and forgetting about the others.  And I was very relieved when she said it, and I thought, "Oh good, FLMZ will listen to that and then I won't have to say anything."  Uhm, today that was partially what was involved in my annoyance, because she again was uh, becoming too narrow in, in her dealing with children, and then leaving too many unattended.  And, and too many for me to handle and be able to do anything constructive.  And uh, yet I, I have to just be able to speak to her.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then when I'm thinking about it, I realize well, the feeling probably was there.  I might have even spoken to her today, if I hadn't felt quite the way I did.  I might have taken time out when I saw what was happening, to go up and say, "FLMZ, please watch more children than your watching," or, you know, "Keep an eye on more than you are," or something.  I, I think by now, I would have done something more specific.  A—, but I realized I was just in this mood of uhm, kind of wanting to expl—, or feeling I might, and then wanting to explode over something like that, rather something else.</p>

<p>So then I began to think about what else.  And uhm, all I could think of is — I mean, obviously, I was trying to think about yesterday — and the only thing I could really think about, was uhm, the feelings that I had been talking about over FTM.  And just how I wanted to fit her in, or react to her, or whatever, and uhm, how I went home still trying to, I don't know, decide about that.  Except somehow, by the time I got home, there didn't seem to be any problem.  I don't know quite what, if I reached a decision or not.  But anyway, I, I just feel as if all I can think of is that I left, or had that question yesterday.</p>

<p>And anything else that uhm, (Sniff, Pause) well, I don't know if I can say anything else, I mean, I can think of some other things that we've talked about in the last few days.  But whether or not it was all yesterday, I just can't recall.  But I have this feeling of something uhm, anything I can recall, I have the feeling I wasn't, a—, I don't have the feeling of emotional involvement, right now.  And it's what I'm not recalling that I must have been very involved in.  And, and want to forget, and uhm, uhm, reacting in this way so that I will forget.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You said yesterday you were uh thinking, one thing you might be doing is sort of setting FTM up like a sister.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) Uhm, (Pause) I don't know, I, I'm, I know I said that yesterday, and I'm, I'm, not sure if the thing I'm thinking about now is what made me say that yesterday, though I, I do—, I feel disturbed about something in connection with my feelings toward her.  And uhm, I don't know whether it really is just basically that, you know, I could just use her to come between MSCZ and me, to you know, become more friendly with her, and, and therefore spend more time in being friendly with her, and less time with MSCZ when he's home.  Uhm, and whether that has something to do with the fact that I, you know, uhm, (Sigh) there's something about, if she were, if I turned her into a sister, then she'd really be a, obstacle between MSCZ and me.  Or uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Uhum, how?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, just s, some kind of a feeling of uh, I could easily slip into sort of, the two of us against, or, or, not a, I don't know if it's so much against MSCZ, but just, you know, we don't need him.  We, we can uhm, satisfy each other, whatever each other needs, without him.  (Pause)</p>

<p>In fact, I th—, I think the thing that is disturbing me the most is the thought that I'm reminded uhm, there's something there, and I do—, I don't know just what it is.  But I'm reminded of the time when I was uhm, particularly friendly with somebody at camp, and then I began to think, well, I'm, I'm, I could be close to having a lesbian affair with her.  And I don't know that I'm, you know, anywhere near that with FTM.  But there's something similar in this, uhm, my reaction to her that makes me think of that time, and — (Pause)</p>

<p>And there's something in all this that uhm, (Sigh) I don't know, I just find the lines very hard to keep clear.  And uhm, you know, to sort of give the directions and then go about the business that I have to do and not worry about whether we're being friendly.  And I don't, it's not even so much worrying well, I want her to like me.  I me—, I'm sure that's part of it, and therefore I have to take time now to be friendly when I really might want to be doing something else.  Or uhm — (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uhm, I, I don't know, I just have this feeling I'm not thinking of it completely clearly.  But again, it was ju—, I mean, I'm thinking still about if I'm trying to make FTM into some kind of a sister, or something.  And uhm, I was thinking in part, because I'm older, one of the feelings I know I've had, and this might be part of it, I don't know, but that uhm, I've felt very much that somehow I have to be older, and somehow be, you know, maybe it's act my age, or you know, be more experienced than she, or be more knowledgeable.  Or, I don't want to talk patronizingly to her.  But on the other hand, it's almost as if I come close to that because she's younger.</p>

<p>And uhm, and yet, I'm not just giving directions and then going about my business.  I'm mixing up — that I'm not being businesslike, I guess is what I was thinking, or, you know, keeping it. I'm, I'm getting kind of worried I'm going to be so nice and friendly, that pretty soon I'll communicate to her that I don't care, when I really do, because I won't have said that I really care.  And so of course that would be confusing to her.  And uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What do you mean that you won't care?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, well I guess I was thinking of specific things that, you know, she's just started, so there are going to be things she doesn't do the way I want her to, and she won't know that unless I tell her.  But in uhm, you know, sort of asking her to do it differently, when therefore I suppose I'm afraid I'll be criticizing.  Or even sometimes when she'll say, I didn't do something.  I don't know, like uh, I can't think of any example, except yesterday she hadn't done the dishes when I came home.  And, and, and I did ask her to do those.  I said it does bother me if I come home and they aren't done, even if you do plan to do them.  Because then it's just something I want done when I come home.  It makes me feel better.  But that's about the only thing I have said that she didn't do that she would do differently, and, and it was sort of an unusual circumstance.</p>

<p>But uhm, I don't know, today the vacuum cleaner was out.  Well, she was still doing some cleaning, I hadn't actually thought she would be, because I thought she'd only do it in the morning.  But it bothered me to have the vacuum cleaner out lying around.  You know, it seemed like that should be put away.  But I didn't say anything.  And uhm, then there were just some things that I've s—, when she said she didn't do, I just said, "Well that's alright."  Uhm, maybe partly because it was possibly an only time of it.</p>

<p>But uh, there's some quality a—, to our relationship right now, so that my, I want to say, that's alright.  And yet, pretty soon it won't be in my feelings.  But I won't have communicated that.  And I suppose a way, in a way, although I never felt quite this way with FLMZ, uhm, that's what ha, has happened, in that I've sort of implied things are alright that uhm, sometimes, that maybe I always don't think are right, but that sometimes really bother me.  And because I haven't been direct and said so, she doesn't know.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I don't know, I was just thinking again of this tr—, feeling of tension.  And I don't think it's because, it's probably not helped by having Parents Night tomorrow night.  And maybe some of the tension I felt today at school is because of, it was on my mind certain things I wanted to do today.  Uhm, and my one free time, sort of, sort of free time during the day, was immediately interrupted, and I, me—, I mean, it's sort of nobody's fault.  It was really nobody to be annoyed at (Sic).  But anyway, I was feeling a, generally annoyed, I guess.</p>

<p>And uh, it's just probably another thing that I, I am trying to not get into the same state I have other years over something like this.  And of course, I am still probably getting into it, to some degree.  But uhm, I don't know, I just have this feeling the tension is really coming from somewhere else that at this point.  I'm using school and the Parents Night and FLMZ, if I start thinking of it that way.  And then I'm not even sure but, that if I'm using FTM.  Although uhm, things are newer there, and so maybe there'd be more tensions, as a result.</p>

<p>But uhm, I feel as, almost as if, maybe, I, I don't know, today I feel as if I haven't quite gotten clear what it is.  But it's almost, I was just thinking, it's almost as if I'm struggling to be the one in charge, and that any minute, FTM's going to be the one in charge if I don't keep struggling to be the one in charge.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Coughs) Well, if she's in charge, and you're not, then what position does that leave MSCZ in?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Uhm, well, at first my reaction was sort of, well, nothing.  No position, really.  He's not part of this.  But then I was thinking, well but then, if she, if she's in charge, then she can take him away from me, if she wants.</p>

<p>ANALSYT:  Is she attractive?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, that's another one of the strange things.  In a way, no.  Uhm, I mean, she's not unattractive.  F—, she has scars on her face because she was in a car accident last year and her face went through the windshield.  And so she still has a number of scars.  They're not terribly noticeable, but uhm, they are a little bit.  And then the way she does her hair, she could be more attractive than she is.  I do—, she's nobody that I would ever fear MSCZ would find attractive.  And she's a bit uhm, I don't know w, what word to use, except sort of outdoorsy in her walk and in her movements, and so forth.</p>

<p>But th, there's a s—, there's something about her, I don't know whether it's her eyes — she has uhm, dark brown eyes.  Th, they're QEC eyes.  Uhm, I don't know if you know what I mean.  But they're sort of a very rich color, and, and soft, and there's something very attractive to me, I guess, about her eyes.  And that sort of is what I center on in this whole uhm, feeling that I was talking about a little while ago.  Of, of uhm, you know, almost feeling that potentially, you know, reminded of that other time that I thought that it was potentially a lesbian situation.</p>

<p>And uhm, (Pause) the only thing I think MSCZ would find attractive, mainly attractive about her, is that she seems to know what she's doing, and uhm, you know, to have a good deal of self-confidence, and stuff like that, which I know he finds attractive.  But, you know, in terms of her really being attractive and therefore, a threat to me, I don't think I really feel that at all, you know, realistically.  But then uhm, if this whole thing of who's in charge becomes unclear, uhm, then, then I don't know if I've thought this directly until I thought, "Well what would be the result?"  But that, then it does seem like it possibly b—, you know, could be a problem.</p>

<p>It's almost a th—, yeah, well in saying who's going to be in charge, and uhm, that she could take MSCZ away, it isn't even so much that, you know, she would seduce him, but just our roles would, not even reverse because she's not my child.  And it's probably partly that that's confusing me.  And she's not quite in the category that somebody like FDO was, who was, you know, much more, I mean her, her, all her life she will be much more, you know, i,i, in that kind of employ, than this girl.  I mean, this girl as I said I guess yesterday, is uhm, similar in background to me.</p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, mm, something I was going to say.  Uhm, but it, w, well, I think it is almost as if, well our roles would change enough, or it's not really reverse as I was saying, I guess, because she's not my child.  But that j—, just somehow she would be in charge, she would be like a mother figure telling me what to do, or making the decisions.  And I would just, in imagining what would happen, where would MSCZ be, I just imagine I would feel very much like a child.  And MSCZ and she would be the adults, and uhm, it's almost immaterial whether they would really, whether she'd really take him away from me.  But just simply, they would be the 2 adults, the mother, the father.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Immaterial?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, in a way.  Uhm—</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Hmm, I question that, because you've twice now indicated something that suggests you really think something more than that.  Because you speak of her QEC eyes.  And when you mentioned her before, in this problem about the roles, and her background, you compared her situation with you, to yours in the QEC family.  Now, the one thing that you have made abundantly clear over and over is, the central fact of that experience in PEC for you was that you thought that you were expected to be his mistress.  And I don't think you bring up those allusions to PEC without some reason.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  (Pause) I don't know, I hadn't thought of that.  I have actually thought, uhm, of the fact I once did s—, I don't know if I mentioned it yesterday, you know, thinking that in a way I'd done something similar to what she's doing now.  But I know I said it this morning, because she was talking about her sister who came here first, and came to PKW first, and got a job of this sort and then asked FTM to come out.</p>

<p>Uhm, but her sister is not happy where she is.  Actually, from the few things that were said, before anything was said about how happy she was or not, and how I was surprised that the sister hadn't, you know, complained, or said she wasn't happy, or something.  Because it sounded like the woman that she worked for really works her very hard, and is not very considerate.  Uhm, and MSCZ's already started joking about how they must think they've got a little slave.  Uhm, just from a few things, you know, was just kind of our feeling of it, our assessment.  And it turns out that we were right on some of it.</p>

<p>And when she was talking about it today, and was sort of, I don't know whether she was really kind of telling me, don't treat me that way, or whether she was really wondering what should her sister do.  And that this is a problem they're both trying to work out, right now.  But I was immediately thinking of my experience again, and how often things weren't talked about.  Not that all of it could have been because some of it I probably was imagining, or just not handling.  Because I, you know, when you say, well I thought I was expected to be his mistress, I'm sure the emotional content was that then.  Except if I think about it, and i—, wh—, and what he really is like, or as I recall him, the ABSD.  I know that, I don't, me—, I really don't think now that I would, that he really literally wanted me to be his mistress.  He just kind of wanted to uhm, flirt, I think, mainly.  And uhm, but anyway, thinking about having been in another family was very much on my mind, you know, that being in PEC, this morning when I was talking to her.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's also true, another thing I dismiss, that uhm, yesterday when I lef—, well, MSCZ was up by the time I left yesterday.  But, yeah, I'm quite sure it was yesterday, uhm, but FTM asked if he'd already gone.  Probably mainly just because she wanted to know who was in the house, and you know, maybe partly because she had to go into FS—, FSOZ's room.  So she probably wanted to know just what — our door was closed, but she didn't know that.  And uhm, well, I don't know why she asked, except I'd, it seemed like a s—, perfectly normal question.  And uhm, and yet at some point during the day, I don't know just when, I did think, well I wonder if, after I left, uhm, well I guess probably I was thinking, did MSCZ and FTM go to bed?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you said all day yesterday, you were covering up something.  This is what you're covering up, these fantasies.  I'm sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, on the other hand, it ju—, I don't know, it just seems like, how could I be more silly, to be thinking these things.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I don't feel as if I really understand why I've started thinking this way.  Uhm, because I ha—, I, I think I have the feeling, some of the things I've said, like being afraid I won't (Clears throat) make it clear who's in charge, and that, and that things will get reversed, and she'll be in charge, and I'll lose that kind of control.  Somehow uhm, I don't think that's then why I am afraid MSCZ and FTM will be going to bed together.  I think there's something else that then makes me feel I might lose control.</p>

<p>And then, I, I, I was thinking about, well with FDO, it was just different, maybe mainly because she was black.  Uhm, but she was from a different background anyway, and I, i—, you know, I don't recall ever having had these thoughts with her.  Uhm, I might have still had trouble directing her sometime, but that I don't think was quite the same thing.  And uhm, and then I thought, well with FMC, although FMC didn't l, live in, and maybe I can't even imagine it, because she didn't live in, so I don't know that I ever had these thoughts.  I can't recall.  But then I did, do now recall, there was a time when I was having trouble with the fact that FMX was living in.  Only I can't remember if MSCZ was involved.  I think it was more because she sometimes had boy friends over.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I d—, I guess I'm still trying to think of why I'd feel this way, particularly with FTM.  And uhm, just now, maybe because I just thought of it for the first time today.  But it just seems, it's uh very important, this whole structure of FTM and MSCZ being the adults in charge and me f, feeling like a little girl.  And then FSO, I don't know, I was just thinking, wondering, well, where does she come in.  It was almost like, well, I guess she'd just be younger, and uhm, somehow, there, too.</p>

<p>But uhm, I don't know, I, I think I'm wondering, well, do I almost wish that that would happen, so I could be, clearly, a little girl, not in charge.  Although then I think that when I was a little girl, I wanted to be in charge.  (Sniff, Sigh) In fact, I, well I never thought of it quite this way, but sometimes I know I have not handled FSO well.  And so I think, some of her bossiness, at times, which has caused her trouble in social relationships with other people, is because when she's been that way with me, I've let her get away with things that she really shouldn't.  Because I am sympathetic to feelings that I, you know, I'm maybe even reading in, but that I recall from being when I was a child, and — (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I, I'm thinking of this again, and it occurred to me a minute ago along with some other things.  And then, uhm, I realize I was thinking of it, probably, well, again, i, it's all part of what I wasn't admitting I was thinking when I was.  I don't know when I was thinking this.  But before, maybe before yesterday, and certainly, anyway, before today, coming here today, uhm, that MSCZ w—, uhm, Friday, when FTM had come, and everything was going nicely, and she seemed to be, she continued to seem to be nice and capable, and you know, the decision's continued to seem like a good one.  And both of us were feeling relieved, although I was feeling tensions over, you know, having to establish the new relationship and things that I hadn't even recognized.  But MSCZ, I think, was just feeling relieved to have the question settled, and so forth.</p>

<p>And uhm, he became extremely, I guess, a—, the word would be amorous, or I don't know, but I, I think I might have talked about how he wanted to make love.  And uhm, he was just in a very loving mood to me, and he wouldn't let me fight and destroy it, and uhm, he spoke about it later.  And, I don't know, it's just as if the fact we had settled the whole thing had created a very good feeling in him, and he turned that good feeling toward me.  Uhm, and I don't know quite how, when I was thinking of it at some point, either yesterday or today, that you know, just in what way I was thinking about it, I don't know that it wasn't totally, well, so he wouldn't turn to FTM, because look how he reacted.  But uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   As though you were reassuring yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well it does seem like in part that was it, but I don't know, I feel as if there was some other thing that uhm, well I guess I just can't understand why I, you know, exactly (Sigh) why I'm thinking all these things.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up. 
 
??</p>

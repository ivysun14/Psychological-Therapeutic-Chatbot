<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm doing pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In what way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In what way?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mentally I'm doing better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In what way?  How?  You still hearing voices?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are they saying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, they told me to take my life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And what are you thinking about that?  What, how strong are they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, they're getting stronger now.  Um, I felt that the medication was causing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh-uh, it won't do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you stop them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You stopped your medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, [PATIENT NAME] now don't do that.  Can you go back on your meds?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When did you stop them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About three weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you'll be getting little, a little wild about now, those voices have been getting worse, am I right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They should.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you getting depressed and everything else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just seems like a, it's not an itchy [INAUDIBLE].  It just doesn't seem to stop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Now, um, what people think causes this is brain inflammation, okay, just like you get inflammation when you hurt your elbow and this kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So like your brain gets inflamed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the medicines protect that so it heals, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it takes a long time to heal.  You know, it may take you three months, four months of taking the medicines every day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But what happens is you gradually get better over time.  I know a lady who one time, and you were on other medicines too, but she was on, I think she was on 600 mg or Lamictal and she was on about, um, I think 6 mg of Risperdal, and she was on an antidepressant, and she was on, um, a little bit of Adderall for ADD too, and, um, she was like that for, well, she was somebody who had been in the hospital like six or seven times and she had been, um, she had been a cutter, and she'd been, uh, just real impulsive and real problematic, and just had not gotten well in spite, in spite of lots of things, and we put you on really high doses of medications till her, uh, hands warmed up somewhat and she got to feeling better and a little bit better and more stable, but her mind didn't stop racing then.  She didn't stop hearing voices then, but we just kept her on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Eventually what happened was that everything began to slow down.  You know, it just takes a while, and then the voices went away, and then her mind stopped racing.  And all the other things went away, and we'd be able to take her off the medicine slowly, but surely.  And now she's on about 150 mg of Lamictal, and, uh, some Adderall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she's been like that for about three years, and stayed out of the hospital not having any troubles.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, she's doing fine now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's doing fine now, but that's the trick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See when you, when you stop the medicine, everything gets all inflamed again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, then you've got to put the medicine on and let it heal again.  So, it'll probably take, take a month just to get back to where you were.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, but you just got to get started on them again.  Can you do that for me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But what I did first was I took more than what I should have hoping that would help the voices stop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  It shouldn't do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I stopped that because that didn't help any—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I just stopped taking it all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, if you have, if you have concerns like that, those things happen, when you come in to the appointment, you can talk to me about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause there are other things we can do.  We can, we could adjust the meds up and down.  We can, we can get other things.  We can do, do other kinds of treatments.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, but let me know, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I won't, you know, we'll just work together on this thing, and if I tell you I think it'll help, I'll tell you if I don't think it'll help, I'll tell you that, but it'll, you know, the major thing is just to get on the stuff and stay on it and make sure everything heals up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then you, once you do that, then you can see where you're going, but it takes a while to, to, but you'll feel some difference here and there, back and forth.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, um, just like, just like when we had you on the Depakote, when we added Lamictal to it, you felt better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And, um, we added, I think the Paxil to start off with and you felt better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, that's what we do.  We just one thing at a time and we look for something that works for you, gets rid of this symptom or this one gets rid of that symptom and eventually you get rid of all the symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  It just seems you're putting me on too much medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm, I'm probably as concerned about that myself see, but right now, it's like anything else, if you've got somebody who has, um, acute attack of diabetes, you know, then people use large doses of, of, of insulin to get it all under control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And as time goes on, then they need less and less insulin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, then they get sort of a basis.  Same way with somebody who's got, who's got pneumonia, you may use an awful lot of antibiotics and anti, and anti—inflammatories and everything else to get that under control, but after you get it well, then you, you slide the medicines down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And this is the same thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I won't ever give you any more medicine than I think you need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what we'll do is we'll, what we do is we adjust medicines.  We like move it up a little bit and see what the effect is and if it works, we might see that does, might go a little higher.  If it's not working, we'll go back down to where we get a maximum effect, and then we'll try something else until we get everything fixed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  It's a little bit, not a little bit, but the main thing is, is we got to have patience.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  That's where it's at, patience.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  And we'll make your foot stop twitching too.  It'll make your hands, the hands no longer be reddish like right in there, see that?  That'll go away too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  But my mind racing, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.  We'll get that fixed too.  You just got to, you got to, you got to, you just got to stay on, stay with it.  Um, I remember one time, there was a lady who she had been on an older drug, Lithium, and she had been on that for about seven years.  That's all she took.  So one day she decided that that was, she was tired of it.  She had been on Lithium for seven years.  She didn't want to take it anymore, so she stopped it.  Only thing wrong with that was that she had some happy little receptors in there that the drug works on, just like, just like, uh, um, a combination lock.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or a lock like you, you use it on your car.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like the combination.  Well, it has those [INAUDIBLE] it had, it had got on there.  The medicine had got on there and hooked that, the right combination in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when they stopped it, then they had, the combination got undone and those receptors that it was working on all of a sudden came back full force.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it took, when we put her back on the medicine, it took about a year to get everything straightened out because she got, she got, everything just came back full force and then it took a while for it to calm down again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you got, that's sort of, that's the thing that happens.  You just have to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It seems like it's a never ending battle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you're right.  That's what life is a never ending battle, okay.  That's what we are.  We, we all fight and we all keep going, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"And, um, again, but the major thing is don't give up, don't change anything without telling me. "</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, but it is like that.  That's what we do.  It's a never ending battle and that's what, we're in this fight together, you and me, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we're not going to give up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, and we will get there.  It'll just take some time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's, how's, how's the therapy with you and, and, and [NAME OTHER] doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's going real well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's really helping me out a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, how about hubby?  Hubby giving you any grief to stop the medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, this was your idea?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He don't know about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He doesn't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I bet he does too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, he doesn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I bet he doesn't.  I bet he doesn't said anything, but I bet he's wondering.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get real quiet when you don't take your medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do I?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.  You get worried.  You get this frowned look on your face and your eyebrows come together.  And you, and you, and your thumbs twitch a lot, sort of do this all the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your leg goes twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when you're, and when you're on your medicine, doesn't do all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you can tell when somebody's not happy and that's what happens, you just got to, you get so you look unhappy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your face doesn't, doesn't light up, doesn't light up like it normally does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you, when you, last time you were on the medicine, you were, looked real happy.  Well, it has been a couple times before that you looked real happy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I guess maybe it was because I was taking the medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The right way, the way I was supposed to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Your complexion changes when you're not on your medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It looks a little, um, it looks a little bit more pale.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm just saying that cause this is, this is a physical disorder.  It's not just something that, uh, you can control by, by mind thinking or prayer or anything like that.  It's a physical thing and you have to use the medicines that the Lord gave us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's true.  I always thought by prayer too, you know, you can, the Lord will heal you, will heal me and I won't need all that medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Then I'd be out of a job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, you will be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so I have to, that's why the Lord made me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't, I don't think he directly, you know, [INAUDIBLE] as much as he did in the past.  There are just too many of us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But he has made people that are helpers and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if we didn't have, uh, that's, he's made us to help, he's given us the tools to help, so that's what we do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what, a lot of people will tell you oh, if you just had faith and you just prayed enough, uh, all this would go away, but they ain't got the illness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what they tell me too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, but that's, but they don't have that illness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, so I can tell you all sorts of things if I don't, if I don't have any, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's sin in my life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, like what kind of sin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why the Lord won't heal you when there's sin in your life.  You have to get the sin out of your life before he'll heal you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And sometimes you don't know what the sin is and you have to pray about it to find out what the sin is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the only sin I know about was taking those amphetamines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you stopped that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, see.  So, um, and you went to jail and all kinds of other things, or, or got punished for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yes I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds to me that's sort of evened the score.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it seems like it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyone call you from [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What'd they say?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I haven't called them back.  I got to call them back.  I'll, I'll talk to them, just haven't had a chance to [INAUDIBLE].  That was so hard on you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Excuse me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was hard on you being away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, extremely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what [NAME OTHER] said.  Um, okay.  Well, we got to do this, uh, can you go back on your medicine please?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think you have to.  I think you'll get well.  And some, and, and some people will tell you things with the best intentions—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But not knowing exactly what they're talking about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they'll tell you to get off your medicines and that sort of thing.  There's a difference between, between physical illness and, and, uh, a sorrowful heart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And getting right with the Lord oftentimes will help as far as the heart, but it doesn't always help with the physical ailment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I agree with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.  So, um, in your case, in order to get help with one, you got to get the other helped too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  But they do give them at church and stuff, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They tell me you just need to believe and go up and get anointed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And all that will the help the sickness in the heart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, but it doesn't always help the sickness in the body.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know want to tell you that, but sometime it does and sometimes it doesn't, but, uh, for the most part, it doesn't, and you'll have a better shot of getting everything done on the medicine than off the medicine because being off the medicine makes your heart sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Sometimes I agree with you on that, [PHYSICIAN NAME] and sometimes I don't, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It all depends on where my mind is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And come in here and talk to you and I leave and I'm thinking well yeah, he's, he's correct, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he can follow through with what he's telling me, and then a couple of hours later, I think totally the opposite.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, so it's like up and down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does your, does your husband help you with these medicines at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes it does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How do you sneak by without him not, you're not taking them what he's going to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He just give them to me, he don't know if I take them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He doesn't watch you take them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.  Well, you know, that's why I had you on the shot at one time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that seemed to help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't think it did, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're on Risperdal, aren't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  [INAUDIBLE] shot for that.  Let's talk about it, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, at least try to take your medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I'll try to figure out a way to make sure you do take them because if you do, it'll help you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I can get you to take your medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, don't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause I'll take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but take it, then you don't take it.  [INAUDIBLE] watch you take it, I won't tell him why.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, don't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It'll cause more trouble.  We're getting along just fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'd get along even better if you took your medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We've been getting along real well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if you say that, you're only going to go blow everything out of proportion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, [PATIENT NAME] I made enough money off of you.  I don't want you to go back in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, I know that.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going to take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, will it be okay if I talk to [NAME OTHER] about this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You can talk to [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and I'll see about getting, getting you a Risperdal shot so I can get, get, uh, your doctor to do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause I seem to follow through with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.  And that gives you more, more stability.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, I'm going to find out about that today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Meanwhile, take your medicine, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can get your hands to warm up, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't have any medicine left though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got rid of all of it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my Lord, girl.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  All right, you taking your, your Topamax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not even Topamax.  Whoa.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to have a seizure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel I'm healed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel you're healed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, and I have been for a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, is that why your hands are red like that?  Huh, and that why your foot's twitching like that?  It just never stops.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It stopped now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You, you're aware of it, that's why you stopped it.  Um, why don't we go ahead and I'll call this in for you, these medicines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and I'll talk to [NAME OTHER] and I'll talk to them and I'll try to get the, the Risperdal in, but you got to get that, you got to get the Topamax in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause you don't want to have a seizure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so I'll call you this evening and, and we'll, and we'll see if you've taken your medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll call you this evening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, you can talk to me.  [NAME OTHER] won't be home anyways.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He won't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's going for a bike ride.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you hearing voices telling you you're healed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  I am healed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And also hearing voices to tell to kill yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Doesn't make any sense, does it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does it make sense to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it doesn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why I know it's just the devil and his demons that are working on me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can I, okay.  Can you let, will you let me interfere, will you let me intervene on the side of the Lord?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Go ahead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That's what the medicine's for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, that's what the medicine's for because it keeps all that other nonsense out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't been sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sure of that.  I'm sure of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause I'm afraid something's going to happen in the middle of the night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do we need to go back in the hospital?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm sure, I ain't going there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, I got to talk to your husband, okay.  I got to, to ensure you get your medicine and so we don't have any, so everything gets better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] it's just going to cause a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it won't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it won't.  No, it won't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's hardheaded.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know he's hardheaded and so are you and so am I, but I know what, I know in the long run it'll help, okay, cause if you stay on the medicine, you'll, you'll get better and better and better.  If you get off of it, you have a relapse, but I think if we can get shot, I think that'll make, make the world of difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I didn't think it was much help, but it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, I'll call, I'll call doctor, the doctor today and we'll see if I can arrange that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can you over there today and do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  All right, I trust you on that.  Can I trust you on that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, you can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  All right, it's a deal.</p>

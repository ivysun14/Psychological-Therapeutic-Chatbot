<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, you got caught in that - did you get caught when the road was blocked off?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not going north, but coming south I saw all of it. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right, it was all northbound wasn't it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like it was pretty bad. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was, I mean, it looked really nasty with cars underneath trucks. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that's scary. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ugh.  Well, other than blizzards how have things been going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Doing pretty good. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty good. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And spirits have been okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they've been doing real good. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had one manic episode and that was just kind of a, I don't know, well, I would call it a manic episode because of how much I end up spending</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, just kind of in the excitement with getting my job. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, now where are you gonna be working?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's called [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'll be doing [DEIDENTIFIED] bookings for missionaries and nonprofit groups. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it a [DEIDENTIFIED] company?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, it's based out of [DEIDENTIFIED], but they have an office here in the [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  So you'll be actually working at their office then?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Making the [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that should be interesting because it's all over the world I assume then right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah, yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you start next week, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, on Monday. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Have you ever done anything like this before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have, but just domestic travel.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mostly, what I had done was mostly just to [DEIDENTIFIED].  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I just started being trained as a travel agent so that's why I was only doing [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, so this will be a whole different system than what I was used to anyway, so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It will be like starting from scratch, but that's okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because they're willing to train me.  The pay's not the greatest, but I figure after being out of the workforce for a year and a half, they pay pretty decent. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, just to get back in the workforce, that's easier to move around if you want to. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly, exactly.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it's full-time, forty hours a week?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's about five minutes from my house. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that's nice. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, that's good. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, excellent.  So that one manic episode that you had, how long did it last?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, about a day and a half.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I probably ended up spending close to $1000 by the time I got done with my shopping sprees. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what kind of things did you buy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, mostly clothes, just new stuff that looked good for going back to work.  Make-up, shoes...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and are there things that you kept or did you take them back or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I kept everything. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, all right and did it create any problems at home with your husband or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Doesn't know about them yet. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, it hasn't caused any problems yet. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not yet, but the rest of my spending has been really good and last month was really good, so</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It really, it should only create just a little blip, I think. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, and it sounds like it's things you can use.  I mean you had the weight loss and you probably needed some new clothes, didn't you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, no because I cleaned out my closet and gone through my closet and I'm getting back into stuff so I really didn't need what I bought, but I wanted it. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I understand.  Have you been sleeping okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not particularly.  I mean, that's been a rough one.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been having trouble getting to sleep or are you waking up during the night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Both, mostly getting to sleep.  I mean, it's like I can be absolutely exhausted and so the eyes are, the brain's not turning off. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and I think the last time we talked you weren't using CPAP.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you using it now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm completely off of that.  That's been resolved.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, the sleep apnea's gone now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I didn't know that, that's great. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's been totally resolved.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> With the weight loss do you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Terrific.  And how much have you lost, do you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 45. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good for you. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> As of yesterday, the official was 25. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Since you went in the hospital it was 45. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow and that's-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Since the middle of July. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, July, August, September, October, November, December, January, February so that's seven and a half months? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great and what's your - how close are you to your goal?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm just about halfway.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, all right, well you're doing really well.  Any problems or complications?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not from their standpoint - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Had issues with staying on the program and eating foods I'm supposed to be eating and not going back to the way that I was eating.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's tough, not to go back to the old habits. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And is it primarily the quantity or the types of foods?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The types of foods. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sweets and carbs or-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's mostly the carbs and the white foods, you know, the white breads, white potatoes, the white rice - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That type.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, they want me more on what I'd call an Atkins type of diet, you know, Because more protein and your fruits and vegetables for your carbohydrates rather than breads and pastas...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And sweets. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, has your appetite been pretty level or has it been high?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, it really depends on the day, um, as to where it is.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I just had another filled yesterday.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that will help with the appetite control. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.  How's your energy level these days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been pretty good because I've been exercising. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, how often? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, well the doctor just released me to go back to exercising two weeks ago, so I've been trying to get there three days a week, about an hour each time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> An hour or hour and a half, somewhere in there. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, what are you doing?  Walking the treadmill or? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No I'm biking for about 20-30 minutes and then just, I guess it's the resistance weights and stuff like that for the rest of the time and stretching and swimming. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, excellent. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're doing real well with exercise it sounds like. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's your concentration or focus these days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been pretty good. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty good. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Any problem with anxiety recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Out of the ordinary or more than you'd expect?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, are you getting some pleasure out of these day to day activities or do you just kinda go through the motions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right now, I'm just kinda going through the motions.  I mean, some days are more than others, like my husband was on a business trip so while he was gone the anxiety level was a bit higher.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But then when he got home then it was like the pleasure set in because he was back. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure, all right and have you had any times in the last month or two where you felt suicidal at all? Have you gotten really down in the dumps. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I haven't gotten that low. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  So you're mood has been pretty good most of the time it sounds like, except that one day and a half where it went pretty high. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, what about stresses?  You're starting a new job, your husband's traveling for work, any other stresses?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, just still with you know, we still have the grandkids every weekend</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So we still have that stress, you know, but at least it's relieved during the week so we don't have to worry about that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old are they?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The twins are [AGE] and then the oldest one is [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You got your hands full. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have them from when until when on the weekends?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Saturday morning about 7:30, 8:00 in the morning until Monday morning. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's every weekend?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Every weekend, yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Until about 6:30 in the morning when they take them to school. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's - I'm just thinking for your - I mean that's every weekend, you don't get a break now, do you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not really. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And when you go back to work you're really not going to get a break. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Although, well, I don't know, your being at work will be a break, I don't know.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It might be, but, yeah right now, on Mondays though it's kind of a big stress because my daughter's car is not working so I have to take the kids to daycare, take her home and then come back home and we did do a trial run last week to see the timing and everything that we need to get out of the house by so I can get to work on time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so that's gonna work out, but that means having to be at 5:30 in the morning to be out of the house by 6:30.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, no. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what time are you going to bed at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that's the problem, you know, a lot of times it's not until midnight or one in the morning. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I worry about you not getting enough sleep. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That could be rough on you, if you can't get to sleep I mean... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you - you're not taking anything for sleep right now are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No I'm not.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel like you need something to help you sleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Probably, at least to get there.  I mean, because even when I wake up I'm only up for about a half an hour or forty-five minutes and then I can go back to sleep. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I was looking back to see why we stopped Lunesta, if it didn't work or if you had side effects. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it just didn't seem to kick in fast enough. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well the fastest is Ambien.  Have you ever taken Ambien?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, but that - what about the CR?  The new CR?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The CR is the same medicine it's just longer acting so it tends to not be quite as good at getting people to sleep, but it helps keep them to sleep maybe an hour or two longer. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What happened when you took the Ambien before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just took like an hour and a half to two hours to kick in. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, that's unusual.  It may just be that your body is absorbing things slower.  I mean you could take it an hour and a half to two hours before bedtime if you wanted to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If it takes so long to kick in. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, well let's try it. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Want to try it?  Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me get you a prescription for - was it 5s or 10s?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Probably the 10s.  Yeah, the stronger one. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, if it's too strong, you could always break it in half. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I'm also low on my Lexapro. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So, Ambien. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I'm on my last prescription with that last refill... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With the Lexapro. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll put down a month's worth with a couple refills and we'll see if it's working and if you need more we can issue more.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay because that's always been the hard part is getting to sleep.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and that's rough too. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They just had a report on CNN, I think it was, or NBC that a new study came out that found that sleep is just as important for our health as our diet and exercise and if people don't get enough sleep it really has negative consequences for their health, so... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, especially with me going back to work.  I mean, right now, with not working, I've been able to sleep in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know and kinda make up for that time. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know instead of sleeping from say 10:00 until 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning, you know, it's like going from midnight to 10:00, 10:30 in the morning. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's kinda rough. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's not gonna work well with going back to work and having to be there at 8:30 in the morning. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No. So your day starts at 8:30 and you finish - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At 5:00. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At 5:00, okay.  You get a half hour for lunch?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And you feel like Lexapro is working okay without any side effects? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah that and the Abilify are both working well. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I figure one little maybe a blip and no depression is doing pretty good for me.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That is pretty good and it sounds like it was short-lived. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it may have been triggered by the excitement of the new job. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you said your husband was out of town. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And the Abilify, looks like your still okay with refills? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm still fine with that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I'm going to give you the Lexapro and Ambien prescriptions. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any problems with any of the medicines that you are aware of, any side effects, dry mouth, constipation?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have a little bit of a problem with constipation, but that's due to some pain medication that I'm currently on for my knees.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, oh, okay, what are you taking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oxycontin.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Extended release. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think that's what it is.  Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And like both your knees are giving you trouble?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I had my right one replaced in January so I'm still coming out of all that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it getting better?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah, yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I only have to take it at night, so. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And the left one, how's it doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that's what I had replaced was the left one, but the right one's doing real good. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I don't have any problems with that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So did they tell you that they thought eventually you'd be able to get off the Oxycontin. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I should within the next month. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because of how far I'm down already.  I just need it really at night just to help with the pain everyday.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  The only other thing I'm thinking is sometimes pain medicines help with pain, but they interfere with sleep.  I don't know if that's affecting your sleep or not, but if it is, the Ambien should still help, I hope.  It may not be perfect, but I hope it will help and then maybe when you get off Oxycontin in the next month or so you may start sleeping better and the Ambien may be more effective too. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The other thing to be aware of is if the Oxycontin makes you tired, if you have an additive effect with the Ambien where it makes you even more sleepy. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you get kinda tired with the Oxycontin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not at all.  No. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, hopefully that won't be a problem, I just didn't want you to be like sleeping until noon the next day or something with it, but Ambien usually is out of your system by morning anyway and again especially if you're going to take it an hour and a half to two hours before bedtime if you need to. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The only thing I caution you about that is, if you do take it don't drive or do anything like that.  I've had some patients that took it and tried to stay up and clean or do other things and then get kind of spacey. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So just be careful if you take it and you don't go to bed right away. I just don't want you to fall and hurt yourself or anything like that. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, good.  Anything else going on I haven't asked you about? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not really. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like you're doing pretty well overall. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's encouraging and you got the new job to look forward to, hopefully that'll be fun and exciting.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah, it will be.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because you'll be dealing with airlines and hotels, too?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hotels and cars.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And rental cars all over the world?  Well... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, all over the world, I guess. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean a lot of them have companies here, but some of them might not have companies here, so. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it's all over the computer I assume these days? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're pretty comfortable with computers?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yes, I'm comfortable with computers, so - it's just a matter of learning this new system. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which I've already been warned by a girlfriend of mine who works at this company that it takes a good six months before you get real comfortable with it. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So she said don't stress out about it.  You know? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like good advice. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah so. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She said that, you know, she's been there a year and she still asks questions about, you know, making travel arrangements. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's got to be a lot to learn, I would imagine. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But a little bit of time and you'll soak it up. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, good.  Well anything else you wanted to talk about today before we set up an appointment? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nope, not really. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Now the next question is when should we meet again? Starting new job and all? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now, do you have extended hours?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I have - you're going to be working 8:30 to 5:00?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have - on Friday mornings, I typically come in at 7:30 so we could either do an early Friday or I do have some days where I have an appointment at 5:00 or maybe I'll set a 5:30 time if that would work. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where are you going to be working? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, right by the shops at [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, so 5:30 would work beyond 5:00?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, 5:30 would work. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me see if I can find a 5:30. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Whatever, 7:30 I could also do?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me get my book I must have left it in my desk.  And the next question too [PATIENT NAME] is when should we check in?  You're doing pretty well.  Do you want to go a few months or do you want to check in sooner?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I think like either between three and six months. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That would be fine.  You can always call sooner if you need anything okay?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's see, this is February, no this is March, so April, May, June, that is, September, so more of the summer. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that works. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excuse me.  Let's see now. Do you know if you're going to be off anytime or have any plans to be out of town. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, just Memorial weekend. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But that's just a couple months away. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So something like mid-July maybe?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and do you have a preference for 7:30 or 5:30?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Doesn't matter. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How does [DATE] at 7:30 sound?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And if something comes up in your schedule just call me and we can always rearrange. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that's Friday, [DATE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A good day. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right, good luck day.  Okay.  Can you read my writing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like I said if there's anything you need before then, please call me.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But good luck with the job.  I hope it goes smoothly and it's fun. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yes, I'm sure it will be.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like it will be a real fun job. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, [PATIENT NAME]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, thank you. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You better take care of yourself. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, bye. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bye-bye. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Scheduling next week. I wondered if you could come in earlier in the week just for next week. I could do either 4:45 or 5:30 on Monday. If neither is good, I can absolutely still do our usual times. It's not a big deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, 4:45 on Monday is good. I mean 5:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean 5:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that alright? Did (inaudible) [00:00:43]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What? It's supposed to snow again? Yeah, 5:30's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Uh, thanks. And I will associate (ph) 5:30—</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, instead of 4:30 on Friday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Sounds great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty flexible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cool. Uh, so I got my tax returns.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think last time when we were talking I was kind of just going back and forth and what we're going to do them (inaudible) [00:01:26] my mom to help pay off, that she helps pay the car (inaudible). So I spoke to my mom, so I got my taxes done—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I paid $125.00 which kind of hurt a little because like I've never paid to get my taxes done. We'll let TurboTax, but it's like $30 bucks or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I realized that I was paying to be able to just sit there while she did my taxes and asked me questions as opposed to like circling through the TurboTax or doing it on paper with my father who likes to wait until like July to do it because he files for an extension or I don't know what the hell. But anyway, I'm not going to tell my father that I did that because I know that he'll just go like "why are you paying somebody this blah, blah, blah?" And last year I went to a Community College and it has like a program where they, if you make under $50,000, you can get your taxes done for free.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was ugly. But now I make over $50,000 which is great. But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So but anyway, last year (inaudible) [00:02:20] I got my tax return, talked to my mom. She said that she's basically, you know, she's put some other stuff on my card, too. She's in Texas right now in South Padre Island with a friend who's in her like Friday night AA meeting that she's known for many years—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - whose friend has a beach house and she goes every year for two months with my mom. Anyway, so I'm really happy for her that she's there and I talked to her. She's having a great time. She called me today and held the phone up to the ocean to, you know, (inaudible) [00:02:45].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you mom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I asked her and she basically said, "You know (inaudible) [00:02:50] I don't know what to do. I'm kind of battling because the truth of the matter is even with this $1,400 return that I'm getting, if I were to put that directly toward credit cards I'd still kind of be like in the red, like paycheck-to-paycheck like struggling to catch up, having to implement my line of credit at the bank", blah, blah, blah. She said in terms of the credit card stuff and the car stuff, she's paying it off $500 a month. It'll be paid off soon enough and she's not, she said let's just talk about it later. So that's great and that's very nice of her. I mean, she's paying 1 percent so it's not, you know, it's really hardly anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I spoke to Franklin about, you know, what to do with my tax return, how to, and we made the decision to just leave it in the bank account for now and to—and for me honestly making that decision felt like a weight was lifted off my chest because it just, it will allow us to not feel pressured and not feel like we're completely broke all the time and allow us to feel comfortable with this new budget that we're trying out and you know, you know we already have people, we're paying what we're paying on the cards, we have this, you know, whatever foresight about how long it'll take. And honestly, making the decision to be able to not have to worry about the line of credit going into it, not have to worry about it going negative and getting bank fees, not have to worry about any returned checks sort of, whatever. It just feels so good. So I'm really happy with that decision.</p>

<p>Franklin, I'm not sure how much he'll get back. He thinks like a decent amount. I mean I have no idea. But I'm sorry this is—and uh, but he's getting divorced on March 20.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Franklin?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. You knew he was married. No. Are you serious?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't tell you this? I really can't imagine not. But anyway—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. He's been married for like a few years because he was with this girl that's from Romania and she basically, they were like getting close and then it was like, "Oh, my visa." And like I think, I don't know what his mentality was. I think his mentality was he's 25 and like kind of in love and smitten and whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also his older brother had done this with his girlfriend. She was an Brazilian woman and his oldest brother. I mean there's no good example regardless but I think maybe he, you know, had on his brain like no big deal who also did this married for kind of green card thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he agreed to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now like fast forward six months, they hate each other. So anyway, so when we got together he had moved back into the apartment that was still in their names together because she was still doing the green card process because he couldn't afford to live where he had been living. I don't know. Sleeping in separate rooms or whatever. There's been this whole big battle because I don't know why she's been dragging her feet. I think she was a little bit resentful, but I also think that she's just, was involved, she was involved with another guy who's taking her traveling all these places. She has her citizenship now. She kind of just wasn't making moves on it.</p>

<p>So this has kind of been like this point of contention, I mean as you can imagine, I'm sure, our entire relationship. And it's been really difficult. Anyway finally they're going to court on March 20<sup>th</sup> and that's that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like and it's taken forever and I understand that (inaudible) [00:06:19]. And I think the other thing was she was paying for it obviously because I mean like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whatever. But then she said that he owed her money for rent and he owed her money for rent. Whatever. Stuff that I really didn't care to get involved with. I was just kind of like get divorced, like if we're talking about—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - if we're talking about marriage like that needs to happen first. Of course I told my mother about it. She told my father and my father told my uncle and I was like "what the fuck, like and I told my mom, and I told my mother please don't tell anybody like. And she told my father and I was, and then my father was upset that I was upset that she told him. "Like what are talking about. Of course she's going to tell me." And I was like not when I asked her—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - like as her adult daughter not to like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then my uncle? It's like why do you need to tell my uncle who's already judgmental. Anyway, so they all know about it and it's been this whole "well if you're thinking about marriage, you know, he needs to figure that out, you know. He made a stupid decision" blah, blah, blah. And it's like okay, like thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway so he can't do this to, the reason I'm saying this is because he can't do his taxes until this divorce is finished. Because if he does his taxes before their divorce I guess they have to resubmit all of their information because they have to get their tax information and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I don't know how divorces work obviously so, so anyway so he's not going to be able to do his taxes until after the 12<sup>th</sup>. I am going to encourage him to go that weekend because he can still go to the community college and get it done for free. And when we get that money I think that we'll be in a better position to make a decision about what we're going to put towards credit cards.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:07:48].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, anyway so that really had, is not like a big thing that's on my mind. It's just like something that I felt like sharing, I guess. Like there's a bigger issue though okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've, I, so last night I met up with a friend of mine who I have known since kindergarten like. But we fell out of touch but then we got back in touch on Facebook and she lives like around the corner from where I work. So we went and met up. She has a 3-year old which is like crazy to see (inaudible) the last time you see somebody is like crazy person in high school that you're not really friends with anymore. No problem. You're in the limo in prom because I was dating her uncle which sounds weird but he's actually younger than us. She has really like, very—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - older siblings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Siblings, correct.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, oh wait. No, her mother. No, no, her grandfather—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:08:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Her, right. So anyway, so the last, to see somebody the last time—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - is like the end of prom and then now she's like a good mother, like we're going to pick up her son and she's like talking to the teacher and like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - buying him dinner. Like it was just like a reality check.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway so we go there, so I go there to hang out and then Franklin was at practice so I said for him to come up and you know, say hello after. She lives with her now boyfriend, not her son's father. They are not together anymore, I guess. Wait where am I going with this. Well, okay. Here's what the problem is. Sometimes, sometimes I get embarrassed about how much and how loudly Franklin talks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I started stealing that and like I felt it a few other times like "My god, do they think he's like a crazy person? Do they think he's really annoying? Do they think he's like way too loud?" And like I'm not necessarily sure if they do but it makes me nervous because I'm like, is this like a big problem? Like is it, or is this just like me like being self-conscious for my partner like, or, or—</p>

<p>And like it's not something that I could ever say to him because it would make him feel really bad for no reason, I think? You know what I mean? I mean it's not like anybody's like "gosh, your boyfriend's so annoying", like everybody loves him. I mean, you know, as far as I know, whatever, you know, or can tell. But maybe, maybe the reason that it, I feel that way is because it annoys me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then that's what's a little scary. Like I really, he was like, and I, he was venting last night because this, her boyfriend is also in customer service. And they starting talking about it (inaudible) [00:10:20] hate the job, blah, blah, blah. They started talking about it because this guy works in an customer service job for the state and had mentioned that they might have a position opening soon. (Coughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Coughing) Which would be awesome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, but he just got into this whole (Coughing) venting thing about it and at a certain point I really was on, like in my head I was "my god shut up". Like, but maybe this was because I cared a lot. Or maybe not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, uh what annoyed you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He kept giving examples of like situations that suck at work. And like in my head I'm like "Okay already. We get it." Like ooooo, like that (inaudible) [00:11:07] my head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He just like kept going on about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kept going on about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As far as you were concerned, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then, and he was loud. I mean I think he's just loud in general.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like we were like sharing a bottle of wine; me, Jillian and Franklin. Her boyfriend doesn't drink. And so I think he gets a little louder and more talkative—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - when he drinks which I think, you know, everybody kind of does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: True.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And him and Jillian like then started drinking like some mixed drinks that I wasn't, I was fine. So then, whatever like—and (inaudible) [00:11:43] they didn't seem annoyed. They were sitting there like listening and "oh wow that sucks," oh he's not getting all blah, blah, blah. But I was really annoyed like, well maybe it's really because I literally hear this all day, every day. Like this is all day, every day that he comes, gets in the car or gets home, he's talking about this, what happened with this guy and this guy's an idiot and this is another (inaudible) [00:12:03]. It's like I think maybe it was more about like he was like telling us—</p>

<p>I think also it had to do with him feeling comfortable talking about things with her boyfriend who knows what kinds of situations happen in this position because he's in customer service—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and does research. And you know it was like oh, and listen to this time, this is so ridiculous, oh and oh my god can you believe. And you know the guy, this guy Phillip was "Oh my god, yeah, I can imagine. Oh yeah, that happens to me sometimes" you know. So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean maybe it's just because I hear it all the time. But like is it bad of me? Like is that a bad girlfriend like, or like maybe like fiancé or wife move to like get in the way of that kind of stuff. Like should I be able to like endure it for like that long? I don't know. (Laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why am I feeling like a little unsure? But wait. It continues because then we get in the car and I had asked him the thing, the tank was like on empty—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well like we have a little thing that like flashes and it tells you how many miles approximately you have—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - before you're like really going to die?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so in the morning—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Running out of gas?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which isn't quite the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. But, no I mean the car. Like the—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, you know. So it's flashing in the morning on yesterday. And it was like flashing like 18. So I said "Listen. Can you do me a favor? On your way home", no. " On your way from work to practice, can you fill, can you put some—"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: " - can you get some gas on your credit card", I mean whatever. "Sure". So we get in the car after Jillian's house and (inaudible) [00:13:35] he started the automatic started like to warm it up. And we get in the car and I'm like "You didn't", I was like "Franklin, I was like 'what happened'? You didn't get gas." And he was like "Oh I know, well because you know it wasn't all the way like on empty." His idea of all the way on empty is when the needle is like all the way to the little—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - stick that holds the needle up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like we just got $2,000 worth of work done on this car. It's cold. Like granted if we can drive it for that much longer like I don't want to. Like why would we? Like why would we run on fumes if we don't have to?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it—and so I got kind of irritated. And then he says—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you did ask him to get gas and he said he would.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And his thing was, "Well I didn't have a chance—". No. His thing was that well it wasn't all the way on empty. And so, so this started a huge fight because then he says, "Well I didn't think that we'd stay there that late so I figured we could get it on the way home." I immediately like jumped to defense which probably was a mistake, like I should have probably planned out what I said better and he actually said this and he like maybe be more strategic with what you say before you say it or think about it—and I said, well this is not that bad though, and I said, "Well I didn't, well you were enjoying talking so much though."</p>

<p>But then in his mind that was me saying, in his mind that was me saying "Well you were", you know, "It's your fault." But I kind of was saying that. Because he was talking his head off like granted I could have said like, "Okay, like time to go." Like he was literally non-stop talking, non-stop talking once like he got into his whole thing in talking to this guy about the customer service. And also he could have been like "Okay, well look, we've got to get going." Like why do I have to be the freaking timekeeper like? And then instead for him it's like well, I'm at your, I'm at this, I'm there because you asked me to come and you wanted me to meet your friend and (inaudible) [00:15:43] I'm like okay fine. But like, like whatever that it was a dual effort and it's like I have to like defend myself and do like "I didn't mean that" because I didn't want to start a fight. I was like "Oh I just meant this is why we ended up staying late, because everybody was having a good time and like no big deal."</p>

<p>But he was really pissed and then I was really pissed and whatever. Like I was like "Okay, like sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel like it was your fault. I just meant whatever and I thought you had gotten gas before, like." But it made me feel really frustrated because it's like he's not, I, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know (inaudible) [00:16:17]. So then this morning what I said to him was "Listen babe, I just want to, just one more thing about last night. I'm not trying to judge you about it but the reason why I had asked you to get gas on your way home, on your way to practice was because of all the work that we just got put in. The car's in really good shape and it's really cool that I just don't want to be driving it like all the way down to empty. So that's all, that's why I had asked you to get it before."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were concerned about it damaging the car and costing you more money—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Correct.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - if you're driving on empty and—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Correct.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he said "Okay". And that was that. And we went and got gas because we didn't get it on the way home because we were like arguing in the car on the way home. But I guess it just kind of (pause), I don't know. Made me feel like nervous about like, like the both of those feelings of like, well like the (inaudible) [00:17:12] of like being annoyed with him like talking so much. I don't know. Like it just makes me like there are moments where like I'm nervous that I like, like if it—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you get really nervous when you feel like something isn't right, like he talking too much and that you aren't going to like it, or he's being a little socially, I mean inappropriate or uncouth or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's going to reflect badly on him like, "I mean I know I was sort of, I don't know, maybe like really a little bit or something that I said like, you know, what have I said about you're not going to die from running out of gas—</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but I think it can feel a little bit like that—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you know there's a problem whether it's you know, a bounced check or probably talking too much for (inaudible) [00:18:04] taste or running out of gas. Like I'm not all saying those might not be problems. I mean I, I think I get it like you don't him to want to make a bad impression on people. It's bugging you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, uh I don't know. Maybe it could damage the car if you're driving around on fumes. Like I'm not, I'm not, I don't know—</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I don't know either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I don't want to discount any of that but I think there's like a kind of general way that you get really worried about things not being right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That I think that part of what you're reacting to. In other words, I think, and he sometimes reacts to being anxious that way by being madder or critical and again, I think you have a right to criticize him, like you ask him to do something, he said he would do it, he didn't do it like you had a reasonable reason for it you know like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would you be mad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand. I think that there's sort of maybe one dimension of it as well where like—I guess, this is probably really where I'm going. Part of what it seems to me that bothers you is when you don't feel like you're in the control as you'd like to be of your reactions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You start to feel like maybe you're not doing something right if you get mad at him or if you like about the talking or about the gas. You don't feel like you can necessarily think it through carefully. And I guess I'm saying I think some of that probably comes from being worried, you know, that the bottom could drop out if these things go wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then sort of immediately try to do something about it without having to time to really think and respond in a way that you'll feel necessarily better about later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I think that also there's another—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - part of it that has to do specifically with my relationship in the sense that—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I think part of the worry—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - is that like, that (inaudible) [00:20:23] he's not right for me or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't say, I mean I don't you've (inaudible) [00:20:23] before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I think that there is, there are obvious, there are, for me, obvious reasons why he's not like right on paper and like he's not Jewish, no college degree, earns less than me; you know, these little, the family crazy, you know, grew up way different—all these little things that are on paper—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But don't, have never really mattered to me and don't really matter to me. But I get worried about like what if I am always like forever going to be annoyed with him like talking about something so much or, you know, venting about something so much. What if I'm going to get annoyed forever about him being, having an argumentative personality or to be the personality where he kind of feels the need to—</p>

<p>None of this really plays the devil's advocate but be the other side of any conversation, you know what I mean? Like any, like Jillian was talking about something and it was like he—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:21:20] become oppositional.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like about, like, like everything and I, and I don't really understand it so I don't really engage. Like when that kind of comes up I just, I, I, I'm like okay. That's fine. Like, 'cause I just don't really care, you know what I mean? But he'll, you know, somebody will say "Well I read this" and he'll say "Well I've read that" and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of annoying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like what if I'm going to be annoyed at that forever. What if, like, but then another part of me is like "ennh", but that's like, but it's not that big of a deal to me and we don't have like, it's not like every day I'm like having to avoid debating something with him which is okay because I don't, you know. But I think that I do worry, you know, and I love him and I don't want to not be with him. But it's not, but, and I think that this is also having to do a lot with the kind of (inaudible) [00:22:19] like craziest thing that I'm kind of feeling in terms of where am I going, blah, blah, blah and kind of you know, being like okay, I'm 27, like I'm thinking about important decisions that'll shape the rest of my life.</p>

<p>And it makes me nervous to have those thoughts, you know. And then another part of it is lately like I mentioned I just have started to kind of feel nervous about him and where he's at in his career and kind of always like being behind me in terms of how much he's making and you know, and like never being able to catch up like maybe is not true but maybe is. "Cause like at this point like I'm just (inaudible) [00:23:05] especially as long as I'm working at MIT. I'm going to keep getting raises, I'm going to keep, you know, you know having big things and it makes me nervous.</p>

<p>I feel like additionally I'm nervous about him feeling jealous of some things. Case in point is that I had great news on Tuesday which was that I went to a policy committee dinner—just that every semester we have this policy dinner and I run and plan it. Not run. And my executive director came up to me and she was, started talking about LASA which is the Latin American Studies Association which is an international group of folks from universities all over, you know, all over the world that come together every year at a conference to like have booths and do conference-y stuff. And she, you know, I've known about it, I helped, you know, prepare some materials last year for it blah, blah, blah. But this year they're asking me to go along and help there in Seattle in May.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm really (inaudible) [00:24:11]. I'm really excited. Like it's a really good opportunity for me not only because I've never been to Seattle and that's really awesome,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - but because you know it just shows that they really value my work and I mean, nobody else in my position has ever been asked to go to this event. So I'm really, I was very surprised, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. That's terrific.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I told Franklin and he said, "That's great babe", but I didn't really feel like I, he kind of didn't really like, I don't know. Maybe I want to feel like it was, maybe I wanted him to make a bigger deal of it and he didn't really and it was kind of like "Now you'll see why I—" because he's been there. He went there awhile back when he worked with the Museum for some sort of training. And he said, "Oh, and now you're going to see why I, you know, consider it on my list of places to, you know, possibly live someday." But then that was kind of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't like push the issue but I, I was like is this just because like were talking about it like, it wasn't really like we were sitting down at dinner and we were talking about it (inaudible) [00:25:14] the car or like doing errands, I don't remember. But it was oh, I have to tell you that, oh I've got some good news. I think we were driving or he was driving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know if that's why and then I kind of haven't brought it up again and he didn't really like remember or if it's because he's a little jealous and a little resentful -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - that I am now going on a business trip and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean he did say, you know, when I was like I feel really proud of myself because I deserve it and he was like you do, for sure. You know, I mean he knows it, you know. I mean maybe I'm just being overly sensitive which I contend to be. But it made me a little nervous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just want him to fuss over it more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And fuss over you more about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right, you know. Like I even, I told a friend of mine, like I was texting with my friend and told him, I was like "Oh I'm so excited. I'm going on my first business trip" and he was like "Wow" you know. I don't remember what he said, he said something like, you know cheesy like Ms., you know, "big shot" or something like "Congratulations. You have to go celebrate" you know. And like I even felt like that was like more than I got from Franklin.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like Franklin didn't even be like "Wow, we should celebrate." And like again, to be fair, like well whatever, I guess I don't need to be fair here. Like you know like I can bring it up and say, "Hey I want to celebrate" and I'm sure that he'd be like "Absolutely, let's do it, you know." But I think that there's a part of me that feels nervous that he's a little jealous. And I don't want him to be. And then to this day you know, to the same you know, point I don't want to be resentful of him moving forward in the future. And so I'm kind of having all these things that, you know—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:26:56] I guess I uh, I was going to say that uh, well it sounds me that you're worried about whether he'll be able to take care of you in certain ways that you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think it may be a little conventional of you because on one hand I know it's very assuring for you to be the one sort of who's always on top of like the financial stuff and lots of other things. At the same time I guess, quite understandably like, he's like (inaudible) [00:28:14] really take care of it and take care of you in various ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yeah, I think you're worried about how much he'll do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. And you know, this is something that my father has been worried about since we got together and I always got upset that he would bring it up because it was just, it didn't feel fair to me. And I never was worried about it. And so it's kind of jarring to now be feeling those worries myself. And I mean, but like I don't want to, but I'm not prepared to end this relationship at this point. I mean I'm not, that's not something that I want to do or you know in thinking it's the only option or the best option or what I want—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder why do you go so quickly from one to the other. In other words like it's as though if you have this doubt or, you know, want to question something about the relationship it's not that far down the road being ready to leave.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I'm afraid that if I bring it up and it's something that we talk about that it's not going to be something that we can talk about, that it's not going to be something that, that it's going to, he's very sensitive to kind of stuff like this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have a way of not being very tactful sometimes when I've brought up things like, about our relationship in the past or about things that--. But on the same, on the other hand like he not only, even if I do bring it up in a way like I'm trying to, it's hard for him to accept or understand when I'm telling him things that I would like him to work on or change. Now we did have a really productive conversation about a lot of these topics a couple of weeks ago where we both kind of put a lot of things out there that, you know, this has been bothering me. This has been bothering me. And it was good and it was healthy and productive and we both felt great after. But I guess, you know, then I go back to having these feelings, you know like again, like the talking too much or the, you know, not getting in the gas or the not, you know, to making a big fuss about the thing, the trip. Again I do I go from 60 to 0 I guess in this case and I'm like well, we should probably just break up like, or I don't like that's the only other option like when I, I, that's not fair like because I do, we love each other and we don't, you know, we have a great time together. Like I don't—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's, I (inaudible) [00:30:58] you might think it's not fair to him. It's probably not fair to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not fair to either of us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean like I don't actually really get why you go there so fast. I mean, it's funny like when you were talking about his (inaudible) [00:31:11], it seems to me that actually the way he was, I imagine you felt in terms of whether he was taking care of you or not; in other words, like coming across the way you wanted him (inaudible) [00:31:21] situation like, you know, I (inaudible) there was a part of that that was like, you know, feeling like he was sort of making you look good or making the two of you look good by how he was acting or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or getting gas for the car like so you just didn't have to worry about it and deal with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would just kind of be on his shoulders to deal with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And certainly the response to, you know, you're going on the trip for work. Yeah, there's something about like how kind of quickly you go from feeling upset about like, I guess, (inaudible) [00:32:05] not being taken care of in these ways to (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean even to like okay, I'm just being tough with him and talk to him about it. But (inaudible) [00:32:13] than that like, "Alright. Well I guess I'll come down (inaudible)."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I think that another reason about it is that honestly I feel like my mother settled on a lot of things with my father and that's why they ended up getting divorced.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like "Uh, this is annoying but I like him."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That she sort of minimized how big a deal—</p>

<p>CLIENT: - certain aspects of his personality were, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like always being late to everything, like not being on his own timetable to being a know-it-all, like just straight know-it-all; being kind of air-heady in defense of really only being, having his own agenda really be his only agenda. And these were some of the main reasons that their marriage didn't work out. And I guess, I don't know that she necessarily minimized them because I don't, I haven't had that specific conversation with her where she said, "Yeah, all these things were there but I just, I pushed them to the side because I, you know, felt like I wanted to get married—"</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does seem like that to me because all those things existed when like she met him, you know. And so I guess the part, another component of it is like yes, be taken care of, absolutely. But the other issue of, you know, like what do I let slide, what do I bring up, and what do I, and what isn't non-negotiable in terms of what he can change, what I can deal with kind of thing.</p>

<p>That being said, there are things about me, you know, and the way that I am that I know that bother him severely you know — maybe not severely (ph) but maybe as much as I feel about these other items. And then, and then like said, the other issue, you know, comes into play about money, about career, about education. And yeah.</p>

<p>So it kind, it just makes me feel nervous and you know, we always work it out, you know, these little fights or whatever I mean. But, I guess the other thing is about the gas thing for instance. Like he really felt like he didn't do anything wrong, like what's the big deal? I just figured we could get it on the way home. And so he was not seeing that it was the fact I asked him to please do something and he didn't do it because he wanted to do it his way which was we still have gas. Let's just wait 'til later.</p>

<p>But for me it was really, it was really, it was really like I asked you to please do something that like I usually do anyway like or whatever, we do together. But can like what the hell? Just freaking do it like you know, if I see that he's doing his homework or whatever, I am like, I have no problem going and washing the dishes. Like with the, you know, I don't know.</p>

<p>So it makes me nervous. It makes me nervous about the future of our relationship. It makes me nervous about like if I'm making the wrong choice. It makes me nervous of continuing in the relationship and then later breaking up whether it's when we're engaged or not or married or not. Like I don't know. I don't, it's hard for me to work through in my mind and also hard to figure out how to breach the topic, I guess, too because I'm afraid of him taking it the wrong way or getting upset or like something. (long pause)</p>

<p>Even when I have those doubts and I kind of bad because of like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How (inaudible) [00:36:30] in a failed relationship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know like, like what do you mean? Like I guess, well—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel like you're on your own dealing with the stuff, stresses you have. How much do you feel like, you know, he's there for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean support-wise I feel like he's there for me a lot because I, there's not a time when I want to vent about something, talk about something, say this is on my mind and I need to deal with it and he's not there to talk to me about it and work through it with me and care that I'm going through it. There is really never a time when I feel like that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>In terms of, you know, the stresses like for instance the financial stuff, you know we had talked about, speak about you had suggested you know well maybe a way to kind of get some of that off of your shoulders completely is to make an effort more to share in what's going on, you know. If it comes in your name, fine. If you're taking over it, that is fine but to go through it and we did that this week and it was really helpful. You know we had this great discussion about the tax return, it's March 1<sup>st</sup>, we're starting on this new budget plan and we're going to go grocery shopping and it was actually very helpful and I did want to make sure to report back on how because it's been, it was very helpful and it just feels so good more like we both know what's going on right now. We both have, you know, we put away for it in the room with the calendar that has bills and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - you know dates and you know, so we both know when, what money is coming in from where. So that was really helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess uh, I think you get pretty stressed out, pretty anxious sometimes about some of this stuff I mean like the gas in the car. Like you got pretty worried about things like that. I think particularly you worry that you could headed for a kind of catastrophe—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you know like with, when you are thinking about getting engaged to him, I guess, you know of course that's a big decision, of course that's something anybody going to, most people are going to worry about at some point. But I think for you there's like a sense of possible catastrophe in worrying about it that is sort of a little characteristic, if that makes sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think it's hard for you to sort of like stop and sit with that anxiety which crops up in all these various places I think. I think that's probably partly why you go from "Oh my god, there's a problem. Well I guess that we should have to break up."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because like what's in the middle there is like all the worry about like impending catastrophe that you don't really want to think about. And it really seems to stir something up for you. I'm not sure quite what. But it's scary. And so I think that kind of short-circuits your thinking actually. And it's probably worth looking at.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean this—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think it's going to answer any of these questions, you know, -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but I think it's probably something that's going to be something very helpful for your processes working out answers for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it's just, you know, like you said, very characteristic even dating back to childhood when—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - you know, anxiety was set in about not learning how to do the math problems and it would be, it would short, exactly what you said, it would short circuit my brain to the point that I now I don't know anything ever and I'm never going to be able to do homework and I quit school. Like I mean it's, you know, it's, you know I can't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, you really (inaudible) [00:40:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, process everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - in your thinking there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In your thinking there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's like, I guess it becomes really a huge deal to get the math problem right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think something else happens there which is that you feel completely alone. I just (inaudible) [00:41:09] when you get in that kind of state.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like there is nobody that can help you. And I don't know historically how much, whoever, your parents, I guess would have been there to help you, "we're going to settle you down about it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the thing. They would try to and I would be such, I would be like in this in this bubble—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:41:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: - yeah that it, they couldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It, what would you do? It's like they'd come along and they'd be like what would they say? I mean how'd it go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be you know, it would be okay, let's just work it out, okay, let's take a break and I would, "No, I can't take a break. I have to do it. I have to do it right now. I have to finish it. I'm not going to take a break because I have to do it." And it would go, you know, I'd—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what would they say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They would say it's okay, you don't have to do, I mean they would convince me but I would literally like even at age, you know, say 5, 6, 7 so kind of stuck in my little—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - thing—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - that they couldn't get through to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it must have reason it was terribly important for you to get that math problem done right then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know why. I think because I put a lot of pressure on myself to get things right and be perfect. I mean not perfect but, till I get things right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think of what it would feel like, what it would have felt like to you to just walk away from it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think like, like just scary, like it, well now I think I would feel like if I don't work on it now then I'm never going to remember it. Like I, while it's in my brain right now I need to do it. And walking away would feel like but then I'm not going to do it and then my teacher's going to be mad and then I'm going to not do well in school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like if you don't do it it'll be gone forever?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, and how would it be gone forever like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Will you ever be able to get yourself to go back to it with—?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that was the fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is they're telling me to put down the pencil because you're frustrated and you don't know, you know, you need a break. I would feel like well then I'm just not going to do it. It's not going to, it's not going to get done. You know I can't take a break. I can't take a break. I need to do it now. That's the feeling. And I think that's the same feeling with this relationship like I can't just talk about things, I can't just see how things unfold. I need to figure it out now or get out now or, you know. Which is interesting and I don't know if it has, if it's rooted in my genetics or if it's rooted in the divorce when I was 6 or—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well like it seems to predate that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh—</p>

<p>CLIENT: For sure.</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, and I'm sure there is like something's genetic (inaudible) [00:44:13] but this sounds like (inaudible) for sure this moment can be worked on that way. In other words, you must have had some fantasy in your head about why leaving the math problem would mean you're never going to come back and what was at stake in doing it, you know what I mean? Like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. There's a memory that I'm like bringing up right now that's not necessarily my memory but I have some memory based on (inaudible) [00:44:41].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I know, yeah. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just that's not my memory but it's a memory that's been told to me that one night when my mother was working and I was like maybe 2 or 3, -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - my father, I wasn't eating my broccoli and he told me that I had to sit in my high chair until I finished my broccoli and I couldn't do anything else until that was done and I was crying and sobbing and Michael was sitting there holding in my hand and I sat there and cried until I fell asleep and didn't eat the broccoli. And like that just, I just thought about because like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - do it now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's, (inaudible) [00:45:18] maybe we can look into it more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So alrighty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. On Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So on Monday, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it was in my jacket. I was like my purse is here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing) Okay. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll see you on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:45:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

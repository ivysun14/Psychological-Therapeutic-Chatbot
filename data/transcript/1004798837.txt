<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm ready. It's been a really long week. The weekend felt like a year and then the week felt like two. I don't even know why. I think just because I'm busy or something. The weekend with all my plans and stuff, Friday night was fun, except that I got drunk and then was looking at Facebook on my phone. Franklin was writing stupid bullshit like—whatever—super deep about his life and direction—whatever. I was feeling like it was intentionally directed at me, and I'm sure it was to some extent and I got really angry. I didn't have my car and my friend's boyfriend was designated driver, and so he took us to get pizza and that was fine. Then Saturday, I don't even know what I did. I don't even remember what I did, probably errands. Saturday night I was going with my friend, Jillian, the one that I've recently become closer with again that I knew from a while back. She lives right behind where I work. It was her friend's birthday and her friend is somebody that I have met a couple of times, and so she invited me along. [00:01:21] Her friend has had problems with her boyfriend in the last six months or so, like caught him sending naked pictures to somebody and he came out that he was cheating. Blah, blah, blah. She stayed with him. He stayed at her house and she was trying to work it out. We're going to this birthday thing. She's getting a hotel room for her and her boyfriend for the weekend. We're supposed to go downtown. They have a nightclub; they have a VIP—whatever. Everything is fine. We're at the hotel and people are drinking and getting ready. Fine. We go to the club. Her boyfriend is kind of an asshole. We go to the club. I was miserable, meanwhile. The whole day I was miserable because I was missing Franklin. I hadn't talked to him. I was just feeling really sad and miserable. I just wanted to talk to him, but was feeling conflicted. So I was even miserable at this club and I'm not really a huge fan of clubs to begin with anymore. It's just a lot of . . . and my shoes were hurting me. It was a whole thing. [00:02:16] I was sitting there, minding my own business, I guess looking bored. But, whatever, I had my drink, and the boyfriend is sitting in the VIP section. He comes over to me, moves seats and drunkenly sits down next to me kind of brushing me. I was like, "Okay." He's like, "You look as bored as I am." I was like, "I'm not bored. My feet are just hurting me, so I'm taking a break." He was like, "I'm really bored." I was like, "Where's the birthday girl?" It was his girlfriend's 30th birthday. "Where's the birthday girl?" He was like, "I don't know. Somewhere," and then he said, "I have a foot fetish, so if it weren't inappropriate to offer to rub your feet, I would." I was like, "Well, it is. Maybe you wouldn't be so bored if you were dancing with your girlfriend," and walked away. It turned into a whole traumatic ending to the night because I guess he was drunk and kicked her co-worker out of the hotel room. We're in the hotel room because Jillian brought along her 21-year-old sister who, I guess, had too many shots or something and so she's throwing up in the toilet. Me and Jillian are trying to take care of her. The girl and her boyfriend are fighting, like "fighting" fighting. [00:03:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is her name, just so I . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Rachel. Rachel and her boyfriend are fighting. Me and Jillian are trying to convince her to come with us. Finally, we leave. The sister is in the car throwing up like, "Take me to a hospital. Just call mommy. I just want to talk to mommy." Her sister, her little sister. We're like, "You'll be fine." It was just a dramatic thing and I had already been feeling shitty. [00:03:42] Anyway, the next day I called Franklin and was like, "I miss you and I wanted to talk and everything," because he had sent me a message that he misses me earlier and blah, blah, blah. So then we talked and it got a little heated and turned into a whole you stopped talking to me without saying why and I felt abandoned. I was starting to feel things towards you that I didn't want to feel. I tried to explain that I just feel like trying to take a break, like I just felt like I needed a little space; and this and that. He was really upset and he was like, "Well I don't want to do this anymore then, because it's just too hard." I was like, "Okay, again you're threatening to break up with me. You always do this." We were talking about something and it was getting a little heated and I ended up saying, "I feel like you bully me into thinking whatever I'm saying is wrong." [00:04:36] He got really upset that I used the word "bully" or said it in the heat of the moment. I was like, "Okay, I'm sorry, but I need to be able to tell you things without it getting to the point where I'm blurting it out." As it turns out, he saw a therapist earlier in the week on Tuesday. He found some guy. His insurance company has a list and he found some guy and, I guess, he specializes in urban youth growing up in society dealing with the trauma of their childhood, growing up in ghetto situations or whatever. I guess that's what he specializes in, which is right up Franklin's alley, so that's good. He was saying how he liked the guy, but the guy had him start a journal and gives him assignments. It's weird though. He was like, "The first session I had was an hour and fifteen minutes." Then he went again last Friday and he said that session was an hour and forty-five minutes. [00:05:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. Weird.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't get it. I know. I've never heard that in my life. He was like, "It's a $20 co-pay." I was like, "Alright, do your thing." I was happy to hear that and I have to say this, for all his saying to me, "What do you mean seeing if I'll do some of the things you wanted me to do by not talking to me?" even though we had that discussion. He has a therapist. (laughs) I was happy about that. He said he would like to see a couple of therapists and he was feeling frustrated. He felt I wasn't holding up my end of the bargain in the sense of having made the decision together that we are going to try to work on things and see if we can make this work. I was like, "It was because I wasn't really seeing as much as I had hoped in terms of things you were doing. [00:06:40] That made him upset, but fine. I would like to hold up my end of bargain, I just needed him to show me a little bit of enthusiasm. I haven't called the people that you gave me their names, but I plan to this weekend and see about that. So that's good. He was like, "I want to give you your space, but I want to take you out on a date or something. I want to try to actually do this." I was like, "Okay," so I'll go out on a date with him. I think we might go out tonight or Sunday, but I still have the feelings like being unsure, obviously, and not really knowing. In our conversation he, too, finally for once instead of being like, "I hate it when you say, 'What if we don't work out?'" but finally for once he was like, "If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but if we're going to try, let's try." Okay, I'm glad that you acknowledge that. [00:07:41] What bothers me is that I think I'm still thinking a lot about the thing with the girl and not sure how to really . . . yes, we can work on our communication stuff and our issues, but where does this whole thing fit in about the whole thing. (laughs) I feel confused like what it was and confused if he still has chummy relationships with girls and who they are and if this is what it is. I have a lot of issues with that. How do I know it won't happen again? And why in the first place? I still don't understand why. I guess I'm also fixated on what he really said to her? What was really the nature of their conversations about what was going on with them versus what was going on with me and him? I wish I knew. I'm not really sure what it would solve for me, but I guess it just feels like there was this whole thing that I was very directly involved in that I don't have any grasp on what actually happened, and that upsets me. [00:09:16] We tried to talk about it and it's just not been productive when we've tried to talk about it and he would like me to forgive even if I can't forget; but at least if I'm going to forgive, then move on. I'm still not sure if I do forgive 100 percent or if I will or if I'll be able to move past it. I'm not sure how to breach that subject with him because he gets very defensive and . . . defensive about it. I do feel better because I'm not talking to him right now because of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah; and I feel better that he's not being as much like, "You're not talking to me as much as you used to," because he gets it, I think, a little bit more now. He is still acting a little bit like mentioning things about giving him access to do laundry because of blah, blah, blah, and his room and the bed is too small. Whatever. Even in our conversation, I hate the fact that I had to tell him for the 100th time, "Please don't threaten to break up with me. It's not mature." (chuckles) That's kind of what's going on, so why be like, "Well then, I'm done. Just keep all of it." He was like, "Everything that's mine that's still there, just sell it or something." [00:11:00] Okay, Franklin. Way to be the most dramatic person that I've ever met, like you're the girl in this situation right now. Right. Maybe that's something that the whole still thinking about the Betty situation and what-not is something that we can try to explore in couples therapy. I'm just nervous about how that's going to go and overall, if he's trustworthy. He really had been keeping things from me in terms of how he has relationships to people that I don't know, specifically women, obviously. (pause) [00:12:04] So many of my friends are like, "No. Be done. You'll never trust him again. Why waste your time trying?" but I don't think that's fair. I'm sure that's what my mom thinks, too, but we'll have to just deal with it, I guess. But, again, I'm concerned about the whole trust thing and how to manage that. (pause) The problem with not knowing how to talk about it with him, I also don't know how to stop thinking about it myself. [00:13:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really want this to work out. I think that's sometimes why you let him talk you out of things and bully you around opinions that you have. It's because you'd just as soon get rid of them. Like with the truck stuff, you present it as though somebody could tell you something you don't know about how you could deal with that with him because I think you'd just as soon not know what you already do know—which is that you're going to worry about it and with good reason until he's acted in such a way for a long enough amount of time that you can trust him, which he hasn't mostly started to do yet. But you don't want that to be the answer, so you're sort of asking me and also just throwing it out there as though this were about some approach you didn't know of yet. [00:14:57] It sounds like those were a really hard few days without him, without talking to him. You were pretty upset and down and alone a lot of times, and maybe don't necessarily realize in the moment some of the things that you do in hopes or with the idea that this will work—which it might. I'm not saying that it won't, but I think you sort of in a certain way pretend and fool yourself about certain things or don't want to see things in a certain way to kind of make yourself feel that it's more likely that it will work or stack the deck that way to yourself. I'm not trying to make a comment about whether it will or won't work, that's just sort of how you seem to be handling it. [00:16:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish he understood how [bothersome] (ph) this is to me still and understood it and helped me work through it or something. Reassure me. He does reassure me that he would never do something like that again and that he only wants to be with me forever, blah, blah, blah; but I still feel like the whole incident is still shrouded in mystery for me. For him it's like why does it matter? Then I think, "Well, you say that because it's worse than you've let on and you don't want to tell me the real truth," which is compounding lies with lies or even lies of omission. How am I supposed to deal with it? I don't know how to put those feelings away yet. At the same time, if I am going to try to forgive and try to move on, I don't want to be the type of person to do that and punish him forever by keep bringing it up or all of this stuff. It's just been such a consistent problem throughout our relationship that I don't really know how to not think that at one point or another there's going to be some sort of conversation with a woman that could get to an inappropriate point or could be something that he would know would make me uncomfortable if I saw it, so deletes it. [00:18:23] I feel like I'm struggling with that the most. The other stuff, I can work on more as long as he's willing to work on it we can try to talk about—like approaches to talking to each other. But this whole thing with my feelings, I can only work on that. I am asking, I am throwing the question out there angrily, like what do I do? Do I tell him we need to clear the air about the whole thing and go over all the bloody details? It sucks. (long pause) [00:21:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel like you sort of pushed aside what I said earlier. Let me be very clear, I'm not reacting because I'm insulted or because I think what I said is so important or anything like that, it's more like I don't think you wanted to hear some of it, (chuckles) although, I probably was also just unclear or something like that as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unclear about what? In general? Maybe I just wasn't hearing. I don't think you're unclear. (pause) Is it too much to ask you to "re-say" it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's not. One of the things that you said—and I guess the part I'm thinking of pretty clearly—you sort of posed it like a question. I don't know how to approach—I'm feeling ill at ease and upset and unsettled and worried about his having this interaction with this woman online and I don't really know what happened and I can't really trust him. It's something like that. I don't know what to do about that. How do I handle that? How do I take it out? How do I put it away? What do I do about it so that I feel better? [00:22:52] Then I said something like, "You pose that as though if you just go about it in the right way, then it will make all the difference." Whereas, I was thinking you probably know full well that he would need to be somewhat open about what happened and would need to do a bunch of things to help reassure you that—none of which he's really started to do yet. [00:23:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like what bunch of things? I don't even know what he can do to show me. Are you thinking about follow through on things?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure you do. Yeah, he could follow through on things. He could not hide his phone as he's done many times since when you go to talk to him. He could say, "Go ahead and look at my stuff." He could tell you what happened. He could tell you why it happened. He could give you some account of why he was doing this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He did, but his account is totally self-centered.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He could be a little less defensive about the whole thing—any one of these things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's true. Thank you. The biggest thing is that he hasn't done it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That may be the biggest thing for him, and for you it seems like the biggest thing is you're doing sort of a version of what you always do, which is to not look at the fact that he hasn't done it and that that's why you still feel as worried and upset and crummy about it as you have. Instead you say, "Hmm. How can I bring this up with him so that we can actually have a more productive discussion about it so I feel better? It's my responsibility to find a way, take this up with him so that I then feel better." [00:25:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Which is what I always do. That makes plenty of sense and I agree with you, but it doesn't make me feel better. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I could imagine it doesn't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I also just need to give myself a little bit more time with things for now and see how things pan out. He is giving me space, which I appreciate. I want to kind of evaluate how much he's relying on me for opinions on things because he's already e-mailed me a couple of questions about like, "Should I do this certification for my personal trainer or this one? Does this one look legit?" Decisions that he should be, I think, already reached—first of all, already have researched. You're talking about this for six months already. Secondly, you should be relying on yourself for at this point. That's kind of part of this whole thing. That's kind of part of the point. I want to kind of evaluate how that goes, see about a couple of therapists and see how that—I don't know what I would even expect from that. So it's like I'll give it a go. [00:27:41] I am wondering what he's talking about with his therapist. He's like, "I just told him everything in the first session. I just kind of gave him an overview of everything." I'm like, "Which everything?" because there's a lot of everything. He said he told him about us and the whole situation. I'm like, "What are you talking about for an hour and forty-five minutes? What is this assignment that he's giving you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My view, for what it's worth and [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:13) is you can't really get your partner to go to therapy and do the work you want them to do. You can look at whether they're changing the behaviors or ways of treating you or ways of reacting to things that are bothering you; but if the therapy is going to stick and going to work, it's going to be on their terms. If it's not on their terms, it's not really therapy. Do you know what I mean? [00:28:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that would be sort of like it might be here, but I'd focus less on what he's talking about, whether he's going and all that—that's on his side—and focus more on what's making a difference. Maybe he's going to come in, "I understood that, I understood this." The reason that would be good is if he were more open about other things that he felt or could be more honest and less defensive, that would be great; but I would think about it much more in terms of his behavior with you than whether he's going to therapy or what he's talking about. Stuff like that. That's kind of "advicy," but. [00:29:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. It's fine. I guess I just need to give it a little more time and let things do what they're going to do for now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel as though when you say that, the tone makes me think you're kind of saying, "Well, Ethan, I can sort of tell that you want me to break up with him or back off from things further and I'm just not ready to do that and I need to settle into things for a little bit," and if that's true, I wonder what's giving you that impression about where I'm coming from.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. I think it's more like I am almost feeling internal pressure to figure this out and move on in whatever direction it's going to be. [00:30:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine because the limbo [ ] (crosstalk at 00:30:55) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Right. Having friends and family that are leaning one way or another makes it difficult as well. I do have friends that are like, "Whatever you want," but then I do have the friends that are like, "Why are you even bothering?" My idiot friend, Sandra, whose wedding I did, put a nice-looking candid picture of me and Franklin from her wedding up on Facebook and tags us the other day. I'm thinking, "Sandra, you know what's going on with us? What the hell?" But, yeah, the limbo is frustrating. [00:31:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a way, things aren't working such that you're together, at the same time it's really hard if you don't know if you want to end things and shut the door, which is at least easier because you can start thinking about moving on if you're not in the middle of all of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. I'm not finding myself wanting to go on any dates or meet any guys or anything. I'm just not very interested. It was a really long week. It was very busy at work just figuring out; now me and Franklin are talking, figuring that out. I went earlier this morning and got a haircut and was going to go to work and come here and then go back to work, but I just called in sick instead because I was like, "Yeah, I can get a day off." Even though I had Monday off for Rosh Hashanah and then I have next Wednesday off for Yom Kippur, for some reason this week was just Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday only were so long for some reason. I have schoolwork now. I have so much reading for school for one class, so much reading, so that's a lot making me tired, too, so I just decided I would take a day off. I have off to go out of town anyway, so that's at least good. I'm looking forward to resting some this weekend and just not being on the go as much as I was last weekend, I think. [00:33:25] I'm going out with friends again on Saturday because my friend is moving to do traveling program and, again, at the same club as last Saturday. I don't know what's so popular about this downtown club that everybody loves it, but that's where, apparently, she is also a VIP. I mean, we're 28 years old. We're really doing VIP nightclubs? VIP section? I don't know. I'm not part of that. Wait. So I was out on Friday night being drunk and angry and I ended up at this club with my friend, Mindy. Like I said, she's a club rat. We met her at a bar and she was like, "Come to this place", by the station. Apparently she knows everybody there. Her boyfriend works there or something. I don't freaking know. I was drunk and annoyed and my feet hurt and whatever. She was like, "Come in this back room and sit down. Here is my friend, Kyle. He's really drunk. He's sitting here. Come sit with him and then we'll go in a little bit." [00:34:29] (sniggers) So I sit down and she's like, "Kyle—Trina. Trina—Kyle." I'm like, "Okay." He's some big VIP club guy that's at all the clubs, like he's her best friend. I don't know. She has a weird life. I don't know. (sniggers) I'm sitting there looking in the other direction and I feel something on my hand and he has sprinkled some coke on my hand and I'm thinking, "Where are we? What is that club, Club 64," or whatever it's called? The disco? Mike Myers? The movie? Studio 54. I was like, "What is this?" and I just brushed it off like, "No, thanks. Mind asking me first?" It was super-surreal because I was like, "Where am I? What's going on?" and it wasn't even a back room, like in the back. It was still part of the club. People were around. It was very strange. I didn't enjoy it. It made me feel very uncomfortable and I don't do cocaine. [00:35:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you were kind of shocked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, "What are you doing? You're in public. Keep that shit to yourself," you know? Again, we're 28. You're bumping cocaine in the club at 2:00 AM? Okay. And she's a nurse, like NICU. (laughs) I know. What the fuck? So, yeah, that happened. Hopefully that won't happen again. I'm going with Lucy, the girl that I became friends with again. She's going with her husband because it's our childhood friend, Mindy, from kindergarten—best friends. She's going and she's normal, so that will be good. I'm bringing along my friend, Gussie (ph), who's not normal, but she doesn't do coke; so she'll be fine. I don't know. It's a club. It will be fun. I'm going to make the most of it. It's just funny. I'm going to the same club two weekends in a row. [00:36:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:36:20) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably not. Maybe a bar or a nice lounge or just some (laughs) [ ]. (inaudible at 00:36:27) That's my idea of a goodbye party or a birthday party, not popping bottles. But, no, I think as far as hanging out with people—no. I'd rather go somewhere that doesn't cost $20 to get in, but I think that's more why I'm like "Ugh" awful. So, no, I have enjoyed being out with friends and taking advantage of that sense of freedom. Making plans and not running it by him or make him feeling excluded. It's just like this is what I'm doing. These are my plans. It's hard because I'm trying to find a balance between schoolwork and weeknights and going out on weeknights and staying up late. I've been staying up a little too late, but I'll find the balance again. It's not like acting crazy. I haven't gone grocery shopping yet, which is totally unlike me, but I just haven't felt like cooking anything. It's just been so much easier (chuckles) to order out or go out. [00:37:46] I really like having my own finances. Did I tell you that my mom got a notification in the mail that she opened and it was for found wages? Like $500? I guess it was commission that I left before the end of the fiscal year, that they would have had the commission amount. So I have a $500 check coming to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. But, yeah, I'm enjoying having my own finances. Yesterday I got so out-of-control frustrated when I was getting dressed for work because I realized I've been wearing the same work clothes during the winter, like the same pants and bullshit for like three or four years. I'm just like, "I'm going to buy new work clothes. I know I don't have that much money, but this is ridiculous," so that will be something nice to do for myself I think; and that will feel good to start the year fresh like that. I was going to go to Columbus day weekend to visit Mandy because I found a ticket for $200, but I guess family is going to be in, so I'm just going to go to Chicago instead. Still, also going away, being able to make a plan to go to somewhere without him being like, "I don't want to go. What about me?" Like, "No, I'm just going to see Mandy for a weekend." That's exciting. [00:39:07] I wish I could afford a real vacation, (sniggers) but [ ]. (inaudible at 00:39:11) I am worried about all of this stuff. I do feel a lot better now that I'm not talking to Franklin, but I am enjoying the freedom. I did tell him that the other day when we were having this whole conversation. "I like the feeling," and he's like, "I feel like one should feel that way whether they're in a relationship or not." I was like, "Well, I wasn't, so I need to get that back." He was like, "Okay, true." I think his feelings were a little bit hurt, but he took it like a man for once. (chuckles) (sighs) So, yeah, I'm enjoying that. [00:39:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a difficult time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Totally. It's a difficult and confusing time. A lot of people, if I've told them the situation, have told me how impressed they are with how I'm handling it and they're impressed that I stuck to my word about what I wanted to do and how I'm handling it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's nice. And it's true, I think. I think I am handling this well (chuckles) considering. Ironically, at the club last week right when we were leaving and I was miserably sad, on the verge of tears, this friend of Franklin's who we've known since he was little—I guess their families grew up together—this girl, she was there at the bar and she was like, "Listen." Of course, drunk, has to start talking to me about it. Like, "I talked to Franklin and he told me blah, blah, blah, and I just want to let you know how much he loves you and he'll do anything for you. I grew up with them and all of them—all these girls are always going to be around but it doesn't matter because he loves you." I was like, "You bitch. You don't know what the hell you're talking about right now. It's not the girls I'm worried about; it's him. Get out of my face. You don't know me." (chuckles) I think he's been talking to her a lot more lately. I don't care, but I was like, "Really? Right now?" I had already been feeling miserable the whole night and then she has to come out defending him, basically. I'm like, "Listen, honey. Please." That was irritating. [00:41:57] And she's just really fake. She's just like, "Oh, my God. I'm here for you. I'll call you tomorrow." I'm like, "I don't even know you. Go home," you know? So then I was like, "Okay, what's he been talking to her about? What are they talking about all the time?" I don't think she's after him, but I don't know—again, it's the whole attention-seeking thing. I don't really do that, I really don't. And he's still hasn't told his family. Nobody's talked to them. We haven't talked to them. I haven't talked to them, (sniggers) which there's nothing wrong with that. It's not my mom. I talk to my family. I don't really know what to tell them. I have relationships with them, but not to the point that I'm going to be calling them and he's not. It's weird. So he can work that out on his own.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me about that trip.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What trip, [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was ecstatic.  It's awful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Was not -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it was just wrong.  Not great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Not your thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even though all the family was there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, but it, was it cumbersome?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, logistics.  You know, like, I don't know, too many people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean, there was, like, 25 people, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you guys try to, I don't know, coordinate things to do things together too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  We were slow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Slow?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Because every, like, 5 minutes someone had to use the bathroom so we never got anywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So did you guys go through [DEIDENTIFIED] as a mass or did you split up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We went through as a mass.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For the most part.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, uh, a lot of standing around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who's idea was that, was that dad's?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  We go ever year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean was that dad's idea to go, uh, all together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't know, we just do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I always thought it'd be kind of fun, but at the same time it sounds like it'd be a bit much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  Anybody like it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean, everyone liked except for me.  It was a waste of money to pay just to go to the bathroom every 10 minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You didn't enjoy much of it, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nice seeing your family, wasn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But I wasn't about to sit seriously here with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It'd have been just as crazy there you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  All that fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, doing trips like that remind me of the me, those Home Alone movies, you know.  Like at the beginning, when, uh, they're trying to get everybody together and they leave a kid behind or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that on?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your health?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it is?  Cool.  How about your meds, how are they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fine.  What's not fine, [PATIENT NAME]?  You can start there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, how are you compared to last time I saw you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Today's a good, fine day, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You seen your psychologist since I saw you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many times?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Seeing her again before you head back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I might be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When does school start?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When do you go back, when do you go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Orientation is this Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and then I'll get back on Sunday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wednesday, Thursday, Friday you'll be there.  Where do you stay then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, a hotel.  I don't know where.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  They don't put you up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They don't, they don't put you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no.  Well, I mean they might, but I, I don't believe they offer to let you stay in the dorms, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, where are you going to stay when you're down there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where, for next spring?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> An apartment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you know where?  Do you have one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  It's near [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you can't go in yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can't move in yet, until?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Next Monday, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Big day, start school and move in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Same day.  Furnished?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.  My own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't move into, like, the [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, I'm supposed to.  But due to errors that he doesn't live in town, because, like, he's leasing it out, so he can't get his junk until, um, out of there until Monday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.  So what are doing driving down in the trailer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, we haven't gotten that far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you going to class Monday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You do that during that, uh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Orientation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You looked at the schedule and see what's available?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.  But they said they leave openings in all the classes for transfer kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how do they do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  Well, they didn't do the same thing for freshman, they don't leave openings -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For, for orientation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you have a lot of classes you can choose from I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You haven't looked at the, at the, uh, course offering in your catalog or anything yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nervous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excited?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sort of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING], you're going to be in an apartment by yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, just for the spring.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's that going to be?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Weird.  It's just because me and these girl are moving up next year, but they're in the dorm this spring and they can't get out of their contract because they already paid for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't want to live in a dorm, and other stuff, and whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This apartment complex, do you know anybody else that's, that's living there in the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I know a group of guys that live, like, across the street.  And my friend [NAME OTHER], like, she's unofficially moving in, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So she's going to stay there with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you will have a roommate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, most of the time, not all the time, but, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So that'll be okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't let her eat all your food.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You going to cook?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I [INAUDIBLE] it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you can eat on campus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can eat on campus I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your mood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it?  You're not depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING], I mean, not right this second.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you have been.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Most of the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> About the same as you were?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Better.  On, like, uh, what percentile better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fifteen percent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fifteen percent.  And what do we need to achieve before you reach bliss and happiness?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mood swings?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Irritable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess so.  I don't really know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And other people notice it, that kind of irritability?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They didn't say anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not even on that trip?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What'd you do when you got irritable then, you just get quiet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stay to yourself?  Uh, did they just say, "Oh, that's [PATIENT NAME]."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they just say, "That's [PATIENT NAME].  That's what she is, she just stays to herself," or do they bug you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, nobody notices.  There was 25 of us at the Euro thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bad thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> None?  Would you tell me if you did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No harm to yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And no thoughts like that?  What were your final grades last term?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, A+, A, A-, B+.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's awesome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, the B+ was, like, right on the border of A- and B+.  So that jerk ran me down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Still, that's, that's pretty awesome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was a 3.95, so that's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's better than good.  Dad happy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know, did he say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um, fine, I, don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No reaction?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I guess he's happy I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he's happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's on your mind, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing on your mind either?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what are you going to do all week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know, go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wednesday or Tue -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tue -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tue, on Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who are you going with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stay with you the whole time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wonder how many, I wonder how many transfers this time of year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  They tell us a lot, though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know.  How many in the freshman class there, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They normally get 1500 or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't really know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So about a 6000 student campus?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About 9000.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Who knows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you seeing your counselor and your therapist before you go back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I might be.  It depends if she has openings this week.  Because she didn't, but then she's going to see if people will cancel and whatnot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Taking your medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any side effects?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, right now I'm on, of the aripiprazole?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right now I'm on the 225.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How often are you forgetting it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I forgot it once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No problems I assume?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what time of day you take it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It changes.  Whenever I remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you keep it with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no.  I brought it, but I usually don't.  I usually lose it every day and I have to go search for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any, uh, thoughts about how you might be able to avoid that problem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it's not a problem, it's just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It might make it easier for you if you can -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean, I can't see the floor of my room right now, so this little pill booklet, it's managing; it did pretty well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, probably missing it one time isn't bad for all the changes.  Well, I'm glad you're noticing some effect already.  So are you within walking distance to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nice place?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many bedrooms?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So she'll be sleeping on the sofa, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, my friend?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, she can sleep with me.  These I think, this is that [INAUDIBLE] stuff?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  You read about it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think, it says I think [INAUDIBLE]?  I don't know.  It says, "2 copies of your psycho educational evaluation form."  I don't know what that is.  Within, like, the past few years, or medical documentation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want me to put your mood disorder on here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Be more likely to get assistance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING], okay.  You're a hard sell.  Okay, I'll send it to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you tell me your address.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, you can send it to [NAME OTHER], because I don't know the address.  So [DEIDENTIFIED].  And here's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's your home.  I knew that one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I thought you were giving me the other one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it says, "2 copies of psycho educational, blah, blah, blah, or medical documentation."  I'm thinking [INAUDIBLE] what that red form is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, this is the form I need to fill out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what it says anyway, Psychiatric Documentation Form.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So after this, what do I do?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll give you a prescription.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And just stay at 100?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, you need to go to 200, and get you [INAUDIBLE] back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get you another one.  Move you up to 200.  And you need more Adderall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll be back [DATE] for Spring Break.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Taking your car I assume?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Because my apartment comes with parking, so that's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, that's nice.  Is this like a house, uh, divided up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.  It's just like a building.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You get generic Adderall, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  They don't make regular instant anymore, Adderall doesn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They don't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Trade name?  What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, Adderall the company, like Shire or whatever?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They don't make [INAUDIBLE], they, like, sold it off, and no -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it's all generic now, except for extended I think, or I completely made that up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I prefer you take trade name Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, Lamictal comes in a generic too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, they may give me generic</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I prefer you not to take that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's new.  Not sure it's the same.  I've heard number of report that people are having problems with it.  You know, it's already a drug that's got some significant side effect possible, you know, the bad rash kind of thing, and just so you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now, is it Adderall, so I know which pharmacy to go to?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because there's pink ones and orange ones?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're different, aren't they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you go to the pharmacist and they say it's all the same.  That's not true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Target, that's where I go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have any idea how makes that one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes that helps if you can kind of jot down what company it is that makes it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The pink ones are awful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, just don't work as well or side effects?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um, Side effects.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, headache?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it just makes you feel like you're going crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, nice.  That sounds like too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's, uh, an interesting state of affairs, because the, the pharmacies get a kickback from drug companies for promoting generics, and it's nice, best way to do, uh, the public.  Okay.  So this will be a prescription for another starter pack.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For a second one?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You start when that one's done.  What you got to do from, from there, you get, those would work up to 100.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stay on, I'll get you a prescription for 100.  And the 100 is going to say, the script for that is going to say 100 twice a day.  You're going to take one a day until you get this one done, then, hopefully that make sense to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And you just get a month at a time on you, on your, uh, regular medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I only get the second starter pack and then another thing, and if say to take 200 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I take 100.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You take 100 until you get to the end of the second starter pack.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm going to take 100 plus the starter pack each day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Until you get up to 100 twice a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then just keep taking 200, 2 100's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It'll come to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because it'll look like this -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But instead to take 125 and then 150.  But the 100 is coming from my own little -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bottle.</p>

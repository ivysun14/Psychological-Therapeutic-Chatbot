<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 5</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm very sleepy today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you stay up late?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Well is anything new?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As far as talking to people you mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I called four places. Well I don't know yet. What they've been suggesting to me is there doesn't seem to be any clubs or groups of people with your particular problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't group together. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They don't group together. Now if you were in a wheelchair or had something like that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wonder why that is. I wonder what they do. I never meet them. [0:01:01.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wonder what the other people do. Well at least let me finish before you get into that because I wanted to tell you that where I'm left going now is I'm going to call up again the Rehabilitation Institute of New York and Michael Reese. And see if there are people that they are treating like in the hospital with your kind of problem because that sounds like a place to get a possible list of people. But anyway you were saying...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't seem to meet people with scoliosis or curvatures very much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You never see them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No very seldom. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This lady said to me when I called she said, "Well if you're friend gets together with some of these people, have her call me up and if she ever wants to talk to some more people, I'll send some more people to her." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Why? [0:02:01.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what she meant was that in the same way that you're looking for people to talk to, there are probably other people looking for someone to talk to too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes. You know I was talking to you the other day about personality barriers. Well I was reading an editorial in Glamour Magazine that mentioned, oh I meant to bring it but I forgot it, mentioned of people looking for what you get. In other words, if you're always looking for bad reactions, or if you think you're going to be mugged on the street, or you think your husband is going to leave, it's very liable to happen. I might happen, not that it wouldn't happen if you weren't looking for trouble, but it is true that we sort of program failure. Sort of like the woman who loses her husband perhaps does not give off an aura of self confidence and therefore, he doesn't believe in her attractiveness either. [0:03:19.6] </p>

<p>You know psychologically. I don't know what this aura is. I'm not sure. The gist of the article was the fact that in the way we behave causes certain things to happen and it was also suggested that perhaps we don't realize that we're giving off negative feelings about ourselves. The part that scared me is that sometimes after you're aware that you're doing this, you can't help it. Now I thought that perhaps if you were aware of what you were doing, of course you may not know why you're doing it. They said that there are many nonverbal ways that we convey that we don't think well of ourselves. [0:04:14.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the part that scared you was that you couldn't stop it maybe even if you knew about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Even if I knew about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that you, I guess you said before, like you feel somehow that you must do that; give off some aura?</p>

<p>CLIENT: An aura. Yes. I don't suppose anyone is 100 percent confident. So that was mostly what I was talking about. Am I causing some kind of? And then it says you're looking for a negative response. You're looking for these bad things to happen to you as they say. And you're relieved when they really do happen. You're relieved when you lose a certain job or you lose your husband or whatever it is because you were afraid of it. [0:05:18.2] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're wondering if maybe that's part of it, like you're relieved from it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well if I'm interested in a man and he prefers someone else, I can be hurt. But it seems natural. It seems like that's the way it should be. I don't think this out but I'm sure that it seems that this is the right order of things and even if he did prefer me I think I would feel that it was sort of out of place. I would be happy but it wouldn't seem natural. [0:06:03.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would seem strange.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would seem strange. For some reason it wouldn't seem natural and right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wouldn't seem natural and right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's as though I suspected this for years so that I would have these feelings of relief of being disappointed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you just said though it sounded to me a little different from relief. Was it relief?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well maybe not relief as much as it seemed natural. Oh of course this is the way...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In some ways it seems very odd about somebody liking you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when they stop liking you it feels like back to normal. Everything's in place again. [0:07:01.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. It seems in place. And then I read another article, I don't know if you've ever heard of Cosmopolitan Magazine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People say that it's trivial and it is in a way. They have a lot of articles that make a lot of practical sense for single women. It's not all nonsense. Well they have a little column called psychiatric couch or something. And the girl writes and she says that this man is making a fool out of her and when he calls she goes out with him then he doesn't call for a long time and etcetera. So he was saying that she wants to be a victim. She felt as if she was a victim when she was a child so now she feels she can choose her own manipulator or her own victimizer. And that if she realizes that she's punishing herself then perhaps she can drop the man which would be a very liberating thing to do. [0:08:21.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now when you relate that to yourself, how does that make you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's hard to relate to me because this situation that I'm in there's not really a man that stays in my life. He's just a colleague. Now I was talking to a friend of mine today about this situation with this person and I says, "Well I don't think he respects me or even likes me as a person leave alone likes me as a woman." Because I feel that he's more worldly than I am and much more of a manipulator with people than I am. I just feel that even when I pretend not to care, it doesn't seem to work. It's almost as if he can see through it if I decide that I won't stop and talk or any little thing. And then like I told you last week that I was proud of my behavior. But one day last week I thought I had been a little too friendly, and I did bring up topics kind of a personal nature and I felt that I had lost pride again. That he still... [0:10:02.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that you felt that you brought up...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I started behaving in a way that I think, I can't describe my behavior, but behaving in a way that would make him think that I care which I tried not to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because that feels humiliating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if feels humiliating because he can do these things like asking me out for a drink and then leave or can cut off what I'm saying. Well it's really hard to go into the details of things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like he can treat you lightly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. You know last night I was thinking maybe it would be, I don't know what you'd think of it, you probably wouldn't give me your opinion. Suppose I told him how I felt and then would let it go at that and just forget about it; not expecting anything just so that I don't have to pretend anymore. [0:11:24.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what would you tell him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would I tell him? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say you'd tell him how you felt. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what words. I thought of telling him that I was in love with him which maybe that isn't true. Now I don't know what that would accomplish. [0:12:02.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess the reason I ask you that question is I'm wondering if you could sort it out. Think of what you're telling and then think how that would make you feel afterwards. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It would depend on how he would react to it. I suppose maybe if he felt that what happened was not because I was cheap or maybe he wouldn't feel that I had been a fool. That what I did was out of real feeling. He's not too warm a person or really sensitive. He has a nice friendly veneer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if he could realize that what he felt that you did was out of real feeling on your part, then that would make you feel much better. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But then I would lose pride. But then I have a friend who thinks, this friend that I was talking to today, doesn't think I should say it. That I should just start ignoring him; just continue. Of course we both decided that the only reason that I have pride is because of the feeling that I have. If I didn't care I wouldn't care whether he thought I cared or not. What I mean... [0:13:35.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. So what you're... Yeah. Go ahead. </p>

<p>CLIENT: For example, I can talk to another man that I know and I can be friendly without being afraid that this man is going to think that I'm interested in him because I don't care what he thinks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you aren't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that you could act exactly the same way with some other man as you act with this one and feel alright about it. But here you feel like you've lost pride. [0:14:04.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And of course the pride is because of the way I feel. That's where the pride comes in because you care what that person thinks. Now we were talking about something else. So I was wondering where I had lost his respect. She said that where I lost out was giving him my phone number in the first place. I said, "Well why if a man asks a woman for her phone number, why does he dislike her or respect her for giving it to him?" She says, "Because this indicates to him that you will have something to do with him outside of school." I said, "Well what would be wrong with that?" Well she did have a point that maybe he thinks single girls shouldn't be interested in a married man. Well this is true but I'm sure if he ever dates anybody that would be the case with anyone that he would be involved with. And of course... [0:15:17.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So wait. As you think it over then, it doesn't seem to you like that's losing respect. That makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It shouldn't have because a person can be interested in anybody besides I wasn't sure of what his status was. You're not always sure about someone else's life so you don't think about it at that point. What she seemed to be saying is that the fact that I gave him my number and encouraged him that's what made him feel that I was a girl that he could manipulate. Of course I don't understand. So I said, "What should I do, never give a man my phone number because he will think less of me if I do?" She said, "No. You should give it to him if you're interested." I said, "Well that was the reason that I gave it to him." Oh I don't know. Unless she says, "Maybe he thought you gave it to him but you weren't interested." But I don't know if he thought I was interested in him at the time. [0:16:35.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like then you wouldn't lose any respect if he didn't think you were interested. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So that's a little muddled. You know perhaps she's right. I don't understand him. I don't know why he thinks less of me because of the way I feel. I don't understand a person like that. [0:17:04.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't understand why he thinks less of you because you're interested in him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But it does seem like that's the case that he feels that I'm a fool. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean he's acted that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah well he does treat me lightly. I can't imagine. I wouldn't be angry or dislike a person who liked me. I don't understand it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't understand why that should make him dislike you the fact that you like him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Especially since I've never been oppressive I don't think. Not very often. Oh I've asked him a few times what do you look for in a woman. Sort of in a light way but it shouldn't have been oppressive. I don't chase him. I don't try to call him up. I don't ask him out. One time early in the relationship, if you want to call it that, I did say I was going out for a drink and that he could join me. Well I did this because he hadn't called me and I thought, which a lot of girls do, that perhaps they had discouraged them by being casual because I was trying to be casual. But I hadn't really started anything. [0:18:40.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well now you were telling me about he treats you lightly now, that could be a lot of different things. That could be that he thinks you're a fool. But it could mean possibly other things too. I guess what I'm saying maybe you're not, what you're saying before, comes up again it is you don't really know how he does feel about you. [0:19:08.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he'll say things like once the other day he said he was depressed. This is a day I had gotten to where I was showing that I felt sorry for myself. Now I know everybody's a drag when they feel sorry for themselves. I said something about that I was depressing him and he said, "Oh no." "You're the only reason that I come here." Things that are so obviously false, it's so ridiculous. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ridiculous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course he doesn't mean that he doesn't have...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that show to you that he says things like that? [0:20:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It shows that he thinks that I'm just a fool, unsophisticated and silly. That I'm nothing. Well I mean not professionally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But as a person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As a person or as a woman. That part of me socially. We've had conversations that he doesn't think I'm stupid but in that sense he thinks of me as a fool or a child. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm not clear why you take that comment of his to mean he thinks you're a fool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But why would he say that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe he was just kidding. For example, there could be a lot of reasons, maybe he felt or she wants me to talk to her and try to comfort her but I don't feel like doing that right now so I'll pass it off like a joke. [0:21:08.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the very fact that he feels that I want comfort and he doesn't want to give it would indicate that oh she's bothering me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that isn't the same as she's a fool. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That's another problem. I feel that I bother him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel that you're in his way? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's the way I felt that day. But why doesn't he want to be bothered with me? Obviously because he thinks I'm not worthwhile or worthless. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying if he thought I was worth it then he'd be willing to be bothered. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He definitely does not think I'm worth taking up time with or caring anything about. He mentioned once how women want to be placed on pedestals. And then he mentioned once how a man can place a woman on a pedestal and she won't care for him. Apparently he doesn't think that I'm that kind of woman that a man would want to cherish. I'm not saying that I'm looking for this but he doesn't see me in that way. [0:22:34.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's a little disappointing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it makes me think that well it must be true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it must be true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'm not. I know it's not logical and it's silly to feel that way but I just have no confidence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's as though you still feel that way. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does rob me of confidence. You know sometimes I think I wish I knew what kind of woman he would really look up to or think well of. [0:23:10.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you're saying a minute ago he really robs you of confidence I'm hearing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He makes you feel...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just a few minutes before that he had listened to me play Bach which wasn't too bad. And some of those things he appreciates but somehow he still sees me as nothing even though he might concede that I can do something fairly well. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's just when you can do something but as a person you're really nothing. And you mean when he says that you begin to feel that too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And like once at a party a couple of months ago, he turned to another woman in front of me and said to me that she's a lovely sophisticated woman. [0:24:08.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you felt like part of what he was saying was in you by comparison are not. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the thing it was a funny situation. He had been complimenting me about something. I don't remember; something with music or the way I play. He'd heard me playing that morning. And right after that he switches and says this to me about her, someone that he hasn't really shown interest in, and still hasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that made you feel like I guess what he just said to you he took very lightly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I suppose so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very put down. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why? He said he heard me playing for my class that morning and he said, "I wish I had enough talent to play for my class or to show my kids something or to entertain my kids because the kids really enjoy something that's done well." And then a few minutes after that he says this to me about this woman. [0:25:27.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the thing about the two things coming right together is that what you mean? That it hurt you or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no not the fact that they came right together; the fact that he said this about this woman. It made me feel that he felt that to be sophisticated is better than being something else; than being unsophisticated. [0:26:03.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did somehow something like he was insinuating that you weren't sophisticated you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yes. He's never said that I was sophisticated. I asked him later what was sophistication and he said something about intelligence. But I was really mad and I said something to the effect that he didn't think I was. He says, "I didn't say you weren't intelligence." Oh really you have to excuse what I did say now. I think I was high, not really. So he says, "Oh yes you're intelligent, you have wit and all that, you can play Chopin." I'm not saying you should be like her. Well she's actually sort of a friend of mine. She has sophisticated manners and I think very often he thinks that a sophisticated manner is important. I don't know. This seems to be very important to him. [0:27:22.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it makes you feel bad that you're not sophisticated. That you don't feel sophisticated. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I might be sophisticated about some things but I don't have the manner that people would call she's sophisticated. I don't have that presence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel that lack of that very keenly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I never felt it before I knew him and I was devalued. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was when he started thinking a lot of that that you started really missing it in yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He doesn't seem to be interested in her. In fact she's rather chubby and he called her lovely. I just don't. She's not ugly. She's a fairly attractive woman. [0:28:13.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what are you saying there? Something about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he said being sophisticated is knowing about the world and politics. Well I know about politics too. I couldn't understand why he would assume that I wouldn't know anything about politics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it made you mad that he didn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It made me made because I may not act sophisticated does not mean that I don't know about politics or whatever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No you're doing a lot by jumping to that conclusion. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then he said something about the way I smoked cigarettes. The way I handle it or something, not the way I handle it, but he mentioned something about sophistication is the way you smoke a cigarette. [0:29:08.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That sounds very shallow I must say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were irritated by that being the criteria.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he justified saying something like that by saying everything is trivial anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that sounds like getting out of it in someway to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I suppose you could say that everything is trivial. Certainly judging a person by the way they smoke a cigarette. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's pretty trivial.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess everything is trivial but life and death with some things more than others. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some things are more trivial than other things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You would think. I would think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But for him to be judging you in such silly grounds really mad you angry. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It did. And I still feel angry. I half believe him then I'm angry at the same time. [0:30:06.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to feel bad about the fact that you just gave him the other half of you yet angry that he should about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. So I just for the most part I've just been despairing of ever having any confidence. And I despair of ever getting over this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you never...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That it will never end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It will simply go on forever. You'll always be stuck in this. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know of course I won't. I've felt this before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this isn't the first time. Rationally of course I know that I'll get out of it but there's only so much you can do. [0:31:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But talking with this girl again, I said, "Would you give a man your phone number?" She said, "Of course she would if I was interested." So she was saying that she would like to go to a psychiatrist or psychologist because her problem is that when she's interested in a man she can't find ways to show that she's interested. And I said, "Well Vera that's not my problem." My problem is if I'm interested in a man I'm trying to think of ways to hide it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have opposite problems. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I really have the conviction that when you show interest that it figures through. I don't know why women want to show a man they're interested.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wish you could stop being so obvious. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. I'd rather not show it. But some women really believe that a guy is more interested if he thinks that the woman is interested. It seems to me that they're less interested. [0:32:06.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it seems to you like when you act like that it puts them off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Puts them off, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you're unable to stop that. If you like them it comes out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it shows. I think it shows. So I don't know. That's sort of where I stand right now in feeling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feeling what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course I didn't come about this specific problem but it relates to. Of course I'm in this difficulty naturally because of other problems. Like you mentioned last week if I hadn't had a physical problem I would've dated more and therefore my outlook would be different. My perspective would be different. [0:33:14.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is all tied in to other things in your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you said that I feel that he thinks I'm a fool and you said well how do you know? Were you suggesting that the way he behaves is for some other reason?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was suggesting that what you've described to me of his behavior could mean a lot of things. Like when he makes you feel that way or it might mean things about that maybe he just treats many people lightly. That's his manner. Maybe he isn't like picking you out as something of a fool. I'm saying there is a possibility that means different things. [0:34:05.6] </p>

<p>CLIENT: A personality. It could be an attitude toward women perhaps? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It could be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He does sort of have a they and us attitude with men. Them and us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean them as the women?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I heard him talking to a man once and he says they, he was obviously referring to women. Well I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was it you were saying earlier? I guess I got off the track somehow because I was still interested in hearing your feelings. What were you saying about telling him how you feel verses... [0:35:00.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Telling him how I feel and she said, "No I shouldn't." Telling him how I feel and just saying that because, oh I don't know, it would depend on what he would say and how he'd behave. But I think I would say because I've been trying not to show it and I've been playing a game and I just feel that I should just say it. Not that I expect him to respond or to be my lover or anything. And also that I felt that if a person is loved by somebody, maybe they should know it. Well they don't have to know it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel that you love him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I suppose so. But that's a pretty strong feeling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you're not sure if it's that strong. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well what I'm saying is I don't know how I would react if suddenly he were available to me. I mean you never know that until it happens. [0:36:11.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not just as simple as that you love him and really want him. You don't really know how you'd feel if he suddenly said, "Yes I want you." </p>

<p>CLIENT: I suppose I would be glad. But how can you love somebody that you haven't been involved with? See that's what I don't know. But anyway I thought if I tell him, I can't say I like him, that I would just....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you don't like him you mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he thinks I like him. He's already told me that that he thinks I like him. I don't know what he means by that. I like a lot of people. [0:37:09.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not sure how he's taking that. In what way he thinks you like him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I should tell him that or not. I thought that would make me feel better or maybe I'd feel worse. But I just thought maybe I could just behave the way I feel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There'd be something freeing about that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Of course he might feel more repressed. It might make him feel more weighted down if I did that. You know I've got this girl's feelings or maybe he feels that way already. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be a burden for him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it would be a burden. Right. That's the word. Burden. And he would avoid me. But if he felt that I just felt that way but didn't intend to say anything about it, but just if he knew the feeling was there, then I wouldn't feel because I've never admitted this to him. I've always pretended to be casual. And I thought that maybe I wouldn't have to worry what if I do something that makes him think I care today. [0:38:25.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He'd know that already. You could relax.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think. It's hard to know how I'd feel afterwards. It would depend on how he would respond to me. I don't know how a man responds when a girl he doesn't care for says this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm trying to help you think that out. Like what is a way that he could respond and then what would that be to you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: How could he possibly respond? Well among other things there's a remote possibility that if he felt anything for me it might free him to feel that he could get into a deeper relationship without getting hurt. I think that is very remote. I really don't believe that. That's just... [0:39:37.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's one possibility. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The other possibility he could say, "Well I'm sorry and too bad." Maybe I just want to find out what he'd do. Maybe that's why I want to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe part of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe just a new... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you're interested in knowing how he'd react or how he feels. [0:40:04.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought, this is connected to what I said before, it would maybe give me a clue to what he really thinks or feels. Of course, he might think even less of me. Oh what a fool. Nobody but a fool would admit something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then would you feel like a fool for admitting it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I would assume that he was thinking I was a fool so I'd feel like a fool. According to my standards, no. But I'm silly enough to feel that if it's silly according to his standards that maybe he has a point. I'm still not independent of his opinion. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What he thinks about you it influences how you think about you. [0:41:00.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And this isn't true with me with all people but I think in this case it would. Basically because he's so adept at handling people I figured that he can see through people. He knows the right things that people should do and the things that they shouldn't say. That he's very much adept at judging what people should say and what they shouldn't say. Well yeah, he's a pretty sophisticated man. Well he's not sophisticated in manner but he's a man of the world type.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you feel like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel well he's had more experience than I do. Actually I really don't know. I don't suppose there's anything wrong with telling a person that if one has the right motive. Of course if you want to burden the person. [0:42:12.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see. Wrong with it in the sense that that would burden him? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because there's no point in my telling him that. I don't think...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would it burden him? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well maybe he'd feel guilty for having hurt me or something. Even though I don't think he would. In fact on second thought I don't think it would burden him. He'd probably think what a child. Why can't she handle her feelings? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why does she have to tell me about this? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What is she telling me for? What difference does it make to me? I suppose he'd have a point. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like it does make some kind of difference to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It would make a difference to me, not to him. And I thought maybe deep down inside it would reach him as a human being. Not that he would respond to me but perhaps he would stop this kidding and taking me so lightly and maybe some of the humanness in him would come out. Maybe he'd feel a little bit more human toward me. [0:43:20.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of seeing a humanside of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I thought this would get the situation out of the game stage and just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make it more real.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know if I can do that. I'll have to think it over. Of course then I would be afraid, well a sophisticated woman would never do this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I were sophisticated I wouldn't do it. It isn't sophisticated. [0:44:05.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not. I don't think so. I probably won't. Maybe I will. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the situation seems to warrant it. I won't plan it one way or the other. I just got so fed up. I'm so fed up. Of course I could get fed up and forget about him too and not ever have to say anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like one thing that you're fed up with is the artificiality of it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Playing games business. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course it's my game like my friend says; it's not his. He's not involved emotionally. But still I'm sick of the teasing... [0:45:09.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're sick of him being very light about something that's serious to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably what you're saying at least if you told him this in some way he would have to take you more seriously or at least you'd be putting yourself forward more seriously than you have before. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That has nothing to do with gaining confidence though does it? Well maybe. [0:46:07.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying what you really want to do is get confidence. That's what's really important; one of the things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you know I was really disturbed when I left last time because we were talking about personality is the same thing and you said... I wasn't disturbed by you. I was just disturbed by what we've been talking about. And you told me to think of things that would be attractive to a person rather than barriers. [0:47:02.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure that I meant to convey that. But go ahead. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well those are stockings, its friendliness more than anything. But I'm still in the dark about how I'm behaving. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean about am I friendly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I know that I'm friendly but it goes back to this aura again. What is this unseen thing? Or just like the article said, I'm throwing off signs to people, especially to men that I don't believe in myself; or that I'm not important. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what makes some (inaudible at 0:47:46.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't understand how I'm ever going to stop that. I don't even know what these things are. What this manner is; it's an elusive thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do I do that says I'm not important? [0:48:01.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, do you have any clues to it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very hard. I used to hold my head down. I don't do that anymore. It might be something in the tone of my voice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if this is helpful but what is it that other people do that makes you think that person doesn't think he's very important? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well they sort of whine I think. Their voice sounds whiney. I'm trying to think. I don't see many people that seem to act this way. I don't know. How can I judge if someone doesn't think he's important? Well they might strike me as a person with not much confidence. But you see I've seen evidences of lack of confidence in the strangest places. One of the greatest pianist is the world behaves on stage as if he has no confidence in himself and he's one of the greatest musicians in the world. So I don't understand his problem. [0:49:40.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like why doesn't he feel confident? He of all people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he has a shy smile. He doesn't look at the audience very long. He doesn't have too much eye contact. He holds back in the front of the stage, sort of a shy smile that he puts on just for the audience; then he leaves and tries as quickly to get off the stage and is sort of awkward. How can I say this great man doesn't have confidence but yet he does behave like a person that doesn't have confidence? [0:50:19.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you're doubting your own feelings that he acts that way? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That he really feels this way but I would say use him as an example. But that's a strange place to find it; that kind of feeling. But then artists measure themselves against standards we never dreamed of. They measure themselves against much higher standard of something almost ethereal. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe that explains how he handles himself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But just ordinary people I would say oh maybe in their posture, they have a whiney voice; sometimes their too friendly. I've noticed that people that seem to have more confidence don't look at other people as much. They look at the person they're talking to but they're not glancing around to see whose where and what and who seems to be attracted. I think that might be. I don't know if I do that. The confident person does seem to be more self-absorbed. Now I read once, and I know that you're running out of time... [0:51:40.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we started a little late so we have five more minutes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. The person who can live alone and enjoy his own company at not be lonely alone has high self-esteem; well that fits me because I have my apartment. I like people but it really doesn't bother me to be alone. [0:52:02.6] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in that way you feel adequate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe I do have more self esteem. Maybe I have a lack of esteem in certain... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it's not like I have low self esteem. Curious like in this area I feel bad and in this area I feel pretty good about myself; it's different in different areas. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think there's a lot of talk about self image and self esteem but I think that's a mix thing that people do not feel. They either have esteem or they don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they have it as well. Like the pianist maybe, maybe feels like he's a good pianist but very shy around people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well this pianist is shy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right. Ok. But what I was getting at...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's part of his lack of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I was getting at is maybe he's complex in that way too in that he's shy with people maybe but not shy in other situations. [0:52:59.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He wouldn't counteract naturally if he didn't have any.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the same way it sounds like you're talking about yourself. In some ways...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel confident when I meet people to talk I feel that I can discuss. Well I don't feel that I may know a lot but I feel that I can...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like the other time you feel confident discussing politics for example.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well not too deeply but I mean I know something about it; certainly as much as this woman sitting across the table. And I feel confident talking about literature or something like that. I feel confident enough of my interests in other topics that if a person is interesting that I can be a good listener because I enjoy them. So in that sense it's alright. And I feel ok at home because I have enough to do even if it's just thinking and pondering myself. [0:54:11.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel alright about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know I don't think there are many other people who think of me as silly; as a silly woman, as a fool. But then I think he knows a side of me that others don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if they knew about that side they might feel the same way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They might.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they might not you're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm beginning to see it is a value judgment. I don't think that all men would think a woman is foolish for caring. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe only some men feel that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well during the course of therapy I will come to conclusions or what? The more I talk? [0:55:12.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you'll do. Well that isn't really a good answer. (chuckles) I guess I'm thinking it's time to quit is really what I'm thinking. But what were you feeling? Like you're waiting for conclusions to arrive and none had arrived or something? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean how would you know if I didn't need therapy anymore? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would I know if you didn't need therapy? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean will I all of the sudden come out with certain insights and you'll say, "Yeah that's fine, she's got it now so that's it." Because sometimes when I tell you things that I'm thinking or conclusions or the way I feel or whatnot, you just say, "Yeah" or do you feel this way and you think this is true. But I don't know what you think of these things that I'm saying. I don't know if I'm on the right track or if I have to come to the conclusion as to whether I'm right or not. [0:56:17.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, well listen. I really feel like I have to quit. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, oh I'm sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But wait a minute. Bring it up again or if you're talking about something and I'm sitting here saying, "Yeah" and you don't know what I'm thinking, you don't know what's really happened, say that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Now next week I can't see you I don't think on Wednesday. Is Thursday ok? It's Memorial Day and then I have a two day conference Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh sure. Thursday is fine if not I'll call you if something comes up. Thursday should be ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thursday should be ok. At 3:30? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's better than Wednesday. [0:57:01.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So yeah, feel free as we're going along like if you're wondering what I'm thinking or where we're headed, say that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll certainly you your opinion. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Good bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright. Good bye. [0:57:12.6]</p>

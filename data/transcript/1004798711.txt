<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday was a ridiculously busy day and I ended up just completely skipping two things that I was planning on doing this week but couldn't cope with everything I had planned. It was mandatory volunteer day at work/. You just show up at the [ACT] (ph?) and senior aid project at 9 AM for their fall cleanup. I didn't know what was involved. It turns out we were just raking leaves in the old peoples' front yards for three hours in the rain. It was kind of not awesome. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. Raking leaves on a day like today is not so bad but in the rain it's a different story.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I had a personal training session an hour later which, in hindsight, was kind of a bad idea because I was already tired out. I was like, "Oh, fall cleanup—how bad could it be? It's volunteer work for 50-year-old engineers, half of whom are smokers, right? It can't be that stressful." Actually it was enough just activity that my ATP stores were depleted and my shoulders were exhausted from raking. [00:01:33] I came home and I had set up an appointment at three to work with my partner on the service I'm planning for my church on Sunday and I couldn't do it. I ended up falling asleep instead. Bishop Gene Robinson was speaking at the school's chaplaincy and I meant to go listen to him preach because—you probably don't know this; in fact, Gene Robinson is kind of notorious in the Episcopal Church. He was the first gay bishop who was elected in our denomination. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, was that in the last few years?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it was in the late 90's, but it caused a great deal of drama—people leaving the church—really terrible all around. He retired recently because he couldn't handle it. He kept getting death threats. Even ten years after getting elected he was still getting death threats, so he retired. He was at my old chaplaincy preaching and I really wanted to go hear him talk but I was just so tired. [00:02:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he from this area?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know where he's living now. He was bishop of New Hampshire, which is pretty close. I don't know where he and his partner retired to. I assume somewhere in New England because he's originally from, I think, Maine. I was just so tired and the current bishop and a retired bishop were speaking at my church at seven, and I needed to be there because I had (chuckles) orchestrated this event. I didn't manage to get there on time. I got there 20 minutes late. I was just very much digging in my heels and had an "I don't want to. You can't make me" sort of mindset going. I finally was just like, "Move!" (chuckles) I kind of used the drill sergeant voice on myself. And it was good once I got there. There were annoyances because how could there not be? It was the members of our anti-oppression team facilitating small group conversations. So the two bishops –is a white man a black woman. She was the first woman bishop elected in the U.S. [00:04:05] Possibly the first woman bishop worldwide in the Anglican communion, but I'm not sure about that. Don't quote me on that. The first woman bishop; first black woman bishop. They talked about their experience with race and racism in the church and then we broke into groups of six and had members of the team facilitate conversations about race. The white people in my group were just [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:32) frustrating and horrible. Did you know apparently that a white man from Nova Scotia being made fun of for liking hockey—that's just like racism? Exactly the same thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sure it is. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. Yeah. I mean we have a hockey team here. I know Americans who watch the Bruins—is that our team? I don't know. I don't really follow hockey.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Me either. [00:05:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not just a Canadian thing (chuckle) because I know people who get very excited about it. It's like [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:19) was made fun of for liking hockey and being Canadian and that's just like (whispering inaudibly) (pause) So there were frustrations, but I think that overall it was a really good event. It went off well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:35) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Afterwards I talked to the Bishop for a little bit. It's kind of amazing to me, his memory. He's met me maybe six times in the last six years, but he remembered where I was going to school and what degree program I was in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He asked if my term on the vestry was over, why didn't I plan for reelection.   (laughs) He's phenomenal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great. [00:06:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm feeling like I'm doing too much and spread too thin, but [final pain] (ph?) leaves me feeling like I'm screwing around and wasting a lot of time and not doing enough. Something that's been kind of little by little bothering me for a while but yesterday really kind of brought it into focus because I did schedule too many things for myself and I didn't schedule enough time to get from place to place or to rest and eat and all of that good stuff; but at the same time I still spent a lot of time just doing nothing and not actively recovering. I don't know if that term makes sense. It's definitely a term that's used in the exercise world. Active recovery is after you do a really hard day of working out, the next day you don't just sit on your butt and do nothing, but do something really light just to keep the muscles moving, keep them warm without overstressing yourself. [00:07:29] Yesterday I watched four episodes of Castle. It was ridiculous. It's a silly TV show, police drama. I realize that some rest and relaxation time is necessary, but I also feel like I could have used some of that time either doing work for my day job. I had the day off yesterday but we have a deadline Friday. An hour or two checking in on long-earning jobs and starting a new analysis task would have been useful or an hour of reading materials for this service I have to put together by Sunday—something instead of four hours watching TV. (laughs) (pause) [00:09:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get the sense you circle around doing stuff, both to kind of push yourself to get motivated to go do it or overcome some inertia to go do it. And maybe also it's difficult to not over-commit and, I know it's dramatic, but there's going to be a little bit of violence either way against yourself. [00:09:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd really like to find a happy middle, though, where there is no violence against myself going on. (laughs) That would be nice. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be nice. Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I realize that I have after-work commitments every weekday, and they're all things that are important that I want to do, but by the time I get home I'm exhausted and I don't have recuperation time, especially when I have a period of four or six or eight weeks where I've also got stuff going on every weekend. Two days a week I'm here after work, and these sessions end relatively early so I can still go out to dinner or go home and cook or whatever; but they're kind of emotionally draining. One day a week I've got voice lessons. Monday I've got choir rehearsal and one day a week I have education for ministry, which is a kind of seminary thing. I don't know if I've talked to you about that. [00:11:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had mentioned it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a program for a kind of formal, guided study of scripture and theology and history of the church—all of that rolled into one for people who have no intention of actually going to seminary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But want to know more. [00:11:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Want to know more and want to discuss it in kind of a formal seminar format. Those are all good things that are important to me that I enjoy and get a lot out of, but I feel so run down. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Sure and you're also trying with the gym, I guess?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And see people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go to work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your husband?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But he's just as busy as I am in the evenings. He has his yoga classes and his work Meet Ops. He's doing this thing at the university. One of the professors has recruited a [ ] (ph?) [00:12:28] of grads who have industry experience to work with his students and mentor the students in his class and do code reviews. It's kind of a less formal TA arrangement, except they're not TA's. They're not students, but it's all volunteer. It's a good thing to put on their resume. He's got stuff after work every evening (laughs) most of the week also. We're both in choir so we see each other on Wednesday evening before bedtime. (laughs) (pause) Actually our best quality time is in the mornings. We both get up a fair bit earlier than we absolutely need to leave for work, so we have about an hour in the morning to eat breakfast together, hang out and talk about our day. It seems like we do breakfast instead of dinner as our family meal. Whatever works, right? [00:13:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever works. Absolutely. I actually see two issues with the evenings. One of which is that you really want to be doing more particular things than you actually want to be doing. The other one is more the violence against yourself sort of thing where it's just like it's sort of smooth; like, "I'll skip this day," or whatever or "I'll add one more thing and I'll be more tired for a while." There's a lot of push-pull. I guess I imagine you sort of feel crummy yourself when you aren't doing stuff or, as you were saying before, kind of dug in about not doing stuff and had to drill-sergeant your way. [00:14:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm always happy I went afterwards. I always enjoy the stuff while I'm in the middle of it, it's just getting there is such a fight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you may also be presenting me with something that's kind of impossible, which is okay. I'm not sure what to make of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's the impossible thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to be doing more things than you want to be doing. I guess I'm sort of inferring that you're presenting that to me (laughing), although I can't tell you what to do about it. Again, which is okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not so much that I want to do more than I want to be doing, it's that I want to be able to do everything. I don't want to have to prioritize and choose; but I think that means the choices get made as defaults or inertia or stick with the status quo instead of actually actively prioritizing and choosing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It's like a passive way of deciding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) [00:16:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know why you don't want to have to decide those things more actively?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just thinking that this has always been a problem. Even going back to high school I couldn't decide what classes I wanted to take in only six class slots, so I just registered for seven classes and didn't have lunch period for two years. (laughs) I just crammed food in my mouth in the five-minute breaks between classes because I couldn't choose. It's just so loaded up with extracurriculars. Even at school, even though I really needed the time to focus on studying and learning material and doing my homework, I still loaded myself down with extracurriculars and kind of made a hash of everything. (pause) [00:18:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:29) (long pause) [00:19:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you may be sort of handing it over to me a bit because for some reason this is hard to think about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think part of it might maybe, but I'm afraid if I pick just one thing to focus on I won't be exceptionally good at it so I'd rather kind of hedge my bets by trying to do a bunch of different things. And if I don't do them well I can always say, "Oh, well. How can I do it well? I haven't really focused a lot of time on it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like a portfolio strategy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:20:27] There is a lot of stuff I do for the recognition, I think, instead of because I actually want to do it kind of in a vacuum. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) There's a group called The Ministry that I actually haven't been a part of because I just couldn't, while I was in grad school, get to meetings. It just kind of conflicted with everything. People on the team have been repeatedly phoning and e-mailing me asking me to come back. It's a community service organization that provides services to people who come to the U.S. as refugee seekers, providing housing and financial support, emotional support and counseling, and for refugee and asylum seekers who are detained. I don't know if you knew this, but people who come to the U.S. seeking refugee or asylee status are put in prisons next to criminals. They are detained there while the government processes their paperwork before they are released, and so there are in prison visits for those people to provide spiritual counseling. It's a multi-faith initiative with counselors from a variety of faith backgrounds to provide appropriate counseling for whatever faith the refugee belongs to. [00:22:05] Certainly, immigration issues are very close to my heart and something I care passionately about, but I'm not sure I would actually be as active in it if it weren't for the fact that it's the sort of thing that good little girl activists are supposed to do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Sort of breaking into [the moral capital]? (inaudible at 00:22:32) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess there's an aspect of kind of "shoring yourself up" running through a lot of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Look. Really I'm a good person because I'm running myself ragged doing all of this community service instead of sitting on my ass, popping bonbons and watching soaps."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "And I'm good enough because I'm not just doing one thing that I happen to enjoy mediocrely, I'm doing all of these things."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you're kind of really having to shore yourself up or stave off this war. [00:23:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm signed up as a mentor for two organizations. And, again, they're both issues that are very important to me and I definitely think that core youth and Latino youth, especially in STEM fields, needed support and role models; but it's a big chunk of time. (chuckles) It's something I enjoy doing, but if I didn't feel almost a sense of obligation in the community as a way of preserving face, if that makes any sense, proving that I care. [00:24:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there anyone else you're having to prove it to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's mostly to myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I figured, but I don't know what the realities are so I ask that. (pause) I guess it does point back towards that quite traumatical part and the kind of combination of complying and digging your heels in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like there's a part of me that feels extraordinarily guilty about everything, like I'm never doing enough, never contributing enough, not giving enough money to charity, not booking enough hours into community service, not doing my best to improve the world around me; and then there is another part of me that's just incredibly resentful of all of this time I spend on other people. The internal monologue is, "I'm doing the best I can and this stuff is hard. Don't I deserve a break already? I've done it." (sighs) It's almost like there are these two halves of me that can't come to any kind of reasonable compromise. (pause) [00:26:31] I'm not sure who I'm trying to be good enough for because, God knows, my parents don't approve of (chuckles) any of the community-service work I do. (pause) And other people in my community from the organizations I belong to think I do enough, so I don't know who I'm trying to convince that I'm a good person. It's not myself. It's all just one big circular tautological mass right there. [00:27:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe some part of it is how your parents looked at you, the kind of strictness and harshness and feeling that you're never good enough, but also some other values that are clearly more your own. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Speaking of my parents, my sister e-mailed me yesterday to say, "By the way, mom and dad have been complaining that you haven't called since the last time we visited." It's like, "Well, you know, they could pick up the phone and call me," but I know they won't because throughout childhood the question of 'who called whom' was always this huge power struggle in my parents' minds. My dad would keep track in a notebook of when he called his brother and then if a holiday rolled around he would look in his notebook. "Oh, last year on this holiday I called him, so he'd better call me." And then if his brother doesn't call him, he'd just sit there and stew and refuse to call and get angrier and angrier and angrier until if his brother does call maybe days or weeks later, it's that his brother is a flake. He'd just explode at him, yell at him, tell him, "Why don't you love me? You're so disrespectful. Does family not mean anything to you? I bet you were drunk." Blah, blah, blah. So I know they won't call me first. I can't even count on my mom to call me because my dad won't let her call family. There were many occasions when mom wanted to call her parents and dad wouldn't let her. [00:29:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because she called them last and they had to call her, which is hypocritical of him because he would also, with my cousins and his nieces and nephews, he would expect them to always call him and he would never call them because elders shouldn't have to call the younger members of the family. Younger members should call them to show respect but he, of course, would say that my mom's elders had to call her because, I don't know, her family isn't real people? It was all kinds of f**ked up, so I have to call them and (laughs) I don't want to. It's kind of my filial duty. (long pause) [00:30:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thing about it is that it seems like you feel, I think, kind of the inevitability of all of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It's a little despairing. I think I've given up hope that my parents will ever behave like decent human beings towards me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where does that leave you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I don't know. I mean I guess I have really two options; the "just cut them off and be done with it" option or the "continue to play the part of a loving daughter" and fulfill what they would see as my obligations to them in order to avoid feeling guilty. (long pause) [00:33:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it's just another impossible choice, isn't it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to be a trend and I think it's for a reason. I think an impossible choice is probably a sign of having some very painful feelings that you don't really want to deal with. That's really a surprising thing for a psychologist to say, I know (both laugh), but there it is. I guess that became clear as we talked about extracurricular activities, that you were sort of trying to stave off feeling really bad about yourself, essentially for one thing or another, and also sort of deceiving yourself a little bit that that's what you were doing—maybe not in pernicious ways a bit, but I guess it's similar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I discovered this story about a year ago. It was kind of a fairy tale from a number of different cultures, The Armless Maiden. Are you familiar with this? The story goes there is a woman who is a girl, a late girlhood/early womanhood, whose father is either malicious or foolish or just thoughtless. He gets in debt or he accidentally gets into a bargain with the devil or a djinn or a demon or whatever. The demon claims ownership of the daughter and the father, in an attempt to do the right thing and save his daughter from being carried off by the devil, cuts off her arms to make her useless so the devil won't want her. Then the daughter goes away, leaves home, gets married, gets pregnant, and she usually marries a prince. The prince goes off to war and, for some reason, the devil or demon or djinn or whatever finds out that she's married and pregnant and engineers a false message from the prince, who is off at war, to the in-laws, the king and queen, telling them, "Kill the girl and her children. She's been unfaithful to me." Blah, blah, blah. And so she leaves the king and the queen's palace and goes out into the woods with her children with no arms and somehow manages to survive and encounters a forest fairy or an angel or, through her own willpower. She regains her arms, grows them herself or is given them back by the angel or the spirit or whatever. Eventually her husband comes back home and asks, "Where the hell are my wife and kids?" and the in-laws say, "Well, you sent them to slaughter," and they discover what happened. He finds the woman and then they go out and they find the demon and they slay the demon that stalked her. That's a rough outline. There are various iterations with more or fewer flourishes. [00:38:12]</p>

<p>It's stuck with me ever since and I think the thing that's stuck with me is this idea that there is this whole recognized archetype and multiple cultures around the world, even ones that are strongly patriarchal, that sometimes fathers just suck. They're either stupid or foolish or malicious, and it sucks; and it sucks to be the child of such a father and it's deeply scarring. It's not until you are well into your own adulthood that you can heal from that and that's completely counter to everything my parents ever told me about cultural values, which is in my culture, "Children never talk back to their fathers," and "You must be American. You can't actually be my children. Your mother must have cheated on me because real Pakistanis or real Muslim daughters would never talk back." It was this constant stream of, "Everyone recognizes this. Parents are always good and how dare you think that we aren't good." [00:39:22]</p>

<p>I only realized maybe a week or two ago that the reason why this story stuck with me and I kept coming back to it and really identifying with the armless maiden in the story, is because there is this validation that, no, actually all of this pressure to put your parents on a pedestal—that it's okay to acknowledge that sometimes your parents just suck. (pause) [00:40:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have two thoughts. The first one is that that sounds very important and telling, that the story would stick with you like that for that reason. The other thought is an additional interpretation, not a replacement I think, but another one that occurs to me as well is that the father very, very misguidedly cripples his daughter so that he won't lose her, which also has resonances with your father as well. I, of course, have no idea where the idea is coming from, but the thing it turns around for me is that all of his cruelty to you seems simply misguided and mean. There is a limit on vulnerabilities in various ways. I never really thought about it as a deliberate attempt to harm you, which reminds me in this way these things are is the opposite of the way these things are, like the opposite of what he was saying, like it was always about how you needed to be better, but the effect of it was to get in the way of your being good or better or feeling good. I don't mean you weren't very competent or successful, but when you've got somebody screeching at you about you coming in second in the state math competition and mocking the hell out of you, that doesn't make you better at stuff. That makes you worse through no fault of your own. I can imagine from what I know of him, he's insulted when his brother doesn't call him on successive holidays, like a year later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible whispering) [00:43:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. It's kind of nuts, but what I was going to say was I can't imagine how insulted he might have felt by his daughter growing up and moving away, as daughters will do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've always been curious how he would react if his son grew up and moved away, but since he doesn't have any sons there's no way to find that out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't mean that to replace your suspicions, but as an additional. We'll stop for now.</p>

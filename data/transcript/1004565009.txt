<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what are the things that do and don't work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next week is probably going to be difficult at all because of the big event is next Friday and Saturday. I'm going to be working longer days all week. The following week I am open 100 percent. Any time. Any day. It doesn't matter. The week after that would either have to be Monday or Tuesday and then I'm traveling and I'm not back until the following Thursday. [00:00:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then after that it's easier. I don't have anything else going on with work or anything like that, so we can actually get back to some things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. So today is Friday the fourth. So next week is just not good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unless it could be something like really early morning prior to Friday or your last appointment on any day besides Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's possible I'll have 5:15 on Tuesday, the eighth, but I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that would work if you do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Assume that I don't. If it opens up I'll let you know. I think it would be more likely that it won't than it will so why don't we plan on not, but I will let you know if it does. I'm sort of making a note here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Okay. So that's that. Also, if I have something early in the morning which, for me, is like 7:00 to 7:45, I will let you know if something can work. The following week, which is the week of the 14<sup>th</sup>, you said you're pretty flexible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Is 9:15 on Thursday any good?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I think I can invite you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really? I can put it in my thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then the following week is the 25<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's the week of the 21<sup>st</sup>. Friday is the 25<sup>th</sup>. I'm here the 20<sup>th</sup> and the 22<sup>nd</sup> and then I'm only back on the 31<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. The 20<sup>th</sup>. [00:03:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: 21<sup>st</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup>. Monday or Tuesday and then I'm gone the 23<sup>rd</sup> through the 30<sup>th</sup> and back on the 31<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I have a cancellation on the 21<sup>st</sup> mid-day, like 11:45.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be fine. Why don't we just put this appointment on the center of my calendar.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Monday, 11:45.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so we have the 17<sup>th</sup> at 9:15.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the 21<sup>st</sup>. Then you said you're gone the 23<sup>rd</sup> through the 30<sup>th</sup>?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. 9:15 May 17<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 11:45 on the 21<sup>st</sup>. Let's see. Then starting Friday, the first. Friday the 12:30 time works for me regularly if that works for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Friday June 1<sup>st</sup> 12:30 moving forward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Okay. My goodness, here we go then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 12:30? Repeat every Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the next time we're meeting after today is the 17<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Unless I get something on the eight at 5:15 or early in the morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'll just put this on the right calendar.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. Do you need to leave before half-past today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Good. I think you had said in an e-mail you might. [00:07:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I might, but I'm not too worried about it after all. We're just gearing up for this big event that's happening, which is our advisory committee. It's 200 people. It's a dinner. It's panels during the days. It's lunches at the faculty club. It's a luncheon. It's a big thing. And my supervisor — I think I had mentioned that I was feeling frustrated with her. Did I mention that? I felt like she hadn't really been checking in enough [ ](multiple voices at 00:07:58) how the events had been going. And she always gets a little bit pissy around advisory committee just because she's dealing with all this stuff, which I understand you're dealing with a lot of stuff. I might handle frustration like that in my regular life, but at work I don't tend to handle my frustration that way. But she just gets really pissy and really snappy at everybody, especially at me and Betty. You know Betty is her direct assistant and then I'm working on the event details and all that. Like today, we were asking her about printing the table bios for the dinner — the keynote and the musical performance. [inaudible] is our keynote, which is pretty cool. Anyway, she looked at us and she was like, "I didn't okay those." I was like, "Oh, I'm sorry, Stephanie had sent you the .pdf that she had made of it based off the bios that I thought you had already approved." "No. I didn't get that. I didn't do that" [00:09:13] Okay. And so I forwarded her that e-mail and I said, "I've also attached the dinner and lunch menus for the tables for you to review once again just in case you didn't see them. Let us know." And then she wrote back and she said Trina, I did see these. I said that I hadn't approved them. And then she's all frustrated because, "Well, I just don't understand. It says [Traliar Allbright then right below it, it says Mr. Traliar Albright BA 2010](inaudible at 00:09:45) or whatever the hell it was. I just don't understand why these things aren't common sense to everybody." I was like, "Well, who sent her those bios?" I was thinking that she did, but even if she didn't send them, she was to have approved them beforehand anyway." Betty behind me said, "I did." I was like, "Oh. Well, maybe Stephanie didn't" . . . whatever . . . you were supposed to look at this anyway and it's not Stephanie's fault. Maybe she thought it was part of the title or whatever. Don't get all bitchy about it. Just a couple of little things like that. Like she's been frustrated with Betty because Betty has some holes in the database of who is coming and who is not or whatever. She is like, "She's not checking these correctly." All I could think was, "Well, then you didn't show her how to check them correctly. This is her first year doing it." Not to mention that the database, the whole invitation situation for this week — we sent out 450 invitations — it's f**ked. We're using Filemaker as our database. [00:10:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. No wonder it's not . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Isn't that Windows 98 or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's awful. She taught me how to use it and I was like in my head I'm like [ ](inaudible at 00:11:05) and we're getting a new database system which is great, but I'm really pushing them to go for the portion of the database program that allows you to do event management because for something like this, where you can have an online registration thing, we could have all the information in one place. It would go automatically into the database of responses. Betty wouldn't have to be clicking on this and clicking on that. Filemaker is ridiculously complicated to work with in terms of this kind of thing. On top of that, we have some .pdf format that was supposed to be able to click a button that said "send e-mail response", but it wasn't working a lot of times. We weren't getting faxes so she made like 180 calls of people that we hadn't heard from and many of them were saying, "Oh, I sent it," or, "Oh, I couldn't get it to work and so I didn't know what to do." The system is ridiculous so for you to kind of blame Betty for not doing it right is kind of f**ked up. Not to mention it's her first year doing this, an event of this caliber or size. Things have been a little bit tense in that regard. [00:12:24] I think that the issue that I was having by you and whatever, we kind of in the last couple of weeks have been bickering and at each others' throats. We had a big talk about it the other night and I was like, "I really just can't deal with all the bickering." He kind of blamed a lot of it on me and how I'm reacting to things and why I'm assuming this and why I'm assuming that. Part of it was true, based in truth, in terms of me being overly sensitive, especially when I'm stressed out. I didn't really think it was fair. I said to him, "I don't really think it's fair that it feels like I'm the only one that's at fault with the issues we have and why we fight." I tried to bring up some issues about him being kind of argumentative or debative and he was like, "Well, I'm not arguing or debating. I'm just having a conversation." I was like, "Well, it doesn't feel like a conversation when it feels like you're trying to convince me that the way you're seeing it is the right way." [00:13:36] So the other night we were watching Avatar or something on TV and I was like, "This movie was okay. It was pretty cool. But I really don't see what the huge 'whoop' was about. Everybody went nuts for it." And he said, "I loved this movie. It's awesome." And I was like, "No, I think it's really cool. I think a lot of why it was so popular is because it's the first movie in awhile that was so visually stimulating in the scenes with the Avatar." He was like, "True, but it's not just about that. It has a character plot. I don't think of it as the graphics, I think of it as they're people." I was like, "No, of course." It was like a conversation but you can see where it was turning into a "Well, no." "Oh yeah, I see." "Well, yeah." "Oh yeah, I see." So then I said, "Oh, that's true, but it's really also visually stimulating so I feel that adds to the draw even more." He came back with, "Yeah, but you don't have to just look at it for that." And I literally had to stop him and be like, " I'm not debating the fact that it had a character plot." He was like, "Well, I'm not debating either. I'm just trying to get you to have a different viewpoint on it." And I was like, "But I don't need one. I'm not disagreeing with you. That's fine. I'm just commenting that it's really visually stimulating." And it was like okay. That was it. But I could tell that he was annoyed that I stopped him. [00:15:01] (chuckles) And then ten minutes later some cool thing comes on and he's like, "Look at how cool that looks." In my head I'm like, "Hmm. I thought it was just a movie with characters." (snickers) I mean it was fine because I've been doing that a little bit more, but it makes me feel a little bit worried because is that what I want? I don't want that to be forever that I'm always having to stop him from something that will turn into literally a back-and-forth that could last an hour or possible turn into another fight. It's making me like okay, is this something like, again, a personality flaw of his that I'm not okay with? Something that we have different ways of approaching conversations that we have to kind of clarify? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're questioning whether it's kind of something about him where he feels he's got to be sort of right or have convinced you of some way that he sees things in a way that, I guess, sort of bothers you and is annoying and that you explicitly have to put the breaks on? Or just different ways the two of you go about talking about things? [00:16:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's a little of both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But this is what you're wondering about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do I have that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. The other day I said to him when we were getting ready, "You know, I'm sorry that things have been a little bit tense lately and we have been on each other's throats. I don't want that to be how it is and I'm hopeful that this will improve." And he said, "I already feel that it has." So clearly the whole "me" — after we had that conversation "this is what I do, this is what I do, this is what we do" — even though I might have felt he didn't like that I was tied up but I'm not debating this, he seems to think that it's helped improve on the bickering, which it has, so that's great. But it did bother me that when we were talking about it that it did feel like it was being put on me in terms of the whole "this is why we're bickering." "Because you're stressed and you're worried and you're this and you're that and you're overreacting."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you would like him to talk about things with him in, if I've got it, a more harmonious or less argumentative sort of way. And it seems like stuff is actually registering with him in a good way, but it's kind of annoying what you have to go through to get there. [00:18:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly. Right. Yeah, and I was talking to my friend about it and she was . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a bit more conflictual than it seems like it has to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And my friend kind of was like — you know I was talking to her about all my concerns — and she was the one that was like, "Well, is that really what you want? To marry somebody that you have to put the breaks on the conversation or stop it from being unpleasant?" And I think there's more to it than that. And she said, "Obviously right now you're just kind of venting. You don't know what happens in people's lives." She's going through a divorce right now. She's just recently separated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) It's like, "Do you want to marry somebody like that? Do you want to marry somebody who eats breakfast? Do you want to marry somebody that wears shoes?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. I know for a fact also that just me being extremely busy at work, I'm just tired, more irritable, super focused. I can't stop thinking about work hardly at home. [00:19:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We did get a new bedroom set last weekend, so we got our mattress. It's great and I love it. I'm still getting used to it a little bit but I think that's just because I was sleeping for so long on such a sinky, soft, awful mattress, to have something that's firm enough, I probably don't know how to adjust. But it's really, really comfy and the space is great except if I end up too far in the middle of the bed, I have to climb over to turn my alarm clock off. (laughs) But it's really much more comfortable. [00:20:04] And then we ended up going to a couple places because we wanted to get furniture that matched. I was like, "Enough of this Craig's List hodge podge of crap in our room." At first I was like, "Oh, we'll, just get the bed. Who cares?" And I was like, "No, it would be nice to get a grown up nice room where everything has it's place and everything isn't out getting dusty because it doesn't have a drawer or whatever." We ended up going to <a name="OLE_LINK1" id="OLE_LINK1"></a>Furniture Central where they have a rental center downstairs and upstairs they have their clearance thing of stuff that was rented in the past or whatever. We ended up with a really nice matching set of a headboard, two nightstands, really nice nightstands, two dressers that match, one of which has a mirror, and we only spent $800, which is really good looking at what things cost, especially for king size. It's great. So I'm feeling very comfortable and at peace in my room, which is nice. We put up some art on the walls. It's just a lot more comfortable, which is definitely nice and soothing, I guess — to feel like your bedroom is not just a place to sleep, but a nice place to hang out, where you like to get ready, where your things are located. So that honestly has probably also helped both of us relax a little bit that much more and wake up a little bit more nicely. [00:21:35] I think I'm really dying to get through next weekend because it's all I can really think about. It's just a busy month. Then the weekend of the 18<sup>th</sup> he's going away for a competition that our friends that live out there are throwing. We've had this planned for awhile that we were all going to go together, a bunch of us were going to carpool, we were going to stay at our friend's house, then I decided that I wasn't going to go to save money. He was kind of like, "Well, I really want you to go. How much money will it really take?" But if you think about it, it's one more person for gas to pitch in, so that would really be like $20 each, the event is $15 each, they're going to want to eat and drink and maybe smoke, whatever. That's going to cost money and it's just going to be double if both of us go. I know that it might sound a little petty, but I think also another part of it has to do with how busy things have been and having advisor committee the weekend before and then Wednesday after — I get back on Sunday and then the Wednesday after fly out for the work conference until the following Tuesday night — it just I think feels like a lot. So the idea of having a weekend at home by myself is really attractive. (laughs) [00:23:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds to me like you're coming around to explaining this as actually because you're tired and you'd just rather not go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not that the money isn't important, but that's a justification for what you actually really feel like doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think also I don't want to hurt his feelings by being like, "Oh, I don't want to go and watch you compete because I'm tired," and I think he would understand and it's something that I can say. I said it like, "Plus with things being so busy it will be nice to be home. I can relax and get some things done." But I do think that's the actual main motivation of being like, "Oh, well . . " Oh, and he's also coming to the work event now. Well, kind of. The ticket ended up being more expensive than I thought. The reason I'd said, "You should come," is because I thought it was a $300 ticket, and the ticket price went up. We had to change the dates because he didn't get the time off after all, even though they said he could have it and then they went back on it. That was an extra $65. It ended up being more. So he'll come. I'm there Wednesday and then I'm taking red eye on Tuesday. He's going to come Friday night and take the red eye on Monday, which is Memorial Day, because he couldn't get any time off. It sucks for him because he's literally going to have to go from the airport red-eyed to work. But he said he wanted to do it, so that's fine. It will be really nice. It will be fun, but that also is like another reason I'd rather spend that money then. [00:24:49] I don't need a place, because we don't have to pay for a place to stay. I'll be in the hotel for work for two of the nights that he's there and then the last night we're staying at a friend of mine's. [ ](inaudible at 00:25:06]) graciously, "Oh, I don't think I'll be there," he and his partner, Clint. "You guys can have free rein." That's awesome. It's a lot of stuff going on. For the month of May and it's enough. I'm just going to stay home that weekend. He can just enjoy the guys. I know the girlfriend that's wanted me to be there will be disappointed that I'm not going to be there and I'll be disappointed not to see them, but it's going to be really nice, (laughs) I have to say. For the first weekend in however long — because even this weekend I'm going to be thinking about the thing next week and last weekend we were doing that stuff and running all over creation. Tomorrow is a free day and I'm going to enjoy it. Tonight I'm babysitting right after work until 11. Sunday I'm babysitting 11:30 AM until 8:00 PM, which is wildly long. In the e-mail where she requested, she was like, "It's a long one." That's a long day with a 2½ year old who is potty training. (laughs) Yeah, so that will be a nice break. [00:26:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine that there's something that feels nice about being here today. It's that we're talking about things and working through a few things from your point of view, given how much you're having to deal with and how busy things are and how much you're having to deal with what other people want from you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yep. Exactly. I was actually really looking forward for that reason. I was like, "If I wanted to I could just figure this out. It would be fun and I wouldn't have to talk to anybody and nobody would ask me anything. Yes. So definitely, it's a nice feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like that's not so much a feature of your life at the moment, although clearly things will slow down in the not-too-distant future. But also, I think, it's something that's not always easy for you to ask for and that you feel that you have to provide justification for, or feel maybe a little apprehensive about at times. Though those are pretty important as well. In other words, it's just part of being busy at the moment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. I think it's a combination. I was talking to a friend. I was just going to talk to him about being stressed out and not really knowing what to do at some times and how to handle that. He's a couple of years older than me. He's 30. He's not super old and knowledgeable, but he said one of the things that I have learned or taught myself — and this is super not applicable in every situation — but his theory is do whatever you want, whenever you want, because you're the only person who can live your life. So worrying about what you're doing all the time and if you're doing it right or at the right time is just going to make you feel more stressed. I feel what he's saying. I don't know about the "do whatever you want where ever you want" thing. I think that's a little bit too open to interpretation for me to wrap your head around, but the whole "nobody else can live your life but you" thing made sense. It gave me something to kind of think about and toss around, thinking about making a decision not to go, making the decision to take two weekdays off so I can go see Amanda when she has weekdays off, little things like that. [00:29:03]</p>

<p>I haven't really spoken to my parents. I had this big blow-up with my mom. Did I tell you about that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Last night [ ](inaudible at 00:29:18) was dropping off my car and, as it turned out, that was another $900 worth of freaking work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway, I didn't have the money and I had cut up my credit cards because I didn't want to use them anymore and I had to ask my mom if I could borrow money. She said, "Well, why don't you have your credit cards?" I was like, "Well, because I don't want to use them anymore. I cut them up." She was like, "Well, that was a really stupid thing to do." I was like, "Thanks. I know." We ended up just fighting about the money thing and I was like, "Fine, I'll just take a cash advance on my credit cards and pay you back everything because I feel like shit for owing you." She was like, "That's not the point." I got offended because she was like, "Well, why don't you come over and we can talk about how you can manage your finances better because you clearly need some help?" I was like, "No, I don't want to do that." We ended up e-mailing back and forth a bunch and at the end she said, "I think one of the reasons I started panicking when you were telling me about the car and the expenses was because you were panicking. I was kind of reacting to that, telling you it was stupid to cut up the cards." And I was trying to say, "Mom, I appreciate your offer for advice. I just don't feel comfortable doing that and I also really want to be making more of an effort to work things out on my own or with a financial advisor or something, rather than my parents." [00:30:44] She was like, "Well, it's not about your parents. It's just I've been around a long time and I can give advice." She wasn't really seeing the whole inappropriate side of it because I think that she really wanted to be able to say, "You should be doing this and you shouldn't be doing that." And I said, "I do appreciate the offer but I do know all the things I should and shouldn't be doing. I don't want to tell you what I'm spending my money on. I don't want you to be like, 'Well, maybe you shouldn't be drinking that much' or 'Why are you spending so much on whatever? What is this for? Why are you eating out so much?'" and "(gasp) You get Dunkin' Donuts twice a week?" It was hard for her to understand that. I just told her I really want to be making more of an effort not to be asking you about every little piece of advice like, "Should I pick (inaudible at 00:31:45) which I have a tendency to do. I have a tendency to report like, "This weekend we went and we found this really great bedroom set and it's only $800" "Oh, $800?" "Well, yeah, but it's really good. Why? You don't think I should have gotten it?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it bothers [Franklin](inaudible at 00:32:07]) because they know a lot and he's like, "Some things I want to keep private, like the whole divorce thing." It bothers me, too, because it really doesn't give me as much freedom to know what's best for me, I guess, because I'm always thinking, "Well, I think I know what's best for me but let me see what my parents think." [00:32:30] I think they're just so used to that, that me kind of pulling back they don't get. But she did take that conversation and she understood it and she hasn't really reached out to me and I haven't tried to reach out to her too much. There's not really been too much to talk about. She sent me a nice text message yesterday just like, "Oh, this is what's going on. I'm checking in. Are you busy? How's everything? Hope to talk to you soon." I wrote her back and said, "That sounds all good. I'm super busy. Love you. Call you soon." And I think that's fine. I think it was hard to have those difficult e-mails between me and my mom, but it's seeming like things are okay now. I think also some of the way I'm feeling about them has to do with Michael and being so frustrated at their whole way of handling his ridiculous mess of life, I guess. It's kind of better for me to back away right now while they help him figure it out, because I have my own shit to figure out. I don't want them to think they have to worry about me and think that I have to show them that everything is okay. So that was a good thing to happen. I don't know if she told my dad what happened and that's why he's been a little more hands off or if he just read it maybe in the tone of my voice when I spoke to him the last couple of times where I was just, "I'm really busy. Maybe we can have lunch in the next couple of weeks but I'll let you know." So he's taken the cue I guess. [00:34:17] To be honest, it has definitely reduced some of the stress in my life. Between everything else to not have to think about my parents worrying about me is helpful. So that's good. And now it's Friday and I have tomorrow to sleep in and I just want to push through next week. And I know it will go well. I know the event is going to be fine. I just kind of want to get it over with at this point. It's just so much planning. It's just such a relief when it's done. So the week after that it's going to be no events, nothing going on until I have to leave, but I'm excited about the trip. I think it will be really nice, a good experience. (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The really stressful part is really, I guess, the next week and a half?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The next week. Yeah. And I think that just not really knowing what to expect at the conference, but I'm helping out with the bookstand. I don't really have any super-duper commitments. It's just going to be for me in a new city, trying on new restaurants. Hopefully they'll hang out with my friend during the evening because I'm going with my executive director and our publications director, who are both like 60. (laughs) So now I'm really like, "Hey, do you want to go to that cool bar I heard about?" I'm feeling good. I think this is helpful to come in like you said and not expect things of me or myself. (chuckles) I'm only hoping the weather holds because that would suck if it were rainy all week next week. We'll see. [00:36:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We just have a minute or two, but is there anything else that's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Why? Are you sensing anything?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. You sort of seemed a little anxious in the last couple of minutes or something, but I don't know. Maybe I'm just not reading that right or maybe you're just thinking about the rest of the week . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think probably just not particularly more anxious than I came in here. I think less. But I think I was just switching gears going back to . . . I think I'm just also very tired today and I'm just so excited for the end of the day. Even though I'm babysitting, she goes to bed at seven so I can relax for awhile. I think I'm just kind of like, "Okay, final push of the week and then next week." No, I'm not particularly anxious about anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, well we'll stop for now. Good luck getting through all of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Let me know if anything cancels next week and if not, I'll see you afterwards.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alrighty. Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. You, too.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that's okay. Actually I had a lot of e-mail I had to do, so, um...there's today something called a denial-of-service attack on Google for the e-mail services.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. I heard gmail was down. I didn't know that was the reason.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They're startin' to think it was a strategized thing to make it go down, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's always interesting cuz people are like "why can't I e-mail?" and I'm like well you're sending an e-mail now so I think that it's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yes. So (sigh) I'm going home tomorrow morning first thing. I'm really actually very excited about that, so cuz I've really been quite homesick and so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had to, I have to work on Sunday and to make it saner for the trip I sort of had to bribe somebody to take my shift.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which was interesting. I had to take...for working four hours for me I had to take eight hours of their shift plus pay them. But eight hours of my shift is an hour and a half so it's like...long story short I had to bribe somebody basically to take my shift on Sunday because no one wants to work on Sunday in spring, ya know so. But, um, I think it's just gonna...hopeful...if this does go through it will make it a lot easier for the drive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As opposed to trying to drive down Wednesday, spend Thursday, Friday and then drive back Saturday so I can be at work at 8 a.m. on Sunday. That would be too hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, sounds better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I'm looking forward to that a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I'm just missing home so...I, ya know, I haven't really specifically made any direct plans but it is...this is the time of year, um, that the carnival is there so there's a lot of people...that is more, more alumnus come home for carnival than they do for, for...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...for homecoming, cuz we just don't do football really that well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um, chances are I'll either be able to run into people I know and/or just, ya know, be able to see some faculty I know cuz with this time off, so...that was exciting. Um...I'm trying to think what else is exciting. That's pretty much the big thing that's going on. Then, ohh (sighs)...I don't know. I just...Mike's been home a lot. Like yesterday he came...I was getting off work and he's like I'm just finishing up right now so do you want me to come out and get you? And like, well I guess if you're finishing up work at 1:15 sure, but one would think that you would still have stuff to do...something, ya know? So...that's. ya know, it's getting a little frustrating not just because of that I worry about his, ya know, work ethic slash career but also just because it gets to be...like sometimes I just...I want some time without him around and although I'm sleeping a lot of the time while he's there it's just...it's hard to explain but there has been a recent - recent being in the past couple of yearsâ€”thing where he will not do anything on his own unless I am doing something right alongside him. It's not that he doesn't want to I don't think. I think it just doesn't dawn on him that he should pick up the dirty dishes or something like that ya know? And so it's frustrating. This happened original...well not orginally but it really was pointed was when we were moving here. I had injured my back. I had just gotten epidural steroid shots and so I had to lie flat on my back. I mean I was having, um...I was having like muscle spasms so bad that people, people thought it was like seizures. I thought it didn't look like seizures...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:04:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but yeah. And, ya know, he seemed very nice to me. His idea is guarding me, ya know, this and that. And like I really just need you to pack some boxes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need you to do something. I can't direct you from bed. I need you just to do something. And, I know that maybe I'm picky about things and so he gets paralyzed about like what to do? I don't know. But it's just kinda frustrating ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way you describe it as being incredibly passive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, ya know, it just (pause) it gets to be too much sometimes ya know? He's really passive except for certain things. Um, usually things that are entertaining, ya know? (pause) But it just...I honestly believe the biggest reason why he has such little self-esteem and he feels like a failure is cuz he hasn't put an honest amount of work into anything that he'd be proud of. Ya know, it is really common for people that have Ph.D.s or do whatever to say they don't feel like they really earned it. They feel like they cheated the system or they've done this or they don't really feel like they've done it. Really? He has. He's earned that feeling, ya know? Like he hasn't really been able to, ya know, put the work in. And so it's really frustrating because at some point he's gonna have to learn to do this, ya know? And I can't do it for him. I can't even lecture him on it, ya know? I am really frustrated because even though I go out of my way to try and find things that are fun for him to do, if I am any way critical of those things he gets kind of bitter and angry. Like oh well, yeah maybe the gaming thing might not be such a great idea for this, ya know, situation or whatever. Ya know. It's like I'm not trying to take it away from you or else I wouldn't have been looking this stuff up on the Internet, ya know? And, ya know, I scheduled last weekend...he went out on Friday night gaming and then he came back in and he was just in a really bad mood. He had a bad headache and all this stuff and I'm like okay, whatever. And I had scheduled, um, recently a hair appointment - long story, I'll explain this is in a second - at the same time as the same gaming group gets together on that Saturday afternoon. Thinking that, ya know, he gets like a game while I'm doing that and like I was sending him messages like, ya know, I'm getting my hair blow dried, I'll be done. And I called him and he said, oh! You're ready to go! I'm like yeah it's four o'clock. I went there at one. And he just...it never dawned on him by me saying this that it meant it's time to wrap things up now. I can't be mothering him, but, ya know...I would think...I'm not trying to be passive-aggressive. I'm trying to say like literally, ya know, this is what's happening and have him make that conclusion, ya know, that maybe it's time to go. But...and I'm not trying to make like drive him away from these things but I'm the one that like planned this and suggested hey, ya know what? I'm gonna go...I have to get this done anyways. Why don't I do it at the same time that the guys you like to play games with are playing games. But it's always like...it always seems to be that you give him an inch on these things and he takes a mile, ya know? And it makes me feel like crap, because ya know I buy him a game and he plays the game a lot, ya know? Or like this and that, and I (sigh) (pause), ya know, and it's, it's just really frustrating. Like I know he's playing (inaudible at 00:07:56) a lot and it's like I just...don't know what to do. I can't be a gatekeeper. I don't want to be a gatekeeper, but it's like he has no self-control at...all. Yet at the same time he's so self-controlled that he's terrified to say certain things to me, ya know? Like I find that habit annoying, or like he's so controlled over everything else that, ya know, that it's...it's so weird, ya know? And so I just...I feel really frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound really frustrated. [00:08:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? I'm more pissed off because I had to go get my hair dyed because I had a couple of customers complain that my roots were looking too long, so I was really pissed. That I was looking unkempt at work. I don't understand why some of the people do this. I didn't think it was that bad. So I had to get my hair dyed. (pause). I...to this day I still think it might have been lost in translation, like cuz it was passed on this information...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. By telephone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was just trying to grow out my hair color, like, so I guess I had to get it dyed again to...I don't know. Whatever. I was just pissed about that part, but, um...ya know, and I was just already in kind of a cranky mood about that and then I don't know, just (pause) I don't know...it's just been really a...just...I can't manage his life for him. I really can't. And so (pause) sometimes it's really frustrating because I need him to do things without me, even prompting him to do them, ya know? It's almost like the act of seeing me limp around cleaning around the house makes him want to get up and do stuff then. Cuz he feels bad cuz he sees me cleaning things up. And like, well, that's great and all, but can't you just do it, ya know? I don't know. There are a lot of things out there that I can understand being concerned about, like maybe packing boxes. You know, like I don't know how you want to mark this or I don't know if this is like packed full enough. But let's be honest here. The dishwasher, like we've got that down pat as to what is and is not like, ya know, okay to do. There's nothing...if it hasn't broken by now it won't break, ya know? I've had all this stuff for years. Same thing like, like ya know, throwing stuff, the garbage out. If it's in the garbage chances are I really don't...I mean I can understand having doubts over whether or not he's doing something right. But these are pretty concrete things, ya know? Recycling goes in the bin, ya know. These are not big things, but it's just (pause)...and so I just feel like....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you hate being this frustrated...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and this mad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you wish there was some reasonable way to avoid this? Though I don't think you can find one. [00:11:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that it wouldn't bother me if he was at work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cuz, I mean I have some vague idea what he does when he sits around the house all day, not entirely, but I think most of it involves like video games that I'm kind of already frustrated about. Cuz it's like, ya know, it seems to be that he can only play...he can't play anything a little bit. He can't just like only play something five hours a week, ya know. It has to be a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like, ya know...and it's just really frustrating. (pause) And, ya know, if he was at work then he would be out of my hair and I could just clean in peace, ya know? But the fact that I know that the reason why he's up and doing this stuff is because of the fact that, ya know, he felt guilty. He's seeing me model behavior or whatever. And it's just...I don't know. (pause) It is...for a person who rarely sees my in-laws I feel like I am constantly with them nearby because I know he's terrified of certain behaviors because of certain things, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a father...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, like, ya know, okay like doing things wrong, therefore you don't do this or do that, ya know? Like I may be doing something wrong. I don't want to get in trouble so I just won't do it at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or they've always made fun of me for like not being very good at something so I won't ever do it again, ya know? And so...but ya know I rarely see them but boy they're around a lot, ya know? And it's just, it's kinda gettin' to me, ya know? I mean when I talk to him he...usually when he knows about it he explains that part of the reason why he felt this way is some sort of assumption...either he hadn't thought at all about it or there's some assumption that he has that's not quite right and</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. I'm confused.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like either he's not thought about like oh! Well, you said you're, you're, you're almost done. I guess that means I should not start a new game, ya know. Um, or like, ya know, that he'd not thought about it at all or the whole thing of like when I was on the phone he started thinking I was mad at him about something, ya know, because that would be something that because of my tone or what I've said reminds him of things in the past where like family members would actually be saying something because they're angry, ya know, and therefore (pause). Ya know, it's like he's oblivious or he's spending time trying not to get in trouble.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:14:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know, it's easier, like it's easier not to get in trouble by not being there or, ya know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...I don't know. It's just, it's just exhausting, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, what it sounds like more from what you're describing is that it's infuriating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you really don't want to be mad at him and I think you mostly feel bad for him, but, uh, sort of...I think what just happened was your version of a tirade.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. Oh, trust me. I've gone on tirades before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I never really even said anything, ya know, at all. (pause) I just wanted something to happen while I was gone or I wanted to be at work or something, ya know? It is becoming maybe infuriating, maybe exhausting, maybe all of the above, um, to have to deal with this, ya know? And (pause) I don't have any way of being able to make things change.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't know what to do, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what if that's true that there really isn't anything you can do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I guess I could just change the way I reacted to it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From? (pause) From like what to what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To like if there's nothing I can do to change it then I have to change the way I react to it bothering me or (pause). [00:16:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is it that you react now? I mean again to me it's not...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I cry and I feel very frustrated and very, ya know, everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? Maybe I just have to stop thinking about it, stop letting it bother me. (pause) Do you know what I mean? I mean I don't what else to...I don't know what other answers I've got, ya know. If I can't change something else, I have to change myself. That's the only way I know how to operate and so (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he know how much this all frustrates you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm certain that he does. I'm certain he's forgotten about it immediately afterwards because that's a coping mechanism for him, but I know I've told him. Probably not that recently. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. What would it...what would it involve to change how you react? In other words like in my mind I'm not quite clear how you do that (pause) which (pause)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know at this point. I mean I've (sighs) (pause) I don't know. I mean I've done a lot of self-indoctrination in my life where I've had to deal with things that were very upsetting and have to change how I react to them and so I don't really know the beginning with this one, but I don't know, ya know. Um, it's, I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow that this is really driving you nuts to the point of being very overwhelming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. Sometimes I can be fine too. It depends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it matters what...how much focus I'm willing to give it, ya know? How much I'm willing to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look, I mean you're saying that (pause) he can't really work much. He...(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can't? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doesn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't. He, um, doesn't take initiative with things around the house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He (pause) is generally either absorbed in what he's doing, like in an addictive sort of way, um, and/or is kind of otherwise oblivious to things you're...a lot of things you're telling him. And forgets immediately when you try to take up any of this kind of stuff with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, that's all a pretty huge deal and must be very frustrating, isolating, um (pause)...I'm going with frustrating and isolating. Uh, and I'm not sure what you can do about it either, but I can't imagine being able to kind of genuinely talk yourself into a different reaction. Ya know what I mean? Like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean I guess I could, like I don't know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you really stop and think about it, um, at least in terms of what it feels like to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:20:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine actually it feels like a whole lot of neglect and if I just think about it from the point of view of what the experience of all this is like for you, forgetting about, ya know, what's going on with him and what he's struggling with all of that, ya know he's really not sort of in a way paying attention or taking care of the things that are important to you. It sounds like it feels extremely neglectful. [00:21:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But at the same time yeah and he does a lot of things above and beyond what many people would not do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He does?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I mean it's very easy to see this like passivity as being well, he's keeping an eye on me while I'm sleeping to make sure everything's okay, ya know. Which like, ya know, like when I'm taking a nap and he's just sort of sitting right next to me for hours? He's sort of keeping watch over me to make sure I'm okay, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I didn't know he...</p>

<p>CLIENT: He usually sits right next to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you're taking a nap?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like the chair is right next to the bed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's like on the computer or something and watching you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if he's watching me or not but in theory you could guess so, yeah. I had the horrifying experience of finding out that I could be right next to him and he'd be looking at things he shouldn't be. I haven't seen it yet because he's very good. He's extremely good at switching...like he switches screens like you wouldn't believe, and I find it very shady but yeah he sits right next to me most of the time, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) this, uh, so he's being very attentive to you that, like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean it's, it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were only using this as an example of how he does...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like he'll give me...like he will like if I'm really tired he'll often like, ya know, make sure the bed is made up and maybe sometimes read to me for a little bit or something like that and then he goes off and does his thing, ya know? It's...there are things that are different, ya know. Does that make sense? He puts up with a lot of crap from me that I think is probably above and beyond what other people would do, so I guess...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what? [00:22:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the fact that like for the past three or four weeks I've been driven to work just about every day like in the morning because I've been in so much pain that I haven't really...I've been exhausted or something. Or the the race made it so that my bus wouldn't be able to get me there in time or whatever, um, to be able to get to work and ya know so he's done that and so he's given a decent bit of his morning to take me in to do something, ya know...drive me to work. Um, that's, ya know, a pretty big deal. Um, ya know like I said sometimes he goes out of his way to make sure that, ya know, if I've had a really hard day that ya know I get tucked in and that kind of stuff, so I mean it is caring in its own way sort of. I...first thing in the morning, ya know, I'm often like in too much pain to even make myself some breakfast so he often throws hot water on and brings it to me, ya know, so I can have oatmeal, that kind of...I mean there are things that he does...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...very, very kind, sweet things. They're just different things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're things that if I were not injured that would not make any sense I guess. Ya know? If I weren't sick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um (pause) I guess my point is really this: It seems to me that there are...there may be a sense to which you don't want to put some of the pieces together about (pause) what he doesn't do and how much it affects you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because really how much it makes you angry and makes you feel alone and my point isn't to say that like you should leave. This is bad. He is bad. I'm not trying to make a...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...statement like that...I won't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I can't. I've been in for penny and for pound. I've put everything I have into this and I can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not in any way...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I'm not saying that you are. I'm just simply stating a fact that I have invested into this so much that I cannot do that, so (pause). [00:25:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, (pause) yeah, I'm saying that it, it's like having emotional paucity or stirring things up that I think are hard to look at cuz they're so painful and because there's so little you can think to do about that really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I mean what do I do? (pause) I don't know. I just sort of put up with it, ya know? I wish it would end. (pause) You know I just...(pause) I'm not saying that I want him to read my mind. I'm really not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you're not. [00:26:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just saying that, ya know...and like I said he does a lot of things. He does all of the grocery shopping at this point. So there are tasks he does. He takes care of the dog and things like that. I just don't want him to walk by something that is filthy and leave it there. That's all I'm asking. I'm not asking like for him to clean up after my messes. I'm not talking about anything like that. I just want like, ya know...if he says to me oh don't worry,, don't get up and take that to the dishwasher I'll...or don't take that into the kitchen, I'll take it. That means to put it in the dishwasher, not like put it on the table in the kitchen that's not near the dishwasher even or in the dishwasher, ya know? That's all I'm asking for. Ya know? Or if he doesn't know what to do ya know asking well what do I need to do? Ya know. I'm not asking for big things. I'm just (pause) ya know I just (pause) There...it has gotten a lot better. I mean years ago when I've had surgery I was terrified to have more of it because he was just not capable of taking care of me at all. Terrified of having the surgery because I'd be like, because when I had my gallbladder out, um, I had a tremendous amount of complications with it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and, um, ya know he would just freak out and stare at me. But he now knows like what to do in like most situations and he does actually...he's gotten a lot better about that. I put off having my right arm surgery for years until like the actual area ruptured because I was terrified of not being able to be taken care of and he's gotten a lot better. Like if I am in a critical situation he is tremendously better, and this may sound like I'm bargaining or like this, but it is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you sounded like you were bargaining a few minutes ago but this doesn't sound like bargaining. This is like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is like justification. It's like oh wow, look, he's gotten so much better. Like if I am in danger, if something bad...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like you're just saying like this sounds like perspective, that this...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he's gotten a lot better, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:28:29) you can say good things without it being defensive, like (laughs)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I just need to say that, ya know. But he has gotten significantly better. Cuz for years I would be terrified. Like even now I don't think I would feel that bad about having...I have to...there's surgeries I have put off for years in general because there's so many of those, so much a pain in the ass. And there's just like...it just, it just opens up another can of worms to have to do something. I have a lot of things I need to get done. I just don't feel like it right now, and so...cuz I would be having like surgeries and procedures for a living pretty much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:29:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, um, I wouldn't even feel uncomfortable being by myself in the city with him being the only person to take of me at this point if I were to have something done. I would actually be okay with that. Which is a huge difference than the way things used to be, but, um (pause) ya know it's just, it's just really frustrating, ya know? I even, like I said, yeah maybe I'll say something. I only want to...I don't expect him to read my mind. I just would like him to be able to like (pause) (sigh) if I say something remember it just a little bit, ya know? It's really kind of...it is disturbing and befuddling in a whole new level of, ya know, understanding because he's really good if he had to. When he forgot something he would pretend like he actually did remember it, ya know? Like just based upon reading people's cues...I mean he has to, ya know? Or even based upon people's cues and sort of behaving as if he actually knew what was being talked about the whole time and so, um, so that's something that (inaudible). Ya know know it's just...I don't know. I am sick and tired of whining about him, because he is a good man. It's just that his training on how to behave around another human being is completely like lacking and I don't know how much like (sigh)...I don't know. I just don't know. I just have to wonder if, ya know, if he needs that much entertainment like this, ya know, at the age he is now if he's ever going to break out of that, ya know? A lot of people grow up out of that and it seems like (sigh) it's just (pause)...I can't be the bad guy and ask him to give up things he loves to do. I really don't because ya know, it's, it's...first of all it's kind of wrong. I don't also want to incur his bitterness and wrath over things, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry. Give up what? [00:31:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Things he likes to do just so he can, ya know, go...like ya know (sigh) if I didn't get things done that I needed to get done, like around the house, I wouldn't go out and do things, ya know? I just wouldn't. If I had, ya know, that's just something you do that's above and beyond that. And there isn't a thing that I do that makes me happy that I wouldn't give up in a heartbeat if I thought that it would change something in my relationship, ya know? I mean maybe that's just...because I'm able to give up habits and things that...I'm able to give up habits and hobbies and interests and things that are...ya know I'm able to do that so easily maybe it makes it meaningless? Ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This sounds a little more like bargaining to me [00:32:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I mean it's true, though. I mean if, if it's something that bothers somebody or something that I need to give up because of it being bad for me or something, I mean I just do it. Ya know no matter how much I like doing it. I decided one day to stop biting my nails. One day I stopped, ya know. Now it was two weeks of misery but I gave up, ya know, being on opiates. I, ya know, I've changed...like I just...when something had to stop because of one way or another, I just did it. And I think that sometimes when I just stop doing things like that because I'm able to have that kind of willpower to just stop doing something, that maybe it makes it seem like the sacrifice is meaningless. I'm feeling kind of helpless, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the situation with him. And I think it's very hard for you to be, transition to being passive and helpless. I mean there really is hardly a thing you can do about his behavior it seems. Well, it seems or you would have figured it out by now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: God, I spent a lot of time analyzing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure, and I'm sure you've tried many things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, um (pause) yeah I think helplessness and passivity are very hard for you. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause). What do I do? I mean if I'm not helpless and passive, but then where do I go from there? I mean like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's sort of like an end game. I mean...like (pause) uh (pause) well, I mean isn't that sort of it? Like if one is passive and helpless there isn't much one can do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But then I just feel miserable and passive and helpless and...I don't see where like saying that this is, ya know, that there's nothing I can do...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:35:37) that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean that's just wallowing in what you can't do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean if you can't jump up and touch the moon, like...actually I think that probably the clearer you are about how you feel, how frustrating it is, how upsetting it is, how many things you've tried, how much you want this to be different, how hard it is to be passive, how hard it is to be helpless about this, I think the sort of clearer you are about the way things actually are, the less you wallow in it. I think it's often like when people don't recognize things like that that you kind of keep trying even though it's not gonna work or keep bargaining even though it doesn't make a difference or keep, ya know, pretending that you're not as frustrated...do ya know what I mean? Like I think the more you come to terms with the way things actually are and how you actually feel about them, the less you'll be, uh (pause) trying to deal with this in ways that are counterproductive or undermine you. Does that make...am I being clear-ish? [00:36:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Somewhat. To me that's giving in to despair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, uh, I mean you're kinda getting into reality. Like if reality is despairing then let's look at that, ya know, but (pause) pretending it's not reality so that you don't feel despair doesn't seem to me like the way to go. Do you know what I mean? Like if the reality leads you to feel despair then let's look at the despair and, ya know, hopefully you'll come to terms with it and it will get easier, but pretending things are different so you don't feel the despair I guess...I may be misunderstanding how you mean it, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I don't feel like I'm pretending things are any different than they really are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't. (pause) Part of the reason why I have been painted as being, ya know, kind of a crazy girl is because of the fact that I'm the person who's telling people the God honest truth about the way that things are. They're not the nicest way to put them. They're not even always the best way to put them, but, ya know, saying things like, ya know, Mike hasn't...ya know to my knowledge at least since 19...since 1999 I cannot think of a time that he put in eight hours at work for five days in a row. You know that sounds awfully like (sigh) (pause)...mm, probably since 2000. But the point, though, is that the, ya know, saying that, that sounds an awful lot like an extremist thing to say. [00:38:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not necessarily. Maybe it's just true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I've always been the person who's like these are the really hard facts, ya know? And so I feel like I am that way and just that I have...my own reactions is what I'm somewhat in denial of but I mean anybody that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds to me like the harder part, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not trying to say he isn't an addict. I'm not trying to say he isn't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I don't hear you saying that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...have a work ethic problem. I'm not trying...ya know what I mean? I'm pretty brutal about that kind of stuff. I hate to be that brutal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. Fair enough. I, I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not in denial about what's happening...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you don't sound that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:38:41).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're right. You're totally right. You don't sound that way. It's more...</p>

<p>CLIENT: As to what it's doing to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's more like the feelings it evokes for you. The frustration, the despair, the isolation...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that seems harder and I think you get worried about...and maybe have been kind of mired in some of those, which...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's completely different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm exhausted. I mean I'm just one of those people that normally has to put my head down and just get through it, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what ya do and (pause) I don't really know any other way. Cuz I don't know. I mean I have had situations where I've had to deal with something that was so amazingly difficult on me emotionally that it has made it so...I mean it, (sighs) it's made it hard to function, ya know? And so (pause) you do it just one day at a time. It's like take (inaudible at 00:38:41) what do I need to do the next hour? What do I need to do in the next, ya know, day? I mean that's just sort of how I take it. And (sigh) (pause) I'm a researcher. If things, if reality isn't the way you like it, you find a different way, ya know? I'm the person at Microsoft when people come in with broken screens on their devices, and I can't...I don't have the power to replace it. I talk to 'em about let's go look and see whether or not your homeowner's insurance can cover it. Maybe the deductible on that is going to be better...ya know I'm the person that always looks for another way to see the same situation, but (pause) in a way that's favorable, ya know? You said you can't touch the moon. Yes, but you know what? I can learn enough about rocketry to find out enough about it. That's who I was born to be, is that if something says no, maybe I can't get exactly what I want but I will find some way to carve that out. And so I...it's something I just don't understand. Does that make sense? [00:41:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean "it's" something you just don't understand?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the concept of...the concept of (pause) there is nothing that I can do about it in any way, shape or form, and so I just need to find a way to just be okay with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cuz that's what it sounds like. I mean, I mean if there's nothing I can do then there's despair and it's like well, you address the despair. Well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess, uh (pause) I'm basing that idea on a few thoughts. One is you've been at this for a while with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I agree, but I don't know how to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And two, ya know there may be things that you can do. I mean you said he's getting better, so something's working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if he's getting better. Things are so sinusoidal and it's, it's so hard to tell these days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess my point really there is that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's better than he was when he was catatonic. I mean he wasn't like the definition of catatonic but he might as well have been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I guess my point is (pause) even if things can get this much better...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...over a long period of time, it would seem to me, based on your 15 years of experience with him? Something like that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eighteen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Eighteen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That, ya know...yeah a lot of this is about coming to terms with what it stirs up in you. I mean, ya know, if you say well, you know, I don't need to do that cuz I'm gonna focus on whatever I can do to change things, ya know, one and a half percent with him like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really can't. I know that. I mean, I try. Everyone once in a while I get like in this...like, and this is like in certain...there's certain things I need to talk at, okay? And this sort of...I just want to see it as this me trying to learn a language or me trying to do...every once in a while I was like I suck at this but I'm gonna give it a try again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it sounds terrible. I don't know if I'm a glutton for punishment or not but, um, (pause) most of the time I realize that it's something that's beyond my control but every so often I'm willing to try and see...revisit and see if it really is...and I just don't know. It's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did this, um...it's not an engineering problem, I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) I'm sorry but it's, it's...I, I understand that but I can...this is my major coping skill that I have to get through life, so it's very hard for you to tell me to lay that tool down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's why this situation's so hard. There are a lot of things that that coping skill is fantastic for. This isn't one of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I just (pause)...it is hard for me to do that. And I agree!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, and I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Believe me I wish it was, but I just know any other way, ya know? Thinking outside of the box to try and either change myself or see things in a different way and change the, ya know, the world around...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: is just how I cope. Now I deal with crap all day long. Why in the world would I...like how in the world could I keep...people always ask that: how long do you deal with this? Like, well, I don't know. Well, really I do know. I mean I have to just sort of say well, the only reason why they expect this of us is because Microsoft's an awesome company, or ya know, yes, I realize that this isn't like the first...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know? Like, I have to find some sort of way in my own head to indoctrinate myself...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...enough to be able to make it through that. And so (pause) I even justify the fact that someone complained about my hair as being like well, ya know, it is already frustrating enough to try and learn how to use a computer for the first time. I guess this person needs to have things that are even less distracting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will find some way...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to cope with that, and so I don't know how.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're gonna stop...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...for now. Um, but we'll talk more next Tuesday. I hope you have a great trip.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Things are going pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're going well, sometimes um, when things are going well I start to get nervous. Oh-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Every one is superstitious, you know, it's a kind of superstition. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh I don't know about the superstition I don't know what it, I don't, I don't, I don't, choose to go there and try to analyze it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't try to analyze it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I just try to keep it in the day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so let's see, you're on the two milligrams of Trilafon right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the Lithium carbonates three hundred milligrams two in AM and three at bedtime. Prozac ten milligrams, so you said you had some questions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, well I, I've told you before I was, you know thinking about going off the Trilafon-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I talked it over with my therapist and came up with a few questions, um, what is the risk of tardive dyskinesia because of the fact that I've been taking it for a long period of time?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's an excellent question. Well you're on the lowest possible dose of Trilafon, two milligrams, </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, the lower the dose, uh, the better it is-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In that regard, the less, the less likely that it would cause you problems.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Either to be on it or to go off of it-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, now, there are people who develop tardive dyskinesia after a number of years of taking their medicine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, and then they come off and it goes away. Used to be thought it would, it would stay for forever, you couldn't get rid of it, but that... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is not true.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, if, if people have an initial sign like, you know, they're finding that their taking more...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, usually we try to take them off-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If we can, okay? All right, now on the other hand, there is an occasional person who when they stop taking the medicine, </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's like their brain has been used to the medicine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then they get some kind of movements for a little while- </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh really?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it could be a day, it could be a week, it could be a month, but usually that goes away-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Too. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now, given that you're on such a low dosage, two milligrams, I doubt you'll have a problem coming off-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It and I doubt you're at a huge risk of tardive dyskinesia-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In any case.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But, would I like you to be off of it, if you could? Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know if you're good and it didn't upset the apple cart too much-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that's what I'm concerned with um, is it enough reason to go off the medication because I'm stable and I'm doing well. But what is the possibility that I would have more intense, my thinking, my, you know, I mean I just come to the realization recently that I am paranoid sometimes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, and, I don't think it's that abnormal but it is something that I, that I you know, I have. And I'm just wondering if-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you mean by para-, what do you mean by paranoid?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just in the sense that I worry the was people are talking about, if they're talking about me. You know, and what their thoughts are when I say something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, that kind of thing and then you know, I mean I haven't really had suicidal thoughts in a long time but I'm afraid of having suicidal thoughts.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, and would, would this thinking sick thinking um, be more intense if I went of the Trilafon?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Possibly, I mean it's hard to know until we try it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you under a lot of stress right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know you kind of want to picture...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm still looking for work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're still looking for work?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Since the last time I saw you. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've got my old job and I'm down to like thirteen hours a week which doesn't pay the bills. And, and I've got a couple of feelers out for something else that I might like to do. A couple other job possibilities, and I'm going down, the first of [DATE] to see my dad. And that is not gonna be easy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, why is that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, because he's, he's pretty sick</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And um-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> OK, wouldn't do anything before then, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Okay, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you know, if you wanted to try it [PATIENT NAME] I mean I'm not saying you have to... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or you know you're not having any thing, stick out your tongue for me. And just try to make it as still as possible if you can. Now you're tongue wiggles a little.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's not just my tongue that wiggles, my hands wiggle.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that, you have some tremor or something-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm having some tremors and as I drink my caffeinated soda, my doctor, my g, um, general practitioner doctor told me to cut down on my caffeine intake.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which I've been trying to do but today has been a bad day, just because you know, I had to come here and I wanna get [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why? Why, are you scared of me?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do expect would happen?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, I'm an alcoholic what can I say? So I had to have my soda. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, then what do you drink?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, normally I, I drink, I'll drink the decaf.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so what-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The decaf, but that's got the, the see this if you get this stuff with the ice and the straw and everything...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They don't have it in decaf. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'd have to drink it out of a bottle-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, well, what is it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it's its, a mixture.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of Coca Cola. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mostly diet Coke in it and a little bit of the real thing Coca Cola.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh I see, I see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because plain old diet Coke stinks, so I-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you haven't, how's the drooling?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Usually it's when I'm sleeping sometimes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's, it, is that something that a lot of people have, when they're sleeping because my mouths open?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It could be. Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I think it...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But no, usually...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Probably a little bit more in people who are taking a medicine like Trilafon.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It, a little more so?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. I don't think it's likely to happen with Lithium. You can get hand tremor with Lithium though. You know that's not an uncommon side effect-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh really?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, do you think its worse when you have a lot of caffeine, is that-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't, I'll take my caffeine if I can get it. No, no I mean um, this is what the doctor said.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, but, I, I have tried to limit, you know, like I never drink caffeinated coffee, I only drink decaf coffee, </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I do my regular Coke which doesn't make sense. But um, you know, I've tried you know, I always have plenty of decaf soda in the house. And then you know, when I need a, a fix, I get my real -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the hand tremor is that all day long every day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's, it's, I was concerned about it being um, Parkinson's, I was afraid I might have Parkinson's but she said when I'm, what's the word for this, you know when I'm, when I'm not... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Moving your hand, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Extending it, when I do this, </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This hand in particular shakes a little bit. But this one doesn't. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But when at the resting stage I guess is what you'd call it, there really isn't much of a tremor. And she said that's what you know, that's one indication, indicator of um, Par, you know, of Parkinson's is when you're when you're resting I guess, that you still have tremors. I don't know, but she wanted me to have a MRI and I'm scared to death.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It, I'm very anxious I asked my husband he said he'd go with me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you know, I guess some of them are open now a days so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That so it isn't a big of a deal but if I had to sit in one of those things for a whole hour it would be difficult.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I understand. So, I'm not sure what to tell you about the Trilafon I mean I mean if you could be without it I think that's a good thing. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We had talked maybe about cutting back every-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, we'll, we'll-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Day-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, what I did I did go out and buy a pill cutter-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it worked, you know some of them crumbled a little but I was able to slice them in half. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But that's as far as I got, and that was I don't know, about a month or so ago and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so you didn't try the half?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I didn't try the half, I just cut the pill.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And um, you know to see if I could, could cut it, cut it in half so I could-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, do half the amount um, you know, for a period of time. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think after you come back from seeing your father-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if you kind of started to feel better-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know you might be a little upset for a little while after that-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know, that's what happened last time-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I would wait but maybe around [DATE] see if you can cut down to one milligram on the Trilafon.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Half of the Trilafon.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know. Now you were going to get a second job as a tele marketer or something, that didn't work out?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, no it didn't. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was doing it out of my house. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it was like pulling teeth to get me to sit down to get on that damn phone, it was horrible. I hated it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I, you know it was, it was okay once I got going at it but that's not something I wanna do every day. You know? And but anyhow, so my latest thing, I may be a [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm. Well that's a good one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah so I've been getting on the computer I took another, got a little computer course and I think I've learned a bit much and more, and so I made up little signs that I'm gonna put all around the veterinary hospitals and the um, and um, the you know animal shelter and maybe in the hardware store down town and stuff like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With my name attached to it you know, and see how I do but-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you charge as a [DEIDENTIFIED]? How you do come up with an idea of what's the right amount-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, when I'm applying for a job working for a company in [DEIDENTIFIED] they're called [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they gave uh ten dollars for twenty minute walk. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To, to the employees. That they hired. But they get I think fifteen dollars for a twenty minute, for that period-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] doing it yourself though, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, that's what I'm gonna do, I'd rather do it on my own. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do it, myself, um, you know-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I can make more money and, and, and they had some of the regulations they have for the job were um if you miss, if you're sick and miss a visit you will have to make it up and you make it up without pay. And then it said if you take a vacation if we can't get someone to fill in for you, then you don't have a vacation. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, so it will probably wasn't a good idea that I get the job with them any how.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I hear you. You're not having racing thoughts, you're not uh-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, things are pretty calm right now although this large quantity of caffeinated soda may cause me to run around the house a little faster cleaning than normal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're still doing the mail aways, right? On the prescriptions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Oh, one other thing is I don't know about two or three weeks ago I went off my thyroid medication. The doctor, I had you know blood work done at the same time as I had a physical, and I got the results and the results said that I don't really...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] levels were high?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I forget. Levels were good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, normal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They were normal. And so I called up the doctor and asked if I could go off it and she said yes but in a month I have to go back and uh have more blood work done see what you know, my levels are at.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But that was another thing I was concerned about is going off another medication while I'm just going off of this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't want you to do it now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, you could think about it for maybe [DATE] something like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There you go.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, although, as far as the Lithium goes, I was thinking if I could cut back on that a little-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Don't...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh all right, all right, all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Lithium level last time was point eight nine, which is a good level-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not too high-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I mean I, but I'm thirsty, I don't know if it's my obsessive compulsive alcoholic whatever-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or the Lithium but I drink like sixty four ounces of water a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that's supposed to be actually healthy for you. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know it is but [INAUDIBLE] the soda also. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you gotta do one thing at a time-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME] and you know you're talking about three things here, stopping the thyroid, possibly stopping Trilafon, and decreasing Lithium-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It has to be done in stages, </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean I'm not opposed to your you know, playing around with it, we could play around with it but...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now lets see, you need the latest time or is that, not as critical-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How about four thirty, have you got a four thirty?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not that particular week. I have, or I could do [DATE] at four thirty.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What week were you going to be doing?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The next week, but I don't have any four thirty; I have a four o'clock on Thursday or Friday. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How about the following week?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, then you're going to run out of pills.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I still have one bottle and a half-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of the Lithium yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Four thirty [DATE]. Four thirty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's all right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I still have a surplus of pills which I can't understand because I take them you know regularly and I don't forget them all, all that often. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, there's that. I just to need to get your height and weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good luck with your father.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh Thanks. Yeah, we'll see. Tough, tough seeing your parents get old. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes it is. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's tough getting older myself. Okay, thank you very much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Alright, good to see you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, wait a minute I didn't pay you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh you, oh that's right. You're twenty five dollar co-pay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh I guess so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what it's been.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have the same insurance right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah it's, they did make some changes, it's Aetna now, did I tell you that, I think it-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it was Aetna back in a year ago.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh was it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Goes to show how I keep up with the times.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is there been any changes in the last year as far as you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There may have but I'm not sure what it is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have your card with you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I've got my card.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right well let's take a look at that then. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't remember, I thought they, but maybe it was I don't know. For some reason I think... </p>

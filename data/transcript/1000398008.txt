<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I don't know, mm, thinking of a number of things that uh, (Sigh) I don't know, I guess I just don't where to start.  Uh, w—, I, I suppose one of them is, is just uhm, I was thinking again about the BFMs and the fact I still don't understand uhm, quite what, what I was doing on Saturday.  Or just the whole way what I did Saturday fits into things I've been thinking about, or talking about the week before.  And uhm, I don't know, at some point today, I saw a f—, uhm, not exactly billboard, but one of those things that are up around train stations.  And uhm, the woman who was — I've forgotten what it was an ad for — but the woman reminded me a lot of MW's mother.   </p>

<p>And so then I began imagining his father dying.  And uh, (Sniff) I don't know what I was, I mean, aside from just sort of trying to imagine my response, or being sympathetic, I, I'm, I don't think that's really what could have interested me in it.  But uhm, mm, and I was thinking about the fact that uh, 2 things came up at school today, both of which don't really affect me directly.  But when I left, I realized I was feeling very nervous, and as if something weren't done, and I wanted it done.  </p>

<p>And I don't know quite — it seems connected with one, or, or, both of these things.  Uhm, and, and in a way I could see maybe how it made me nervous, because it sort of fit into perhaps, somehow the feeling that I was thinking about yesterday, of being left out.  Uhm, but uhm, Mrs. BBF had stopped in when the children were having music.  And I was first talking to her about a conference I'd had this morning that I thought went well.  It was with MJ's mother, and she was very (Sniff) helpful in certain respects, and then just seemed to want to work with the school and work things out.</p>

<p>And I, I don't know, I just, I had a very positive feeling afterwards.  And uhm, so I was telling about that, and then because Mrs. BBF was there, and I think she'd come in just to see what happened in music, anyway.  She began talking about the music teacher again, and I've known she doesn't like her.  And uhm, I've said that in man—, many times she does good things.  It's just, again, her, uhm, she gets them over-stimulated, and the noise level is always very high and loud, and she has a very penetrating voice that really does hurt.  And MJ today, for instance, left the group saying, "It's too loud, I can't stand it."  And it was, I, I don't blame him.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>And uhm, but I, I don't know, it just seemed to me there were certain things that, perhaps, if she were aware of, she could change.  And uhm, when we were talking, Mrs. BBF's attitude was, I'm not sure I can stand to have her here, anymore.  I think she might have to be fired.  And, and then she went on saying something about, she always comes in and complains and she came in this morning with complaints, and said she wanted to talk to me.  And uhm, apparently Mrs. BBF just told her she had too many other problems and couldn't talk to her.  </p>

<p>I think Mrs. BBF does have some (Laughs) problems.  I just found out about one, that's the other thing that disturbs me, but uhm, I also felt very disturbed that she was not trying to work with this music teacher.  And, I don't know, that she was just, uhm, seemed to me, being very destructive in the way she — I mean, she'd either say do it this way, or else she wouldn't talk with her.  She wouldn't tactfully handle her, and, and it just seemed that there were things she could do that wouldn't be that difficult.  And then if it didn't work, well, you'd have to reevaluate it.  </p>

<p>But uhm, I don't know, so I was feeling distressed, uhm, over this woman also having such a negative atmosphere toward her, because other teachers don't like things she does.  I can see where she'd be really a horror with the younger children.  Because I have the oldest, and even they can't completely handle uhm, sort of the frenzied atmosphere that she creates.  And, and she is that kind of person.  She's always sort of not sure where she should be, and being late, and running in, and so forth.  And it uh, so it is hard on the younger children.  </p>

<p>But uhm, I don't know, there's something about that — I was talking to FLMZ a little bit about it after school, and — saying I wish there were some way that either Mrs. BBF, or we, or somebody, could talk with her, so that we could see if it couldn't work out.  And then I don't know, somehow I think maybe I felt, well, I was gossiping with FLMZ, and I shouldn't have said anything that uhm, indicated Mrs. BBF wasn't happy.  Because that was for her to indicate, not for me.  Uhm, even though it's been clear.  But somehow still, I don't know, I felt like I shouldn't have talked about it with FLMZ.  And uhm, it wasn't that I'd said, "Oh, isn't she awful?", or, "Isn't Mrs. BBF awful?", or anything.  I, I was careful not to do anything like that.  But uhm, somehow I think I felt guilty that I talked about it at all.</p>

<p>And then the other thing that, uh, well again, it might have a similar aspect, I mean 2 similar aspects.  One is, somebody feeling alone, or, I don't know exactly what the feeling would be, but, and then the other thing would be the way I wanted to talk about it, uh, that might have bothered me.  I don't know, but I had heard uhm, at the beginning of school that another — well, she's an assistant in the morning, then and a secretary in the afternoon.  Her name is FYSI — that FYSI was out, and this affected our plans, because I had to have somebody help FLMZ when I was out with the conference.  And uh, then something was said, uh, by FLMZ, about how she was under a lot of pressure.  And FLMZ's implication was, it was all Mrs. BBF's fault, that Mrs. BBF was driving her too hard.  But she didn't say too much, and I didn't know exactly what was going on, and I didn't ask any further.  </p>

<p>Then at the uh, when I was talking to Mrs. BBF about something totally different, at one point she just said, uhm, something to the effect, I've think I lost my secretary, or uhm, anyway, referring to FYSI.  And I said, "Oh, what's the trouble?"  And it turns out that FYSI apparently, has had a lot of problems handling pressures on her, and Mrs. BBF had been trying to relieve the pressure. She'd hired somebody full-time that she'd only had part-time, to help.  And uh, Mrs. BBF had felt she had done all she could to help FYSI, although I think Mrs. BBF is kind of hard sometimes.  But uh, apparently she'd gone out of her way to make it easier.</p>

<p>And then FYSI yesterday, just had uhm, she got to a point where she just couldn't do anything.  And she started crying and, and then sort of started rocking herself and talking incoherently.  And it sounded like she was going through some kind of a breakdown.  And I felt distressed, because I've al—, I've liked FYSI all along.  And, and Mrs. BBF mentioned 1 or 2 things she'd done that belied the appearance that she generally gave.  </p>

<p>Uhm, and I guess she was just holding herself under rigid control, and then every once in a while she'd lose complete control.  And, and it would come out like she apparently, once or twice, yelled at the children — she was with 3-year-olds — and uh, that upset her very much, because she was I guess, a perfectionist, too.  And then, she couldn't handle the secretarial things.  </p>

<p>And uh, but I don't, I don't know again, what was making me feel somewhat disturbed about that, except that I enjoyed hearing about it in sort of a gossip fashion, I think.  And yet on the other hand, I felt really distressed to think of FYSI alone, because she lives alone.  Although apparently she has a married sister in the city.  But uhm, and yet I'm not supposed to know about it, but she lives fairly near me.  And so my other reaction was, well, maybe I should go over.  </p>

<p>And uhm, but then, I, I was thinking, I don't know, it's almost like uhm, might not be something so good about the way I wanted to help her, too.  Because there are other people in the school who know her better and who are closer to her than I am.  And uh, two of them are going to call her, planning some point today to call her, see how she was. </p>

<p>And, I don't know, but anyway, there was something I felt unfinished, or distressing about both those things.  And uhm, (Silence) I don't know, it seems like in both those cases, uhm, part of what I wanted to talk about was, enough g—, get enough uhm, information, I guess, or something.  I don't know.  So that then I would be in a position where I felt I could help.  And uhm, as if then if I could help, it would give me some kind of feeling for myself.  </p>

<p>So in a way, I don't know how much I'm really thinking of the person involved, o—, the music teacher, or FYSI.  But uhm, what I would get out of helping, almost.  Uhm, I think I feel something for both of them, otherwise, but today, I don't know, it just seemed like it was important to me to be in the power of uhm, having the power, I guess, of being able to help.  And uhm, and then uhm, and then I think of how the other thing I'm not understanding right now, or I don't know, the other thing that's been on my mind this week that I don't understand is this incident Saturday and how, there I did something awful to some other people, in a way.  (Silence)</p>

<p>On the other hand, I was just thinking of, and I don't quite know why, exc—, uhm, I mean, I think I want you to know this, but I don't know why.  Because I don't see how it fits into anything.  But I was just thinking about the fact that I went to the dentist this afternoon.  And now I still have novocaine in my mouth, and I feel, I guess, sort of self-conscious about that.  Although I don't know how much it appears.  But uhm, but then I was just thinking about an incident there, too, where uhm, at some point, well the dentist's wife is there sort of as his assistant, and his secretary.  And she kind of fills in wherever it's necessary.  And then apparently, they've been trying to hire people to do some of the things that she has to do, because it's really too much for her.  But they're having trouble.  </p>

<p>And at fist I thought she was talking about people at home.  Because my appointment today had been, at first, in question, and, and it, had to be wait—, I had to wait until I knew about FDO, and if she could baby-sit this afternoon.  And uhm, so she just asked , I guess, how FDO was working out.  And then she uhm, went into this problem they were having.  And I didn't understand for a long time, that it was somebody there, and that that person had been sent out on an errand.  And they were worried whether she'd even be able to complete it, or not.  </p>

<p>Uhm, and then the person came back, and uhm, immediately started confusing things.  And she'd already confused some other things.  I mean, one was, she was supposed to have cleaned some instrument that the dentist had to use on me.  And, or, to do something he had to do for me.  And uhm, it wasn't working properly, and they finally found out why.  But uhm, I don't know, th, they were talking a lot about how unsatisfactory she was, and then just how hard it was to find anybody, anyway.  </p>

<p>And finally, uhm, at some point somebody came, and apparently also, a patient came at the same time.  There's a doorbell that rings whenever anybody comes in  And uhm, she didn't let them know that the patient had come in at the same time.  But she knew they knew that it was a serviceman for something.  And she knew, they knew that he was there.  And uh, so when they finally found out the patient had been waiting, they got kind of mad at her for not having told them.  And I don't know, it seemed almost as if she talked back a bit.  But I couldn't really hear what she was saying.  And, so I was just thinking about that, but I don't quite know — (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, at first I was thinking again about not understanding Saturday.  And, and then the next thing, uhm, I think that I started thinking, was of uhm, well, some things are being delivered from the cleaners, and along with it is a sweater that I left there this afternoon, right before coming here.  It has a broken zipper.  And I, they didn't know if they could fix it, or not.  So I didn't pay for it.  But everything else is paid for, they're delivering.  And so I think I was just wondering whether they can fix it.  And then, if there'll be a charge.  And uhm, if I'll be home in time, in case FDO doesn't even know this is being delivered.  And I don't know, just kind of wondering about it.  But uh — (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was thinking about FYSI again, and uhm, I guess I'm wondering too, about what it's like to go through whatever it is she's going through.  What is she feeling?  (Sigh, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uh, I don't know, I mea—, I'm still thinking about FYSI, and just little things that I could see how it would be part of it all now.  Like, she had a terrible time finding something, or she couldn't find it, that uh, I had wanted to o, order.  And uhm, I just couldn't understand why she was having a hard time.  And it, I thought well, maybe the place that I used to get it, has changed, or the book has changed.  And I checked at LKC to see if it's still something that you can get.  I mean, I didn't think to think that I should check through the catalogue after FYSI had, because I assumed she had.  And uhm, they said you could still, I mean, FHYZ said they'd still gotten the same kind of paper there.</p>

<p>And so then I was, I had just told this to FYSI yesterday, that I'd heard that you could get it there.  And so I was going to help her look again.  And I was thinking about that, and I just don't know, a few little things, or some things Mrs. BBF told me that had happened.  Like, FYSI lost, apparently, 3 sizeable checks, uhm, th, that I guess were tuition.  And uhm, I can see where that would be very upsetting.  </p>

<p>But, I don't know, I have this feeling that there's something about all this that, I'm wondering how she felt when she finally broke down yesterday.  Because I guess, whether it's a real nervous breakdown or not, she did have a kind of a breakdown yesterday.  Uhm, whether uhm, I'm curious because, well I keep thinking about, I'm not getting at how all the things I've been thinking about, work into Saturday.  It's bothering me, I don't understand Saturday night.  </p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, somehow I'm thinking, I had felt I had to get out of the BFM's apartment Saturday night, because I was afraid I might in effect, I suppose, break down.  By meaning, losing my control, and say things I didn't want to say, or I don't know exactly what I would have done, but I had this feeling I had to get out before I did it.  And, uhm, I think what I'm imagining, because I — FYSI's breakdown happened in the afternoon yesterday — I think I'm imagining that she had this feeling of, of pressure building up and building up.  And that she w—, might do something, explode in some way.  And then finally, she did.  </p>

<p>ANALYST:   What do you think of, when you think of exploding in some way? </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I mean, wh—, after I used the word, I think I, well, that was the wrong word for FYSI, but it would have been the right word for me, the way I thought I, what I might do at the BFMs.  Because uh, I think FYSI just sat down and started crying, and then all the other things.  But I think of shouting and throwing things around, and sort of losing control of my body, and just uhm, well, being very aggressive.  (Pause)</p>

<p>For instance, with FYSI I would, I don't know whether she said much in this line, but I, I've, if I think of her exploding in her situation, I would imagine her just suddenly stopping and shouting, "I can't do it!  I can't do it!", you know, or something along that way.  I think she just sat down and started crying, and in that way indicated (Chuckles) she couldn't do it.  But uhm, I think of shouting.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I don't know what this means, either.  But uhm, uh, at some point, I don't, not sure again if it was right after thinking about exploding, I noticed the run in my sto—, I, it's not that I don't know the run is there.  But I was just looking at it again, I guess.  And uhm, then I was thinking about how today, I stopped at a place on my way to the cleaners that uhm, well they had a sale of opaque nylons in the window.  They had a sign about it, so I thought I'd go in and see.  And I thought that was the place also that, FNI had mentioned, where she has gotten bras, in the past.  So I was going to get one, because I need new ones.  And they didn't have anything.  </p>

<p>So then, I was just thinking about, well I wondered where the store was, or if that was it, and they don't carry them, or just what.  And uhm, well, then I started thinking something else.  But — oh, I know — and then I started thinking about at the conference this morning, uhm, Mrs. SMB, that's MJ's mother, kept looking at me in such a way that I felt my b—, my blouse must be k—, unbuttoned.  Because this blouse sometimes has, not, well, it's only happened when FSO's sort of pulled the 2 sides apart.  But uhm, because of the way it has to dry, the buttonholes are quite loose, so that FSO can, if she w—, if she, if I'm holding her, and I don't stop her in time, really pull open my blouse.  And so I thought, well maybe something's happened and the blouse has come undone.  Because she kept looking at me.  Uh, it wasn't exactly at my bosom, but it was enough so I felt I must be coming unbuttoned, and she's looking at what's happened.  And uhm, I don't know why I think of that right now, and I don't know why she was looking at me in that way, because I wasn't unbuttoned.  </p>

<p>But uhm — (2-minute silence) Well, now I, again, I'm not sure how I got to this, because I think I thought of something in-between.  But I was thinking about another boy, uhm, who seems to me disturbed, in that uhm, if we're doing any kind of a group thing, and I'm asking the class to stay together, uhm, and usually it's the type of thing that, it's not so demanding, if they can't do it they don't have to.  And there's no real pressure on them, I'm not calling them out individually, or anything.  Uhm, but uhm, and some of the things, well, it's like the other day when I was working with numbers, he can do.  Except he can't stand the pressure of, of doing it, and trying.  And uhm, h, he participated for a second the other day, and then he just had to withdraw.  </p>

<p>And, and he'll go sit in a corner and hide, and, and get in the fetal position.  And he did this again today.  We were just going over the alphabet, and just sort of really, just saying it by rote.  And it was right there in front of them, and uhm, he could have blended right in with the others, and not said anything.  It wouldn't have mattered, because we were all sort of saying it aloud together.  And then we were just talking about some of the letters, and sounds they make.  And uhm, he could have just listened.  Instead he went and sat in this posi, position again.  </p>

<p>And uhm, so then I was thinking about having a conference with his mother.  She's been extremely negative throughout the — I don't remember how many years now MYL's been there.  But, other teachers have found her very negative, and then this year, she's already spoken to Mrs. BBF about wanting to know more about me, because she didn't think I was very good.  And she and her husband were the ones that uhm, I don't know if I mentioned it here.  I think I might have. </p>

<p>But anyway, I didn't, I had an awful uhm, well, not awful, but unpleasant experience with them at the parents' meeting, when his father said h—, she brought her husband up and said, uh, this is MYL's teacher.  And then he said hello, and then immediately left.  He went out in the hall and said in a loud voice — and he knew I was near the door — "Uhm, oh, so that's MYL's teacher."  And then, in a few minutes he came back in, asked me a question, and m—, in the middle of my answering him, he turned away again.  And I stopped talking, and then he turned back and said, "Oh, I'm sorry."  But he, he w—, he was just being very rude, and apparently, he's been uh, this way before, too.</p>

<p>And, I don't know, anyway, a number of things have occurred, and I, I don't think I'd like his mother, even if they hadn't.  So that I don't like this boy's mother.  I like MYL, but he's got a lot of problems.  And then today, the children drew pictures of their family.  And MYL, uh, I didn't see what he started out with.  But by the time I saw him, he'd covered the whole paper with red.  And there was a face in red, too, just barely coming out of one place in it, that he hadn't completely covered over in red, with a mouth open.  And all you could see were the eyes, and barely the shape of the head, and then the mouth o—, wide open.  </p>

<p>And that, this was his th, the idea they were all working with was their family.  And uhm, he had verbalized who was in his family before they started this, so it wasn't that he had no idea of what was going on.  Uhm, and so anyway, I was just imagining the conference with his mother, and it being a very tense and unpleasant and, with both of us being aggressive toward each other.  And uhm, I was thinking of that picture, but I don't, picture — "picture", I always say that wrong — but I don't know whether I, uhm, was thinking of bringing it out as a way of attacking her.  Probably so.  (Pause) Because her approach has been, the school's not doing the right thing for my son.  And she won't recognize his problems.  He's also the one with the cataract in o—, well, I guess in both eyes, but one is nearly blind.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And the only good reason why I can think of having thought of that, well I don't know why I thought of MJ's mother looking at me the way she did at the conference.  But uhm, what I think of now is the connection, is between thinking of MYL's mother — that's the boy who seems disturbed to me — and uhm, having conference with her.  It's sort of — and I was thinking about exploding — and then, I don't know, it seems like thinking about having this fight with MYL's mother in conferences, uhm, well, it could be destructive, because I — but, but it seemed like it was a w—, I was thinking of it as a channel for these feelings I did not want to have come out by exploding.  So then I fight somebody in a, what would seem like an acceptable way, although if it were for me and not for MYL, then it wouldn't be.  </p>

<p>But, I don't know i, it,  I don't know how much it's bothering me, because I'm not doing it, but I keep thinking that I don't understand why I can't work out, uhm, I can't keep on thinking about Saturday.  And uhm, I mean, why I came to feel that way.  Or I don't know, I j—, and I'm s—, I don't know if I'm thinking of it mainly from this, that since we're going to see the BFMs Friday, I feel I have to know, have some understanding or else, what if I do it again.  Or I don't know exactly, except, I, I feel uhm, it's bothering me in some way, but I guess not enough, so I'm not doing enough about it.  But uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, no, from what you said, uh, yesterday, I think you feel I'm not doing enough. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh) I don't remember what I said (Laughs) yesterday.  </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, maybe it was the day before, but you wanted me to say something.  

PATIENT:  You mean, so I'd understand?  Yeah, I remember that.  (Pause) Yeah, but then, I, I suppose maybe I do feel that way.  But then also, I'm feeling that yesterday you did say some things, and I'm not getting back to them today.  Because I, I'm remembering thinking about uh, well mainly yesterday, because I haven't really thought about it today, but I haven't forgotten that you had uhm, pointed out that MW's having a tantrum, and so forth, a lot of, well, I don't know if a lot of things. </p>

<p>But anyway, but that possibly, MW reminded me of my father.  And uhm, and I also, i—, somehow been on my mind today — although I'm not sure exactly in what way — when I've talked about FYSI and the music teacher, in the back of my mind was thinking yesterday about uhm, well, I guess mainly, the closed door.  My parents being on one side and me on the other.  But uhm, now I think — I didn't originally, today — think of also that, going on to imagine uhm, the couple making love with the daughter in the bed next to them.  </p>

<p>ANALYST:   And why do you think you've been avoiding these things, then? </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I don't think this can be the real reason, but I think uhm, one way I've thought about it today, is thinking, because I know yesterday, I d—, I couldn't see the connection with Saturday, and, and so what I keep thinking is I have to understand Saturday by tomorrow night.  And uhm, well then, I just wondered, because these were things you had in effect, suggested might have something to do with Saturday night.  So it's like my saying, well I don't agree with you.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then, I don't know, uhm, when I think of that, imagining the couple and their daughter in bed, uhm, it seems like today I was thinking of it (Clears throat) well, I remembered your saying something about something else I thought of and that (Clears throat) you didn't think that would have been all I was curious about.  And then, eventually we got into talking about this incident.  And, so just now, I think I was thinking of it as imagining the girl being curious, or, here would be what I was curious about, with the door shut between me and my parents. </p>

<p>And yet on the other hand, the girl's having her curiosity satisfied, assuming she had it, uhm, would somehow be worse.  I don't, I know yesterday I was thinking about a feeling of being even more left out.  Uhm, but I don't know, somehow anyway, have this conflict of wanting the curiosity satisfied, and then, well I guess, maybe being afraid of it.  Not so much as thinking it really would be worse, as being afraid of having it satisfied.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I feel as if that's sort of stopped me.  Because then I think uhm, well somehow, anyway, I got to thinking about, just sort of the mechanics of, I'm not sure exactly what time we're meeting the BFM's tomorrow, which I have to find out, or FNI's going to call.  But uhm, a, anyway, it just sort of involved the mechanics of my changing when I would change, and meeting them, and uhm, so well, maybe it had slightly different twist to it.  Though I'm not sure, because I think I was even, I was thinking too, that uhm, I probably want to change after coming here.  And I'm not sure yet what I'd wear, but uhm, it would take me awhile.  And then I was imagining FNI wanting us there at 6:30.  And would I say to her, "Well, I can't make it until a little bit after 6:30," or what would I do?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Ah, next Tuesday, Election Day, there's going to be a holiday here — </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  </p>

<p>ANALYST:   — so I won't be able to see you.  And time's up.

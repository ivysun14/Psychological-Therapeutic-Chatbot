<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's been a while since we've sat together. Where are you this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sydney and I are doing better. So we still sometimes—like the thing is though, a lot of our disagreements last for about like a minute or so. So it's not like we're constantly fighting and stuff. But like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feels intense though, when that's happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. It depends on what the issue is. It doesn't get that intense. It's not like we're in a screaming match or something like that, so things are getting better and he's getting better. And so things are getting comfortable and stuff. Now I just really need to get a job so I can—well, A) support myself and B) give him more alone time and stuff, and have my own alone time. Well, I guess it wouldn't be alone time, but away time. [00:01:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Independence. You're looking for independence in a lot of different ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean, I guess what I should be better about is—because I get nothing done when he's around. So I finally finished the encoding [inaudible [00:01:17] last week. I linked in on Thursday and I did most of it, and then I was maybe like four lines from done or something ridiculous like that, but I had to go to a doctor's appointment. And—oh (pause) shoot. I have a piece of paper that I was supposed to bring and I didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, your referral?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My referral. But I did get the referral. Which I also have to call up insurance again and be like "Okay, I have this referral now." Because all they told me was "get a referral." They didn't say "there's this piece of paper that you have to fill out" or whatever. But theoretically, the referral should've also been sent to your—like did you get anything about it? [00:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not that I'm aware of. I haven't checked my mail yet today. But I didn't get anything on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, yeah, and the appointment was on Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So it's possibly there today, but I haven't actually gotten a moment to open my mailbox.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well if not, I'll—I should really just—I don't know how that slipped my mind, and I feel bad. But I'm pretty sure I took everything out of my backpack when I was trying to lighten up my backpack.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you can mail it to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I will mail it to you then. (pause) So yeah. But I almost finished it, and then like Friday I was actually—Friday or was it Thursday night—I think it was actually Thursday night that I sat down and actually finished the encoding, and fixed a few things, and made a few things fancier and stuff and then sent it in. So now I'm like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Officially done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Officially done. Tara is going to mail me the last check, and I am done with that. So now I have like no actual responsibilities, but I need to get a real job. [00:03:14]</p>

<p>I tried calling the temp agency again today. Because I had actually gotten in touch with a real person last weekend, sent her my resume and have her name and stuff. And I tried calling her today, and I first called the main office and then they put me to her line and it ended up going to voice-mail. So I left a message, and I have to try again tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Keep pushing to stay on top of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Calling every day is easier than writing cover letters. So I don't know. And I don't even know if calling a temp agency counts towards my rewards for getting things done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's up to you. I mean, this is your system. Let's think about what your goal is. What's the long-term goal and what's the short-term steps that lead up to that? And you decide what's rewardable. [00:04:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The long-term goal is to have a job in my field, though when I'm thinking about things, it's like "If I can't get a full-time job with benefits, it might be better to be temping or a part-time job than having a full-time job with crappy insurance." Such that I can—if I can make enough to live off of but keep my State Care. You know, I have to actually make the calculations since I have the State Care, since if I had gotten that crazy job that was making like $80,000 or whatever, then sure I could just afford anything. But (pause) yeah. Most jobs that are out there aren't like that. So maybe I am better off just temping. [00:05:01]</p>

<p>But I mean, I want to be doing something in my field. And at least the good thing about this project is that it's on my resume. So I don't have this huge—I don't have any, really—okay, I have a month gap. But I only have a month gap on my resume. And that's it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is experience in your field, so this was a great thing to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can still keep it on there. I'm still technically a consulting librarian until I find something else. And I can go in and go back to volunteering and not getting paid and stuff. But (pause) yeah, it's still (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if the goal is really a job in your field, then it seems like the specific steps toward that are toward getting a job in your field? [00:06:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, if that's the ultimate goal. But if I'm not going to get a job in my field for like three years or something, and until then I have either temping or some administrative assistant job or something like that, you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, so that's necessary, right, I mean you can't -</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm not setting up my reward system such that I'm not going to get that trip to Florida till I get a job in my field, because I'm not going to wait three years to go to Florida. Especially if I get a job that's paying decently and not in my field.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the reward isn't based on getting a job, was it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's based on doing things towards getting a job. Which I guess I could still be doing even when I'm in another field or temping or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you have to. Otherwise there's no way out. So if you make—if the rewards are only—if you could get the same amount of rewards from following up at the temp agency and following leads on jobs in your field... there has to be a way that you're motivating yourself in addition to the temp agency. Because if you only do the temp agency stuff, the likelihood of the temp agency leading you to your field is a lot smaller than applying to specific jobs in your field. [00:07:22]</p>

<p>So you have to find a way to motivate yourself I think to do both. Because the temp agency is a way to gain some financial independence right now. That might work faster toward that. But cover letters and following up—if you get leads of a contact or something, those are what's going to lead you to your career versus your job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm. But I'm just thinking maybe getting something in my field is like a pipe dream and I need to give up on it now and just do the things I can do. Maybe not. But also the whole financial—because the financial independence thing is a lot more important to me than the job in my field. Like, I want a job in my field, but it's really driving me crazy to be doing absolutely nothing at all and having no financial independence. [00:08:11]</p>

<p>I like being able to spend money on things. Like right now, we were talking yesterday about Hanukah, and what sort of price range we'd be spending on each other. So I told Sydney probably something like maybe around up to $40, because that's probably what I—if I got a job it'd be way more than that. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that's where you are right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because he wants to get me the Kindle Fire, which is like what he has, and it's really nice, and I think it's something like $150, $200. But he's fine with getting me something more expensive. Also because he wants for us both to have tablets because that'd be cool. And we can do stuff with them. So it's okay that he's spending more money on me. But the fact that I'm only spending like $40 or something when I want to be able to be more generous. [00:09:10]</p>

<p>And yet I don't want to be stupid. I don't want to recklessly spend this money that is mostly my parents' money anyways and not my money. And if I spend so much—like if we're still going out to eat all the time. We're trying to do it less, but it's hard—especially the days when he's feeling more depressed, it's hard to completely avoid it. And he likes going out to eat, and I like going out to eat, but just spending all this money...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard without the money.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I actually had to let him—he has a lots of money that's in stocks that he has to sell, and it takes awhile to—he sells stock and sells more stock, and originally the reason why I lent him the money was just because the rent was due for his place, and he didn't have his checkbook with him at my place. We were at my place, and so I was like "Okay, you know what, I'm going to write a check. I have to go over to your place anyways to pick up some clothes for you." Because right before the hurricane. And I was going to go grocery shopping and stuff. And so I was like "Okay, I'll do this, and I'll write the check and you write me a check." [00:10:17]</p>

<p>Except that then it went oh wait, he has to write another check to his therapist and all this other stuff, and (pause) so finally, I guess today, the selling of more stock, in the thing that took longer but gives him more money went through, so he'll finally write me back. But that's like $650 that I have not had for the past—since Hurricane Sandy. What, two weeks, three weeks?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Three weeks ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Three weeks ago. So yeah, it makes me worry about money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's understandable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then maybe setting up your system to reward you for steps in both directions? [00:11:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we'll just have to make a check that you're not just moving in one direction. Because both of those things are important. Getting something for now to establish some financial independence, a sense of security, some kind of structure for yourself. And also something that might be longer term but working toward whatever avenues there are more in your field.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The thing is I feel if the temp added up to like an admin assistant thing, I'd feel guilty leaving if I was there for less than six months or a year, and I was looking for stuff in my field right away as soon as I got there. I feel like I'd have to take a break, because it would look bad, right, to be in a job for like three months?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not via temp agency though, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not a temp agency, but if I went to temp agency and got something out of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so now we're planning three steps ahead? [00:12:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, while I'm at the temp agency I can write as many cover letters as I want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so that's where you are now. It doesn't make sense to spend a lot of time and emotional energy thinking about "what would I do once I'm in a job that I got through the temp agency?" Because you're not there. And we can make those plans if that becomes a scenario.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so. Or even if I—if I was at a temp job that was supposed to be six weeks long, and if I had something—I guess I could always tell them my availability starts after whatever day. Maybe that's what I should be doing, because it just is crazy and I really want financial independence, because I'm sick of relying on my parents, even though now they're less crazy about money. And even Sydney is also less crazy about money, because it turns out that his insurance actually is paying for his entire [inaudible [00:13:02], so it's paying for itself. So now he's less stressed about money too, which is good. But I'm still stressed about money. (pause) [00:13:12]</p>

<p>Especially, yeah, and I keep on telling Sydney, "You're not completely better. You don't want to get a job and have to leave because of depression or do a bad job or something. You're better off waiting until you're completely better. And I'd feel more comfortable telling him that if I had a job and could pay for when we went out to eat and all that stuff. And (pause) I don't know. I haven't even looked at the job blog site this week yet or anything. But I really do need to make myself write cover letters. Because I haven't yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you said you haven't looked at the site this week. Did you look at it last week? [00:14:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I looked at it last week, or the week—it had gotten delayed at some point for something, but (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were there things that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: There were things that were sort of borderline. Maybe one or two that I could've applied for. But a lot that require more experience than I have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to let those chances go by. It seems like your motivation is such that they are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, and then it's like do I also apply for all these admin assistant jobs, or is it like doing the temp agency enough in that direction and then applying to my field enough in the other direction?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if you're not writing any cover letters, then the first one you write is to the thing that's most likely to get you a job. And it has—so far, your luck with getting an interview are the ones that are a little bit more specific to what you actually want to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. [00:15:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it seems like if right now you're not writing any, the goal is to write one. And you write the one for the thing that is the best shot of getting what you want. (pause) If you set the goal a little bit lower, something that you're more likely to actually achieve, you're more likely to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If the goal feels really high and unobtainable, it's going to feel overwhelming, and most people don't want to be overwhelmed. Including you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. And you know, I'm starting to have motivation. Like I finished that encoded [inaudible [00:15:44]. And I was like "I'm the awesomest person ever." And then Friday I ended up actually spending all afternoon right before [inaudible [00:15:52] cooking. So it wasn't like I had time to follow up with the temp agency or doing any job-related things, ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you did—you were motivated enough to make that call and leave a message today. [00:16:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was motivated enough to make that call, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it does seem like you're getting a little bit more active in that area.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And part of the motivation is to keep my mom off my back, yeah. But yesterday I was in theory going to go down to my folks and go clothes shopping with my mom to get sweaters and stuff that actually fit, because these ones don't really fit so much anymore. But I had a group [inaudible [00:16:25] dinner last night. But it wasn't until 8. So I totally could've done it. But when I was talking to my mom on Saturday night, I was like "Oh, I have to get back for the [inaudible [00:16:33] dinner," and she was like "Oh, do you want to do it some other time?" and of course I was like yes, I'll push it off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Easy out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like "maybe I should just do the clothes shopping here." Because I just don't need my mom seeing how large I've gotten. It's not like she's not going to see me on Thanksgiving in like three days, but to see what size I am and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like an invasion of your privacy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, even though she's the one paying for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that why she wants to come with you? [00:17:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think it's because she wants me to have clothes and buy them, not because she wants to know what size I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she's thinking that if she offers to go with you, you'll actually do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. I think I've even been the one to mention that I needed more clothes, but I got the new winter jacket and stuff, and (pause) and I can be in these sweaters. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not something that you feel comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They ride up a little, and I feel weird wearing them, and want ones that are bigger. And I mean, these sweaters are also at least a couple years old. Some of them are even older than that. Some of them are staring to fall apart, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You need something that you feel confident and comfortable in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just really hard, because before if I was going clothes shopping, I'd be going clothes shopping with Allison. And Allison is not here. So I don't really have anyone who I can be like "Let's go clothes shopping together." "Okay, yay." I mean, I don't like clothes shopping. And Sydney also needs some clothes, so theoretically we can go clothes shopping together. But he's also not very motivated. Though he is starting to think more "Hey, maybe I should get some nicer shirts and care more about my appearance, and I'll feel better." So we need to make a trip to the Gallery or Macy's or something. Or I guess there's Macy's at the Gallery. Or something. [00:18:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you rather do it with him or on your own? Or with another friend? Is there some other friend that you could go with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd rather go with him if he were able to, but the problem is that I shouldn't rely on him to be able to, and I need to get past that, like be able to do it alone if I have to. It's also carrying all the bags; I suppose I could at least borrow his car and park there and stuff. And make lots of trips to the garage to drop off all the clothes that I acquire. Or go to a place like Old Navy or something, find a sweater that fits, buy the rest of the exact same sweater in different colors online. [00:19:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Assuming Old Navy had sweaters that I liked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there's lots of places you could shop online.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could employ that strategy in lots of places.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I could, yeah. I just sort of feel like I want to try the first one on. I mean I guess if I find something online that has returns. But then you have to deal with the shipping and taxes. So I think it's easier to get one something, some sweater, offline, and then buy the rest online.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. But you could do that lots of places. Doesn't have to be Old Navy. Wherever you feel you're going to have the best luck, I suppose.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably has to be somewhere in the mall though. Like if I went to Thrifty and found a sweater that fit, I couldn't really order ten more of it online. [00:20:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, right. No. It needs to be a place that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: A real place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Someplace that has a standing store and an online version. With multiples.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And Thrifty is not that place. But yeah (pause) I just hate clothes shopping. And I always put it off as long as possible, because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We've had these conversations before. The same hesitations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even if I'm not overweight. Even when I lost all the weight, I took forever to actually go clothes shopping.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it that you hate about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All the taking things off and trying them on and carrying everything around. Mostly the carrying everything around and stuff, which is why it's easier if I have a friend or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The carrying it around after you've purchased something, or carrying your selections to the changing area? [00:21:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Changing area is fine, but dealing with my jacket and my purse. I have to at least bring some sort of—I guess I could just bring a credit card and my driver's license, in theory. Like that could be the bare minimum. I might not need a purse. But usually I'd be bringing my purse with me. And so yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So too much schlepping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. I just hate carrying things everywhere. So it's just enough to—and I actually used to like clothes shopping when I was younger, like in high school, middle school. And I don't know what changed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So would some of that be—would some of the barrier be removed in a setting where you could—a place that might have a cart so that you could stash your heavy jacket in a cart and not feel like you were carrying everything? [00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wonder if sort of a store on its own versus a mall might feel like you were doing less schlepping, because you could park right outside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it also requires borrowing the car, which is easy enough, but—because like clothes shopping without a car is really annoying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, for you then it creates a lot more carrying, which it seems like is a lot of the barrier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. And also bringing things back. No, but then again, if I only go to one store and I find that there isn't anything that works there, then it's unfortunate. (pause) So (pause) I'm sort of reluctant to go that route, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where do you usually have luck?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends. Like I got this shirt at Target. Some of the other sweatshirts—I have three sweaters that I really, really like, and that are now too small. But I got those at Macy's. Pants I usually have luck at Old Navy, but I think I'm okay for pants for now. I don't know. Found some nice things last year at Nordstrom's, but that requires my grandmother, because Nordstrom's is expensive. And it's probably not worth the effort, because I'd have to go down there. If I were like staying the weekend for Thanksgiving, it would be like "Okay, I could go"—[00:23:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not. We're going down for Thanksgiving. I don't want to stay overnight because I don't want to get in a fight with my dad about whether or not Sydney and I can stay in the same room. (pause) Especially considering it's not like there are two bedrooms to put us in. Like one of us would have to be in the open living room downstairs, and that would be really lame, and there's no privacy. [00:24:00]</p>

<p>So it is now a policy, I'm not staying with my parents anywhere, pretty much ever again until I—unless I am single again or married, because unless my parents—unless my dad, really, changes his mind. Like no family vacations either. Because they're like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're avoiding that conflict.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm avoiding that conflict, and I wouldn't want to stay me and my mom in one room and Sydney and my dad in the other room. Sydney doesn't want that either. It'd be really awkward and uncomfortable for him. And I'm 27 years old. So I'm not doing that. I mean, also avoiding the conflict of being around them for more than a day anyway, which—it'd be a lot more doable if Sydney and I had the same room. And until my dad is okay with that, which may be never, unless I'm married, because he's being stupid, it is now a policy not staying in the same city as them. [00:25:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are they aware that this is policy for you, or have you...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if they're aware it's policy. When my mom asked me about the Israel trip, she's like "Would you change your mind if Sydney could come?" I'm like, well not if you're going to make it so I have to stay in the same hotel room and Sydney has to stay in the same hotel room as dad. I'd be better off without Sydney at all and staying in my own room. So no, I need privacy. I'm 27 years old. So I don't know if they know it's my official policy. Because I never announced it to them as such. But my mom knows that I feel that way, and said no to the trip to Israel for that reason specifically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how did you explain your decision about your Thanksgiving plans?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I actually said it would be easier just for us to go back. But it is part of that. That is one of the big reasons. (pause) And I feel more comfortable in my house anyways and stuff. I like having privacy. I like having a door I can actually close, because... [00:26:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well this is one way of you asserting and maintaining a boundary that feels comfortable for you without it becoming an area of conflict. (pause) It doesn't' become a value judgment that you're making about your dad's beliefs or... it just is a way of maintaining that boundary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which I'm going to do in full force. So yeah. But I'm not staying over there. I can't easily go clothes shopping and stuff. So I have to know it'd be a day trip down to my parents or doing something here or having my parents come up here or something. I don't know. Maybe if my mom were willing to come up here, we could go shopping and all go out to dinner, and then we'd get free kosher Chinese food, and that might be the better way to do it. But I'm putting it off. I'm like "Okay, maybe I can go this winter without having to get new sweaters," even though... [00:27:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you want them though. You want the outcome of the shopping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Without the work. And maybe it would be better just looking at them online and guessing my size, which I can probably do. I probably, I guess at this point, would be a large for sweaters. Look at ones that I think would fit my body, order one, and then if it works order a bunch. Maybe I should just do that, so that way I don't have to leave the house. Because I'm okay clothes shopping with friends or something, but I don't like doing it by myself, and I don't like doing it when there's conflict involved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said "so I don't have to leave the house." Leaving the house...? [00:28:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Leaving the house or leave the house and schlep all of the things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you don't typically have a fear of leaving the house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just heard you say that and it stood out to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no. Leaving the house for that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Purpose. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think just like with setting a goal for what's going to get you most likely to write a cover letter. Setting a goal, though. Similar idea here. What's going to get you to your outcome? You do want sweaters that you feel comfortable in. So what's going to get you to that? Are you going to be more likely to order something online? Or are you going to be more likely to go to a store? And be honest with yourself, and let yourself take action on the thing you're likely to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it probably would be online, because it's the easiest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So lowering the barriers to getting what you want. That's the way to look at it. What can we do to make it the lowest hurdle possible. It's not necessarily going to be hurdle-free, but you can get over low hurdles, so we set them up. [00:29:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I don't even need that many nice sweaters. Because my t-shirts, I have older ones that I got that were like mediums still fit. And I have a sweatshirt, or I have multiple sweatshirts that fit. And I can always wear a sweatshirt over a t-shirt if I'm in the house or doing anything that isn't job related.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You just need a few things to show up to work or an interview in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which I guess would mean, depending—I guess five sweaters, if I did laundry every week. So (pause) five sweaters should be doable. And it's also the whole "I have no room in my room for more clothes" and stuff, and I have to figure out what to do with all the other ones.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, things that don't fit don't need to be taking up space. They can get stored someplace.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:30:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if that's taking a box to your parents' at some point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which would also require the car. I guess I could -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, but you're going there anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true, and I am driving there. So maybe I could just get a box and put things in them and bring that and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That's not—it doesn't seem like that's something worth stopping you. Because you could figure out a way to make space. Whether that be off-season clothes getting stored at your parents', or things that aren't going to fit right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, the problem with off-season clothes is because the weather changes so easily, or it might be hot in the room. I keep my off-season clothes around because I usually end up wearing them. At least t-shirts and stuff. (pause) Because originally that's what I did, and then it's like "No wait, I actually need all these clothes." The ones that don't fit I could. You know, I try to always go through and find the ones that are like, that I'll never, even if I lost weight, I'll never wear again because they're in such bad condition, and get rid of them. Donate them or whatever, or throw them out if they're really bad. But (pause) I haven't done that yet this season. I should. [00:31:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're putting lots of things on your to-do list.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't want that many things. It should just be write cover letters and order sweaters online.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So then that's what it is. Right there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And call the temp agency again and again and again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a notebook with you, or a calendar or anything? Or a phone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a phone. This'll work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's make this list official.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Where should I put it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Either notes, or if you keep a calendar on there, both seem like they could be appropriate places.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, the calendar would mean that I have to put it on specific dates. (pause) Actually, you know what, Word Document or an Office document I think is going to be the better solution, because then I don't have to put specific dates on it. Especially because then I don't want it to get off track that like "Oh, I didn't do things on X day, now I'm like stuck." (pause) Luckily my computer's on already. (pause) [00:32:24]</p>

<p>Okay. Then document. "To-Do List." So then what? Because "apply for cover letters" is too general, you know? It's an ongoing thing. [00:33:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but this is not an ongoing list. This is your list for Monday through Wednesday. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Because Thursday's going got be Thanksgiving, and you can get these things done in three days. There's still some time left today when you leave here. So you said before you write a cover letter—so I guess the goal, what you said was write a cover letter. But actually before you do that, you need to look at the job site, right? You haven't done that yet this week? So let's make that goal. Look at the job postings and pick one cover letter to write from what's on there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm. (pause) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If there's nothing perfect, you pick the best one. Write the cover letter. [00:34:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm. Slash fill out application if there is one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good addition. Because sometimes there are, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they suck. But I'll—yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Call the temp agency Tuesday, because you've already done one for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't have to bother them on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then three: order sweaters online. That's a doable list over the next few days.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There might be a couple of things that I need to add to it though. Like "write skit for my a capella group winter concert."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's due this week? [00:35:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, usually we try to get at least a first draft—especially, the concert's on December 2nd, so we want the draft of things done by Thanksgiving. And (pause) and I actually might have to write two skits, so they kind of go together, and I sort of have to... yeah. Well, the first one I can make really, really short. But (pause) yeah. It's kind of complex, because basically it's a robbery that I have to plan and then have a scene where they explain how everything was done, and the middle scene where they're questioning people is going to be written by someone else. So I have to figure out how they steal the test tube menorah at the test tube menorah lighting in front of everyone. And yeah, just "write draft of skit." (pause) [00:36:02]</p>

<p>Yeah, because that's something I've been putting off. I don't know, I mean do you think I'd be better off—maybe I should just go somewhere else to do all these things, because like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did say, earlier today in the session, you said that you don't tend to get a lot done—I believe you said I get nothing done when Sydney is around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I finished the encoding when Sydney was around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does he get in the way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like "Oh, let's play Minecraft together; let's listen to a podcast together." And I could in theory listen to a podcast and write things, but it's sort of hard to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, but if he's asking for your attention... he's asking for attention.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, we're both Interneting at the same time while listening to something. But still, if I'm listening to something, I'm going to be Interneting and not—I could in theory multitask and look for jobs, but I think I'd be better off if I like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You may get more done faster if you're someplace where you can focus on the single task. [00:37:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I forced myself at least one or two days a week, if I just make myself go and walk to the public library, because it's a what, 10, 15 minute walk from my house. Then I get that walking in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you'd be there. You could set a time that you're going to be there...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And write things and stuff. Yeah. They must have Internet connections. I'm not quite sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most libraries do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I might have to ask about it and find out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know your way around a library.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's true. So like doing something like that might be more motivating, and then I'm out of the house. I've worked from my place and then sometimes I'm at Sydney's place and I guess—he said the Starbucks, which is not that far away has free wi-fi. So I could go somewhere like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. They have a big workspace.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So one of those two options, which will get me to walk. And I guess just carry the bare minimum with—you know, because I still have to carry my laptop, but my laptop isn't that heavy. [00:38:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you're going there to do one particular thing, really all you need is your Starbucks card and the laptop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can lighten your backpack.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or get a second bag because the thing is that if I have bad like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to take out -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to—it has all of my drugs in there. I don't want to take those out. Because then if they're in there, it doesn't matter if I'm at my place or Sydney's place, I have all of them in there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 38:34] But so if you're going to go, you could carry just—you could get a smaller bag or a computer case or something that becomes the thing you take with you to the library or to Starbucks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. So yeah. And it's not like my bag is currently too heavy, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you spend an hour somewhere in the Square after our session and tackle one of these? [00:39:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could spend a half hour. Because originally I was going to meet up with Sydney after his therapy with starts at 2 and ends at 3. Now he's doing the phone session. So I'm not sure if I'm going to meet him when I—because we were going to go to go for a late lunch after this, so (pause) I probably, I could at least probably do the sweater ordering if nothing else, because that's like the easiest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a half an hour, yes. That would be a way to knock off one thing off the list. If you plan to just go from here to a spot where you would have free wi-fi and pick a store, peruse, and order. That's one thing off your list already before you even make it home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. I could do that pretty easily.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And then maybe enact the Starbucks plan or the library plan tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tomorrow. Yeah. Which I could do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can. I have complete faith in you. You can do that. If you set up the structure, you can follow it. [00:40:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just—I don't know, I feel so silly about it. It's like I have to write this to-do list like in order to make myself do things, and I can't just do the things I need to do (pause) right away. You know? It's like I'm not just like super motivated and stuff. And I don't know. I guess maybe because I've just been going so long without actually getting anything done.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's a hard cycle to break. And I'm hearing judgment of yourself creep in. I understand why you're feeling that way, but I also know that it's not helping you to do anything differently. When you start judging yourself for what you need, it makes you feel worse. It stands in the way of getting out of that cycle. [00:41:03]</p>

<p>So this is where you are. You need a list. You need someone to help you think through it. You need a reward when you do it. That's where you are. So that's where you have to meet yourself. This is what you need to get these things done, so we do it.</p>

<p>I did want to take a minute—I know last time we talked, a big focus was feeling uncomfortable with your weight and finding ways to get more movement into your days. I promised I would follow up on that, so I wanted to check in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been like a little bit, but not much. Like Friday, Sydney had to go to the post office to pick up a package, and finally, finally, finally—it only took him like four months—but finally put in his change of address form to change his mailing address from my place to his new place. Because he'd done it the first time and then couldn't do it online the second time, because it never went through and had credit card problems. So we walked to the post office, walked back. So it was like 10 minutes each way or so. It was like a little walk. It wasn't a huge walk though. [00:42:16]</p>

<p>Yesterday when we had the [inaudible [00:42:19] dinner, originally it was like "Oh, we can walk there" but it would've been a half hour each way, which in the end was a good decision that we didn't—especially because Sydney ended up getting beer, and we were like tired and cold and it was like 10. But I'm like—so I forgot about that.</p>

<p>But I'm still not really doing enough to actually get out the hassle. I feel that pain in the lower back when I do things for very long. So I made Sydney carry my purse and stuff, to at least alleviate that somewhat. And I feel like we must have walked at least one other time last week. But I don't remember what it was. [00:43:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there were days where you were able to incorporate that movement into what you needed to do. And now we need to build on that and find more ways to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I can actually make myself do the whole "get out of the house and go to the library" thing, that would do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, accomplish both goals with one piece.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I'm just so bad at it though, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've had trouble doing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just the whole because it hurts my lower back thing, even when I'm carrying nothing, if I walk for too long at a time, it's just so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know how long—where's the window? What can you do without pain, and where...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think if I'm not carrying anything, I might be able to go for like a little bit over five minutes. It gets really, really low, unfortunately. And it's really frustrating, because I used to be able to walk for an hour or two hours or whatever. And my lower back pain is a problem. And I don't think it's because—I mean, I haven't been doing the back exercises, but I think it's more because I've gained all this weight and my body doesn't want to have to support all this weight. So it's like a really hard cycle to get out of. [00:44:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's why you need to do those short chunks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If that's where you're starting you can do five minute intervals lots of times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's a little harder if I'm going to be like "okay, my walking is walking to and from the public library," and if it's like 10 minutes each way, then that's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then that's what you're stuck with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I want to be able—I guess I could do like (pause) I guess, except it would be too busy, if I did the Starbucks here, near my place that is, not here, that would be less than—a shorter walk, but (pause) but then have the problem with being all crowded and feeling guilty taking up a table all day. It'd be better to go to the public library, but... [00:45:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you haven't been taking up a table all day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you buy a drink, then you're entitled to a table.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. I mean, also—I guess I'd wait till normal people were at work and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People with working schedules. Not to say we're normal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. People with the typical 9-5 schedule, which is the majority of Americans of working age, I think. But (pause) yeah, they—I don't know. But then also if I'm carrying my stuff, then I want to get out of the house and I want to be able to do this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So make that your priority. Figure out how you can do it with the least burdens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I want to be carrying my—I want to have my laptop to do it, but like—and also because then it's a lot more likely for me to do that than just take a walk, because then I'm like—[00:46:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's always been true for you. Having a particular destination. Working it into another productive thing has made you more likely to do it in the past. So I think the idea of finding a bag that you can then take the bare necessities; just your laptop, your license, your wallet, and that's it. That's all you need. And you don't need to go for a long time. In an hour, you could probably get a lot done if you're focused. And you can do that.</p>

<p>And I want you to think about this as what are you doing today? What are you doing Tuesday? And what are you doing Wednesday? And that's it. You don't need to think about you're going to do this for the rest of your life, or for the next four weeks even. Let's just work on one day. One day at a time. Then we'll make the next plan. But we don't need to make plans forever.</p>

<p>Why don't we stop there for today. I'll let you get started on the plan. And I will see you next week, same time? [00:47:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Are we on in general for Mondays and Wednesdays?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we can be, I think the [End of audio]</p>

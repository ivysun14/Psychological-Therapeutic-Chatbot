<p>PATIENT:  (5-minute silence) Just before I came in today I was thinking about the difference in the way I felt, uhm, well, about teaching in general, yesterday and today.  Because, again, I had, well, the last few weeks, feeling more just not interested in it.  And I had dreaded going back on Monday.  And then yesterday I had a, I don't know, for some reason I felt it was a nice day and I was enjoying teaching again.  And I thought, well, maybe I won't, I don't really feel so strongly about not teaching again.  And then today, uhm, the end res—, the, the last period of the day went in such a way that made me feel again I'm not teaching well and I've sort of lost, well, I suppose, the goals that I used to have, what I was trying to get out of teaching.  And, uhm, I just sort of have nothing to put in its place and I'm not sure, once I've lost the other reasons I taught for, uhm, whether I really want to teach or like it.  And I was just thinking on that line then something just suddenly occurred to me.  This is before I came in.</p>

<p>And I don't have any idea if it's related or not but I suddenly remembered that last night, when I got home, uhm, MSCZ called to say he would be working late and won't be able to come home.  And this surprised me so at first I was surprised and disappointed.  And then I felt sort of relieved.  And I w—, I remember being very aware that I was relieved and then sort of saying, well, I'm just not going to think about that or I just sort of pushed it out of my mind.  But I think I was relieved because I knew that he'd, I could do what I wanted that evening, that he wouldn't be around giving me the feeling there were things I should do or had to do.  And I could just sort of throw together supper, I didn't have to cook a big meal.  And just for lots of little things I was relieved, I think.  But I was, I think what, because it came after thinking about today, it made me wonder if there was some connection.</p>

<p>Because often, when I feel I'm not teaching well, I think it's because I'm, I'm not really able to give my thoughts to it.  I'm distracted by something else.  But the something else is so vague, I'm not aware at the time what else I'm being distracted by.  (Pause) And I think when I realized I was relieved, last night, my feeling immediately was, well, I shouldn't feel relieved.  And so then I would feel guilty.  But I quickly put it out of my mind so completely that I just, I'm not sure if I felt guilty about it. (Pause)</p>

<p>But also last night I, there were lots of little things that I wanted to do and didn't do.  Well, I wanted to do them and then I wanted to have them done but I didn't want to do them so I didn't.  And this was one reason I felt relieved MSCZ wouldn't be home to sort of, even if he never said anything but still, his presence would sort of make me feel I'd better keep at it and get these things done.  And so then I told myself, well, I can do them tonight.  And I just wonder, too, if that was always on me, that I was thinking more in terms of all these things that I'm trying to get done at home, rather than thinking about being at school. (Silence)</p>

<p>I started thinking about my assistant.  And, uhm, I suppose I did because I was thinking of the way she does enjoy teaching and so readily has good ideas almost because, well, she, there's a certain concern for the moment that, uhm, even if things are bothering her or are on her mind outside of school, she doesn't really, they don't seem to be preying on her mind the same way things would bother me.  While she is in school, she can kind of forget things or else maybe she just doesn't feel things that deeply.  But I don't know, it's just more, she, every moment is what she cares about at that moment, whereas I hardly give any thought to the moment, itself, at all.  And it's almost as if it's always for some future thing that I use every moment but without just caring about the present.  Or else I'm worried because of things that happened in the past and just going over them and over them so I can avoid them in the future.  And then of course, they're happening again right then. (Pause)</p>

<p>It's funny.  Saying that, it just seems so silly to let myself feel this way about things or be trapped in that way but I still am.  And then it makes me think of, uhm, something that occurred to me last night, that sometimes, when I hear you repeat something I've said, even though I might not be in the same mood for it — I remember yesterday I said, well, it depends on the mood I'm in, I guess, how I feel about things but some—, I think it's also just hearing somebody else say it, it just would strike me as being ridiculous and then I want to deny ever having felt that way.  (Pause) And I, then I couldn't tell whether it's because it really is ridiculous and, and I can see it when I'm not the one actually saying it or if it is what I'm doing with myself, too, that I'm denying it because I can't stand facing it or just why I feel that way.  (Pause) But I think, too, yesterday I felt, well, sort of self-conscious or it's almost as if the whole day I could hear myself talk.  And, uhm, I don't, I think maybe I was beginning to wonder if, after I left, if it were almost, I was going over everything I was saying to see if I could tell what effect it would have on you.  I don't know whether — I didn't I wasn't aware of doing it while I was here. (Pause)</p>

<p>But I think somehow during the time I was here, I, maybe it was because I wasn't finding it easy to get into things and was feeling sort of self-conscious about it, but I left, well, just feeling sort of discouraged and, uhm, well, I can't remember exactly what it was but sort of on the idea, I can't, I can't seem to get hold of what I should be doing while I'm here in analysis, which has bothered me lately.  And just sort of, well, the more general feeling was just that I'm stupid.  And I don't know why I would have started to get that feeling because I didn't come in here feeling that way.  And I don't remember now what I was talking about while I was here.  Well, because that would explain why I would feel differently today at school, if I did leave really feeling I was stupid again.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, it occurs to me that, uhm, eh, your feeling about my repeating what you'd said about feeling about MSCZ last week and then when you heard me say it, your feeling that it sounds ridiculous might be the sort of thing that would have led you to feel you were stupid to have said such a thing, feeling the way you did yesterday, then, about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean, when it didn't seem so real yesterday?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Right.  You were wondering, how could you ever have thought it or felt it, or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, it was a strange feeling because it was, I could remember it was almost like I had known somebody else very well and that person had said it.  Because I knew I had and I knew what feelings had led me to say it but I wasn't feeling them at all.  And so it was almost like looking at somebody else.  (Pause) But there's something else, too, that, uhm, I know sometimes when I've thought of things outside of, uhm, well, before I've come here or over a weekend and they've seemed, they've just seemed so real and so important.  And then when I start talking about them here they don't seem to be that real or important, perhaps sometimes because I'm trying to get away from them.  But I don't know, it just, they're, everything is so emotional that, if I don't happen to be feeling that particular emotion, then it doesn't have any reality.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was just thinking, I, I don't know, this seems like an extreme statement but it almost leads me to feel or think that I just don't know anything.  Because everything I say is sort of an emotional statement.  And, and it, so, so all I'm doing is feeling and those change, my feelings change.  So I just feel as if I'm sort of constantly in flux.  Which leads me back to a feeling I've had lately of just, I guess, feeling sort of chaotic inside or confused.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I keep thinking back to the particular incident that occurred today that disturbed me so much.  And it was just simply, uhm, I was reading a rather difficult book to them.  And, but they are quite interested in it and they had a lot of questions and things.  But it's a long book and I was worried that it, if I didn't keep reading it, I would never get through it so we just sort of touched on their questions and then I would keep going.  And I think I sort of stifled them in their questions.  And probably, I, I think I have this great fear that somehow I've killed their interest in it by not letting them just talk about their questions and not worrying if I didn't get through the book.  And so now I have this, well, I don't know, well, a great feeling of urgency that I somehow have to right it tomorrow and ensure that they still are interested and, and really let them ask questions and discuss the ideas that they're meeting in the book and not push on.  (Pause) And I don't know why it disturbs me so much, except that I was doing to them, by not really letting them work out their questions or not attending to them, I was just doing to them what I guess I always have the fear people will do to me, or feel people do to me, of sort of not respecting my ideas or me, as a person.  And I was just giving them the idea that I felt the book and what it said was much more important than anything they were thinking.  And that was what I was doing at that time.  So I was defeating my own purpose.  And I think, well, it just makes me feel very stupid again.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And again the same thing that has bothered me a lot lately: the way I will dwell on little things that happened at school, which is what I do anyway but bothers me when I do it here.  (Pause) Because I think I think of it as wasting time.  And I, well, sort of accept that I'll waste my own time but I don't want to waste this time.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How is it different?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  My own time and this time?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I suppose just the expectations I bring to it.  When I'm on my own time I just know I'd dwell on this type of thing and so I just don't expect to accomplish much of anything if I'm in one of the moods where I'll be thinking that way.  But here, I, well, I've gradually learned to expect less immediately but, uhm, I don't know, I think I'm still looking at this as some way to be more comfortable with myself and I don't see how just thinking on all the little things that come to my mind about school are going to help.  (Pause) And then it occurred to me that what it makes me feel is that, and this might be why I don't like thinking about it while I'm here, is just makes me feel sort of petty and small-minded and a lot of little things that I don't like to think about myself.  And I make myself face it about myself if I'm here if they come to my mind.  And if I'm thinking on my, at home or something, I can escape it, I don't have to make myself face it.  (Pause) And I suppose there's also the added thing that you'll know I'm thinking in that way, whereas if I think at home, nobody has to know. (Pause)</p>

<p>And, and then it occurred to me, except for MSCZ.  If I don't if I don't hold my tongue, then I'll start immediately talking about all these things to MSCZ, if he's home, because that's all that will be on my mind.  And this makes me think of the, sort of the front that I keep up for most everybody.  And somehow I don't want people to know what I really am.  And it's, I, I remember one saying that annoyed me when somebody just described me as being sort of sweet and, I don't know, all these qualities, kind and so forth.  But actually, it, it's almost that I've created that impression very carefully because it's so opposite to what I think I really am.  (3-minute silence) I just seem to be sort of in a trap because I don't like people not knowing what I really am or having this false impression of me and yet I'm creating it.  And I want to be able to feel more relaxed and freer about just being myself but yet I'm so afraid of anybody knowing what I really am because somehow what I really am is so terrible or just sort of negative.  (Pause) And I suppose that's one reason why I can't unbend to feel any, or show any emotion, even if it's just laughing.  Because what, I, I must be afraid of what else I'll reveal if I, the emotion I might be revealing might be fine but I might reveal something else too.  So I have to keep kind of a very even image.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And it's funny, too.  I'm so concerned with having the, well, let's say the outside world having a certain image of me because I'm so afraid of anybody realizing what I really am.  On the other extent, I, I constantly have the feeling that my family saw me as much more negative than I am.  And so that I'm always feeling, if I think about it, upset that that was all they saw, this other false image to another extreme.  And I think I'm sort of worried that if outside my family people knew what I was like, they wouldn't accept me but somehow even though my family saw me as being so horrible they had to, since it was my family.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What sort of image do you feel I have, now?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean, today?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well or —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, I think it changes all the time.  (Pause) I really don't like thinking about it and the only time I do is when I have a, when I'm feeling particularly stupid then I assume you must see me as very stupid.  (Silence) I think at other times just, and just a few minutes ago this is probably what I was doing, I have to think of you as disassociating me from what I'm saying somehow.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

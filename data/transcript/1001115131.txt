<center><b><P>COGNITIVE THERAPY</P>
<p>Introduction</P></b></center>

<P>Bruce S. Liese has extensive experience as a cognitive therapist and has been in the forefront of practitioners who have successfully applied this model to addictions-related issues. An Associate Professor of Family Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center, Dr. Liese has achieved renown as a therapist, educator, and researcher in the field of addictions.</P>

<P>Cognitive therapy helps clients modify the thought patterns and maladaptive beliefs that can lead to troublesome behaviors and reactions. As it is applied to addictions, this model focuses on the beliefs and thoughts that tend to be associated with substance abuse behaviors. The cognitive therapist brings to light the thought patterns that relate to the individual's addictive behaviors, helps the client modify these thoughts, and collaborates with the client on the development of more effective coping skills.</P>

<P>This transcript is an initial therapy session with Dr. Liese and L.C. in which Dr. Liese helps L.C. identify his own thought patterns as they relate to his use of cocaine and alcohol.</P>

<p>Therapist 1: LC, I'm glad you could make it.</P>
<P>Client 1: Me too.</P>
<P>Therapist 2: My name is Bruce Liese. I'm glad to get to work with you. Okay. I would like to start, as I said earlier, by finding out what you want to talk about, so why don't we begin there.</P>
<P>Client 2: Well, basically, I don't know. It's up to you. What is it you would like to know?</P>
<P>Therapist 3: Well, I understand that you have had some difficulties with alcohol and with drugs?</P>
<P>Client 3: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 4: Okay. So, why don't we start there.</P>
<P>Client 4: Okay.</P>
<P>Therapist 5: Tell me what the background is, and I will ask you questions from there.</P>
<P>Client 5: Okay. Well, as far as drugs, first time I tried drugs was in 1983 during the time I was incarcerated. Alcohol, I first started drinking alcohol when I was about 13 years old.</P>
<P>Therapist 6: Okay. Do you mind that I am taking notes as we talk?</P>
<P>Client 6: No, I don't mind.</P>
<P>Therapist 7: Good, because I usually do, and if you want to see what I'm writing . . .</P>
<P>Client 7: That's okay. I trust you.</P>
<P>Therapist 8: People get curious sometimes. So, in 1983 you started using drugs when you were incarcerated at the time?</P>
<P>Client 8: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 9: And what were the drugs you were using?</P>
<P>Client 9: Cocaine.</P>
<P>Therapist 10: Okay. Any others?</P>
<P>Client 10: No.</P>
<P>Therapist 11: Okay, so you were in prison?</P>
<P>Client 11: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 12: Okay. For what?</P>
<P>Client 12: Well, I was in for attempted murder, armed robbery, home invasion, unlawful restraint.</P>
<P>Therapist 13: Okay. And it was while you were in prison that you started using cocaine?</P>
<P>Client 13: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 14: And when did you get out?</P>
<P>Client 14: In 1985.</P>
<P>Therapist 15: So, prior to that you hadn't used at all?</P>
<P>Client 15: No.</P>
<P>Therapist 16: Okay. And you began drinking, you said, when you were 13 years old.</P>
<P>Client 16: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 17: How did you decide that drugs and alcohol were a problem for you?</P>
<P>Client 17: Well, because a lot of things in my life started to change, and the more I was messing with drugs, I started drifting off from family and started associating with different people like people that I normally would stay away from. I started drifting with different crowds with them and getting away from what I considered just friends and family.</P>
<P>Therapist 18: You would consider what?</P>
<P>Client 18: People that I considered as friends and my family, I would drift away from them to try to hide what I was doing.</P>
<P>Therapist 19: I see. Okay. And at what point did you decide that you had a problem?</P>
<P>Client 19: Well, I constantly end up broke, no money, and you know, life just started getting worse and worse and worse, and the more that I started wanting more and more, and I was losing interest in everything, just started not caring about a lot of different things.</P>
<P>Therapist 20: So you got out of prison in '85, and when did you finally decide, what year was it that you decided that you really needed to do something?</P>
<P>Client 20: About '90. I went back to prison before I decided to go get some help.</P>
<P>Therapist 21: And what did you go in for the second time?</P>
<P>Client 21: Possession of controlled substance.</P>
<P>Therapist 22: Okay. You've been through a lot in your life.</P>
<P>Client 22: Quite a bit.</P>
<P>Therapist 23: Yes, okay. Um, at this point, what are you doing in the way of drugs or alcohol.</P>
<P>Client 23: Well, I drink, not as heavy as I used to, but when I do, I overindulge when I do.</P>
<P>Therapist 24: And tell me more specifically what you mean when you say overindulge. How much?</P>
<P>Client 24: Well, it don't give a limit. I just drink until there is no more around or I can't go get anymore, the stores is closed.</P>
<P>Therapist 25: Okay. So, you are drinking still, and we call that binge drinking, is that what you would call it?</P>
<P>Client 25: Right. That's what I call it. Now I used to be, I guess you used to be able to call me town drunk.</P>
<P>Therapist 26: Okay. So you drank all the time?</P>
<P>Client 26: Yeah, I used to, but now, I don't know, it's just not like it used to be. It don't move me like it used to.
It's like every once in a while when I do decide to drink, I drink.</P>
<P>Therapist 27: And how often do you have binges?</P>
<P>Client 27: Oh, about, now about twice a month or so.</P>
<P>Therapist 28: Okay.</P>
<P>Client 28: Like this month I've been drinking excessively.</P>
<P>Therapist 29: And by excessively, what do you mean?</P>
<P>Client 29: I've been going about almost every day. I just had a recent death in the family, and it just seemed like I just took off on it.</P>
<P>Therapist 30: When you say took off on it, you mean what?</P>
<P>Client 30: Well, ever since my sister passed on New Years Day, I've been just drinking very heavy.</P>
<P>Therapist 31: Um, that's a pretty tragic event. What happened to her?</P>
<P>Client 31: Well, she had cancer for about three years, and she died on her birthday. So she suffered for about three years. I thought I was ready to accept it, but I guess I didn't, and I just reached back and got the bottle.</P>
<P>Therapist 32: As you talk about it right now to me, how do you feel?</P>
<P>Client 32: I feel, well since a little time has elapsed, I feel a little better, and I'm easing back up off the alcohol some, and like now I'm ready to go on with life.</P>
<P>Therapist 33: So, your sister's death was boy, just a few weeks ago!</P>
<P>Client 33: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 34: And your response was to start drinking heavily again.</P>
<P>Client 34: Right. I guess there something I wanted to do anyway, and that was an excuse.</P>
<P>Therapist 35: How would you describe your emotions after her death?</P>
<P>Client 35: I was trying to keep myself composed, but I would find myself easing off to myself and crying and this, that, and the other, and every time I would see a bottle, I would just go.</P>
<P>Therapist 36: Okay. I'm wondering. You told me earlier, before we started the actual session, that you were divorced.</P>
<P>Client 36: Yes.</P>
<P>Therapist 37: Who do you turn to for support and company when you are feeling down?</P>
<P>Client 37: Well, basically I'm a drifter type guy. When I get to feeling down I wander off to myself or like I switch states and cities and stuff a lot. I just get off to myself, and then I come back and then I go again. Like when I really feel down and out I sit and talk with one of my younger sisters.</P>
<P>Therapist 38: So, you're a loner.</P>
<P>Client 38: Right, basically I am a loner.</P>
<P>Therapist 39: And you really don't have any support or any close, close friends?</P>
<P>Client 39: Yes, I do. But like I said, I'm a loner. I don't like too much associating with different people, and like, it just seems like I'm more comfortable alone. There are a lot of people that I could go and talk to if I wanted to. It's always open for me to come to them, but I just don't do it.</P>
<P>Therapist 40: So, when things hurt inside, you don't have too many options.</P>
<P>Client 40: No I just usually take it and keep on going. I tries not to show real feelings. Or if I'm hurt I try not to let nobody know it.</P>
<P>Therapist 41: Is it possible that you drink to try to change your feelings, to try to feel better or numb or . . .</P>
<P>Client 41: Well, I really can't say exactly why I've been doing drinking. I can't come up with anything because then I would be trying to make up an excuse, and there is no excuse. I just do it.</P>
<P>Therapist 42: Okay. A couple of times you've said that you maybe really wanted to drink and you don't want to come up with excuses. What's your understanding, what is your best understanding of why people generally become alcoholics or drug addicts? What's your explanation?</P>
<P>Client 42: My explanation, I don't know. Like me, I just started off to experiment, and the more I experimented, the more I got off into it, and the next think I know it was a habit.</P>
<P>Therapist 43: So when you think of it as a habit, do you think of it as a disease kind of habit, or do you think of it as a just bad behaviors? What do you mean exactly?</P>
<P>Client 43: Well, I would say mostly bad behavior because a disease is something like cancer, tuberculosis.
Like drugs and alcohol is a disease that you get to yourself. It's nothing that you don't have to have. It's self-inflicted.</P>
<P>Therapist 44: So you view alcoholism and your alcoholism as pretty much bad behavior, and what causes it exactly do you think? Some people get it, some people don't.</P>
<P>Client 44: Well, like I can't really say what causes me to react to it the way I do because my mother doesn't drink. My father wasn't an alcoholic. It was just, I don't know, I guess I looked at myself as being a product of my environment from when I was growing up. I grew up in the Cabrini Green area.</P>
<P>Therapist 45: Tell me about that.</P>
<P>Client 45: Well, during the time I was growing up, to me it was the greatest place in the world to live. And like(?) and I could just like go out and get drunk, play baseball, didn't have nothing to worry about, go home, food is cooked, and nobody has to worry about paying rent or anything, and all I had to do was go out and have a good time and instead of me benefitting like I could have or should have like a lot of other people that I knowdid, I was more concerned with the alcohol and trying to get out of going to school and everything else.</P>
<P>Therapist 46: So, you didn't have anyone in your family who was a heavy drinker, so you probably didn't learn it from someone in the family.</P>
<P>Client 46: No, I guess I picked it up from my associating in the streets, hanging out with buddies, and once we started we'd get to drinking and clowning and having fun and one lead to another one and the next thing I knew it was just automatic.</P>
<P>Therapist 47: Okay. So, it's become automatic. . . Did anyone in your family have any kind of problems with depression or any kind of mental problems?</P>
<P>Client 47: Not that I know of.</P>
<P>Therapist 48: So what you learned when you were young is that the best way to have fun is to drink.</P>
<P>Client 48: That's the way it seemed to be.</P>
<P>Therapist 49: Okay. And perhaps the more you drank, the fewer things you could do to have fun. I'm not sure if that's true or not, but . . .</P>
<P>Client 49: Well, when I was young, I'd there were a lot of times I'd be drunk, wake up lying in a park asleep or at somebody's house or land always somewhere, went home and be scared to go in the house and be sleeping in front of the door. To me it was exciting.</P>
<P>Therapist 50: Okay. And what other things did you have to be excited about besides drinking? Did you have anything that really turned you on or got you fired up?</P>
<P>Client 50: Well, I used to like playing baseball and you know just hanging out, picnics, barbecues, and believe it or not, I used to like to read all the time.</P>
<P>Therapist 51: Okay. You know, you seem to me, can I tell you what I'm thinking so far?</P>
<P>Client 51: Sure.</P>
<P>Therapist 52: You seem to me to be a pretty sensitive man, soft-hearted.</P>
<P>Client 52: I am.</P>
<P>Therapist 53: Yeah, and it seems to me that you feel things like normal human beings do, that you feel things intensely. That you have very deep personal feelings.</P>
<P>Client 53: I do. I just don't like to show emotions.</P>
<P>Therapist 54: Right. And it also seems to me that you have some rules about not showing your feelings.</P>
<P>Client 54: I do.</P>
<P>Therapist 55: And a lot of people have those rules then turn to alcohol and other drugs to try to turn off . . .</P>
<P>Client 55: Medicate it.</P>
<P>Therapist 56: Medicate it. That was the word I was actually thinking about earlier. What do you think about what I just shared with you?</P>
<P>Client 56: It makes sense. Because I do have a lot of personal feelings like you know, like other people come to me with their problems this, that, and the other sometimes. I wonder, hey, how come you don't ask me how I feel sometimes? I always something that your problem is your problem. So I turn around and walk off. I don't want to be bothered.</P>
<P>Therapist 57: So, people are happy to share their feelings with you, but they don't listen well.</P>
<P>Client 57: Right. Well, really I don't bring my feelings to nobody else, but like I'll be wondering sometimes why can't you just ask me how do I feel.</P>
<P>Therapist 58: Well, with you talking about your sister's death, I was really struck by how deeply . . .</P>
<P>Client 58: Oh, yeah. Well, my family, we're distanced, but we are very close. Very close. We don't be together, share a lot of quality time and everything together, but we are a very close knit family. And this is the first death that really in the immediate family except for my father. He died in '88, and it was '94 or something like that before we even knew he was dead. That hurt me a lot.</P>
<P>Therapist 59: Tell me about it.</P>
<P>Client 59: My father left home when I was about 14 years old. Like when I was 22, he come back in my life,
and I wanted to be around with him, you know. Me and him bonded, and we got very, very close. To me he was like God, and I tried so much to be like him, I just about lost track of my own self. And then like after I got my divorce, I just blew up, threw my hands up and said forget everything. I started drifting in one jail and outanother one. I lost contact with my family, my kids, and everybody. All they know is like they would see me every year or every other year. I pop in and I pop out. Next thing they know I'm locked up again.</P>
<P>Therapist 60: How did a man as sensitive as you get into so many legal problems?</P>
<P>Client 60: I don't know. It just seemed like I just stopped caring. In a way it seemed like I might have had a death wish and didn't know it. I was scared to do it myself. Because it just seemed like nothing mattered. But now I look at things a lot different because of during my sister's funeral me and my oldest son got together and we talked, and he said things to me that I never knew. Like I said when he was young me and his mother got divorced, and he was constantly telling me about how his cousins and everybody would talk about me, and he felt like he got cheated because I shared their childhood, and I wasn't there to share his. And now he feels like me and him should get together more often and do things together and get to know each other all over again.</P>
<P>Therapist 61: What do you think of that?</P>
<P>Client 61: To me it sounded great. That was what I really wanted.</P>
<P>Therapist 62: You said it sounded great, and you look like you could cry.</P>
<P>Client 62: I could because like, I got four sons. And like after the divorce and I had lost contact with them for a long time, and just seemed like the whole world just caved in on me, because to me that was the only thing in life was worth living for was for my kids at the time.</P>
<P>Therapist 63: When did you get divorced?</P>
<P>Client 63: Twenty four years ago.</P>
<P>Therapist 64: So, it was after your divorce that you started to get into legal problems?</P>
<P>Client 64: Right. It seemed like I just started doing all kinds of crazy stuff, and . . .</P>
<P>Therapist 65: Again, to summarize, you seem to me to be a very sensitive deeply feeling, caring man who never go to know his own father, and who felt an enormous loss because of that.</P>
<P>Client 65: I did.</P>
<P>Therapist 66: But in some ways, you turned out, and you wanted to be like him, and in some ways you have turned out like him. He disappeared from your life . . .</P>
<P>Client 66: I know, and I disappeared from my kids' life.</P>
<P>Therapist 67: And what you have been doing for much of your life is running from that and getting into trouble with alcohol and having bad legal problems, getting into trouble with cocaine, so . . .</P>
<P>Client 67: I'm in the legal system still. I just left court this afternoon.</P>
<P>Therapist 68: I'm curious what you think of our discussion so far.</P>
<P>Client 68: I enjoyed it because like sometimes you know I, this is something I used to do like at times I would feel down and out, and I would get early in the morning and I would go way across town somewhere and go to a bar or go sit out in the park and see a stranger and just sit down and talk. It feels good to let certain things out.</P>
<P>Therapist 69: Have you been able, from what you say, it sounds like you have not been able to talk about personal things because you didn't believe it was okay to do that.</P>
<P>Client 69: Well, I was able to tell because like I said my family and I, we're pretty close. You know we are close, we understand each other, and they know that I'm a drifter type person. They feel like that you know like when I'd be gone and this, that, and the other, it was hey whatever he do he gonna be alright, you know. It'sopen for me to talk to them, but I just don't.</P>
<P>Therapist 70: So, when you come up with ways of viewing yourself, the term you've used most is drifter.</P>
<P>Client 70: Well, that's because I just like to be by myself. Like times now I like in the summer or something I go right and sit on the lake and just look at the water, and it seems like it just eases my mind and like when I have a lot of things on my mind or when I feel down and out, you know, I just get away from people. Because there was one point in life I would say I didn't even trust people.</P>
<P>Therapist 71: Right. Tell me about that. That seems very, very important, the not trusting people.</P>
<P>Client 72: Well, I just felt like hey, I can do this for different people. I can do that, and I can do the other, butlike it seemed like when I want something, not want, need something, you know, there's nobody there. I'm not telling my family this, that, and the other because I really never went to my family and asked them for anything.
But when I did it was available. I wasn't denied. You know what I'm talking about as far as associates and stuff like that, you know, I thought hey. I felt like I was better off without them.</P>
<P>Therapist 73: You know, they, I don't know if they told you, if they gave you a name for the kind of psychotherapy that I do. Did they tell you the name of the kind of therapy?</P>
<P>Client 73: She said, I can't remember.</P>
<P>Therapist 74: Cognitive is the term that I use. They may have used a different one when they told you that you would be seeing me. But the word cognitive means thinking. So your thoughts, your ideas, your beliefs, that's all part of cognitive process.</P>
<P>Client 74: Cognitive.</P>
<P>Therapist 75: Yeah. You know like when they say cogitate on something? The reason why I'm telling you what kind of therapy I do is because I want to explain how I'm thinking about you, what's guiding my thinking. I'm looking for specific ways that you view yourself, specific ways that you view the world, specific ways that you view other people. I'm looking for specific ways you view alcohol, and what I'm coming up with is thatyour view of yourself, the biggest view you have of yourself is as a drifter. I am a drifter, and I think what you mean by that is that you're somebody who can't stay still. Is that right?</P>
<P>Client 75: Right. I like to go different places. I like, it just seems like I just be around one place so long it just gets bored, or like if I'm in a place and things don't be going like I want it to go, instead of me staying and trying to get it together, straighten it out, I'll leave, and I'll go somewhere else.</P>
<P>Therapist 76: And the issues that come to mind for me when I think about you is that you work hard to escape from problems and run away from problems and that you have a hard time committing to things.</P>
<P>Client 76: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 77: So commitment is a problem.</P>
<P>Client 77: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 78: And so your view of yourself, I'm writing here because I do want you to see what I'm writing, your view of yourself as a drifter gives me an idea that your strategies are to try to run and to escape. Now a lot of people who try to escape and run and have problems with commitment find that escape through alcohol and drug. Now your view of other people, your view of others, does it help when I write like this? Do you want tosee what I'm writing?</P>
<P>Client 78: That's okay.</P>
<P>Therapist 79: Okay. Your view of other people is they aren't trustworthy. In other words, when I need them they won't be there.</P>
<P>Client 79: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 80: Is that right?</P>
<P>Client 80: Right. If I don't associate with them, I won't need them.</P>
<P>Therapist 81: If I don't associate with people, if I don't associate with them, I won't need them.</P>
<P>Client 81: But there are a lot of people that I am very closely associated with. I just don't go around them too much because my lifestyle is one way and theirs is another way. They just don't coincide a lot, and for another thing about the drifter part, you know, I just feel like I was telling my sister the other day like of all the things in life, I could have been anything I wanted to be because at one point in my life I was at the head of my class in school and everything else. But like I never really gave myself a chance to fail at nothing. Like if it started going bad, I'd be gone. I'm not a failure, I'm a quitter.</P>
<P>Therapist 82: I'm a quitter. That's another view you have of yourself.</P>
<P>Client 82: Right, but like if things start going bad, I never really try to follow up on it or see it through to the end like I don't have, I usually don't never have a Plan B. If Plan A don't work, I gotta go somewhere else and think and come back again.</P>
<P>Therapist 83: So your view of the world, the way the world operates is that if things go bad, it's best to run.</P>
<P>Client 83: Well, I always put it another way. I just say leave instead of run.</P>
<P>Therapist 84: I would be happy to put it correctly.</P>
<P>Client 84: Then again I found out another thing I found about leaving or running, however you put it, one of the worst things I do, everywhere I went, I had to carry me with me. That was my biggest problem.</P>
<P>Therapist 85: Explain that. You're exactly right, and I want to hear it in your words.</P>
<P>Client 85: My words, okay. I'll leave. I'll go here, but like I would carry that same mentality with me. Wherever I go they got alcohol, they got drugs, and they got this, that, and the other thing. It seemed like a person that used drugs or drink alcohol, you could spot another one just walking down the street, and the next thing you know like I say, people, places, and things, no matter where you go, it's the same people with different faces.</P>
<P>Therapist 86: Wherever you go, there you are.</P>
<P>Client 86: Right. It's the same people, just different faces. Different names, but everything is the same. The drugs are the same, the alcohol is the same, the mentality is the same.</P>
<P>Therapist 87: You know it's very interesting because people who are quitters and drifters and people who escape and run, a lot of them can get away with it because they don't have the kind of sensitivity, gentle warmth, that you have, that makes them want to be close to people. It seems like you have two different kinds of thought processes. One is I want to be close. I want to love. I want to be loved.</P>
<P>Client 87: Now that's one thing that I want. I have said that to myself a lot like I know I'm getting up in age now, and I'm like I said I'm still playing in the criminal justice system and this, that, and the other, and I was saying the other day, before I did have to leave this world, what I would like to do is to be married and happy you know and just settle down. Go to work and come home and relax and have a meal and you know look at TV and every once in a while go out and enjoy family life. I really don't like going different place and this andthat. I am family oriented. That's what I would like to have, a family.</P>
<P>Therapist 88: And all of that, all of the things you just said were all in response to my saying that I think you want to be loved and I think you . . .</P>
<P>Client 88: I would like that. You know, it's not the family love. I want a special person in my life. That's what I would like. And like you say, I'm scared to, I haven't seen anybody that I would really be willing to be committed to right now or obligated to because at the moment, like I say, I don't even trust myself, so I wouldn't want nobody else to be looking to me as being a provider or anything else right now because I want it, but Idon't know if I could deal with it right now.</P>
<P>Therapist 89: I wrote next to how you view yourself, I don't trust myself, is what you said. I'm just curious, as I'm taking an inventory of your thoughts, I'm curious about how you have viewed alcohol and drugs when you like using, when you liked drinking. What was your view of using, and keeping in mind that you've been a guy who doesn't trust other people, who does like to escape and run, what views have you had of using that maybe .
. .</P>
<P>Client 89: Like to me, most of it is excuses anyway, but like the way, especially drugs, okay. Like as long as you are using drugs or you got drugs or you got money to buy drugs, you got people around you, everybody loving you and this, that, and the other, but as soon as the money and the drugs is gone, you look around and you are by yourself.</P>
<P>Therapist 90: That's big. So as long as you are using people will be around.</P>
<P>Client 90: Right. And I guess that's why they call it a controlled substance. Whoever got it is in control.</P>
<P>Therapist 91: Hm. Whoever has drugs is in control.</P>
<P>Client 91: That's the way it seems.</P>
<P>Therapist 92: Do you remember the name of the therapy I told you I do? A lot of people forget it, so I'll ask you a couple of times, and I will keep reminding you.</P>
<P>Client 92: I forget.</P>
<P>Therapist 93: That's alright. It's cognitive.</P>
<P>Client 93: Cognitive. I was going to say (?).</P>
<P>Therapist 94: That's alright. I knew to ask because a lot of people forget the word. Cognitive, again, focuses on your thoughts, and the thoughts you have will determine whether or not you are addicted, and this is a huge addictive kind of thought. Whoever has drugs has control. It's very common. You probably saw it in prison.</P>
<P>Client 94: No, I saw it in the streets. To me that's a fact. And that is the reason you need to get away from it,
people like that, because when you don't have it, you're nobody. You're nothing.</P>
<P>Therapist 95: So, when you don't have drugs, you're nobody.</P>
<P>Client 95: You're just a face in the crowd.</P>
<P>Therapist 96: Right. Now, can you think of any other thoughts or beliefs you've had about drugs, the effect that made you more likely to use?</P>
<P>Client 96: Made me more likely to use?</P>
<P>Therapist 97: Yeah, like one thought you had that made you likely to use, as long as you're using people will be around. Whoever had drugs has control. When you don't have drugs you are just a face in the crowd. Those are the kinds of beliefs that make a person more likely to use. Any other . . .</P>
<P>Client 97: No, not really. Because a lot of times also like I would just buy drugs and just here, here, here, here,
here. How 'bout, in a way sort of like an enabler. I would just buy them and give them to people just to see how they would react. A lot of time you would be giving people stuff, and they think you're not looking and they're stealing. I'm going to give it to you anyway. What are you stealing it for?</P>
<P>Therapist 98: So, what was the belief you had in giving people drugs? What did you . . .</P>
<P>Client 98: A lot of people, everybody reacts different. That way I could look and see if I wanted to associate with them anymore or not. If I'm going to give you something and you are going to steal from me, I don't needto be around you no way.</P>
<P>Therapist 99: So, if I give drugs or if I give anything to people, I give drugs to people and watch them, I will really get to know them.</P>
<P>Client 99: Yeah, I'll get to know more about them, but why steal, why steal when it is there for free?</P>
<P>Therapist 100: Okay. You're not only a sensitive guy. You're also a natural psychologist.</P>
<P>Client 100: I am?</P>
<P>Therapist 101: Well, you seem to have a good sense of people. A good, you seem to have an analytical mind, like you analyze things. What do you think of that?</P>
<P>Client 101: I tries to. You learn more from watching and listening than you do talking.</P>
<P>Therapist 102: Again, what I'm curious about is how a nice guy like you who is so sensitive and analytical and able to think so clearly could have gotten things so botched up.</P>
<P>Client 102: I made a lot of bad choices, a lot of bad decisions. In a way it was like as far as the criminal justice system and stuff, I guess it was a way of letting out my true feelings and instead of me just dealing with them as I should that they would come out violent or some other way.</P>
<P>Therapist 103: So your frustration, your incredible frustration. . .</P>
<P>Client 103: Like when I tried, I've been trying a long time for self control and this, that, and the other, like I'm generally an easy person to get along with, but like I have a very violent temper also. That's one thing I've been trying to work on a long time because I know I can't keep on going like this.</P>
<P>Therapist 104: You know the cognitive therapy that I do, the theory that I follow, the way that I practice this stuff I do, this psychology, the way people like me practice psychology, we believe that people have hostility or bad tempers are often trying to mask the . . .</P>
<P>Client 104: Their true feelings.</P>
<P>Therapist 105: Yeah, a lot of hurt, a lot of anxiety, a lot of pain. I can believe that about you. The question for you is, at this point, are the advantages of using drugs or alcohol to mask that pain or anger for that matter, to mask that pain, are the advantages good enough that you are going to keep using that strategy. Is alcohol, or drugs that you are not using anymore, is it worth it?</P>
<P>Client 105: No. Like I say it was more so where I guess it was an excuse. There is no excuse to do it. To me there's no excuse. It is probably something that deep down inside I would just want to do anyway, and the leastlittle thing that happened, I got a reason to react like this.</P>
<P>Therapist 106: Well, it sounds to me like you don't have good coping strategies. It's hard for you to copeeffectively.</P>
<P>Client 107: Yeah, I'll go along with that.</P>
<P>Therapist 108: And so the default methods you use, violence, drinking, alcohol, using cocaine, those default strategies, those are just getting you deeper and deeper in trouble.</P>
<P>Client 108: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 109: Now, you've told me some things about yourself. You've told me about the way you think that would lead you to use, but you've also told me some things that you think about yourself that I think could lead to a terrific recovery, and I'll tell you a few of them. One of the things you told me is that you want to be close to people. I want to be close I'm writing here. I want to settle down. You told me I am a sensitive person. You agreed with me when I said that.</P>
<P>Client 109: I agree.</P>
<P>Therapist 110: You said I am an analytic or a person who can analyze people. I wonder what would happen if you developed the belief that you have the skills to be happy without using. What would happen if you developed the belief that you have the skills to be happy without using?</P>
<P>Client 110: I would probably have a better life. I would probably have a better life. I've been thinking about going back to school. For a long time I've been thinking about going to school, and it might seem strange, but what I wanted to be was a counselor for juveniles, for youths. I was thinking about writing a book about mylife, the way I lived, and different things I did so maybe somebody might read it and see that it ain't no good because most of the people I grew up with is dead, in prison, and might, some might not be as fortunate as I am, as I have been. At least I'm still alive.</P>
<P>Therapist 111: I'm writing, I'm writing frantically these thoughts that you are telling me because these are the kinds of thoughts that lead to a clean and sober life. These are your thoughts. Let me go over them with you.
The recent ones, I hear go back to school, I could become a counselor. You said a few minutes ago I want to be close to my sons. I could write a book. I'm lucky to be alive.</P>
<P>Client 111: This is something that I am going to do. I am going to write a book. I don't know when, but they say the hardest part of anything is to start it.</P>
<P>Therapist 112: That's right.</P>
<P>Client 112: I don't know exactly when I'm going to start it, but it's like I want to get this legal matter behind me, and for some reason, something keeps telling me to go back to Kenosha, Wisconsin. That's what I've been looking for, what I've been trying to run to all my life is there. All I got to do is go back there and wait and it's going to be there.</P>
<P>Therapist 113: You know, we only have about five minutes left. I want to give you something to take with you, okay? I want to go over this with you. I'm writing down cognitive therapy so that you know the kind oftherapy you've got here with me today. Cognitive therapy equals you are what you . . .</P>
<P>Client 113: You think you are.</P>
<P>Therapist 114: You are what you think you are. That's point number one. You are who you think you are. If you think like an addict, what?</P>
<P>Client 114: You are an addict.</P>
<P>Therapist 115: You are. You'll act like one. And then another statement I want to write here is if you believe in yourself without drugs, without drugs or alcohol. . .</P>
<P>Client 115: You can be successful.</P>
<P>Therapist 116: I'll write that down.</P>
<P>Client 116: I do believe I can do anything I set my mind to doing. Only thing stopping me is me.</P>
<P>Therapist 117: Well, I'd like you to realize that the only thing that stops you is the way you think. So before we close, I want to have these two columns here, and in the left hand column I want thoughts and beliefs that lead to addiction, and on this side, thoughts and beliefs leading to freedom from addiction. Now I want you to help me again. All this is here is review from what we started. So, what were the thoughts and beliefs that leadyou to addictions?</P>
<P>Client 117: Well, my own sensitivity.</P>
<P>Therapist 118: Yeah.</P>
<P>Client 118: Okay, and another thing didn't help me was a lot of idle time.</P>
<P>Therapist 119: Okay, so those are circumstances. So I'm going to write down the circumstances because those are very important, and I'm going to put that in parentheses. The circumstances, you are a sensitive guy, and you've had idle time, but the beliefs were drugs . . .</P>
<P>Client 119: Drifting, and it's been drifting and not wanting to be around people.</P>
<P>Therapist 120: Drugs make me, there was a term you used here now. . .</P>
<P>Client 120: Where I said whoever got the drugs was in control?</P>
<P>Therapist 121: Yeah. Yeah. Drugs make me powerful, right? Control, power.</P>
<P>Client 121: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 122: Drugs make me powerful. People hang around.</P>
<P>Client 122: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 123: See that, those are the thoughts and beliefs that lead to an addiction. Let me just see what other ones you gave me. Um, when you don't have drugs, you're just a face in the crowd.</P>
<P>Client 123: No drugs no friends.</P>
<P>Therapist 124: What was that?</P>
<P>Client 124: No drugs, no associates.</P>
<P>Therapist 125: No associates. Okay, now let's counter those with thoughts and beliefs that lead to freedom from addiction. We have a whole list of them. I don't want you to read them because I want you to remember them. What did I write on that other page right here that you said? Thoughts and beliefs that lead to freedom.</P>
<P>Client 125: Going back to school, settling down. . .</P>
<P>Therapist 126: I can settle down. What else?</P>
<P>Client 126: Go to school.</P>
<P>Therapist 127: I can go to school.</P>
<P>Client 127: Writing a book.</P>
<P>Therapist 128: I can write. You know, even if you only do one of these things or two of these things, what's good here is that the theme, the theme here is I can. I can. I am capable, or I can. Now you are going to take this with you I hope. What's the theme over here? On this side? If the theme over here is I can, what's the theme over here?</P>
<P>Client 128: I do.</P>
<P>Therapist 129: Well, I'm thinking . . .</P>
<P>Client 129: What I do.</P>
<P>Therapist 130: Well, I'm thinking the theme here is I can't.</P>
<P>Client 130: Can't do that. I have to stop.</P>
<P>Therapist 131: I can do without drugs. Again, this is the column over here that leads to addiction. I can't do without drugs. This side is I can do without drugs. So,</P>
<P>Client 131: Like I say, anything that you don't have to have, you can live without it. I wasn't born with drugs.</P>
<P>Therapist 132: I'm going to put that on this side. I wasn't born with drugs, and I can live without them. Now your sister's death just three weeks ago made you feel very sad.</P>
<P>Client 132: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 133: And you said that you were binge drinking, and now you've cut back a lot.</P>
<P>Client 133: I've cut back just like when I went to see her before she passed, like during the time we was growing up, like I depended on her for a lot, and she like, in a way, she is only a year older than me, but like it seemed like she was always there and this, that, and the other, and like I always called her my rock, you know. And then she asked me, she say, she told me she say now I need a rock. She say can I lean on you. I say yeah, what do you want? She say I want you to change and get your life together.</P>
<P>Therapist 134: This was your sister who just died.</P>
<P>Client 134: That's what she told me before she passed. For her she wanted me to get my life together.</P>
<P>Therapist 135: What would you think if I put in this column thoughts and beliefs that lead to freedom from addiction? What was your sister's name?</P>
<P>Client 135: Eloddie.</P>
<P>Therapist 136: How do you spell that?</P>
<P>Client 136: Eloddie.</P>
<P>Therapist 137: ElClient 137: oddie.</P>
<P>Therapist 138: What would you think if you wanted to go for a drink and you told yourself I can do this for Eloddie? I can quit.</P>
<P>Client 138: I can quit this for her, the promise that I made her, and like at the same time I'm helping myself. More so than doing it for her, I'd be doing it for me because the less I drink, the better my life will become.</P>
<P>Therapist 139: The less I drink, the better my life will be. The less I drink, the better my life will be. These areyour thoughts. These are not my thoughts. I wasn't born with drugs. I can live without them.</P>
<P>Client 139: Those are my thoughts.</P>
<P>Therapist 140: You're not an old man. You're 53 right?</P>
<P>Client 140: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 141: How many more years do you think you have left?</P>
<P>Client 141: Well, the way I plan, I plan on living til I'm 94.</P>
<P>Therapist 142: Okay. How many years does that give you?</P>
<P>Client 142: 94? That wold give me 41 years.</P>
<P>Therapist 143: 41 years.</P>
<P>Client 143: That's a lot of time.</P>
<P>Therapist 144: How do you want to spend that time?</P>
<P>Client 144: Well, peaceful. I would like to have grandkids. I would like to get to know them, like I really don't know em, never really, I've seen them. I don't really know them, they don't really know me. I would like to become a part of their life and like I say become closer with my sons and settle down. That's what I want.</P>
<P>Therapist 145: Is that the kind of thought that leads to freedom from addictions or it leads to using.</P>
<P>Client 145: Well, as long as you're happy and you got control of your life, you don't need no drugs or alcohol.</P>
<P>Therapist 146: As long as I'm, how about if I write as long as I take charge of my life . . .</P>
<P>Client 146: That sounds ever better. I like the way you think.</P>
<P>Therapist 147: Well, a lot of these are just my words put on your thoughts. Well, since you like the way I think, can I write a few more possible thoughts on here?</P>
<P>Client 147: Help yourself.</P>
<P>Therapist 148: Okay, I'll help myself. It's going to be your page. Wow, you know, I just like all the ones you gave me.</P>
<P>Client 148: Well, another thing about this addiction thing. You know, it's bad when you get to a place where you let a mood/mind altering substance take control of your life. It can't think, it can't talk, but it just ruins your life. It takes charge of your whole life. It dictates to you what you're gonna do, and it just seems like you don't care. You lose control, all your morals and everything is gone.</P>
<P>Therapist 149: Well, before we stop, I want to give you one more page, and I'm going to write action plan at the top. If I feel like using, instead I will . . . okay. Number one, what are you going to do instead of using?</P>
<P>Client 149: Well, another thing that relaxes me, gets my mind off drugs or alcohol, is reading. I love to read.</P>
<P>Therapist 150: Okay. I will read . . . What's another thing you can do?</P>
<P>Client 150: I'll go sit down, talk with my sister.</P>
<P>Therapist 151: What's her name?</P>
<P>Client 151: Jackie.</P>
<P>Therapist 152: My sister Jackie. What's another thing you can do?</P>
<P>Client 152: Just don't use. If you don't pick it up, you can't use.</P>
<P>Therapist 153: Okay. I'll write not pick up. If I feel like using, instead I will not pick up. What's another thing you can do. I want to see more options. You said you wanted to get close to your sons, your grandkids.</P>
<P>Client 153: I can go visit my sons or grandkids or . . .</P>
<P>Therapist 154: Visit my grandkids.</P>
<P>Client 154: Right.</P>
<P>Therapist 155: What's another thing you could do?</P>
<P>Client 155: I could get off into something that would keep me more busy where I don't get bored and try to keep from having so much idle time, just . . .</P>
<P>Therapist 156: Okay. Now the fact that you are a sensitive, warm hearted, tender hearted guy, are there any other things you could do besides talk to Jackie? You ever write anything?</P>
<P>Client 156: Yeah, I write sometimes. I write a lot of letters. I said I was going to write a book. I start it and I reread it and I put it down.</P>
<P>Therapist 157: Okay. So I wrote here if I feel like using instead I'll start writing. Work on my book.</P>
<P>Client 157: That might be even better because like that way I'll be going back into the past and in a way the past is the best part of the future because without a past there is no future, and like I can look back in the past and say hey, I've been here before. It didn't work, so I'm not going there anymore.</P>
<P>Therapist 158: Smart guy. Reflect on my past and realize drinking . . .</P>
<P>Client 158: Ain't no future in it.</P>
<P>Therapist 159: Has no future. Now you haven't said anything about going to meetings of any sort. AA or . . .</P>
<P>Client 159: Well, I have been to meetings and this, that, and the other and I sometimes they are good and like to me it's mostly your mind, your thinking, and like you know I'll go to meetings and I'll be looking at people and listening to people and like a lot of it is, to me half of them don't seem like they're real. Like you go to one meeting and you hear somebody say something, and every other meeting somebody liked what they heard. They just keep repeating the same thing that somebody else had heard.</P>
<P>Therapist 160: So you haven't been stimulated by meetings?</P>
<P>Client 160: No.</P>
<P>Therapist 161: Have you ever heard of Rational Recovery or Smart Recovery?</P>
<P>Client 161: No.</P>
<P>Therapist 162: Okay, those are two kinds of meetings that are based on cognitive therapy. I'm going to write those down. Smart Recovery or Rational Recovery, and I'll ask you if you would consider at least looking them up.</P>
<P>Client 162: Yeah, I'll look them up. I have nothing to lose . . . everything to gain.</P>
<P>Therapist 163: Well, we're out of time.</P>
<P>Client 163: Okay.</P>
<P>Therapist 164: We have spent this session reviewing your background and how you got into trouble with drugs and alcohol. We've talked about your personality and the beliefs that you have about yourself and about other people and about the world and about using that lead you to become addicted. And then we started talking about the beliefs you could have that would lead to being clean and sober. I wrote two take home sheets that I would like you to have. One just focuses on the thoughts that lead to addictive behaviors and the other leads, thoughts that lead to freedom from addictions, and then an action plan.</P>
<P>Client 164: Okay.</P>
<P>Therapist 165: These are yours, and I'll ask you once more. Do you have any other final thoughts or questions that you want to say before we wrap up.</P>
<P>Client 165: Smart Recovery and Rational Recovery. Where do I go to get into something like this?</P>
<P>Therapist 166: When we're finished with this, I am going to check with the people from here who would know more about that because that's something that varies from community to community. Because I'm not fromhere I will not be able to tell you exactly, but when we're finished how bout I go out and check on that.</P>
<P>Client 166: Okay.</P>
<P>Therapist 167: That sound alright?</P>
<P>Client 167: Sounds great.</P>
<P>Therapist 168: Any other thoughts about our visit tonight?</P>
<P>Client 168: I enjoyed it. I feel, I feel a lot better than I did, you know. Like some of the things that came out,
just a lot of things that I wanted to say anyway and had been holding in. I feel a whole lot better. I feel a lot better than when I walked in.</P>
<P>Therapist 169: Well, I'm delighted to have given you that opportunity to feel better. Thank you very much.</P>
<P>Client 169: Thank you.</P>

<center><P><b>Future Directions for L.C.</b></P></center>

<P>Liese indicates that his view of L.C.'s future has to be guarded for now because he has not had the opportunity to know this client over time. He points out that L. C. has the tools he needs but that he will need to find treatment that is well matched to his own style. His success will depend on his ability to access resources, something that is always difficult for people who have been involved in the use of illegal substances.</P>

<P>If Liese continued to work with L. C., he would begin every session by asking what L. C. would like to work on and would pay attention to factors that might act as barriers to success. In the first session, the therapy focuses on identifying the client's belief systems. In future sessions, L. C. would learn how toconfront and modify some of the beliefs that interfere with his potential for long-term recovery.</P>

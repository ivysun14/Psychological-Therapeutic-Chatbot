<p>(Analyst coughs, 3-minute silence)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking about, uhm, well, just lately I've been thinking about generally how I do sometimes just put thoughts out of my mind when I don't want them.  And I seem to have done this, uhm, this week in thinking about what we'll be doing tonight at the class I take.  Because, ah, he mentioned — we made puppets last time and were supposed to do something with them then but there wasn't time.  So he said we'd do it at the first of this class.  And this is the kind of thing that I dread, I think, more than anything else.  And I, I had thought last week that it would bother me all week but I did just not think about it until this morning.  And it was just immediately this morning I knew that it would be on my mind all day today.  And, I don't know, it just made me feel sort of nervous.  But before this, since the last class I haven't really thought about it at all.  It was almost like I was putting off feeling nervous about it until today.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What is it you dread?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, having to do something in front of other people, whatever it is.  And I don't know, I've never done this so I — and I don't even know what it will be that I'll be doing.  And just being free enough to make noise, move, use your imagination and (sigh) I suppose the fear that I won't have any ideas, too, as well as not feeling comfortable, just drawing attention to myself.  And by not having any ideas, it would be, again, feeling ridiculous or stupid or foolish and certainly feeling awkward.  (Pause) And I think there's an element of I don't, again, know how he'll set it up but probably it will involve working with some other people.  And, I don't know, somehow having to make a contribution to a group project bothers me too, sort of the idea of not being able to carry my own weight.  It's the same kind of feeling I have sometimes just when we're with friends and I don't talk very much during the evening.  I feel as if I sort of didn't carry my own weight, I didn't earn to be there.  And I've felt that way about being in my family too. (Pause)</p>

<p>When I think about this reaction to working in a group, it seems strange to me in a way because it would, I would almost think that I would be more comfortable not feeling complete—, completely responsible for whatever show is put on.  But it just seems to increase the feeling of discomfort that I have about it rather than making me feel more comfortable.  (Pause) And sometimes I've, if I've gotten into a situation that I'm afraid of, as I am of this, and I find I do relax and enjoy myself, I think there's something in that that disturbs me too.  So right now I would think, well, I'm sure that I'll be very stiff and tight and restrained and all.  But if it happened that I did free myself and really just enjoy it and do whatever I felt like doing, I think that would disturb me too.  (Pause) And so it almost becomes that that's what's holding me back, rather than a fear of what other people will think.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>My thoughts jump to, uhm, well, sort of a general impression I have of a lot of people: when I was a child, teachers and now, my supervisor and then my professor and probably you, although you weren't in my thoughts right then.  But just how I often see a reaction to me.  And I was thinking mainly of my professor and my supervisor.  And I got the feeling again today with my supervisor and I often do with the professor if we're, several of us are talking to him, that both of them — well, it's the way I feel about my family too — that they accept me because they have to, because I'm part of whatever it is that they're working with or they're part of but that they don't have any real feeling for me or that it's sort of an annoyance to them if I bring myself to their attention.  It's almost as if grudgingly they'll give some of their time to me but they don't particularly want to and they don't seek me out.  And I think with both of them I can see that — first of all I'm not sure I'm seeing it correctly when I feel this way but if I am I can see where my response to them, if they did ever seek me out, might have been enough to make them not want to again.  Because if they were the first to approach me, I think I would become so alarmed by it, and might have, that I can't do anything.  I, I just withdraw again until I'm safe in numbers, until other people are approaching them and then I can kind of join them.  But then the pressure isn't on me.  And I actually think I've done it with both of them this year. (Pause)</p>

<p>And this is so true of my relationship with so many people that — counselors at camp or teachers or really for professors just, there've just been 1 or 2 that I ever got beyond that point.  And then they were always kind of a motherly or fatherly figure.  And I would always feel so, well, probably just jealous of the others around me who would be on increasingly intimate terms with them.  And it would just seem that my terms would get worse or at least, wouldn't become any more intimate. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I have a memory now of being bothered about this type of thing particularly with counselors at camp.  And it seemed more true with them than almost anybody, that they were annoyed at my presence.  Or if I tried to bring myself to their attention or ask attention from them that they really didn't want to give it.  And since I've worked with children I can see that probably I was the kind of child that did—, really just had no personality in their mind because I never showed any to them and they couldn't see it.  And so there was absolutely no reason why they would enjoy my being around.  Or if I tried to joke with them — and this is true too even through today if I ever try — when the others who are in the same position as I are becoming more intimate with whoever it is, my professor or supervisor or back with the, the counselors, when they would show the growing intimacy by joking and so forth, if I tried it it would somehow just go flat.  And I just somehow didn't have a sense of things.  This is even true when I'm with my family.  I just realized that over Thanksgiving when I was, I don't know, feeling a little bit more relaxed at dinner and I might have made some joke about something and this happened several times, people would just not get it at all.  And there would be this awkward silence.  And sometimes they wouldn't ask me about it but sometimes they might sort of say, "I don't get it."  Or something.  And it, that would bother me even more.  I'd rather they just pretended I hadn't said anything.</p>

<p>And then my reaction would be, "Well, maybe it wasn't so funny and maybe I was wrong."  Or else I couldn't figure out whether I just hadn't expressed it clearly or if my humor is different than theirs.  But I would become very unsure and it would make me keep quiet for a long time afterwards.  Or else I would do things as I did today when I was wi—, in the faculty room, where I didn't know all the facts and I made a joke which they didn't get because they knew more than I did.  But somehow today it didn't bother me when that happened.  Because when they questioned it I was able to, at least I felt comfortable going into it and I don't recall being uncomfortable as I would be at home if that had happened. (Pause)</p>

<p>And the other thing that has bothered me about my jokes is that sometimes it's, something will strike me funny and I'll say it without thinking.  And then after I've said it, I'll realize that there might have been a real bite to what I said if the person takes it wrong.  Or maybe I was thinking of it so that they wouldn't be taking it wrong to see it and that it would have been better for me not to say what I said.  So it's almost as if I were being malicious.  (Silence) And I used to think that I didn't have any sense of humor at all.  Because I can just remember long periods of time when I'd see friends, especially in high school I would see classmates laughing and joking and it just seemed I never heard anything that made me want to even smile and certainly not to laugh.  I could smile but I found laughing extremely hard.  But I don't know, lately I think I've realized that the more caught up I am inside myself or with myself, then of course, the less you can hear something that is funny.</p>

<p>ANALYST: That's the way you described your mother last week, eh.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Never laughing?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Right.  Smiling but never laughing, or rarely laughing.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, she does more now but that's because the pressure of bringing up a family is pretty much over and she's not so harassed by, probably, feeling inadequate to things that she had to do.  But I'm probably responding in exactly the same way.  (Pause) It seems funny to me too sometimes when I can see myself doing something and realize that it's just what my mother or my father would do or it must be just how they felt when they would react a certain way.  And, I don't know, I just seem to have the worst of both of them.  Because so many of the things I don't like about both of them are things that I have in myself.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And that made me think of how I used to, perhaps I still do, feel about myself in relationship to my other sisters and brother in that I seem to have all the defects that a person could have, have inherited.  Because I had the worst eyesight and I had the knock-knees and the flat feet that had to be corrected and my teeth were the worst that had to be corrected and I was the one always having accidents.  I'm sure there are more, I can't think of them.  But just, I remember when I was little I couldn't understand why it was so unfair that — because by first grade, I, I knew I had all these things and I don't re—, I think maybe FYC might have had to have something done for her knees too but I had a much more severe case.  And I think I was the only one that had to wear braces and I had to start having things done to my mouth when I was 3.  And then I had to start wearing glasses in the middle of, or the end of first grade.  And, I don't know, I was always having accidents more than anybody else.  And it, I don't know, I sort of looked upon myself as some kind of a doomed thing.  And it does just make you assume bad things and look at things in a pessimistic way.</p>

<p>And I've understood this a little more when I've talked with the boy in my class that has a lot of accidents.  And I'm not sure I ever felt quite the way he does but I think there must have been something similar.  Because he does just assume he can't do things because whenever he does do them, or so often when he's doing anything he ends up having an accident mainly because he doesn't really notice what's going on around him.  And so he gets into trouble that way.  And I don't know, that's, I'm quite sure that's probably why I got into trouble so often: I'd be just too hasty and wouldn't notice.  But then after a while you just assume that bad things are going to keep happening to you. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I've sometimes wondered if because of — well, I don't know if I had that many more than anybody else but it did seem to me at the time I had a lot and my mother always said that to her it seemed that I had a lot and that in comparison to the other members of the family I was the one always being hurt.  And now I'm just so cautious and afraid of everything.  And I wonder if that's why, in a wa—, well I was thinking too I'm becoming more and more afraid of flying and I don't think that has so much to do with it, that's something else but — (pause) the only thing I'm not afraid of and I don't — I would think that I would be afraid of driving, feeling this way but I like to drive.  And I, I imagine I like the feeling of power that it gives me.  And I also feel that if I've, if I'm driving quite a bit so that I'm in practice that I can handle a car well.  And I really enjoy that and enjoy driving fast and, I don't know, doing things that I suppose aren't completely sensible but aren't that dangerous.  And it's just, I have much more daring then than I do at any other time. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's funny too, sometimes if there's been some kind of a close call on an accident if I'm dri—, if I'm the one driving I can accept it.  If I'm a passenger and something is close then I am just terrified.  But the fact that I'm in control somehow — I think there've even been times when I almost wished it would happen that I would have an accident.  But then it seems strange that I could react so much the other way if I'm just a passenger.  Or it's the same feeling I'll get in a plane if I think something's going wrong in a plane, just being so totally out of control.  I've sometimes thought, if I learned to fly then I wouldn't mind being in a plane so much because I'd know more about it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And this is one of the things I find, I think I find so terrifying about dying, is that it's something that you can't know about and I can't seem to accept that.  And this idea of eternity, which I can't really accept or understand or come to terms with and, and then spending eternity somehow that I can't ever know about, it's very disturbing.  (Silence) And I used to be very upset also by the fact that humans exist at all because there didn't seem to be any reason for it.  And I had to have a reason.  I don't think I feel quite that way now.  (Pause) I was just thinking that if I — there is something that still is disturbing to me about it and I don't know quite what it is.  Although it must have something to do with what a human is capable of and what his mind can be.  And how could this just happen?  And I don't really know very much about evolution but I suppose if I knew more about it then perhaps I'd be more comfortable in thinking about human existence.  But at least I don't feel this compulsion to have it be some great purpose that I used to. (Pause)</p>

<p>In fact, I was just thinking, I sort of like the idea right now of civilizations or well, I guess civilizations would be the best word, of their being sort of like waves and going up and down and, and just go—, never ending, never really getting anywhere.  (Pause) And this makes me feel that I don't have to accomplish some huge thing, which I used to feel.  Again it's part of the same thing in order to hold my own, I suppose, or do my job or my part in existing.  (Pause) But this doesn't help at all with feeling some day I'll die and I'll have to leave what I do know, whatever it is.  I suppose that's also a part of what I was saying earlier today, in being afraid that I might become free and enjoy myself, for instance, at this puppet show we have to do, because then I'll leave what I do know about myself and have to face something else.  Yet even when I think this it just doesn't seem possible that I could be reacting that way.  Because it doesn't seem that it would be so hard to handle a new side.  I mean, these are all things I keep telling myself I want and it seems strange that I'd be so afraid of it.  And it's the sa—, probably the same with attracting attention to myself which I think I'm so afraid of and don't want.  I'm sure that in a way I'd love it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>In fact, I'd probably love to be the kind of person that my parents wouldn't approve of and that I thought I didn't approve of either.  (Silence) It's funny.  I've just reached the point where I don't feel I can or want to think about all this anymore.  (Pause) It's almost as if I can think all these things and it kind of exhausts me to.  But, well, then I kind of shut it all up and I'm back again dreading going to class this evening and feeling I'll just be the same and I'll kind of grit my teeth and get through it and be very relieved when the class is over, almost as if I were going to the dentist or to a doctor for an injection of some kind. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's the same attitude I have toward anything unpleasant: if you just don't fight it, it'll be over faster.  But I always experience a lot of, well, either fear or anxiety or something about it beforehand.  (Silence) I was just thinking about the puppet again and the fact that probably in the reaction I'm having is the feeling that the puppet I made won't be acceptable.  And then it made me realize that essentially I'm afraid that both the puppet and myself won't be acceptable.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

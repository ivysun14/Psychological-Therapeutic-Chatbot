<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>[00:00:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So... I'm not going to be in Monday because of the holiday. I don't know if I had</p>

<p>mentioned that this past Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we should talk about sometime next week. Do you want me to just send you a text about it so we don't have to take the time now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it'd be better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I'll do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:00:41] to 00:00:47)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I went to go see The Vow last night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The Vow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The Vow, yeah. It's like a movie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a movie.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A movie, yeah. And it's so weird, like. Clara had asked me to go to the movies before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I had said to her, you know, "I don't want to go," because I guess Mindy works their part time, and Mindy is Shauna's roommate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just didn't want to run into her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I like said like a couple times I didn't want to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it saddens me all the time. Like I see things happening, like, you know, 30 moves down the line and then I still run into them, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still, like, have the problem. It's like I know that I'm going to run into her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like go to a different movie theater. Okay, I can drive to a different movie theater; that's not a big deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But of course I just like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of those Greek stories where they're like this is your fate, and they're (ph) like I'm going to do (ph) those other things so I don't remember that fate, and then like, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Still, I end up, you know, (nonverbal sound).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she's not even working. She is seeing the movie with one of her friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like two other people (chuckling). [00:02:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And - yeah. I, uh - I don't know. It just ruined my movie experience, ruined the - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It did. And Jen definitely noticed. And I obviously - I didn't like hide it from her. I was like, "Oh, great, Mindy's over there."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she knows who Shauna is. Not like in that way, but, or at least I don't think so, although she's made some strange allusions, like she's alluded to some strange things before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm confused.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Anyways, so I didn't like hide it from her that I saw Mindy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she knows who Mindy is also. [00:03:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because Mindy works at the same store, so she knows her through that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And Shauna was not there, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So - I don't know. So basically I go and rent the movies, and I'm just like hanging out, and that completely ruined my movie experience, you know? So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I get that it did; I'm wondering how so. Like you're just - did it upset you because it reminded you of Shauna, or were you upset for Jen because - for Clara, because you were worried it was going to upset her to think about it? Like you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, first off, it upset me because it reminded me of her. [00:04:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was like the biggest one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I also thought about the fact that, you know, she's very sensitive to the subject. Because when I first met her, she didn't know that I had a girlfriend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she originally, you know, went into this thinking that I was a single guy. And then she found out through her friend who was buying an iPod from me at the store, who was wearing a Jessup sweatshirt, and I said, "Oh, my girlfriend goes to Jessup. Yeah, she's on the track team. Yeah, her name is Shauna," You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And because of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She finds out that I'm not single; that I have a girlfriend. [00:05:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that (inaudible at 00:05:05) I'm very sure (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm thinking about like how strong my feelings are from Clara, and I don't know if I'm like, you know, completely in love with her. Like I woke up on Valentine's Day and I was like, you know, this is like basically like a chore. That's how I felt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. You haven't like hardly mentioned her since you came back from the surgery.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. She didn't come to my surgery. I told her not to, but then, like, when I woke up from the surgery that night I was in the hospital, I called her, and it was like a Friday night. And she was like, "Oh, yeah, I'm going out with all my girlfriends," like we're going (inaudible at 00:05:54). I was like, "Okay. Well, do you want to come over first? You know, I'm in the hospital." She was like, you know, "No, I'm going to be with all my girlfriends." I was like, "Okay," you know, and that like ticked me off. I don't know. [00:06:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I asked her. I asked her not to go, before the surgery. She made all these plans for the weekend. But, you know, you can't call it - I don't know. For me, I am sensitive to it. I feel like the guy who says he doesn't want to be around anyone, but really does, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like "I don't want to be loved, stay away from me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But not really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then like - I'm like "Pleeease love me." (Chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckling). So I don't know. I got upset about that. I remember thinking about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like it's just it feels like a chore. And I don't want to break up with her because she wants to, like, you know, marry me. [00:07:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait. You don't want to break up with her because she wants to marry you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to break up with her because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I get that she's very serious about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's very invested into this relationship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but -</p>

<p>CLIENT: What does that have anything to do with me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know why I don't.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:07:39] to 00:07:45)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like I'm stringing her along. And I get mixed emotions though, because on the one hand, you know, I don't want to string her along because that's going to suck, but on the other hand I don't want to lose her. [00:08:09]</p>

<p>So it's like maybe I'm just happy in my comfort zone in that room in her apartment; like the fact that it's like a block from my house, from my apartment. But I don't cheat on her, which is different from, you know, Shauna and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - the other girls I've had. But I could be going back to, well, trying thing though. I'm just trying harder.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I really don't know. And I haven't, you know, sorted through these feelings in a way that will allow me to make a decision. I'm just sort of, you know... Like today I woke up with her and I barely slept. I was just like tossing and turning all night. I was just like in pain and it sucked. And I wake up and I'm like, you know, happy that she's waking up with me, and at the same time I'm sort of like thinking about all of this stuff and I'm like - I don't know. [00:09:39]</p>

<p>I guess some part of me wishes it were Shauna, and another part of me just wishes maybe I were alone. Like I feel like some - I feel like she might even be hindering me or impeding me from working on myself, because I sort of get caught up in the moment with her, like I do with all, you know, social interactions. I think we all do. Like there's time for reflection, introspective thought, and that's all well and good. And then like - you have like, you know, what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity. [00:10:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then you go back to real life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, you go back to the - you were interacting with people, you're talking to people, and you sort of like slip back into those nice, comfy grooves that you've been working on, sort of building these grooves that are, like, you know, you've just been wearing away at them, wearing away at them, wearing away at them, and then they're so comfortable that you can just slip right into them. And that's how I feel, like. I'm in my pod of, you know, wanting to be with her because it's comfortable. [00:11:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's what I know and that's what I like, enjoy, because I like that. And maybe that pod is preventing me from going into one that will allow me to advance myself or work on myself further.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there different ways that you're concerned she's getting in the way of your - like, being more how you want to be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. Dieting; I want to diet. And I have to like lose the way that I put on for the surgery. And that's just tough to do with a girlfriend, because you have to go out to dinner. And, you know, I was at the Cheesecake Factory at Valentine's Day and I was eating meatloaf, and I'm like this is delicious, you know. [00:12:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but using a fork doesn't get you a workout.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:12:16] to 00:12:24).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So but I don't know if that's the reason. Maybe I'm just trying to think about what - where all this is coming from, why I don't want to be with her right now.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:12:40] to 00:12:55)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One thing that crossed my mind about it was like - I wonder if there's a way in which you have this kind of like a bit of a stoic vision right now for how you want to be, you know, like a little apathetic (ph), like very clean, sort of sober, on the right track, very disappointed about it, focused.</p>

<p>And having a girlfriend, period, and having her as your girlfriend in particular, just don't fit too well with that. I mean like "Let's go out, you know, or like bring (ph) together new friends" or whatever, which are things you also like to do, in a way. But are - and are very comfortable inside but conflict with this other thing. [00:13:50].</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have an unrealistic idea in my head of what it would mean to be making progress.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. Then like I'll read, and I'll read furiously. Like I'll - you know, I won't watch TV, I won't eat anything. And then I'll eat, you know, and watch TV with my girlfriend. [00:14:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Or I'll try to remain focused and, you know, that, like, perspective of, like, okay, I'm just slipping into different pods and like what the fuck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then like two minutes later, like, you know, I'll interact with, like, my dad or my girlfriend or someone that - and that makes me go in there. They're like triggers for it. And I don't know if - I think it's a good thing that I have different pods in some ways, because they distract you from those, like, you know, inconvenient facts about life that can like really suck; namely, that like - like the question one gift (ph) of knowing that you're going to die so that - stuff like that. [00:15:18]</p>

<p>So it's fun; it's all well and good. Like, you know, go to a sports bar and go to a sports game and like watch the sports game, and like talk about the sports. And like, ah, [inaudible] is the bad, and like, you know, that's cool. And a lot of that I think is fun, because you get to compete with your friends, like on who knows the most.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, you know, all these dynamics going around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, you know, who's number 84 in the Patriots? I don't know. Deion Branch. And oh. You know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's cool. And I think that's important, that we have things that we can, like, allow ourselves to get lost in. Allow ourselves to just get into a free thinking - you know, maybe not free thinking. Maybe it's really just you're in like a mode. Like when you're driving, you're just like spacing out. [00:16:25].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Handling driving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then you find yourself at the destination.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then you know how to go there because you've driven it before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right, but you're not really sure where you were on the way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly, exactly.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:16:38] to 00:16:43)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And reality sucks now that I'm not stoned any more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean in some ways. In some ways it's good, because I feel like I can function a little bit better and that's great, that I can use my noggin. But I think the thing that sucks about it is, number one, you know, the guilt and the pain from my past is, like, more clear and more defined. [00:17:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The colors are more vivid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah. They're not colored a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're not - yeah, exactly. And number two is what I was talking about last week. Without - you know, there's no immediate progress. There's no immediate, like, you wake up and you're hahhhhhhh (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're healing, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's no magic wand you can wave. But I'm okay with that, I'm okay with that; that there's no magic wand; that it takes effort and time; that things may never be fully okay or granted. [00:18:14].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where are they at, then, if they're - I mean if you're not hearing angels sing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty shitty if they're in a very -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What's shitty? Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just still dealing with my family dynamic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, the two against one thing going on.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:18:38] to 00:18:48).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just, you know, trying to survive in this world of, you know, needing a college degree and having basically lost my collegiate career because I withdrew from classes a day late, a day past the deadline. [00:19:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where they were going to make it W's. And instead of making them all W's, they're all F's.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:19:19] to 00:19:27)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:19:27] to 00:19:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's pretty harsh. And that fact that I'm not in class every day, learning stuff, that I have to read a book if I want to learn something instead of just have a book that I already - that I'm given to read. [00:20:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also trying to - trying to, I guess, get back to school is really tough. Again, there's no label (ph) on it, go back. Because I have those F's, my GPA is now below the minimum requirement for going into the school of education at Brandeis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's not like I could just register for class in my education school. I could register at a different college, but that would mean I would have to study something else, and I don't know if I want to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like ever since I was a kid, I would be into working with people and, like, making connections, like, you know, raking lawns, like raking weeds for my neighbors, shoveling their walkways. On my way over here, there were two gentlemen walking, and they were talking about, like, you know, and like all these different acronyms that I know, like CFO, and, you know, I miss that, I guess, in some ways. [00:21:36]</p>

<p>I feel like the door has been shut out to me, like it's been slammed in my face. And now I'm old (chuckling), which sucks, because if I go back and um - I'm going to be older than everyone, and that in itself is weird, because you have to work on teams. Luckily I have a baby face, so I can come back if I shave. [00:22:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's, again, not going to cut it, you know. And people like to communicate in teams. They like to use Facebook. They don't like to have to text or e-mail you because you don't have a Facebook because you don't want to, you know, be searched for on Facebook. So...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:22:34] to 00:22:47)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like part of me wants to - you know, there's this sentiment of, like, I want to get myself - go back when I'm good and ready.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like when I'm not - you know, when, like, I've lost a bunch of weight and when I'm healthy and my back's fixed and I no longer can't sleep at night because, you know, I'm in pain, and when I am working out. You know, all this - all these reasons to go back. I'm like, "Oh, maybe I'll go to a different school even though I can't now," all right, because remember, I found that out, that the tuition remission doesn't transfer. [00:23:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, things like that.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:23:40] to 00:23:52)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So because I was two days late, or like a day late, I think. It was literally like a day. Might have been two days, I'm not sure. But it's wasn't, like, over a weekend or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was literally like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The deadline was Wednesday and I called Thursday, and because of that I threw away my second chance with schooling. [00:24:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was my second chance in that position.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:24:21] to 00:24:27)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And will that be the beginning of the end for me? You know, or will it be something that makes me stronger?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or [sort of makes this more an uphill] (ph) battle and that could suck more. That makes it feel more frustrating, even embarrassing, puts you in a horrible position.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:25:05] to 00:25:14)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you going to do if you want to, like, get things back on the track (inaudible at 00:25:18).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I look at my friends from high school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And how they're all, like, graduated from their colleges already and how they're all like working at six-figure jobs already, or most of them are. Like my friend, Ashby; he graduated in the spring, last spring, and has been working and he has, like, a girlfriend, too, who on like - who is working with, like, the state there or something, and he's going to marry her, like I think he actually got her pregnant. And, you know, he's setting up a life for himself</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:26:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm sort of in limbo, just trying to figure it out, like just getting -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it makes me sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm in like a lower percentile, I guess, whatever you want to call it, or I guess that I'm - that it's taking me more time to get it together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:26:39] to 00:26:56.)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But some people I think just continue to build more problems and make that mountain higher and higher every day. They never sort of stop and, you know, (pause [00:27:09] to 00:27:18) think about it, think it over. [00:27:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think at least in some ways that's done me a service that, you know, I'm waiting (ph) for the - I'm still trying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With all the bad part (ph) around me, like it's all coming down, you know. So it's like the walls are caving in, but I'm still standing here, not going anywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. You never heard that - you really don't say "So fuck it all anyway, I'm just going to do whatever I want to do" in a way that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Used to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You used to do a lot. [00:28:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup, I definitely did that. And I'm sure there are triggers out there, little catalysts, that will make it very difficult for me to not, you know, say "Fuck it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it's just trying to stay conscious of this - conscientious of this idea of, like, you know, that I can get out of this still, so the chance is still young.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there are definitely things that are never going to change and never be completely right. But I think that there are things that I can control, that I can fix at least, to make better. [00:29:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess that's where I'm at.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:29:19] to 00:29:29)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what you're going to do as far as the school stuff goes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have it planned.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. If you like register at another college and do you - get some better grades, can you then transfer back, or is that not how it works?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I basically have four semesters of tuition remission left - no, three semesters of tuition remission left, so it's going to cost me, you know, 30 grand anyways. [00:30:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you have three - oh, I see. The probably F, that actually counted as a semester and you probably don't get credit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of sucks, yeah (chuckling). That does suck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I got it in terms of the GPA and not going back to school, man, but I didn't get it in terms of not getting the credits that you'll need to graduate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So but I can figure it out. I think I have to - I think the first step, like anything else, is showing up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. I have to meet with this guy, [inaudible], and try to talk to him, just explain my situation.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:30:46] to 00:30:56)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, I mean this is just a random practical idea and, like, I'll throw it out there. I wonder if there are ways you could get those credits more cheaply. Like can you do some classes at a community college, just to get credits that you can then transfer? And if that's true, are there ways you can start doing those sooner than this summer? Do you know what I mean? My impression is that, like, if you could do something productive like that, starting the next couple of three weeks, like, do you think you're pretty psyched to do that? [00:31:36].</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would definitely be psyched to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I was just wondering if there's like a kind of less traditional environment like that, like a community college or something, where, you know, maybe they have like some half semester courses that you can transfer credits from and that are going to be a lot cheaper than getting the extra credits you need at a place like Brandeis?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's an idea.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:32:00] to 00:32:08)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, some of the things are (ph). I mean I don't think I'd be able to do it in the next three weeks, but that might be a way for me to, like, finish my degree. Because the thing is I can use the tuition remission for any semester. So I can go back and use that tuition remission; it's just going to be at the end of my career, the end of my degree. [00:32:37].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I'll be like, you know, four or five courses that I'll have to pay for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe I could do one of those or use -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I'd just imagine a cheaper place to do them if you could transfer the - transfer the credits or something, that's all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Be used like a six grand class, certainly because it's a five grand class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, if you think about it, if you miss one class, is like a $500 loss.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling), right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would think about that. I've got to get up because I've got to copy 500 bucks (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling). I've got to wake up, right. [00:33:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's the motivation to go to class, not to mention the opportunity costs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:33:20] to 00:33:27)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't have a plan.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm in limbo. But I think that I'll find - I'm going to come up with one. I don't want to study something else I don't like. I know I've said before that, like, maybe I don't want to do finance, but I think it would be really cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To be like (short pause) - I don't know. To do something like that, where, you know, you can - it's something that has job security. [00:34:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The question is how do I go back?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. We can stop for now, but I'll text you by next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would work. All right. So when we next going to meet? Friday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. Yeah, I'm going to see if I can find something earlier in the week as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:34:43)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Take it easy. Sure. [00:34:48]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Ah, that's enough] (ph). Um — uh, yeah, I'm, like, in the middle of a major mess with that, which it will hopefully be resolved soon. Um, but, uh, the very short version is that they [slaps surface] I've been in practice (ph) since 2003, and they terminated without letting me know in March because, um, they said I hadn't re-credentialed, which is something you need to do every two years. The last time I did it was August 2010, and they hadn't notified me that they'd changed my re-credentialing cycle, and [slides paper on surface] it goes on from there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I — [chuckles] I'll leave it at that for now, since there are other things to talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, let's see — and they [gave her] (ph) the check. I think you used [inaudible at 00:49] [sound of something sliding on surface]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, great. Thanks. Um, and, uh — yeah, I'll sort out whatever's going on with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] [sighs] [00:01:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, welcome back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even know where to start. [Sighs] It's been, like, six weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it has been a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so it was my sister's graduation, which was a nightmare. Did we get a chance to talk about that? I can't remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't since — no, I had to cancel that one session I had in between because of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Stupidness. [Chuckles] I had — had a custom suit ordered for an event at [the West] (ph), a fancy dress party.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, you know, participants were encouraged to cross-dress, but, like, men's suits, off the rack, won't fit my body, so I had them custom-made, and the tailor was — turned out to be not reliable. She canceled two of our appointments in a row because — well, first, she forgot to order the fabric, and then it wasn't done when she said it was done. So I had to go and get it fitted [chuckles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Before I left for the graduation. [Chuckles] [00:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I — yeah, so that — that's what happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Let's see — so [pauses] yeah, there's been a — and then there's YOU (ph), which was awesome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um — I don't know — Dave and I had a couple of little spats about my family, um, [snaps] especially around buying souvenirs for my family. And his whole attitude was, "It is pearls before swine. They don't appreciate the stuff you give them, and I resent spending money and effort in looking for gifts for them, that they'll just spit on." I was, like, "But they're my family, and it will cause me more difficulty to not get them something than to just spend the money on something they'll hate."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because — and then it was just [makes blowing sound] <i>pfthhh</i> [slaps surface] — "Skip it if it —" — how we relate to my family [is ignores] (ph) me, the biggest sources of comfort to our marriage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can kind of, sort of see Dave's point, which makes it really horrible, then. [00:03:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think it is resenting the fact that he gets really defensive of his parents when I criticize them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my criticisms of his parents aren't nearly as harsh as his criticisms of my parents.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think the things that bug me about his parents are valid...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But [pauses] - I don't know - it is like he feels perfectly legit in saying, "Well, your father's an asshole." And, on one hand, well, that's true [chuckles]; on the other hand, if I said anything like that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right — double standard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...About his parents, he'd flip his shit at me, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, on the other hand, my parents are assholes, and his parents are reasonable human beings who have flaws. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they're — there's a difference there. Um, but yeah. Uh, my new job started Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, it has been going well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been [inhales] struggling with imposter syndrome [chuckles]... [00:04:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, but my boss reassures me when I'm picking stuff up quickly and then making progress, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface] ...Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad it started off well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] So, yeah. [Pauses for five seconds] So my sister has her degrees now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, four years ago, when she said she was going to start this program, Dave and I both told her getting an MBA straight out of college is a bad idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "You won't be hirable" — and my sister wouldn't hear us, um, in part because Dave and I both fall into the fallacy that a lot of people fall into, of, like, all [men trends] (ph) is useless, and all MBAs are pointless, and sweeping generalizations, which, I mean, yes, there are pointy-headed managers in our respective industries, who have no idea how to deal with engineers as employees, and that's a problem. But, um, my sister is very defensive about our critiques of the business world, so... [00:05:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So she wouldn't hear us [chuckles] out about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and now she's realizing, in fact, that she can't get a job [chuckles], um, in part because something like only 50 percent of graduates actually get a job...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...In two-thousand — the 2011 graduating class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, because schools have been, um, systemically lying [chuckles] to [attract prospects who won't be swingers] (ph) and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, I've been hearing — I've been hearing about that, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, <i>Wall Street Journal, Forbes, New York Times</i> have all been on this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my sister is finally realizing this, and she's been, like, making a lot of posts on Facebook about how people assume that, because she went to grad school, she'll be making millions of dollars, and she doesn't have a job, and people can stop making assumptions, and life is so depressing. And, also, she's having trouble — her in-laws are being monstrous to her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [sighs] - I don't know — I feel like she may have had a [chuckles] [now she has to whine] (ph). I mean, she knew these people were horrible long before they started dating, much less got married. [00:06:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's horrible, so, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He molested our youngest sister, and Sasha married him anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my God [sounds shocked].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know if you told me that or not. You may have and — I don't know how that slipped my mind, but, in any case, that's horrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah [uneasily], so — so she's got all this stuff going on, and [slaps surface] [sighs] I don't know. I feel a little bit [pauses] vindicated; I think that's the right word. I definitely feel vindicated. But, you know, I mean apart from the [brain weasels] (ph), my life is pretty awesome, all considered, um, and my sister's isn't. And she was always the good kid, the one my parents said I should be more like, especially when I was in college and my entire life was going up in flames. You know, I had just got [shifts in seat] so much shit from my parents, and it wasn't just like shit directed at me; it was comparison-based shit. [00:07:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it wasn't just — I mean, there was just, like, straight-up abusive crap. Like, they would leave messages on my cell phone, calling me a bitch and a slut, and a whore, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, wished they had aborted me. Uh, "Wish I'd never come to this Country; living in a refugee camp would be better than the shame of having a child like you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it was [becomes emotional, speaks softly] really, really terrible. Oh, but there was also...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really, really terrible. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And, at the same time, there was also, uh, "Why can't you be more like your sister? Your sister is doing so much better than you?" And it is just — my sister played my parents' game [in exasperation, inflection], and she did everything they wanted, or at least she lied to them well enough to think... [00:08:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...To make them think she was doing everything they wanted, but she wasn't really. Um, [pauses] — yeah, she was an expert at sneaking out of the house at night, going out with her friends, going [chuckles] to parties. She was a total party animal in high school, and my parents didn't know; whereas, I would just scream and yell at them, and bitch about how it wasn't fair that they wouldn't let me go out with my friends, and then sit at home and sulk, which [chuckles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but my sister played their game [speaks animatedly], and kept them happy, and now she's miserable. And I refuse to play their game, and I'm happy. And I don't know — I feel [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Vindicated?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Vindicated! Smug. I think champfroid (ph) would even be appropriate here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that makes me feel guilty because, you know, this is my sister. I shouldn't be, like, glad that her life kind of sucks. But [pauses] — but I [chuckles in exasperation] [sighs] [pauses] - yeah, so I feel guilty, and I don't like feeling guilty. And I don't like being happy at my sister's misfortune, but [sighs] [pauses]... [00:09:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>[Silence for 18 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I mean, about that or whatever else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's see — what else? [Pauses for 15 seconds] I don't know. [Pauses] My commute [emphasizes] sucks; I hate it, but I don't want to deal with the hassle of moving. [00:10:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where to? Sorry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cranston.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ooh, Cranston.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the intersection.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, just west.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [Pauses] That's a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [emphasizes] it sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You're going the wrong, at least, but it is far.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is not the distance so much as...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...The intersection with [inaudible Ave.] (ph), like the - at Parkway and the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Getting out of Cambridge, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, taking the [Ave.] to the, uh, Parkway, to the Turnpike — like, I — I sit at stoplights through, literally, ten or 12 light cycles in the morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, you know, the exit off of Route into Cambridge in the afternoon — it is... [00:11:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Backed up all the way to [chuckles in exasperation].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, it is — it is getting through it alive is a nightmare. So, like, really, the only reasonable thing to do is move further up out or somewhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But Dave and I both want to stay in — mostly in the urban neighborhood...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And it is too suburban-ish for both of us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, [pauses] yeah. [Shifts in seat] And then, of course, because I live nearer, there is still the — the way to get home is either through Hanover, which sucks, or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Around the Drive and then up through the Square, which sucks, or, you know, back through Plymouth (ph) and the Square, which also sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:11:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's — uh, [pauses for 13 seconds] so we have to tell our landlord by Monday whether we're renewing our lease for the next year or not, and — I don't know — we're both leaning towards renewing the lease just because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I still feel a little bit emotionally exhausted from spring semester and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, still the idea with moving?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't even imagine taking on another big project. And even though I had, like, three and a half weeks of vacation, I'm still just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Don't want to deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where is Dave's job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The Square.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He can walk to work. It takes him 10 minutes to walk to work. It is remarkably unfair [speaks playfully exasperated].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is so unfair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:13:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] [pauses for five seconds] But, I mean, when we got our apartment, I was telecommuting, so I had no commute, so it made sense to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Minimize his commute.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then when I started at the university, it was like a 15-minute drive, so it was whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But [sighs] — and now we've been there for four years, and we like our landlord; we like our apartment; we like our neighborhood. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There — there's a huge start-up cost to moving, enough start-up costs to [inaudible at 13:34] for — "energy barrier" is the term.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sort of a chemistry analogy] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep, activation energy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Activation energy, yes! [Chuckles] Ah, [sounds as if rubbing face] I am so brain-dead. A big part of my new job, so far, has just been learning vocabulary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh? [00:13:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I actually pulled out my, um — in Japan, there are these little cards that are marketed there, notecards that are about this big, and they're on a cubing, and they're...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Designed to write vocabulary, or they're vocabulary flashcards, basically, that you fill out yourself. And [slaps surface] that was how I learned all my conjugating (ph) when I was studying Japanese with these, um, word cards, they're called.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I've just been — every new acronym, every new tool name — I've been putting on these word cards and drilling them, because, I mean, I know if I were to do the technical part of the job but don't know the names of the tools that I need to use — because everything [slaps surface] [sighs] AMD doesn't use industry-centered figs (ph) because they have a really bad case of [not-been-to-here] (ph) syndrome. Um, so everything is built in-house, and nothing works like any of the industry standards I had learned before, because they're all proprietary to AMD so beautifully.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so, yeah, there's been a lot of learning vocabulary... [00:15:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And memorizing steps. And so — I don't know — I feel like my brain is [whispers] freaking out in my ears (ph). [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Yeah, would imagine a whole day of that can get pretty wearing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Speaks softly] Yeah. And my boss wants me to learn Bridge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The card game Bridge?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because ANB has a Bridge Club that meets at lunch. They invite a lot of players. "You should come play Bridge with us!"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I play other card games; it can't be that hard to learn, right? But Bridge also has its own vocabulary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I didn't realize when I agreed to this, or I wouldn't have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But... [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have to learn a new programming language because my boss's boss wants us all to be using the same scripting language even though, mostly, we only use programming languages for one-off things to support our other work, and [no one's used what you use] (ph), but, just in case, he wants us all to [pitch in] (ph). There's that and - [chuckles] [sighs] I'm sure it will be [speaks softly] OK. [00:16:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 16:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Silence for 15 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. There's so — so much going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] so there's — gosh — [pauses] so I'm friends with a bunch of authors — um, published authors who write books. I'm friends with a bunch of editors of magazines, science fiction...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Magazines, that sort of thing — people who I've met at [the conference] and have developed and maintained friendships with, and so I hear a lot about what goes on in the professional publishing world. [00:17:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and there's been — there's an organization called The Poets Association, which is a professional organization...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...For people who write science fiction poetry, I guess. And there's been mad journal (ph) from the Organization and just balls-out racism and just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like, it has been terrible, some of the stuff that's been — what they've published.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, after the last round of SFPA Awards, in which a group of people collaborated to, um, stuff the ballot box, basically, for a white author when it became likely that a different author would win the award that year... [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. [00:17:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]...Like, it was just — it was a bust. And so, um, a bunch of people are fed up, but they don't want to establish a competing organization because, to people who don't know what's been going on, that looks too much like, you know, "I just want to my friends to win," and, you know — which is not what is going on. So there's another organization called The Brandon Society, which exists to support writers of color in all formats. And they offer an award for novels and short stories, but, up until now, they haven't offered a poetry award since that's a very tiny field. Obviously, there weren't that many poets, and there are even fewer poets writing science fiction, and even fewer poets writing science fiction who are not white.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but it — [sighs] — I don't know — a bunch of my friends and I think that, if Brandon Society started offering a poetry award, that would at least...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:18:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Provide encouragement for writers who have been getting shit on, essentially, by SFPA. And so I've taken on the research task of collecting information over the last several years of published poetry, and getting statistics on how many are [poetry writers] of color (ph), how frequently are they published relative to their white peers, etcetera, etcetera. So that's a sort of fun project but also kind of huge and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] And so, halfway into this project, I, um, read an article that got published recently in an academic journal, about, um, [shifts in seat] what percentage of literary fiction is published by authors of color, and, apparently, the person who published that article — you know, a professor at the University — had their grad student working on collecting the information full-time for a semester and a half. [Chuckles] [I took a lot of their data] (ph), so [chuckles]... [00:19:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So [chuckles] — well, certainly, science fiction poetry is a much smaller field than literary fiction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's — I'm realizing the scope of what I've taken on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm a little daunted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand why.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, I also [could get some points] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] So there's that going on. That came out of [inaudible at 20:26]...</p>

<p>[Crosstalk]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You tend to take on sort of, uh [pauses for 6 seconds] — uh, big — sort of [pauses] very, like, kind of noble and more motivated, and kind of a — [over - invite, I guess something of] [pauses] church invitations...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In [chuckles] that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Invitations?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The wedding invitation? [00:20:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, yes, yes. [Pauses] That was a lot of fun, though, if a little bit stressful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hah...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] I'm not saying you hadn't any fun...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so yeah. I'm a [inaudible at 21:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I meant it is fun; it also just feels good to be doing something, and it feels like the right thing to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Silence for 12 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, church...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember if I told you, but my priest sent me this horribly insulting note about Mother's Day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I mentioned that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I think you did. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I wrote her a letter, saying, you know, "I know you meant well, and I appreciate that you were thinking about me, but my feelings were really hurt by the content of your note," and a couple of paragraphs explaining how I felt. [00:22:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tried very, very hard not to be judge-y about it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Or — or aggressive or angry, just saying, you know, "Let me tell you how I feel."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't heard anything back from her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it has been a month and a half.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And [pauses] her father died recently, so I haven't expected to hear anything since then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, so that was the last [that was sent] (ph) — the letter?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [slaps surface] exactly. So, [sighs exasperatedly] I actually haven't been to church in about two months because there's the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Madness around getting my thesis done and graduating, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Doing this traveling and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...There's constant [daily jetlag] (ph) [chuckles] to wake up. [Chuckles] Uh, so I don't know. Like, I'm dreading going back because I just don't want to face her. Not so much that I don't want to face her; it is not that I'm afraid, but more to [what I've been through] (ph). I won't want to see her face. [Chuckles] [00:23:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: How's that? [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's pretty clear, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just — mm — see, in theory, like, my theology says that the forwardness (ph) of the priest has nothing to do with the validity of the sacraments you receive from them. You know, they can be a horrible human being, and, you know, the Eucharist would still be consecrated; it would still matter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And receiving the Eucharist is very important to me, but I'm letting my disdain for this woman...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:24:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I think "disdain" is accurate — I'll run with that for now - is keeping me from going to church. And [pauses] — I don't know — it feels a little bit petty and childish of me to not go and participate in my spiritual community [shifts in seat] and not participate in the sacraments just because I have no respect for Julia. So [sighs] [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that sort of [prove a cut] (ph)? Or, in other words, [pauses] uh, there's more to it than just the idea that, [pauses] um, the Eucharist matters regardless of the quality of the priest?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Speaks faintly] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean? Like... [00:25:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I mean, that's what the official position of the church is, and it has always been something that, up until this point, I've always intellectually agreed with. But I've also [pauses] never been in a situation where I had this kind of personal complex — conflict with my priest. I mean, [slaps surface] a couple of years ago — actually, more than a couple of years — ten years ago now, I was in a kind of spiritually abusive church...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, where the pastor actually contacted my parents against my expressed wishes, and caused a lot of problems for me because he really wanted to provoke a violent response on the part of my parents. Um, and it was — it was really horrible, but, like, I ended up leaving that church because, in addition to him being a horrible human being, I realized that the doctrines of that church were — encouraged abusiveness on the part of the leaders hip and, also, their theology was whack, in my opinion, so... [00:26:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it wasn't a — [as for him being a] (ph) horrible human being was part of why I left...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But it wasn't the only reason. Like, there were other — there was, like, a whole truckload of other stuff going on that, um, [pauses] — well — but I've never in the situation where — [clucks] I'm in a reasonably healthy community...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Where I wholeheartedly agree the official theology or doctrine of the Church and the practice of, um, the people in my local parish - at least, they're — [chuckles] I can't say I agree with the entire [of this] (ph) culture — statewide, nationwide, but, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I came out, at least.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. [00:26:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the conflict with Julia isn't [pauses] — I don't know that — she's not abusing her authority; I just don't like or respect her, which is different. I mean, I don't think she's been abusive; I think she's just been a bad leader, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is important to me to make those distinctions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I don't [slaps surface] — I'm finding my [chuckles] intellectual theory about what to do when you have a bad priest to just not be holding up to the actual reality of the situation, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, to feeling...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is [chuckles] really just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...[Outdone by hurt] (ph) and angry for it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the same [inaudible at 27:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Slaps surface a couple of times]</p>

<p>[Silence for 35 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:28:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um - [pauses] I don't know — I guess there are — it seems one thing that you're — is sort of coming up in what we're talking about is, um, the way you're kind of, like, anger or frustration is causing things or affecting things more than you want it to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, I mean, like your sister or your — you [feeling a little bad] (ph), sort of, with Julia. Um, [pauses for five seconds] — yeah, like, um, you're [having a] (ph) problem with the way that you're feeling about her, per se, but it is sort of crowding your actions, I guess... [00:29:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...In a way that you're, like, [frustrated with that] (ph). Um, [turns pages]...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sneezes] <i>Ah-choo</i>!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bless you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, excuse me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] [shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat] [Pauses] Yeah, I guess I'd say the problem across the board is the way that it is sort of — kind of starts, like, um, anger (ph). Like, is the problem is it kind of starts to spoil something good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:30:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think that's probably something that, uh, you get scared of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...That, um — that you're sort of angry that your critical feelings toward things will cause you to lose out on — on things that matter and that are good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly] Mm. [Pauses] I'm reminded of my dad's career, such as it is, where he would quit his jobs every year or two because he had a conflict with his boss, and couldn't get past having the conflict to resolution and continued working relationship. And, [pauses] I mean, my career has been very short. I'm only 30, and I've only had three real jobs; this is my fourth... [00:31:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: .... But [pauses] I guess I left not because of conflict with my boss but because the work was boring, and I didn't want to suffer anymore, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But my job at [inaudible] — my boss was horrible, and I was just chomping at the bit to leave when my contract expired. And then Celluon was supposed to be a long-term job - it wasn't a contracted end date — but because of conflicts with my [speaks exasperatedly] bosses, and the work environment, I was just like, "OK, I'm ditching this after a year."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And [shifts in seat] — I don't know. I'm really scared that I won't be able to sustain long-term working relationships.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I, also, for a very long time, was afraid that I wouldn't be able to sustain long-term personal relationships, either, but, I mean... [00:32:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] I can actually...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You believe it] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Hard at all] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Whispers] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. I, uh — I could imagine, uh, these are a little — I mean, a little similarly with your advisor from grad school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I'm not thinking it was the same or anything about how much it was on her end...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I also think about, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But just in terms of your being worried.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, after my implosion with work in February...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And how horrible things were all [slaps surface] spring, I don't think I could have sustained working with her after that. And, you know, Dave tells me I don't need to worry about the same thing happening here because a day job is much different from a thesis, so that was... [00:33:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Horribly, horribly isolated and had no support, at tops. I was the only person in my group who did my work, and it was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Outside my boss's field, and she didn't really know what she was doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I remember that] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that's totally not the case at this place. I have an assigned mentor, whom our boss is requiring to spend at least two hours a day with me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, for my first month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, who had eight years' experience there and then was helping me get my feet under me. Um, and, here, I'm not isolated; there are other people in my group. I'm not working alone, in a corner, on something that no one understands, so — so Dave says I don't need to worry because it is a completely different situation, but [sighs exasperatedly] I am still worried.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, you know, the thing with Julia, where, you know — I mean, I guess it is not completely analogous because she's not my boss, but the power relationship is weird because she's a priest, so she has [shifts in seat] some level of authority. [00:34:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, on the other hand, for three years I was on the vestry, and the vestry has hiring and firing power...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And also does the budget, which does her salary, and so I have authority over her. And we were trying to collaborate as peers on the integrational (ph) thing, but she's white, and I'm not, and — <i>pshhhhh —</i> but it is like the power relationships were all over the place and really complicated and screwy. So that's not completely analogous to a work situation, either, but it is sort of the same in that we were trying to accomplish a project together, that required work on both our parts...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And required us to work as colleagues. Um, [pauses] and, I mean, I'm still working on that project and still communicating with other people on that project, and we — like, before any of this, like, Mother's Day stuff happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? [00:34:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And before I went on vacation, the entire group decided to take the summer off because it was too hard to schedule anything because of vacations. So, um — and so I don't know how it is going to work out when we pick it back up in August, but, [whispers] hopefully, we can [slaps surface]. But the fact that I don't want anything to do with the church — I don't want to go; I don't want to see people; I don't want to — like, that's worrisome to me. Like, I very much care that it is a sign of some, you know, deep-seated character defect on my part, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I have this, you know, want-to-completely-disengage/have-nothing-to-do-with-you-anymore reaction in so many situations.</p>

<p>[Silence for 12 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:36:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if you have a fear that, because of the kind of bad blood, [pauses] um, that things could get really out of hand, like abusive or really more destructive. I'm not saying that 'cause I think you — I don't have that question that you constantly worry; that's the case - that and church...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But more, like, because that's how things have been at times in your past...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ....And kind of just back way the hell off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, the conscious thing that I'm worried about...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Is that I will end up like my dad — unable to stay in one place for more than a year or two...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Without, you know, nuking the bridges from orbit (ph), essentially.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh? [00:36:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And [pauses] I don't [chuckles in exasperation] want to end up like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, I mean, I do fear having a deep-seated character flaw on my father's part that — I mean, I've had three jobs, which lasted less than two years; my dad had had 20 jobs, which lasted less than two years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, at some point, I mean, you could argue that my job history so far and has just been some unlucky situations, but my dad's 70-something years old. Like, at some point, you have to say the only common factor here is you. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We could stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. I will leave work a little earlier and, hopefully, get here on time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I left at 3:45 today, and that clearly was not enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got you. But the schedule looks like it will work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. My boss said, you know, "Take off when you need to." [00:38:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Front-load your hours earlier in the week, or get here early in the morning. It doesn't matter, as long as you're here for meeting and can get your work done."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...See you tomorrow, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

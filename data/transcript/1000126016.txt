<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 10. Interview 10, 9:00 (sp?). What's happening?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I was not feeling good the other day. Well, I wasn't sick really until I went to the clinic yesterday and discovered that I'm pregnant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's quite a...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess, I've been running around just feeling mostly embarrassed about it right now and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Embarrassed about being pregnant?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and feeling very stupid. I have an [aunt that...] (ph) well, I don't know how long this is going to last, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want to say. I've never had one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just... I just feel like a stupid idiot and I feel like... and I'm very embarrassed about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean kind of a stupid idiot for getting pregnant?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I told you didn't I that Don was sterile?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he'd been to the doctors and had tests, and what he had told me was that his sperm count was like really low, and I accepted that without question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now you kind of say, "What a fool I was."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the doctor said that any test of sperm count is a highly unreliable thing, and I feel like what an ass I was not to have pursued that to discover what...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Find out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I'm embarrassed because like I feel like I'm old enough; I've been around enough and I know enough about what's going on I shouldn't be in this situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean I should have known better how to take the precautions that just would have kept me out of this situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Damn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you're kicking yourself to hell.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm angry at him because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of he didn't take all...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...he knows. Well, I assumed he knew more than I guess he did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like [soup dupe] (ph), I knew he was unreliable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if he did or not, but I just... I'm probably more angry at myself than at him and I'm also very... well, I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what... have you gotten to the stage of thinking about what you're going to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, sure, I was thinking about that last week, because one of my roommates has got an older sister who has had five kids, and so she's somewhat familiar with some of the symptoms of being pregnant. I fit some of them and I went to him yesterday and he was practically confident, even without taking the test, that I was pregnant just from the symptoms I had.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he know how many months or how old the fetus is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I had a period in March. I'm only about seven weeks pregnant. It's not very long and I am... I just feel so stupid, absolutely stupid. 0:03:30.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like it would have been so easy before to prevent it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Certainly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And just not for taking the extra...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...extra care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've never wanted to take birth control pills because I knew I'd gain weight and I hear, "Well, what a perfectly safe contraceptive. I mean, it couldn't have been anything safer."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He was sterile.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like how dumb and I... that's... I just keep feeling like I'm such an idiot. I've been just such an idiot about it. Maybe I really haven't been as idiotic as I'm feeling, and I'm embarrassed, and then I keep thinking about, well, there's a dis... you know, I'm not so sure about having an abortion. Don and I are going to get married in September, but like the whole thing of being embarrassed about telling my mother and father about it, and I know it's going to just kill them and I don't want to let that bother me because I don't necessarily think having a child and you're not married and if you're mature enough and all isn't such a bad thing. I don't feel like I want that responsi... I know I don't want that responsibility.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean having one unmarried?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, just having a kid now. I just don't... I don't think I can deal with that responsibility right now, and I know that I'd be absolutely bored to death having to sit home and take care of a kid, and I have certain feelings about spending time with a kid if you have one. And like I feel like if... I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just... yeah, I hear. It's a whole lot of things. It's like you don't want to... it's the embarrassment. Like you feel like you shouldn't be bothered that your parents will be bothered but yet you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you kind of feel embarrassed, like the people... well, some people they won't think anything of it but a whole lot will, and all that coupled in with just knocking yourself up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel like I should be... like I'm intelligent enough... I have experienced this with kids that I've worked with, and I helped a good friend of mine last year have an abortion. She was really stupid. I mean, she was probably even stupider than I was, and I remember that I... like just thinking that she was stupid, because she was messing around with a lot of different fellows and she wasn't taking anything. It was like a really dumb thing and she knew better than that. 0:06:18.1</p>

<p>I guess, I kind of feel like I've not only been stupid, but I've been sort of duped. I feel like I've been duped into... and I'm also sort of afraid is that I've grown and I've trusted. Like a lot of things I don't trust about Don and that's one thing I've trusted him with completely because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like he should know his body and what's going on with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And just getting into a sexual affair with him has been... like I've been really scared about it until...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like it hasn't been all happiness and joy for you. It's had problems in its own right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just blocks that I've had with it and I've really trusted him completely, and I don't know what that's going to do to my trust in him, and maybe it's unjustified to question that. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it's kind of like you can just see it in every area of your life, like a big cut is put there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like... like when I say a cut is put in there (inaudible at 0:07:31.9) with you last night, your relationship with Don. What's it going to do to that, with your parents, with your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also... I feel like a 13 or 14-year-old kid who is this... your not knowing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Got to feel like that's been shamed...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what you think is your naivety or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jesus. I guess right now I'm just very much overwhelmed with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Battle of the (inaudible at 0:08:02.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I... I haven't called him yet. I'll probably try and get in touch with him tonight. I guess like I've been intending like since yesterday afternoon, considering what's going on, to try and get him to come down this weekend and decide what we're going to do about it. I'm not sure what it does to me and I'm really very emotionally upset now. I don't know what it does to me. I completely... beyond today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today is kind of a... I mean, you kind of feel just how overwhelmed you feel today, but how much is that kind of upset emotional overwhelming going to carry into just the rest of your life? And what does it mean, like you have one life to live. What does it mean in terms of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jesus, I feel really embarrassed just sitting here and telling you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I just feel so embarrassed about it, like damn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like you feel like such a god damn fool that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it all happened anyway to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, and like... like I, you know, "That's never going to happen to me. I'm not going to let anything like that happen to me," and all the kind of upbringing I've had. Even though like intellectually you don't approve of that, doesn't necessarily accept the kinds of morals and stuff that I've been brought up with, I feel sorry when kids get pregnant, because it's a really burden and it's a tremendous experience and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it may not be your morality, but it's something that you have to live with in the world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it carries over whether I want it to or not, and just what my family thinks and all carries over. 0:10:09.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't want to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess in the corner of me like it's kind of an okay thing, like sometime I'd like to have a kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when do you want to have a kid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, not now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how do you feel about an abortion?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I haven't thought about it in terms of what it does to me psychologically or emotionally. I've thought about it rationally as a positive thing rather than anything else and I'm not afraid of doing that. It's a very real possibility and I don't think I'd have any trouble doing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like any kind of moral or rational ideas.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, I don't think so. I guess I have to think about what it means psychologically and I haven't done that. I haven't let myself and I sort of put a block. I just accept it, and yet having dealt with this with other people, I think it's an important thing to work through. I haven't even looked at that and I don't know. I don't know what it... and, I guess, I feel repercussions of that coming after more than we do beforehand and having an abortion. It's what it does to you later.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what you mean about really wanting to work it through before you've decided what it could do, I mean, if you do decide that's what you want to do and if you're clear on that. If you decide that's what you do want to do, if you're clear on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it carries a lot of ramifications in terms of Don and my relationship. That does, too. I'm feeling very angry at him, too. 0:12:20.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's kind of like there's anger at yourself in there, too. It's, "What a fool I was", but anger at him is just all of a sudden it's thrust on you. Here you are, "I'm pregnant", and it's a whole lot of anger, and so just admit it shouldn't have been that way would have been so easy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The other day I was thinking he's got... he comes from a really large family and he's the oldest, and he has a sister who's a year younger and a brother who's 19 or 20 and a sister who's 18, and they're all married and they all... I mean, like they all had to be married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean they had to be married because of being pregnant?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was thinking about it... what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because of being pregnant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I had been thinking we're just going to fit the pattern of his family a little. Isn't that interesting? It also makes me, I guess, ashamed or embarrassed and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of ironic that it's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, risky (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I kind of sense it's kind of like just everything kind of feels like it's closing in on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, only everything in terms of what it means to be 24 years old, an independent woman who's got very definite feelings and ideas about where I'm going and what I'm doing with my life, and not fitting into that at all is being pregnant, I'm being pregnant, and in that sense, yeah, I got... it doesn't... I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like being forced to... and having a kid just changes all of that, and it's not your decision to change that when, in fact, it could have been within your power to prevent it, and you thought it was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. It's all I can think about is just I'm very stupid. 0:14:52.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you see, you keep going through it. It's kind of like things just occurring to you. You had, "What a fool I was". And I guess that's kind of the biggest reaction right now is, "God, it would have been so easy. I'm being an ass".</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's right. That's it, and I feel like a stupid ass. I'd like... it's like I can't even think about anything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's understandable. I can see why. When something big happens, I'm going to know... I guess my thing wasn't so big comparatively, because my fire was going down (ph) and I couldn't even...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, that's pretty big, too. That has a lot of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I know the kind of thing you're dealing needs to (inaudible at 0:16:10.00. My God, if had a fire extinguisher. It was so little and I could have put it out. I mean, it's a different kind of thing but there's a similar feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think it is like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I just vowed to myself after that fire, wherever I'm going to live I'm going to use that fire extinguisher.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow, that's great that he keeps saying, "In the middle of the room".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wouldn't have [thought twice] (ph). But you know it was kind of the feeling of being fooled. I mean, it's like that's your whole life now. Like the things that you used to be able to think about are the things you don't even see. It's like they don't exist anymore. Laughter doesn't exist anymore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it does, but it's all cynical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just... I sleep with all the feelings and thoughts about what this means. What does it mean if... like why would it... and ask about what it's got to do...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, shit. I mean, so continue besides the fact that if I decide to have an abortion, it takes all that money out of my trip for the summer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you worried about going?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really... why did I think this dude (ph) was gone? Now here I want to travel all over the country by starting out in Nova Scotia. He got very nervous just actually realizing that this will be the first summer that I leave (ph) and what happens to me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You got pregnant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, although whatever the institution is, I don't know why that should keep me from going anyplace.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I'm not too much up on these things and I just don't know how much they cost in New York. Are they all pretty...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, last I checked around Christmas for a kid and it was... I could have it done in Chicago then for about $250 illegally. It'd cost upwards of $500 to go to New York and have it done and I... like I could wait until school is out, but I think that's too late. I'd have to have it done before school is out. So, the choice really is to have it here and not really to go to New York. I don't think I have any qualms about whether it's legal or illegal and in my mind it's legal. 0:18:33.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's whether it's... and I don't know if reputable is the right word but maybe you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I have a pretty reliable source that I have some faith in and then from what she says there's the clinics that they've set up are as good as can be. At least right now, that doesn't frighten me at all really. It frightens me more... like right now sort of the decision is to have an abortion. The decision not to have one is far more frightening to me because that carries... that just redirects everything that I... my whole life really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's going to change from here on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, very much so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, you're life is going to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and that's really scary, because I don't know how well I can deal with the embarrassment and having to tell my parents and the feelings of stupidity and all, and that's very frightening. The thought of having a baby and taking care of it and raising a child that's very frightening, too, particularly not really planning on it. 0:20:03.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kind of like... when you think about not having an abortion, it's like, well, from like today on or... it's all through...</p>

<p>CLIENT: From today on, it's over. Yeah, it really is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because your life has changed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's... it's not too scary to consider having an abortion and it even... even coming to terms with what that will mean for Don and I being married and not having had a child when we might have been, maybe not having one at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. You mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is a big... see, like the really big problem comes in is that I don't know where he is physically, whether he's perfectly normal and fertile now that having an abortion wouldn't make much difference.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or is this some kind of quirk?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or is it just a freak thing that I got pregnant? And that makes the decision so much harder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, because it's like if you have an abortion, you get married and you want kids and it's like of your own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I had very... I had very satisfactorily accepted that I was not having children. Adopting kids, that doesn't bother me and I'd really accepted that. Oh, once in a while, I'd thought about it'd be nice to be pregnant, to go through that whole thing as an experience and having a child of my own.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you had come to terms with like, "Okay. I could give that up and I can live without that".</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't... it's not that... it hadn't been that important a thing to me and, I guess, it really gets thrown in my face now and that's what is really hard to know what to do with. Like I can't even think about my parents and that's just... I'm just really afraid of what it would do to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, it's like the second you start to think about it, it's almost like you get so upset you can't think about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jesus, yeah. I think of how old my parents are and how much respect they have for me and what I've been doing with my life so far and having told them a week ago that Don and I have decided to get married in September. I don't think that was easy for my mother, because she's always carried some prejudice because he's an Indian, and I just can't imagine like... well, I know they aren't going to disown me or anything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean for marrying him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, for being pregnant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean for being pregnant. They wouldn't do that. 0:22:54.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like what it'll do to them inside. It's like they've been feeling good, like what you've done with your life and how you've viewed it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like sort of a rejection, perhaps, of them. I don't know, but I'm...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's kind of like they won't disown you, but like I know they'll really feel upset inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm sure they'll stick with me on it. I don't feel too bad about that. It's just that I feel like I've let them down, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel like you've let..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, they have really very.... they're very moralistic and having a baby and not being married; just having sex and not being married is a total... you just don't do that, and I suspect in the back of their minds they know that Don and I have been sleeping together because he stays in my apartment, but they don't face that. They don't have to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They probably know it, but they don't have to think about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and they don't... they've never point blankly asked me, so that they don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Usually they don't want to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's it. They never wanted to know, so they haven't pursued it, and it's like telling them, "We've been sleeping together and been immoral in your eyes".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's a sin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I know it'll be a terrible blow to my father and it'll be embarrassing. My mother, who is very conscious of what people think of her, which is... I've picked that up from her; and like she's just going to go berserk about, "Well, what are all these people going to think?", particularly if we decide not to get married until September and three months later have a baby. She'll just be mortified about the whole thing? It's sort of funny in one sense. For all her self-righteousness... 0:24:41.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like we can get a cynical laughter. Good reaction, but there's no...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I can laugh about it and really think that it's funny and it is, but then I still have to deal with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the real, and it's kind of like the seeing her mortified, I mean, there is a certain kind of amusement, but it would be... that would be interesting to see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like last... so, I told my mom and dad Sunday that we were going to get married. The night before all the roommates and I had had dinner together, and we were deciding what the reaction of my parents was going to be and we were role playing it. My mother has asthma very severely, and the first thing was walk in and hand my mother a atomizer and it was really... we were having a really good time about it. The same kind of things that like you walk in and the first thing you say is, "You're going to need this". It's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like, "You think that was something". </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my mother's response when we told her, we were sitting down to lunch and she says, "I'm glad I'm sitting down". That was the very first thing that she said about it and I knew... it wasn't totally a surprise, because we'd been going out together for four years and we were engaged last year, and so I'm sure that they realized it's, perhaps, an inevitable thing. It's just when and, I guess, it was just my mother, perhaps, was still hoping that somewhere along the line that I wouldn't marry him. 0:26:21.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like she had really come to terms with it, probably, now that it's already done. But this...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they dealt with that very well and I think they were happy, but I don't think they were really surprised, and it's like they have enough trust in me. Like one of the questions was, "Now, are you sure?", and they were sure. They just had to check and make sure about it.</p>

<p>Wow, like I just barely... but I think of my brothers, too, and being very rational human beings and them having a lot of trust in me. It's sort of... I guess I feel like they have a lot of respect what I've done in terms of education and all that kind of crap, which adds to being embarrassed.</p>

<p>Sometimes I keep thinking about it in terms of, "Well, move your frame of reference about being happy about having a baby and not the feelings of it being out of wedlock", that whole moral issue. If I can make that disappear, if I decide to have a baby, and I can decide that I'm happy about it and it's not that serious. It's not offensive. It's not so sinful to have a child. Don and I love each other and if you want to in the very basic sense of the word, we've been married for a long time, but I don't know if I can do that. Certainly, right now I can't. I guess I feel like the next week or two is probably the worst time of all. 0:28:27.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, probably, it's like the first couple of days were the worst time, and it's because the first couple of times it's all that you can think about is.. all that you can really feel is how you say that you are, instead of it being, hey, that it's not your fault, because the shock and the waves (ph) are there, and like in time you can get through that and think rationally and constructively what you do want to do about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I can't right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. It's kind of a mess. I sure understand that. In a sense when I asked you about maybe you wanted to have an abortion, I kind of felt bad as soon as I said it because, my God, you're so upset. It's like you know you can't... that stuff it'll come in time to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that I have. It's like I've really thought through many things about it. Like last week before I even made the appointment... well, I became a little bit worried when I missed my period last month, and as I started feeling sick last week and I was talking to my roommates about it and Betty... we were joking and it was a really funny joke. I started to think, "Well, what does that mean if I'm really pregnant?", and some of the thoughts... and I could deal with it quite rationally then how I would feel, or not how I would feel, but what I could do even yesterday and this morning, as I became more and more nervous before finding out what the test results were even, but there was still that ray of hope that I might not be pregnant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet before like you really knew truly, you could... you were thinking you could kind of see a way to get through it, but it's much harder to get to that when you're in it, where there isn't [room to breathe] (ph). 0:30:26.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see, one of the things I feel like is, "I'm sure I can get through this and deal with it one way or another, because I think I have enough faith in myself", the strengths I guess. It's just that all the emotional exhaustion that I'm going to have to go through between now and whenever I decide what I'm going to do, the pain and the agony almost...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like when you see what's ahead of you, it looks like a bad hard strain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, a really kind of tearing psychological or deal with your offspring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, damn. On the lighter side of it, all I can think, "What's this doing to my diet?" Daisy and I decided, well I can lose five pounds probably real easy. I can think of those things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can kind of get a laugh on the lighter side.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know whether the joking about it and all is part of all the embarrassment and I'm sure it probably is. I do that, I guess, a lot when things are really bad is I make jokes, because it makes it a little easier to handle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, like gallows humor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those things are called gallows humor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Gallows humor?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gallows humor. It's kind of like soldiers had it on the battlefield.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what it is. Like I know like for the next week I'm going to walk around the most paranoid person, like everybody is looking at me, and I'm going to be afraid to feel sick because I know I am sick, and then that bothers me, too. Damn. And it's like I'm... I'll fight that, which probably is an unhealthy thing to do. 0:32:32.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To fight feeling sick, and that's what I'm not...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, like when you're pregnant...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I'm... well, being sick, just nauseated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, the morning sickness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I don't throw up or anything. I'm just nauseated and I sleep a hell of a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But why fight it? I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't want to... I don't want to be sick.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you don't want to. Is it a game (ph)... oh, you don't want to get there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's also confirmation of the fact that I'm pregnant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, have you... do you feel like you've not accepted in your mind, "Well, I've already accepted it". You don't welcome it, but I mean you're kind of... like you do recognize you're pregnant. You see what I mean? I just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know what you mean and I don't know how fully I recognize it, because one of the thoughts that has gone through my mind is, "Well, when I asked the doctor how accurate the test was and he said that he's quite confident that's what it is because just the... " He was sure about it yesterday he said even, and he referred me over to the gynecology clinic for a thorough checkup and for a more thorough diagnosis; probably determines how far along I am. But the thought is also there, "Well, maybe...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe there's a mistake.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess, and I don't like being... whether I'm pregnant or not, I don't like being sick unless I need it as an excuse to get out of doing something, then I can be sick and use it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I guess, you see the thing is like I was just... if not accepting that you're pregnant... I mean, notifying you probably that it's wrong, kind of prolongs what you're going through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think I... I think that I accept it today, but I think it's just the being physically sick I don't... I probably don't like, and like if I had mono I'd probably fight that, too. The doctor told me to stay in bed and as we see this I felt good, it'd be damn hard for me to keep myself down. It's just the physical thing that I... 0:34:54.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like even if I decide to have the baby, I can see myself exercising myself to death. It'll be the healthiest baby you've ever seen. It'll come out doing situps or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like... it's affected everything. You can see it affecting every area ahead of you, including whether how you feel getting out of bed or not, not just in your head but in your body, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, very much. It does, and what I'll look like six months from now getting married if I decide to go ahead and have the baby. I don't know. That's even hard to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you really feel like that's something you do want to talk about with Don.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I think it's a real possibility. Like I think I'm a rational person and I don't think that I can... I don't think it's fair to decide what to do on my own anyway without talking to him. He's been part of it and I think it has to be decided that way and I don't completely eliminate the possibility of going ahead and having the baby. That's just, of course, a more frightening thing to do. 0:36:16.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something that, I guess, you really just have to kind of sit down and think about and think what you feel about it and really decide that it is your decision and his decision, too. It is something that you and he do have to...no, it's not something you decide now in a day. Well, maybe you do decide in a day, but it's not... it's not a decision like what movie you're going to do for sure or even where to live. It's a question on just a whole way of life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I... it's also important, because if the decision is to have an abortion, if it hasn't clearly been talked about and decided that that's the correct thing, then having an abortion could have a lot more psychological backups on it and doing some, "Wow. What have I done? You know, maybe I really wanted to have that baby", that kind of thing. It's not that I'd be killing something. I don't have feelings about that at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not that it's like, well, I guess, the thing if you do decide to have an abortion, it's like you really have to get yourself to say, "Look, I know I might feel different, but I know now I do", if you do decide to have an abortion, "I really feel that I don't want to have this baby", and remember that and remember it when you're 50.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's the kind of thing that I have to really be able to carry through all my life is that it was the right decision to make.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And to make it and not to dwell on it after it's done if that's what you decide to do. Do you see what I'm saying? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. I mean, that's why... 0:38:00.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you can doubt anything away. Any person... I'm not saying you can, but people can do that if you start to have some things done, you can always start to have second thoughts, a thousand thoughts that you kind of... if you decide to [certain events] (ph), or if you decide to have the baby, then decide not to have those.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't... I guess I feel confident about myself in that sense is that if I do it... when I make the decision, I think I'll feel good about it. It's taken me a long time to decide to get married and I'm very sure about it. Once in a while, but I don't think that's abnormal to think, to doubt once in a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It's just that I know that if I make the decision, I've made the decision and I'll live with it and I'll know it's the right decision. It's just to make it and be rational about it, which I think I can do. I can't do it right now, but I don't feel like I have to do it right now. Like I'm not so long pregnant that a decision has to be made today or tomorrow. Like I have a couple of weeks to mull over it and decide about it and thinking about that is really a shitty thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think about... it's like I know what I'm going through and I think about what I'm going to go through the next month or so and it's just it ain't no vacation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it really isn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just a whole lot of... well, you deal with suffering and anguish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really feel so bad right now. (pane noise drowning out voices) [I'm what a dumb ass about it.] (ph) I just can't stop thinking that I'm such a dumb ass.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, [it's kind of where you got it from. Just like pampering yourself in your surrounding, you're stepping on yourself and you don't like that.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind of think... sometimes I think that that's unrealistic to think how dumb I am, because maybe I haven't been so... like, I guess, the doctor made me feel stupid yesterday. 0:40:48.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? How did you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said... I told him how I felt and then I told him that I had missed a period. He said, "Well, do you take birth control pills?", and I said, "No", and like then I felt really stupid. "Why not?", and I explained Don's sterileness and began to feel more and more like a child.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a dupe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when he said that any... well, then he said, "Well, what did he go to the doctor for? That's really unusual thing anyway", and then I explained that to him, which was the fact that he's been screwing around for years and that when nobody got pregnant, he went to the doctor to find out why, because he comes from a very poor area and it's not uncommon that no contraception is used at all. He's gone through some very stupid times in his life where he'd do that. So he's been to the doctor and he's checked and the results. Then he says, "Well, any test of sperm count is a totally unreliable thing". He's a really good doctor and I feel very good about him, except that, I guess, he could have said anything and I'd feel stupid about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like it didn't take much and you were feeling stupid, probably, when you went to him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was very sure that I was pregnant then and that added to feeling stupid and like I don't think he had any doubts in his mind just talking to me. So, how's that for an attitude (ph).</p>

<p>It's so funny that I know I can function. I think I can function. Like I can put it out of my mind temporarily in order to function and do things that I have to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just about getting out of the day, or day by day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Every time I think about it, it's just such an overwhelming thing. It's just... it's like keeping myself from thinking of it. Like I have to do this class tonight and I'm clearly unprepared for it, because I've been pretty worried about what this is going to be, and I'm probably most worried about getting through today than any other day and, I guess, that I'm not sure how I'm going to get through this evening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:43:41.6). In a way, it's a big strain. It's like this is a big strain, but it's a strain to feel like, "I still have to live a life and do the class".</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sort of feel like I'd like today just to cry all day and let it out, a lot of it, so I won't have to be so upset with it tomorrow and the next day, at least not as much as I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I don't know if this helps, but when you're going through a hard time and you find that you can do something that's outside the hard time you're going through, it feels good to be able to do it. Do you understand what I'm talking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if it does or not. Sometimes I feel real mechanical, though, when I can accomplish things and I look at myself, "Man, I can just do anything". I can be under the worst hardships and I can do anything, and sometimes I feel like I should be totally overwhelmed and not be able to do anything, but that's really stupid, too. Well, that's really weak and self-pitying and everything else, too, but a lot of getting through stuff is really just mechanically getting through it. Like if I get through tonight, it'll be just mechanically getting through it and I don't feel too bad about that, except looking back at it and knowing it was so mechanical and not even feeling it at all and just like grinding out the brain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But sometimes it has to be done that way if that's the way it can be done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. I guess so. I mean, I wouldn't know any other way of trying to do it, but I don't know how good I feel about getting through things when I'm carrying...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you're getting kind of worried with this thing anyways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, last (dictation ends abruptly)</p>

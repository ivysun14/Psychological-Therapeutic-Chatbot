<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I'm so shy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I know.  How you been?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, basically okay, except I got two things coming on the horizon ready to attack me and I decided before they attack me I would try and attack them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right. What's your attack strategy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The first one is [NAME OTHER]'s third child, [NAME OTHER], who is in [DEIDENTIFIED] and her [AGE] daughter [NAME OTHER], decided they were going to move to Florida. So now we have everybody including the ex-wife here. Ask me how happy I am, go on ask me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So they arrived last week and during the -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh they're here?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they're here. And during the transition they're staying with us.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's that going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's all right with [NAME OTHER] 'cause [NAME OTHER]'s really wanting to, yknow, get a job and put in the stuff, but [NAME OTHER] is just bored out of her mind. So, yknow, [NAME OTHER] kind of trying to keep her happy and, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Get a job, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh, yeah, well, I wish, but anyway, so, um, normally, um, [NAME OTHER]'s ex, [NAME OTHER] would watch [NAME OTHER] except, um, [NAME OTHER] is still watching [NAME OTHER]'s daughter, [NAME OTHER]. And so sometimes when [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] get together it's not a pretty sight. So I think [NAME OTHER] would be happy with her other grandmother if she didn't have to fight [NAME OTHER] for all the attention.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old's [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER]'s [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hard on a [AGE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, very hard. Um, so it's just that that's going to be percolating for a while.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> School starting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, and that was the other thing that, um, Monday they went to try and enroll her in [DEIDENTIFIED] in the neighborhood of the grandmother 'cause that way the grandmother could take care of her in the morning and then she could pick her up at night and, yknow, child care would be taken care of for [NAME OTHER]. And the only school they had available was over in [DEIDENTIFIED] which is not necessarily in the best neighborhood. So, um, every one, there were seventeen schools in this particular segment of [DEIDENTIFIED] and only [DEIDENTIFIED] had any openings. And both, yknow, it was an A school and everything else, but because of the mix of students, yknow, there's a percentage of them that didn't meet the criteria for reading and all that kind of business. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anyway, um, so on Tuesday morning she got a call and [NAME OTHER] is now in a closer school. So that's fine. Yknow, that one worked out all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 'Cause they just had something in the paper that it won't be 'til next year but they're gonna close like four or five schools in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but where?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And redraw the districts.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's in today's [DEIDENTIFIED] if you, it shows them and where they are and everything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. Oh, I'll have to go back and look. Um, anyway, so but this particular area, yknow, [DEIDENTIFIED] is burgeoning and, um, yknow, [DEIDENTIFIED] and all that kind of stuff, so those schools aren't gonna go away because they also have young people in them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Aren't you in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, but, um, we're right on the [DEIDENTIFIED] line. And the grandmother lives in [DEIDENTIFIED] which is probably where [NAME OTHER] going to end up getting an apartment.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And we're working on that one. We're focused. Anyway, and I think [NAME OTHER] has, um, good intentions around getting a job, but she told me the other day she said I never had to go out and put out a resume and find a job because she's basically been in food service, waitressing, and she gets her jobs because somebody opens up a restaurant and recommends, yknow, if she's looking for a second job or something, yknow, the owners will kind of like transfer her among themselves. So, um, anyway, she wants to try something else. But she told me, she said, I'm not opposed to going and waiting tables again if that's what I have to do to start bringing in money. So do you know anything at all about unemployment compensation when you've been in one state and you move to another?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I remember I had a guy one time here, he was getting it from [DEIDENTIFIED], so maybe that's how it goes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It was paid in there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. So, um, I guess I'll have her call [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's kind of weird. She might be able to get something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I think she can probably get a, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know how you would look but back on the other side, [DEIDENTIFIED], a little further down on the other side of this giant park of businesses. I don't know how you would go in there and look and see if there's one that help wanted.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Well, I had a friend of mine went back there and, um, just took down, I think she may have walked around door to door and handed her resume out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, but we have to work on a resume first which is, yknow, something she's been looking at. So I told her tomorrow or tonight I would sit down and help her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like she could try.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She must have come a long way, this girl.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, she has. Yes, she has. So, um, anyway, um so that's that one that I'm dealing with. The other one I'm dealing with is the two little old ladies down on [DEIDENTIFIED] that I've been helping. Um, they're [AGE] now and [AGE] and the [AGE] has been frail. The [AGE] has been pretty much in this, two women they've shared accommodations for forty years I guess, at least forty years. And [NAME OTHER] the [AGE], is kind of the alpha character of the group. And, um, [NAME OTHER] has over the years, yknow, [NAME OTHER] has allowed [NAME OTHER] to take over a lot of responsibility. So a lot of her personal responsibility. Well, in [NAME OTHER] family there's Alzheimer's and so [NAME OTHER] is convinced that [NAME OTHER] forgetting things is an indication that the Alzheimer's is kicking in. Well, now that [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> May or may not, but yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now that [NAME OTHER] is [AGE], um, she's starting to sputter. And two years ago I talked to the women about getting, well, [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] talked to [NAME OTHER] about getting somebody to come in the house and they stay with [NAME OTHER] so that [NAME OTHER] could go out and do stuff without worrying about whether or not [NAME OTHER] was okay. And [NAME OTHER] told [NAME OTHER] she didn't want anybody babysitting her. So basically nobody came in. This year since January [NAME OTHER] has been in the hospital three times, two with bowel obstructions and once with a broken femur. And with the bowel obstructions when she was leaving the hospital [NAME OTHER] would always say, yes, we're gonna have somebody come in and help. And then they would have nobody come in and help. So [NAME OTHER] was running around being the primary caregiver for [NAME OTHER] including, um, [NAME OTHER] has a difficult time walking. So if [NAME OTHER] ended up having diarrhea, um, [NAME OTHER] would try and get her to use Depends and [NAME OTHER] would say, no, I don't want to use those and so she'd have a mess in the bed and [NAME OTHER] would clean up the mess in the bed. And, yknow, I mean it was just a cluster. I'm watching my language. I will use other language. Anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Use the [DEIDENTIFIED] language.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, use that [DEIDENTIFIED] language. Um, anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They need a lot of help sounds like.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, and apparently their physician has talked to them about getting somebody in to help them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well he could order some stuff, but that's temporary like.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. So what transpired was the real kicker was [NAME OTHER] fell and broke her femur so she went into the hospital to have that fixed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then went to rehab.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then went to rehab. And while she was in rehab, um, basically it was just a, being in the hospital, [DEIDENTIFIED], being in the hospital without somebody coming in and, yknow, looking out for you, the care was questionable, um, being in rehab, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not a whole lot better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not a whole lot better because they were used to handling somebody who was sick. They were just looking to try to get somebody, yknow, working again. So then they moved her to a care facility called [DEIDENTIFIED] and she was in [DEIDENTIFIED] and there they kind of do both things. Yknow, they can take care of you if you're sick, and they can also, it's a skilled facility so they can take care of you if you're sick and then there's a therapist that can come in. Well, um, with, um, that was all well and good except during the second time period [NAME OTHER] started getting very vocal. I mean, she would be in the middle of the night saying hello, hello, anybody out there, hello. So they put her on, they put her on something for dementia to kind of bring that down. And then they, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's pretty far along it sounds like.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yes and no. Yes and no. Um, she's, once they got that calmed down, then [NAME OTHER] and I were talking and [NAME OTHER] said, yknow, I just, we need to bring her home because her spirit is out of whack. She said we're never going to get her body healed but we also shouldn't just her sit and fester, yknow, in the [DEIDENTIFIED]. And I said that's fine [NAME OTHER] and I did some research and they have a reverse mortgage and so I told [NAME OTHER] that she could bring [NAME OTHER] home but [NAME OTHER] had to have twenty four hour care. And it could not be provided by [NAME OTHER]. It had to be provided by somebody else. And that was going to cost thirty two hundred dollars a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A week.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A week. And, um, so we brought [NAME OTHER] home a week ago. We had caregivers.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They have that much income or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, they have it in their reverse mortgage.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. They have about sixty thousand dollars I guess in their reverse mortgage, so I'm only letting them go two months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that's going to be about thirty or forty thousand dollars that they'll pay out. Um, but anyway, so in my big picture I'm looking at letting everything go for a month and then at the end of the month sit there and start making some decisions around what should happen. So, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, do you think the younger one could, is she bad enough to be declared incompetent and need a guardian?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, quite frankly the people that are now in the house observing, the CNAs and the RNs and everybody in the house that's observing now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What they said, they're more objective.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They all think that the [AGE] needs somebody. And of course the [AGE] doesn't think she needs anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, they both need to go someplace. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, um, anyway, that's coming up. Boy, this is a cheap pen. I hope I didn't get it from this company that's doing this taping. Um, anyway, so, um, yknow, I just.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They both need to, I think you just ought to start looking around for assisted living places and say choose one 'cause you're going to one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, um, they have a thing called [DEIDENTIFIED] and I went to go to look at it. My sister went with me and my sister in law. And basically we all wanted to know how soon we could sign up, yknow. It's very, very nice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're what, about five thousand a month for a place?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They can be, yeah. Um, but [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] who are both RNs worked in, um, skilled facilities and there's no way that they're going to go to one because whenever I brought up the conversation they would say listen, we know about them. And I said, in this day and age, I'm not saying you don't know about them, but I'm just telling you in this day and age there's like three steps and you guys right now are in the.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In the luxury area.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In the, yeah, you're in the luxury area, you can take care of yourself. You can, yknow, somebody will just, there'll be oversight on you but not control of you. No, no, no, they didn't want to do it. So, um, the younger one, her family's from [DEIDENTIFIED] and, um, and they're all older, and so I called her brother and gave her brother a lowdown on what's going on now and I told him, yknow, we're planning in two months, two months, something's gotta happen. And, um, I was talking to his wife and his wife said, well, yknow, we can't take her. And I said, well, it just may be that we have to find a place for her. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, see that's what I said about the guardianship because, well, I'll give you the papers for it so you can see all the areas and it's like can they choose where to live, can they make contracts with people, it's all broken down and can they manage their own medicines and medical decisions. It's probably most of them are no. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, um, prior to, prior to this, the last episode, [NAME OTHER] was taking care of [NAME OTHER] medications but when [NAME OTHER] came home from [DEIDENTIFIED] the doctor there had added like ten more medicines or something. A couple of them were antibiotics and stuff like that. But, anyway, [NAME OTHER] saying to me this is bad medicine, this is bad medicine. I'm putting her on what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] had her on before she went to [DEIDENTIFIED]. And I said, [NAME OTHER] I got news for you, if you do that then I consider that bad medicine, yknow, and oh my god. I've gotten to the point where, yknow, she yells at me and I yell back at her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, because the other way to look at it is given how much you, uh, trust just one of them, whether to live alone or go out, figure it in terms of what age kid that is, [AGE], [AGE], yknow. And then you'll think better of what you're dealing with.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I don't think that I can turn them around and think of them as a six year old or a seven year old. Yknow, it's, um, I guess I still, yknow, I still respect them for their, um, the stuff that they helped me with when I was going through all sorts of things, and so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Just take this and read it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What would be the best way for me to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is what I had to fill out for the court when I go through this.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Okay. Um, what does marry mean?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To get married.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, should they be able to get married. Oh, and you can so no they shouldn't be able to get married.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you're the guardian you can have control over all those things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, that was another thing about [NAME OTHER]. Um, when, yknow, she started trying to discuss who could be in the home and 'cause she kept trying to weasel her way into the fact that she didn't need to have anybody there twenty four hours a day. And I told her that was full a crap and that she did. And that there was a, yknow, there was a state law around elder abuse which included neglect and for [NAME OTHER] to be in the house with [NAME OTHER] alone wasn't going to cut it because [NAME OTHER] could not provide her the care. Yknow, anyway, so [NAME OTHER] now screaming who made her a ward of the state? I want to know what I did to make [NAME OTHER] a ward of the state. And I said [NAME OTHER], you can consider yourself a ward of the state because you are an elder person.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the only way you could, and that's the only way you can force them to go live somewhere, to get legal control of that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For you or somebody. But what they do there is you'd have to call the court, the courthouse in that county and they have a mental health section and say or if your situation, how should we proceed? Because the ones I do are usually poor people, so the court appoints us. That's two psychiatrists and a layperson who turns out to be a social worker usually. But if they consider you have enough money to get it done on your own, they tell you how to do it a different way. But it still comes back to the, I guess it's the family court judge or some judge, yknow, for final say. So I don't know. You're gonna get there at some point. So take it with you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Anyway, but when I'm dealing with them and I'm talking about any words of advice when I get ready to start talking about it at the end of this month, okay, ladies, we need to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, what I had to do with my father was when he got to that point, and it sounds like where they are just about, and I set up, we were gonna go look at one of these places one Saturday morning and I went over there and he started saying I'm not going, I'm not leaving the house, it was a little different. I said look dad, I'm going to look at it, and if I like it, I'm signing you up. And so you can stay here if you want. But I didn't have this guardianship power, but I had power. Yeah. And he went, okay, I'll go. So they resist and resist and then I would say you make one attempt at calmly and very firmly say this is the way it is. Yknow, it's time to do it. Uh, and they may follow because they're dependent on you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wish I had belief that that would happen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well, and this is the only other way. And it's just, and you could be the guardian of the, if they want you to 'cause it's you or a lawyer. There are people at businesses just to do this. And most of them are good. You're in a weak position because you're not a relative.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the path. I don't see that they can stay there very long. I mean, you've gotta be pretty rich to afford twenty four hour a day people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or have a really good long term care policy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, yknow, they can, I discovered that they can go into care facility, now see we can qualify both of them for Medicaid but they would have to be in a facility to have any kind of constant care because if you're not in a facility Medicaid won't pay for the caregiver. Medicaid will pay a facility to provide the caregiving, but they won't pay for a personal caregiver.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I mean, what's the best you could get out of that, somebody who had a house and took in four or five, yknow, people like them. And actually it's a better deal when you think of all those nice places 'cause there aren't many of them that are very nice I'll tell you. I go into them too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, anyway, so that's where we are right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The trouble is with those places they have schizophrenics and all kinds of, yknow, disabled people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I need a new prescription for Ativan. That's what I need now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you're okay with the Wellbutrin and the Lexapro, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, the Lexapro I think I have one more refill on it. But I'll be back to see you before I need a prescription.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I need Ativan now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like it. How many you taking a day would you say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I still take them whenever I need them, but I looked at the supply of when I found out [NAME OTHER] was coming home and [NAME OTHER] was in the hospital and I said to my husband I don't think I have enough.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Well, actually by.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My standards I'm doing pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> October. Yeah, by end of September most of these things will be decided or on their way to being decided. Get the kid in school and the girl get a job and. And these two, something's gonna give. I don't know what.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I know the brother can't -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's real hard when you see the people a lot to be objective as to how bad they really are. And I'll say that of myself too, yknow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Well, that's why yesterday when I went over there and the caregiver and the nurse stepped in and said we have to talk to you. Is it about [NAME OTHER]? No, about [NAME OTHER]. I said oh god.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well, I mean, they know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Bye.</p>

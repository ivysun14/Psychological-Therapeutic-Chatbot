<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, go ahead, and, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, where do I start?  Remember my same problem, a couple of years ago?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just one second.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, go ahead.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Remember a couple of years ago, they were giving me a hard way of going?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They didn't really know what was the problem at first.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know what to think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm really, just, really kind of frustrated.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I just need to know if it's me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's not me.  I don't feel that intimidation of the new boss I had because they got rid of him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's, I don't know if it's the lack of trust they have in my decision making the most of, or is it other people don't see it, but they see it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't see that as my, as a problem, because they say I come [INAUDIBLE] when I already know the answer?  I do know the answer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, then it's like keeping them up to date.  I don't know. I bring my grammatical spelling to them.  I brought that to their attention.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, writing business letters.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they used that against me.  And everything, and basically what I have here is I don't trust them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I pretty much told them. I says, I don't trust either of you.  I don't know if that was the right thing to say or wrong thing to say, but it is what I felt.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, basically, I'm back to square one when I went through this happy horseshit with them two years ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, it's not on the same level as I was back then.  I don't feel that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What was the change that you have seen?  You know, you want to call it change, improvement or you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you know, it's really, it's really just being blindsided by them.  And basically, if this was gonna be the case, I mean I got my audit from October...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, it was pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I get, my personal evaluation and you know I told them I, I even told them last year I needed help with letter writing and it was yeah, we'll help you out.  And it was like being blindsided.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What really makes me mad is, is that you would think they could've told you, you know, if you didn't do this, do this, do this, this, we're gonna put you on a development plan.  But no, they didn't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They, when they just started adding, piling stuff up on me, without -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> -- trying to develop me, that's what kind of bugs me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I don't have any trust.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't know how to - I went to an AA meeting and they told me like resentment, some resentments are good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's okay to feel that way.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you know, I just don't know how to keep my mouth shut.  Well I do, I'm a lot better with my mouth.  I just, I told myself I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.  I do have, and I know it's not, like on some of my letters -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They sent back as, not being right, not being done professionally and all that stuff, what was funny about that was, is that I went to this other lady manager that I know very well.  She's in AA, too, so I knew I could trust her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And what's funny about it was, was that about three of these letters that I've sent, she wrote and they would come back three or four times needing these types of things done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm. Yeah, mm-hmm.  Can you call me back or I can call you back.  Give me a number.  Uh-huh, okay, 1-7-8-8.  I'll call you back because you have to tell me what they are and I'll go and get them, okay?  Okay.  Bye.  Okay, sorry about that.  Go ahead.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's funny is -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is that a couple times, well on two of the two letters, my supervisor sent them back three or four times and basically he was shooting down her letters.  And, I found that kind of interesting.  She said it's kind of making me mad.  I says, I should be looking at what he's doing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And this would be one step above - my supervisor, my boss and then this lady would be like above them and she said this just ain't right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now, what I don't know is what do I need to do to keep them from eating at me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But they, I don't trust them.  You know, I already told them, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I says, you're not developing me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I says and you use that leadership, I think Eisenhower said it one time, something about the leadership skills and once you lose the confidence.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You're no longer a leader.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you know, I just don't know what's the best avenue for me to do.  I mean, I'm just kind of lost for words.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My- you know what?  I was just, I think I was just more mad that I trusted them to help me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I think that they should of at least told me what they were gonna do.  And that's okay.  We can make provisions.  Don't wait for the last minute.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well, you know, sometimes, people are like that because you know, they feel that, maybe they have a hidden agenda or something like that about something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You think that's a hidden agenda?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you feel like that maybe?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you know, the members, they give you periodically, they compliment you and saying that you are doing an excellent job, and uh, -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's like, good for now, but-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I couldn't trust them down next year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Next year?  Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I couldn't really trust them with my development after next year because they set the tone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of how I feel.  And I'm not the only one that got it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you know, these are some of the things and you know, brings your own self esteem down.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, it's during that time, you know, some people start questioning their ability.  Is it me, or is it, what was your thought on that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My abilities?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I really look at it, I would say -</p>

<p>CG: Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's, some of it's just nitpicking.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Some of it is just flat out nitpicking.  You know, we make mistakes, I'm human, you know?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, what he wrote down, well yeah.  We're gonna use that for a training tool.  Yeah, but don't use it as, or against me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, blah this, blah that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I said well, you guys got an answer for everything.  I said you're just blowing more smoke.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I said you guys are just like Smokey the Bear.  They said what do you mean by that?  I said all the hot air coming out of here, just blowing the smoke, you know?  I'm a straight shooter.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the way I like to do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So when you told them, how did they react to that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They were just probably a little shocked.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, you want to know what I told them?  I said, I basically, we're going through this - I didn't really say anything. I mean I didn't [INAUDIBLE] like the last time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wasn't too - I wasn't worse- I [INAUDIBLE] cool.  I said you guys really disappointed me.  I says, I know three things.  I says, number one, I says at least I know where I stand with you guys.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I says I might not be able to change that, I says, but I can definitely change myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I says number two, I says, I trust neither you nor you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Period.  I says your development sucks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, what do you mean?  They says we're helping you out.  I says you ain't helping me out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I said well, what school did you go to?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh. And what was their reply?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, they just wasn't too happy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Since, you know-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That was last Tuesday.  And I still have to get my formalization 90 day paper.  So, here we go.  It's like, well, we'll bust you down, then all of a sudden you're doing a real good job.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then we'll bust you down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You're doing a real good job.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, you know, just, and these are the guys that took me off the same development plan last time.  Oh, yeah, you can trust us.  Not.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.  All right, since, you know, because you have been on Adderall now for how long, about?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Those other two drugs?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Gosh, about a month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and what have you seen, different?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If you ask me?  I don't notice anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I really couldn't -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.  Because it's too early to tell, and most of this medication, the, thing that I gave you last time is improving the memory skills and, the one before that that I give you was Adderall you know, for attention deficit, okay.  Which seemed to turn things around a little bit better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'll say, it's hard to say.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I really couldn't give ya -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, mm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A definitive answer to that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Better now because the last time when you came, you know, you had to [INAUDIBLE] was recognizing that sometimes, it appears to be a little memory issue here and, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think that's more attributed to attention deficit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't see myself losing my mind.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just think I concentrate on a certain thing and then sometimes its I go here, then I have to go over here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's, you know, since it has been going on for quite some time and also, you know, if there is stress at work, you'll feel little improvement, you are going to see, it's more gradual and-  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How long's it take?  I mean.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, the thing is-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, some days I forget to take it, too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And there's other days that I do take it, but I would say I take it five days out of the week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, one of the things that you may have to sort of learn to recognize is that you know, your reaction time and the reaction approach, like in the good old days, used to lash out.  You're not lashing out as much.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, so, you know, sometimes the so-called improvement and may be, can come in different, different ways and so if you're less irritable and you're not reacting in an adverse fashion.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm thinking because basically what I've been doing is, and this is good because A, I didn't just realize that this girl was [INAUDIBLE] in the program, which is great and B, we go over to a new meeting every day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's like five minutes from work.  So, maybe we'll go over there at lunch and really just clear up my mind.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And really just think about what I'm dealing with.  And I had this issue, do I trust - I said you can't keep a resentment.  But then, I've had - somebody brought up it's okay to have that particular kind of resentment because it's founded.  There's some foundation to it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My thing is I've got stay and keep my mouth shut.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, sometimes it is advisable to hold our feelings inside until the right time comes and you can have a good dialogue with you know people, both sides -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll say even if I go through their development plan and I come out smelling like a rose, you did a great job, but it'd be asinine for me to say really, I just don't believe it.  Would that be okay?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, yeah because you are accurately talking about your own inner emotions.  And those are basically formed with-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Even if they put it in writing, I'd say I really don't believe this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Experience you know, is the one that guides you, in that, and you have seen enough you know, in your own eyes to make that kind of a comment.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and so, you know - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And actually, actually, that's almost, you know, having that callous feeling, is that okay?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I look at it, you know, it helps me deal with their bullshit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, I don't trust them and I know I can keep them at that level.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That, yeah, and that's usually how people, you know, express their you know, trust and, feelings is maintaining that safe distance and only when that, you know, trust is built up a little stronger or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I'm of the mind that says I can't go back to that thought.  That'll always, you know, be there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just like they probably think that I'm gonna be like you just can't make a decision.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well, you know, you may use that kind of thing to sort of, like, when, I guess they are exhausted of all the things that sort of express or convince themselves, that you have been doing the job that you're supposed to do, and -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I did fine with what I was doin' and then all of a sudden, it's like you know nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm not the only one feelin' that.  I mean, it's like really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.  Yeah, and you know, people at, you know, at the higher or highest level many times do not want to take any responsibility and by blaming somebody lower on the totem pole.  It lets them, you know, off the hook and then, if more than half of the employees recognize that and make it a point okay and they really have some difference going through as a part of, sometimes part of the reorganization, I mean, they try to give pink slips to some and not the others.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I could say, you know what, in all honesty, I could take a pink slip better than this shit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's a big difference.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and it's, the, this is, like I said, trusting someone is not what is happening because - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but it's not good to be - it's not good to not trust anybody.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Anyone, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I just - you know, they're just, is there something I could take, is there anything else I could take to help me out?  Is there an option if I want to say I'm tired of this shit, I'm just gonna take a couple of months off like I did the last time?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what you may have to do is that way, you know giving the medication a little time to work, away from all the pressures and all that.  And, so you may need to have to do that and, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't particularly feel that now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, I don't know what type of crap they'll give me.  Aw, you're just - that's none of their business.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but if they're putting pressure on you like that, then maybe, you know, to your advantage, to think, you know, in those terms and-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You mean take some time off?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, take some time off and regroup your thoughts and see, you know what your options, what options you have, and possibly executing the options you have.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, start looking for another job.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, and that's to consider.  You had that in the past and, you know, you are, your expertise is pretty good in the area that you work in.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I'm a slacker.  It's not an easy game that I'm playing.  You know, it -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, mm-hmm.  So, let's see what we can come up with and you know, you'll keep on taking your medication.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You got any type of better medication you think I could use?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, right now, since we just started, you know, let's give the medication another month or so, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, then there is one more medication that, you know, might -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Called Provigil.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Provi - what's that do?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a medication that improves attention quite a bit.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is it like the Ritalin?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a controlled substance like Ritalin, and, but uncontrolled in the sense that you know, you can write refills on that and in some cases it seems to be a very motivating, has a very good motivating factor.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You take that with Ritalin?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, you can take that with the Ritalin.  I have people taking that.  And the only thing that you do is do not take it with other medication.  You take it by itself.  Wait for about a half an hour before you take the Ritalin, okay?  And so, we can give it a try.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You want to try that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I'll give you a packet and I'll tell you how to take it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I can take Zoloft?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I'll be on three of them?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  You are taking Zoloft, you are taking two memory pills, is that right?  And the Ritalin, okay?  And, the thing before Ritalin we tried that, but Ritalin seems to be better, is that right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've seen it do some good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and so, I'll give you some Provigil and let's see what we can do, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

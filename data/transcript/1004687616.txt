<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what did you talk about in the ten minutes I wasn't here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Mostly whatever was on my mind. </p>

<p>CLIENT: My phone is going crazy. I posted the movie, Animal House, you know where they're having the hearing and I forget the guy's name, it was cool speech. I posted the speech to Facebook, and people keep posting lines from the movie. I don't know why I posted it, but it was sort of appropriate. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's like it's our fault and it's the whole fraternity system and the whole university. Then it's the whole country. Are you condemning it, like that can . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If you're saying we broke a few rules and took a few liberties with our female party guests, we did. So Ian is in, all weekend in the Open Air Circus. Did I tell you about that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mentioned it. Yeah, there were four shows; he wants to do all of them. I don't think Jess's going to let him do tomorrow night's show. My shoes were soaked and it's somehow probably from my bike. I just got a bunch of grease on them. More stains created more stains. At least it's Friday. [00:02:24] The firm that owes me all that money keeps sending me title orders, which is good, but I want to get paid on them, you know? A couple of them have August 10th deadlines, which means they're probably closing on the 15th which, hopefully, they'll send checks out. It's just getting really hard to juggle all this stuff. Jess wants me to close down those accounts and open up new accounts. Plus I'm going to still keep getting checks made out to the firm. I can't even get these people to send it to the right address, let alone write the checks out for the other office . . . If you change the title company . . . It's just a big pain in the ass that I don't want to deal with today. I see the new psychiatrist at a quarter-to-two. I have another attorney I to do titles for and I have a couple of titles, and I should probably work on those today. I might go into the office. I was going to the office, but I'm not wanted there so I decided not to use it. That was just f**king stupid. Someplace that's air conditioned, close to home. I probably should do some laundry today. [00:04:09] The laundromat is not busy during the day—in the middle of the day. I can get out of there in like an hour. Maybe I'll do that after I go see the doctor. I don't seem to be suffering any ill effects of taking less medication and I've been taking less of the Klonopin, too, and my anxiety doesn't seem to be any higher.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not really—rather than money, there's not a whole lot to be anxious about. I just don't feel that anxious. I was talking with Barbara last night. I so wanted to ask her if she found someone yet. I'm going to try not to be a jerk. It really is that she's probably way too nice a person for me, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) What would make you say that? [00:05:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I know you might find this a little shocking, but I can be an asshole sometimes. (both chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think I see you as an asshole?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm not saying that, but I say things. I'm not saying I am an asshole, but I can be one. Sometimes I don't respect boundaries appropriately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? I've not seen that at all. I'm serious. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like with people I'll push it too far—in that sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't feel like you've done that with me. I don't know if it seems otherwise to you, but . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: To some people. They get offended. Jess often took offense to that. It's like she can say whatever she wants about me, but I say something about her and it hurts her feelings. Can't live with them, can't shoot them. I get very emotional watching the Olympics. I don't know if it's because I'm watching people who are more than half my age—you know, like in their teens and twenties and they're wildly successful; they've had something to work hard for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What have you seen that's affected you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the swimmers and the gymnasts. I want to say it's like happiness, but it's not like I'm overly happy. [00:08:04] (cell phone rings) It's probably an attorney calling me. He'll call me back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it watching them do something that they've worked so hard for and you have so much in common?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the opposite.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what you want and you don't have it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I haven't been able to succeed at anything, really. I mean I did well in law school, but that never really got me anywhere. It did get me a job as a law clerk, but I interned for a judge and once you get a recommendation of a judge it's going to get you (inaudible at 00:09:17). He was on the panel that sought [inaudible], but other than that it's really been kind of downhill. The problem is when I have made money I pissed it away. I just wish I could start making money again. The realtor at E&G is focused a lot on landlord-tenant rentals the mortgage guy kind of works a job two nights a week in a restaurant where he makes good money, so it's not like he's totally motivated to go out there. I know that he's using another attorney as well. I do know that, but I get most of his deals. I get the sense that there are a lot of people who recognize that rates are low but don't want to lock their rate and have them go lower. I'm getting a lot of that, so maybe there is a backlog of people who will ultimately walk in. I am going to renew the lease for the condo. The buyer was being kind of a dick about it. At first he said it was okay and he asked Claire to look up rents, and then he asked about month-to-month. I had already asked about month-to-month and they were worried about that, so I was just like f**k it, you know? [00:11:20] I'm just going to go ahead and renew and if he doesn't want to buy the f**king property, f**k him; then foreclose. I don't care, you know? It doesn't make a difference to me if we sell it or—it may we tax it as owned property, which means we probably can't even do the short sale. I don't know. If I have $1,500 rolling in it will be helpful with my rent and I can ultimately find some more contacts and make some more money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you said it months ago that you haven't really succeeded at anything, what do you think it's been, career-wise? What's gotten in the way? [00:12:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I was doing well. I was getting no recognition for doing well from Jess whatsoever. There was nothing. Like, "Wow, I'm proud of you," or "You're really working hard." It was all, "Are you cheating on me?" that kind of stuff. "You're never around for your family. " Even when I was successful, it sucked. I was stressed out at work and then I'm getting blamed for it all. It was really coincidence that I lost all my business at once. It was not one factor. I've tried to find other sources of business, but it's frustrating. You go and you meet people and do this dance and nothing f**king happens. Like people's bank; I'm getting nothing from that guy. I tried and referred someone over to him and he never got back to me. It's so much f**king effort and nerves and stress to deal with these people and then nothing happens. [00:14:12] I'm just not sure what to do. Maybe what I'm no longer president of E&G I'll be able to focus more. I'm going to have to because she didn't ask me to do anything . . . [00:14:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had said that you never succeeded at anything, but I think that's kind of not true. Actually you certainly were making money and staying busy for a while there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a couple of years; with nothing to show for it. When I was a kid I wanted to be a major league baseball player and that never happened. I didn't even make the high school team; or a rock and roll star—and then I wouldn't practice. I guess it's all my fault. Why are some people driven and I'm not? [00:16:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm a lazy procrastinator. I'm just not sure. I guess I worked hard in law school. I worked hard closing all those loans. When everything went away it's just . . . It's like I want a day I can just sleep late and I haven't had that in a while. I look really tired . I can't fall asleep at night. Ian is going to spend the night tonight, so he's going to wake me up in the morning, then on Sunday I can sleep late. It's not like I'm not getting eight hours of sleep. I got eight hours last night. [00:17:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have the sense that sometimes you are aware and sometimes you're not aware of how quickly you change the subject. You posed some, at least it seems to me, quite important questions about why things have been so hard for you as they have, and sometimes I think, partly subconsciously but mostly I think not, you move away from those so fast.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Let's go back. [00:18:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's really two issues. One is going back to those questions and the other is, because this is not the only time I've seen you do this, why you change the subject like that. I think it's like germane, because I think it's related to your tendency to avoid questions like that. It is related to the difficulties you've had at work and other things; motivation, I guess. [00:19:38] </p>

<p>CLIENT: So let's go back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You go ahead. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. You asked why you're not motivated in a way that a lot of other people are. You asked why you haven't succeeded at everything you've tried. What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I've always been an underachiever. I've just always been that way. I just do good enough to get by. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That feels pretty shitty, I think. I mean it can be fun in some ways, mostly I don't think it has been.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did it in high school. I knew I was going to the University of Virginia, so I did just good enough to go to the University of Virginia, which nowadays I wouldn't even get in. I was in all moderately AP classes. Definitely in college I did the bare minimum—just skidded by. Actually I didn't. There is a special masters' program that they had in the business school; and I didn't get into it because my grades weren't good enough. That's kind of why I just had to go to law school. There was a 3/2 program where you would get your masters at the same time you were getting your bachelors. I only got into a few law schools, smaller schools, a couple in Virginia and just a couple here. In law school there's no doing just enough to get by. You have to study the case and you have to study for finals. You have to know everything. So a lot of that stuff came easy to me so it wasn't like I was just putting in hours after hours studying every night; I wasn't. I kind of went through the stuff and it clicked, you know? Plus you've got nothing going on in your life so . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There aren't as many distractions as in college. [00:23:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't going out after practice, so now I kind of regret it a little bit, you know? I wasn't doing anything really extra outside of practice, but I wasn't in shape. I'm in much better shape now than I was back then. [00:23:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have the impression you really couldn't bring yourself to care if you wanted to. And I think you've always wanted to. I imagine you always wish you cared enough or were motivated enough to work harder at these things, but you could never bring yourself to. [00:24:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I'm just tired of feeling—it's not rejection; it's not like someone saying, "Oh, I'm never going to send you business," but it's quite clear that they want me to send them business first before they'll do anything with me, you know? And I just don't have the business to send people. The only person, a realtor, I really know in and around the area is Claire, so I refer all my stuff to her. And she had sent me a lot of business prior, so I assume that one day she will have business again. I don't know. That would make a huge difference if she could throw me a couple of deals every once in a while, but she doesn't have them for whatever reason. I don't know why. She went from being so busy to just not busy at all. It just happened to be at the same time that Ray retired. (long pause) [00:27:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aside from the people who used to send you business when they did, do you ever feel like you actually got much from anybody else of any sort?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean there's always random . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just talking about business deals; I mean anything emotional . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Jess would never support it for a minute if I did it. She always had a way to find some fault with what I did, even the way I'd clean the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [For other people in your life, for instance, have not enjoyed being out with people. ](inaudible at 00:28:35) It's fun to go out, fun to go to games, but it's not really the same thing as having somebody who's there for you in any number of ways—emotional, social, and financial. (pause) [00:30:06] I'm not sure how much you got into this with your parents. I mean obviously, they kept a roof over your head and [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:21) things were fine growing up, but I sort of have the impression that there were ways that your dad was kind of there for you but . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Financially.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not otherwise? [00:30:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like they didn't try, I just never reciprocated or opened up to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did they try?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. They would just call me and call me, "What's going on? What are you doing?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about as a kid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was a pain in the ass. It's not that hard to believe. I was always, not picking on, but bothering my brother. He never really wanted anything to do with me. I'd go on a tantrum to get out of my room while I was standing at the doorway. It was like, "Don't even breathe on my room."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not unusually being a pain in the ass. That's being a brother. Did your parents talk to you when you were a kid? Did they know what was going on in your life? Did you find out from them? . ? [00:32:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't find out anything . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine you were kind of depressed as a kid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't remember a lot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before what age?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Always. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Stuff comes back to me but even in college, I talk to people in college and they'd bring up stuff and I just totally was like, "What? I don't remember that." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you not remember what it was like when you were ten? Who your teacher was? What it was like in school? [00:33:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mrs. [inaudible] was the math teacher, but I don't remember any of the others. (inaudible at 00:33:16) I can't remember the people that were in my class. I went to a small elementary school, (inaudible at 00:33:28). I barely remember junior high. There's a lot I don't remember. I killed a lot of brain cells.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you think I'm repressing it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and I think you're probably living some of it out. That's often what we do when we repress things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Living it out in what way? [00:34:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With your depression; with your difficulties with motivation. A lot of it probably has roots in how you were feeling then. We need to stop for now but we'll talk more on Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nine o'clock. </p>

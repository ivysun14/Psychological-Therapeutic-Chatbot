<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) While I was coming today I was wondering if I was going to be able to change the time for tomorrow.  And then I suddenly realized that I had already planned to have a parent come in, ah, at the time I'd have to be traveling if you could take me at 2:00.  And I just had this sinking feeling for a minute as if I'd made this horrible mistake and there was just nothing I could do.  (Sniffle) And then I thought in terms of changing the appointment with the parent.  And, ah, I really feel very mixed about it because in a way I've always felt that once you've made an appointment you keep it no matter what and that you don't ask somebody else to change it.  And yet I keep saying to myself, well if it's not inconvenient to the parent then it shouldn't really make any difference if you do change it.  But for some reason I think that it would be annoying to the parent to be asked to change it.  (Sniffle)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Just as you assumed it would be annoying to ask me to change it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I did, uhm, check my schedule.  I, I wouldn't be able to uhm, make it earlier tomorrow.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And as far as I can see, I wouldn't be able to make it earlier any Friday —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Except very exceptionally, eh, for some time to come.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: There are things I, I am just not able to change right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  Is there any chance that later in the year you might be able to?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Uhm, it's possible after February.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  I'd appreciate it if, you know, when you find you can, if you could let me know.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because I do think it, uhm, would be easier for me then.  But it's just as well that you can't tomorrow (laughs) now.</p>

<p>Well, I think I felt some, some kind of a feeling of inadequacy in a way with having forgotten this particular appointment because somehow it made me feel that I hadn't been giving thought to this person as I should have if, I don't know, that I should have remembered that I had this appointment and (sniffle) and that somehow the parent would get this feeling even though she might not know what happened at all. (Pause)</p>

<p>But I've always felt this way about asking for anything, I think.  Just even if it's, uhm, at a restaurant and you need something.  I don't mind asking MSCZ to ask for it and then I don't mind MSCZ's asking for it but I don't like to.  And very often I won't even think about something that I might want because in a way I don't want to think about it because I know if I start thinking about it I'm st—, it'll be a conflict and I won't ask for it.  (Pause) And I've been that way just about assignments.  And I used to think it was, that I was brought up you should have a certain responsible attitude toward it: if you're asked to hand in a paper at a certain time there are no extenuating circumstances that make any difference.  You should have that paper ready and hand it in.  And yet I would see other people throughout high school and college asking for changes and there being no problem when they asked for changes at times or when they said at the due date for a paper that they had been unable to finish it and they'd get it in later.  And there never seemed to be any consequences to pay.  And this became very confusing to me then, that supposedly there were some of some sort, I didn't know exactly what.  But supposedly you should feel badly and that the person wouldn't accept it.  And yet I would see these people feeling no feelings that I thought they should be.  And the person involved who was expecting the paper wouldn't be angry or too demanding or anything.  And it just didn't make sense to me.</p>

<p>In fact, I think the only time I've ever asked to turn something in late was when I was at RZG and it just happened that I had an amazing amount of papers due all at one time or within a short period of time.  And I was also going through the breakup with, uhm, MSCZ's roommate that, who I'd been dating.  And (clears throat) the whole thing I was just not able to work too efficiently anyway.  And then on top of that, to have so many papers.  And finally, I did ask, I guess, to have, be allowed to turn 1 or 2 in a little later.  But I hated asking.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And in a way, too, it just struck me that it was almost as if I would use the time due as the final limit on what I could do and that I would extend forever what I thought I could do or work—, reworking the paper or doing more research or extending the topic, or something so that the job would just never end if I asked for more time.  So in a way, I held myself to the time due because then it made it the job was finished then and I could say, I could sort of take responsibility away from myself and say, "Well, there's nothing I can do.  It's due at this time."  (Sniffle, 3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about 2 other things that occurred today.  One was that in a conf—, in another conference with a mother I had noticed that her son had some trouble with, uhm, writing and remembering his name and things like that.  And I just don't feel right now that I know that much yet about how you identify different types of problems or when they are problems.  So I always feel very shaky about it anyway and perhaps try to identify things too soon or too much.  And I asked her if, if he'd ever had any trouble sort of in coordinating his hand and his eye.  And she got very upset and said, oh no, she'd been told that definitely was good that way and that, uhm, her oldest son had had trouble but that she was so relieved that he didn't.  And it just — really, I didn't know — but I felt as if, to her, I'd made a statement that he did have this and that, uhm, I should have known.  And, I don't know, again it just made me feel very inadequate, that somehow I hadn't done the ty—, kind of job I should have done (sniffle) or perhaps too, that my approach was, to the problem was wrong.  I should have approached it more from what things I had noticed he did have problem with, with and then seen what I thought might be the reason for this.  But it did upset me and it was a mother that I found fairly easy to talk with so I was surprised that I was upset as I was by this particular incident.</p>

<p>And the other thing was just back with my assistant and I haven't felt particularly, I don't know, aggressive toward her or, or whatever the feeling is that I have toward her lately, until today.  And I've been trying more to give her different responsibilities and sometimes she carries them out very well.  And, of course, sometimes she doesn't.  And I should be more understanding of this: that sometimes I do and sometimes I don't, too.  But when she doesn't it just makes me very angry, especially today when it was she just didn't really seem to care.  And she's been going out a lot lately and so she just kind of exists at school.  And I get annoyed because then I think well, I'm giving her the chance now to do more with them as she's been asking and this is all she does when she gets it.  And I also will get so I feel well, I should step in and, and show her how it should be done, which I know is not right.  And then it just makes me all sort of tense inside and kind of angry at her for a while.  And somehow I al—, I feel I have to make my point about it.  I can't just assume that she realized and that, that there's nothing more that really can be done.  I always have to kind of make her look at it again and, and it just makes everything quite awkward and uncomfortable for a while.  It's something I do with MSCZ too.  And I don't realize I've done it until afterwards and then he'll ask me to stop being a pest or something like that.  And I'll be kind of surprised and then I'll (laughs) realize that I was sort of aggressively making a point of how he had been inadequate in some way, almost as if then I'm saying that better.</p>

<p>Another thing that struck me when I was coming down today (clears throat).  Either last night or recently I had a dream about something, I can't remember what, that made me wake up feeling very uneasy or unhappy.  And I couldn't tell exactly what it was.  I knew it was something to do with something I'd been dreaming but, and then it just seemed to me that I've had a lot of dreams lately, none of which I can recall too clearly.  But they all seem to be connected with my thinking about things I have to do and dreaming that I'm not able to get them done, that something's in the way and I can't get them done.  Or else about things that I should have and I don't have or I can't seem to get.  And, uhm, it's kind of a vague feeling but I just wake up feeling a, a sort of vague tension.  And then I forget about it after a while during the day.  But it just kind of underlies the whole feeling I have for that day.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you say the second theme was ah, on, uhm something you should have and couldn't get?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Something you should —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Something I thought I should have, probably.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Oh.  Do any instances of, illustrating these come to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I can't.  No, I just — no, it seems like they're practically there but I just can't quite get what they were.  When I wake up in the morning there've been some mornings when I've woken up that I, I know right, when I've woken up I've realized that I've dreamed something that — and it's right there, I can recall what I had in my dream but then if I think about it an hour later I can't remember. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's funny, too.  Because these dreams as I can recall it, have been just close enough to a possible situation so that even when I realize that whatever the feeling is came specifically right then from a dream, it just, the feeling doesn't go away.  Or sometimes when I've had a dream and I wake up feeling quite upset and then I can think immediately, oh, well, I dreamt that, something which I think has, has really happened.  And then it's a great relief and the feeling goes away, whatever it was.  (Pause) I suppose everybody has these feelings too but I remember especially when I was a lot younger being very impressed by sometimes doing something and it was something that as far as I knew I'd never done before but it just seemed like I knew every single thing that was going to be happening while I was doing it.  So it, and it just seemed like I could put everything in my mind and recall having done it before, although I'm, I was positive I hadn't.  And that would bother me.  And then I'd start making up all sorts of situations of playing around with time and, I don't know, thinking I was really dreaming now, not awake.  I suppose this is something a lot of people do too.</p>

<p>Or else I'd start to do something and I'd just know something was going to happen that — the thing I think of in particular, although I've done it with other things, is once when I was maybe in high school I was getting a jar of vaseline from upstairs and taking it somewhere.  And I, when I was reaching for the jar of vaseline and, that, there was no problem about my being able to get hold of it, I just had this picture of a lot of vaseline lying on the floor with broken glass all through it.  And it was almost like I had to drop it because I knew I was going to.  So I did.  Only it seemed to me I couldn't avoid it when it did happen.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  Something else that I was just thinking again about the fact that you couldn't change the time and therefore what your schedule would have.  And it just made me remember that for all the times I've thought about what you do when I'm not here, I don't think I ever really thought about your having anybody else in for analysis, except at this time.  So therefore you couldn't while I was here.  And that I would be thinking who came before me at this time and who might come after me at this time but never somebody at another time.  And then one day I went out and somebody was just waiting there.  And I don't know that I'd connected that particular person with you.  But it just was the first time that the idea occurred to me that you might have somebody here at another time concurrently when I'm coming.  And then it just surprised me that that idea was coming to me for the first time.  (Pause) And I think it upset me too because I think of thoughts like that as being sort of immature type thoughts and, and again, it just makes me feel sort of stupid.  I sort of associate it with things children I'm teaching do, that, like not recognizing you when you are outside of school because they just think of you as being at school and they can't project beyond that.  And that's part of, I think, that whole feeling that I have about crying here because I — and I do feel that way sometimes at home, too, if I'm crying, that I have to get myself to stop fast because it's just a very stupid and silly thing to do and how can I at my age, be crying?  It's not going to get anything done.</p>

<p>And it's funny about my age, too because I have to keep telling myself I'm 28 years old and I even forget sometimes how old I am.  Maybe not really, but if somebody asked me I sometimes have to work it out.  I, I don't just immediately think, 28.  I don't want to think, 28.  Because I feel, despite all these things that I don't want to do because I think that they're immature, I feel very immature.  And just makes even more that I'm not what I should be if I'm 28 years old and I'm still this way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Can you be more specific about, uhm, what it was about the idea that, eh, it had surprised you to think, eh, that I would be seeing someone else concurrently, what, what about that, eh, do you regard as immature on your part or stupid or in what way or why or how, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, partly because the fact that it occurred to me then suggested to me that I would have found the idea unacceptable before then, that you were seeing anybody else, that I was being very possessive about your time, or you or your attention.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So that's what you denounce in yourself, feeling possessive.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  That and just anyway this connection I make between may—, well, I don't know, maybe I'm just using that to protect myself from thinking I was just being possessive.  But it just struck me that why wouldn't I have thought that before.  And of course you would probably be seeing other people.  And, I don't know, it just seemed wrong to me that the idea might have been hard for me to even face at one time.  Because it isn't that the idea didn't, didn't come to me at other times but it didn't, I don't know, somehow I would before have just put it out of my mind as not e—, I wasn't even going to think about it.  And so that in a way it was almost that I didn't accept it.</p>

<p>And I think sometimes this is what makes me angry at my assistant.  And, and I'll do something that really is kind of unthoughtful to her when, when she's done something completely innocent but that it makes me feel jealous or possessive toward her time.  And then I just get mad and I suppose in a way I'm mad at myself for feeling that way.  And it's also a sort of reaction of, well, since I feel possessive, then I think, well, I must have a s—, a need and so I'm going to prove I don't have that need.  (Pause) In fact, sometimes in terms of need, I have thought quite specifically of that when I've thought of how I relate to other faculty members.  And both at LKC and then at the school I taught when I was in high school, I didn't like going into the faculty room.  This is the first year I've really used the faculty room.  And in a way I knew I was escaping from it and I might make other excuses about, well, I had other work I wanted to get done while I was at school but I knew really I was escaping from being in the social situation when I wouldn't know what to do.  And since I didn't go into the faculty room, I would have a very distant relationship with a lot of the people that I didn't work with directly, whereas other people at the school who might have even come in after me were becoming much friendlier with all sorts of people.  And then I would just tell myself right out that, well, I really didn't need them, that I had my own life with MSCZ and friends of ours.  And so I didn't need to have any feeling of friendship at, with people at school.  Or I'd tell myself that I really didn't like them anyway so what point in developing any kind of friendship with them.  Well, I guess that's what I used to do when I was dating in college, too.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking of the fact that somehow I was just letting my thoughts go to, I don't know, just other things about what I might want to do or plans or something and it was, again, almost like I was escaping from thinking about, making my mind keep out things that I didn't really want to think about.  And I just saw something that the church across from us put out.  They always have the quotation out.  And I don't know whether they chose this one because of the election or whether it just happened that it was this one.  But it was just the simple one, "Refuse to despair."  And it struck me because I've been worrying so much about, well, how can I be different or control things in a constructive way or, I don't know, just what is my function with myself, I suppose is the thing that's been bothering me.  And it just struck me that just that isn't something I did, especially in high school when I was so upset, I didn't refuse to despair, if it can be that strong a term.  But I sort of enjoyed it.  And I gave up.  And I just thought, well, there's nothing I can do.  And I didn't get myself in hand and think constructively about if I could do these things for a while then I wouldn't feel quite so badly.  And, but then it, part of my problem seems to be this great need for self-control.  But then now I'm just trying to put more self-control on myself so I, just leaves me feeling very confused.  (Pause) But I suppose the difference is that you have to exert control on yourself where it can do some good an not just where it's meaningless.  And, in a way, all the control I've exerted on myself was in areas that have been rather meaningless.  And where it would have been meaningful, I haven't. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I just thought again of my assistant and what I did with her today.  And, in a way, if I'd had control over myself (laughs) then I wouldn't have said anything.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I gather then from what you say that, eh, here, now and perhaps other times too, when you, eh, find yourself, eh, not talking and you feel it's an exercise in control to make yourself talk, you wonder whether this will be constructive or whether this is a situation that, where that kind of exercise of control will be as futile as you feel it often is.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I suppose I do because I will think to myself, well, this thought won't go anywhere.  So why bother with it?  Or today I think I was just thinking that I wasn't feeling that uncomfortable not saying anything and maybe I should just not say anything if I didn't want to and not make myself say something.  (Pause) But then I was just wondering if the times I tell myself, well, maybe I shouldn't make myself do something are the very times when I should make myself do something and that I'm just rationalizing.  And the kinds of controls I exercise over myself are the ones I find easiest because they're the ones I've done the longest, even if they're the ones, the very ones that I wished I could stop exercising.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I've been wondering, too, how much just problems I see in the boys I teach I, aren't just reflections of problems I think I have.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

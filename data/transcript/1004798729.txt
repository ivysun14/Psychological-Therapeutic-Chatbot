<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Definitely [inaudible [00:00:01].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just wondering if there are things we can do to work on your...(pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning. I felt like crap all week. I really haven't been able to motivate. Very cold today. Just I don't know; just I don't know if I'm sick or crazy or what. Ian said to me, um, are you ever going to be moving back home? I had to say no. Because if I said, you know, well maybe then he gets his hopes up, you know. And the truth is no. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh definitely tell the truth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I didn't see his reaction. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it over the phone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was in the car. He was in the back seat. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's probably one of those things that just bounce right off of him. You know he doesn't seem to react, you know, to things like that. He reacts more when Lucille takes his toy or breaks something of his, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could ask him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ask him what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see, buddy, remember what you were asking me the other day, if I were going to move back home or not? For what I said, you know, I think I didn't really say anything, but I was wondering you know, if you thought I would or you thought I was going to soon or you just really wished I would or...(pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just too bad they can't see their mom for the evil deity that she is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't have to respond. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They each have two parents who love them a lot and that's what matters the most. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Ugh. So I called the dealership twice yesterday wondering where my car was and they never called me back. My sales guy was on his day off and I left a couple of messages for the sales manager and I'm assuming the reason he didn't get back to me is either he didn't check his voice mail or the car just wasn't ready. So I've got to call again today. I don't know why. I just hate calling. Just, but hopefully my car will be ready today. Cleaned out the Subaru. I left the trash in there. I'm not leaving this [inaudible [00:03:24].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you going to do with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trading it in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>[00:03:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I found the title and I've got to remember to take my resident sticker and my plates. But everything's lined up and Kaylee said she's gotten the money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it doesn't appear that my dad has openly offered any help with the monthly payments, so I've got to...but the thing I've got now is it's like I can't blow it off. I've got to pay it because it's his credit, not mine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's got to be like my priority every month is to pay that car. It's on automatic payment. I get an extra quarter point interest for having automatic payment. So that'll motivate, but it's like that hits and the state hits and then send the check to the Feds and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What will the payment be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: $380 something. But in other news, I've all of a sudden gotten very busy. Multiple title orders this week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh that's fantastic. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was a little nervous because the closing I was doing for this bank, first of all, I didn't hear anything from them and then I got a one-time attorney approval application and they ask you on there if you've ever been insolvent or bankruptcy or whatever, something like that. I thought they were going to turn me down for the bankruptcy, but they didn't. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>[00:05:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So and I've got some [inaudible [00:05:13] and I had even forgotten about I kind of looked and...because I haven't been opening my files. I mean I'm just not doing work. If it just doesn't have to absolutely be done that day I'm not doing it. And so there was a file that I got a couple of weeks ago that I never even opened. You know it takes like 60 days to close, so there's no rush in opening like there used to be. And they send them to me pretty much in the beginning of the file where sometimes you get them kind of late, you know. So I've got a handful of closings in the pipeline and at least for the next two to three months that should be decent. I don't know if I'm going to have extra money to help maybe stock away for a little bit for maybe January or February, you know; that I don't know. It seems closings now, you make, if I'm lucky $800. You know, some of them maybe $900 close to a $1,000.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On a seller rep?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On just a regular closing refinance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay. </p>

<p>[00:06:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And because the values are low. You know the loan amounts are low. And you know, so seller reps, I make $750 for doing nothing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh, just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: This one I've got on Monday, I mean I had to track down an affidavit from some old lady. So I wrote her a letter and sent her the affidavit. You know that wasn't too, that much heavy lifting. Drove last night to get the document signed and I show up and sign what I need to sign and leave the closing with my $750 check. You know, and my client's check, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the seller reps are pretty easy and I've got a couple of those. Yeah, at least I'll be able to make my first couple of car payments. It would be nice if this was like the start of some sort of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I've been waiting. I'm like God, you know rates are so fucking low and Harry just hasn't been sending me the business. And finally, you know, things have caught up and he's starting to send me a lot of business.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great. </p>

<p>[00:07:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And um, (pause)...but today is just like I really; I left that affidavit up in the office, so the closing's on Monday at 10:00. So I've got to go back up there at some point either today or this weekend. I've got some work to do. I've got my audit next Wednesday. I just; it's not...I'm not motivated. Just, you know, it's weird because it's like I went from you know sleeping until 9, 10 o'clock. And then just...(phone rings). Hey, that could be the car place. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to pick it up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. The car or the phone? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The phone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But hopefully I can pick it up when I'm done here. That would be nice. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what I was talking about. (Pause). Oh yeah, I'd sleep to like 9 or 10 o'clock, but I'd wake up and I'd still be able to get in to the office and get work done and you know. Not that I was completely motivated, but seemed to be a little bit more productive. Where now, it's just like I'm up at like 5:30, 6:30, you know and just completely unmotivated to take a shower, get up and go to the office. You know. And um...(pause).</p>

<p>[00:09:47]  </p>

<p>I don't listen to my voice mail. [inaudible [00:09:51].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sales manager. Give me a call. Hey, come pick up your car. I hope there are no hitches. I don't know how there can be at this point, you know. They've got the money. That's all they care about. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm just...I don't know why I just...this whole week I've just been completely getting up early and you would think getting up early would mean I'd have a fresh start to the day and you know, but still can't get out of the house by like 9:30 or 10 o'clock. Back problems. Pilates. That's another thing. I'm not doing my exercises. I'm not practicing. I drove my car here today. I'm not riding my bike. I'm just...I'm getting fat. But I don't seem to be as sad or depressed or you know...(pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And no recent changes to the meds right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing significant. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've gone down, you know, what, gone down on the Trileptal, but that is being replaced with the Lamictal. So, you know, I've got some mood stabilizer. I would assume that would just affect my anchor. And then the Trilafon, I've gone down from 8 mg a day to 4 mg a day. And I don't really feel like...and I remember the reason that they gave that to me was to kind of just glue everything together and you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't seem like I'm disoriented or you know anything like that. Or...it's just pure motivation. Just, I don't know if it's cold. I mean I was very cold this morning. I wore, you know, a heavy coat and it's not even that cold out. I just...not like a super heavy coat, but my fall coat, which is missing buttons which I need to put a...</p>

<p>[00:12:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's a...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, we were talking about my meds. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I don't think it's the usual combination for you of both feeling better, like your mood is better. You know, you're not as sad, you're not as anxious, and yet you're feeling less motivated. Like that seems, I just thought, I don't think that's how it generally works for you.</p>

<p>[00:13:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean like not opening up these files is like normally I would get a file and I would open it that day or the next day and get checks out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Been, like you been getting out of the house. Had been riding your bike more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was thinking, you know, maybe this weekend I could go and try, because first of all I was in like, okay Friday, I'll go in to the office on Friday and just try and kill as much as I can until soccer practice. But I've got to pick up Ian from school at 2:30. Jess's like [inaudible [00:13:56] I'm in the middle of all this all week. I'm like, alright, I'll pick him up. She e-mailed me to pick him up on the 19th and she meant today. So I'm like alright I'll pick him up. So that negates getting in to the office and getting a bunch of work done because I've got to leave by, you know, 1:30. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And um, (pause)...tomorrow I've got soccer at 8:30 and then I've got to go to the farm and pick up my share and Ian is sleeping over, so he's probably coming over in the afternoon. So it's like I really can't go tomorrow to the office.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which also means I can't get up early on Sunday morning and go to the office unless I, you know, just try to bring him home early.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The past games were at 4 o'clock, so that gives me a little more time to get stuff done. The problem is it's just, you know, I really don't need to go up to the office. Maybe I can ask Jess on Sunday if I could use the local office.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Try and get some work done there. I don't know. I've got to do an estate plan which means I've got to print out...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that seems to be a problem. In order to really get work done you've got to drive, whatever it is, 45 minutes.</p>

<p>[00:15:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, you know it's like the title work; I did a lot of that at home, you know, and got the scanner at home and I can do e-mails at home. I can review...there are certain things I can do at home, but I don't know. Maybe today I'll at least put together that estate plan. So I'm just cutting and pasting. I'm going to have to do something today. You know, I'm going to get bored at some point and do something. But I've got to go up to the office and get that affidavit. It would be nice if I just had my new car and just went riding today, you know. (Pause). Just for fun. Start putting the miles on it. I had to fill up my gas tank yesterday and I didn't know how much gas to put in it, you know. (Pause). I did a check and it's only going to save me a couple hundred dollars a year, but you know, the better gas mileage is still better gas mileage. It's a bigger tank, so I'm going to be paying more at a time for gas, which should be farther apart. So I keep everything in Quicken so I'll be able to tell, you know, with some, if I'm saving money. I'm sure I will. But...(Pause). So. (Coughing) (Pause). Yeah, so I don't know what to do about the motivation. It's like...(pause) a part of it was you know, at times feeling nausea, like I don't want to do my exercises because I feel nauseous or whatever, but it's like I feel a little better today. I had a small, a short...my puking episodes have been, my dry heaving episodes have been pretty rough this week. And I'm sure a lot of that has to do with the weather and just more stuff, dropping down, you know. It doesn't seem to happen... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that from? Do you know what that's from? </p>

<p>[00:18:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't remember who told me, but basically snot just drips down in to my stomach and upsets my stomach overnight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it from allergies? Like do you know what it is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know because it doesn't happen during the day. I think it's just because my apartment's not clean. You know, dust mites and there's probably still some pet dander in there, you know. Because I don't have this problem when I sleep other places, you know. So and it's only been...it hadn't happened for a long time. And then just all of a sudden it started happening. And the funny thing is, is that I cleaned up and did some Swiffering, and I'm wondering if I didn't just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Agitate stuff. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But you know, it's been some rough mornings and but I have like just the medication...nausea throughout the day. And it's like today I'm...I wasn't as bad this morning and I don't feel nauseous right now. And maybe I can get some exercise done today. I think that would help to break the cycle. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. So. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:19:50]</p>

<p>I wish had clients who were yelling at me, "Where's my stuff?" and then I'd get it done, you know. (Pause). On Monday I agreed to file something in the land court which takes forever, so it's like I got a closing at 10:00 and at noon, I've got to go in for it. And it literally can take hours because they're so slow in land court to file documents. And I get paid $50. But I can bring my laptop and do other work. I'm supposed to have a closing Tuesday, which I'll make decent money on. But that's not going to happen. It'll probably happen more like Wednesday or Thursday. So...(Pause).</p>

<p>[00:21:10]</p>

<p>The banker has put in an application E&G so maybe there's a chance to get on their list. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Just you talk to these people and no one seems to know how to do it. You know. And I think once I get this closing done with one bank, I'm going to send an e-mail to it, because I've been dealing with the closing manager. I'm going to send her an e-mail kind of explaining that you know I did do closings for the bank and that I've been working with, I forget the people's names, to try and get on a list. I'm on the Advisory Board at the, you know, of the bank. Which reminds me I've got a meeting at some point. [inaudible [00:22:06] calendar. They pay you $100. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who pays $100?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The bank. You just go and it's, you know, an Advisory Board that they want your opinion on things. A couple weeks later in the mail you get a check for $100. Apparently they used to just give you $100 cash. (Pause). It started with National Bank and then when they were taken over by the local Bank they continued doing it. Now this one is continuing to do it. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:22:48]</p>

<p>Ian had a horrible time in swimming on Tuesday and I'm just worried that he's just so afraid of putting his head under water, you know. It's like when is he going to, you know, for me it's like you've just got to keep at it. You know. Jess's like, "Oh he needs to go swimming when it's not a lesson." It's like yeah, but you know, he's not putting his head under the water when he's just swimming for fun. You know. And he's afraid of the big pool and they pulled him under the water and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, how did he get pulled under the water?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They have lane lines and they were supposed to swim under the water lines and he went under one and cried. So she's, you know, was going to help him and pulled him under. Which I think is the right thing to do. She only did it twice. I would've done it the whole way. I used to run a pool and was a Water Safety Instructor and a Life Guard and all that crap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that's my problem. But, yeah, you've got to have the kid sort of...there's a fine line of you know, confronting your fear and not forever, you know, stigmatizing—not stigmatizing, but whatever. When you never want them to go swimming.</p>

<p>[00:24:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Traumatizing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Traumatizing. Yes. But he's got to learn to swim, you know. It's getting kind of ridiculous. He's been taking lessons forever. Since he was like 18 months. You know, off and on. It's not like they've been consistent, but when he was just like one or two, he got water up the nose and he never likes his face getting wet; he never liked it. He couldn't wash his face. He couldn't wash his hair. You know. He just had a fit every time. But Lucille loves the water. I think she's just going to totally have fun swimming, you know. She's going to think it's great. So maybe tomorrow I'll take him swimming, maybe like a family swim for like $5 or something like that. Just take him swimming and get him used to swimming and it's not a lesson. Because he has fun in the pool. He loves going swimming; he does. You know. Like Dad comes to town, that's all he wants to do is go swimming in the pool at the hotel. You know. There was like a Sunday where they moved their flight up so we couldn't go swim in the pool and he was devastated, you know. It was like, 'Oh, I was looking forward to swimming every day." You know, just he gets these little ideas in his head and you just, you know, he gets so excited about them. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:26:05]</p>

<p>I was going to take him next weekend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next weekend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's tomorrow?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The 13th. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so next Saturday I'm taking him to a game. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to get a little grill and cook up some hamburgers and hot dogs and Jess was like, "What are you doing that for? Why don't you just get him food inside?" and you know for the money I would spend on food inside, I could get a little grill, some hamburgers and hot dogs and the spatula and some buns and some condiments and then I'd have a grill for the next time we go, you know. Just a little smoky Joe. You can get them at Target, you know. They're not that expensive. I could even get a propane one if I wanted to. I can decide whether.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet he'd probably be excited about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so. You know you kind of hang out. You kick the soccer ball around. A lot of other kids are around there, you know, and he could maybe try and play with other kids. So. She just kind of poo-poo's everything, you know. I have a feeling she's really not going to be excited about him being in the Cub Scouts or the Tiger Scouts. I [inaudible [00:27:28]. But because that's all like camping and you know doing the hiking and taking festive activities. But I think he's going to love it. You know, uniform, badges.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you were saying he's in to badges.</p>

<p>[00:27:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I hear that Ian's room is stacked. That's really great. I haven't heard of that. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so yeah, he's in the...(pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do sound a bit better and a little more motivated in certain ways here as I think about stuff. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm getting a new car, business is good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause). It sort of makes sense in terms of like the not feeling that so much as far as work. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't had, you know, it's like I, I mean the loneliness thing hasn't been bothering me as much as it had been before. I don't know if it's just because I'm falling asleep. Last night I didn't fall asleep early, you know. I just...I'm not thinking about it as much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:29:19]</p>

<p>I just don't know how that...as the winter comes on, I have less and less social, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of practice?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because we're done...that's kind of like my main...(coughing). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess there are the games, but the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I do have the games, you know. So there are those. That's true. It's not like everybody's going out to a bar. I mean people will. I'll try and keep in touch with people and do stuff. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Too bad there's no indoor practice for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause). But it is a very quick game.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's no wind and which makes a difference, surprisingly.</p>

<p>[00:30:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would think it's good. That would make it easier than being outside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but when you finish the season and you go back out and you start throwing in the wind again...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The last time I did that, that really messed up my throws. The first year they did indoor I played it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's too far. It's just too quick a game for me. You know. I'm unable to use a larger field to my advantage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe more like basketball and less like soccer or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. the rule are different, so I don't exactly know because they're subbing and there's just all these other different little things you've got to know. But I think there are like big nets and you can throw it off the nets and you know; because it looks like the indoor soccer in places. So...(pause0. But yeah. I've never played it. I haven't been playing it in years. It's probably been 10 years since I've played it if not longer. (Pause). (Yawns).</p>

<p>[00:31:57]</p>

<p>It's like I kind of just want to go back home and go to sleep, but I'm going to have a coffee. I won't be able to sleep. I watch Cable News, which is like the same thing every half hour or hour. Just the same stories over and over and over and over again. (Pause). Maybe an e-mail comes in that I've got to respond to. Fix this, fix that. Don't change this; change that. Those are the little things I'm able to do, you know, because they've got to be done. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and address this. Change the wording on this. You know. The numbers are very inconsistent in what they want. (Pause). It probably would've made more sense to have Ian sleep over tonight, but I get the feeling there's something going on. I don't know. Because Jess specifically said Saturday, which would have made my life easier if we did it tonight and then I could go mid-day on Saturday up to the office and get some work done then go in. Been trying to set up a space to do some work, but I don't know. Completely not what I needed. (Pause). </p>

<p>[00:34:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: is it because you don't like the work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure that's part of it. I mean there's none of the work I really like. And you know, the work I have to do takes thought and preparation and you know writing a letter and writing a complaint and doing some lawyering. Whereas like opening up a file is, I mean that's paralegal work, you know. So it's just mindless activities that I should be able to do but I just I don't know. (Pause). It would be neat if my car is ready. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:35:19].</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, what do you think is going to be the most exciting part about having a brand new car? Or what am I excited the most about? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The radio.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're good. I really am. I'm just like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's so silly, you know. Like I could have gone to Best Buy for like $50 and got my speakers fixed, but instead I had to buy a whole new car just so I can listen to the radio. (Pause). I can actually stream my iPhone over the Bluetooth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice. That's cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's funny. It said it has like Pandora integration, but I think you need a phone. So it's like why; just don't play Pandora on your phone, which I think is what it does anyway. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just, I don't know. But...(pause), it'll be nice. (Pause). I took a big plastic box to just clear everything out of my car. Now I have to go through that box and decide what should be kept, what should be thrown away, and what needs to go back in the car. (Pause). I don't know. (Stretching.) </p>

<p>[00:36:57]</p>

<p>Ian will be excited if I pick him up in a new car. I don't know why kids get excited about that kind of stuff. You don't know? You haven't done studies on this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I haven't read them. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think they just like new things, you know. (Pause). Like the game, you know. He's never been to it. It's a big thing. It's exciting for him. Going to a new stadium. There's all these...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's also about dad is cool. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles). Oh he'll learn.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing). </p>

<p>CLIENT: In due time. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, as best I can tell, they all do in good time. (Pause). You may as well enjoy it while you got it. I think about that game...I know you go to football games, going to sports games with dad. You actually got a grill like the big guys. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually have a pass game the next day. So it's like Saturday night I'm going to be there and then I'm going to come back Sunday morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, it's in the same place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sunday morning, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, both are in the stadium.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like why can't I just get a hotel room and stay down there. I would...if he was going to the game, I would do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it doesn't make sense to drive all the way back up and back down. It's not that far, but...(coughing.). He has fun in hotels too, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he go to a football game last year?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he's never been to one. And when, see, because we're there all day. It's just too much for him. But I'm going down to a game in December, the beginning of December and he's going down. My dad's trying to get an extra ticket. But I'm thinking my dad is just so in such bad shape that he's probably not going to be able to go to the game.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So Ian will use his tickets and just he and I will go. But he's really looking forward to that football game. I don't think he knows the first thing about football. It really doesn't matter. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he likes football.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well that's what matters. It's the game. It's like I need to...I can't find my team shirt. I need to get a new team shirt. He wants me to buy one at the stadium for him. I'm like...I bought him a couple of figures at the park. We should go to the stand where it's like $5 for the shirt, you know. Or one of these discount places instead of spending $40. (Pause).</p>

<p>[00:40:27]</p>

<p>Yeah, so initially I was thinking I might not be able to make Tuesday, but now it looks like I will be able to make Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, because the closing's likely to happen later in the week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, probably. Hopefully Wednesday. (Pause). A part of it is my client...he's a nice guy but he's not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree, you know. At work he's brilliant, you know. Common sense isn't always...I think he's just been slow getting documents through the lender and then the lender takes forever to review everything. And it's just...(pause). </p>

<p>[00:42:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I wonder how much of it that is with work that you're...(pause)...[inaudible [00:43:03] like. I don't feel it's like what you do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder how much the lack of motivation at work is not it being excited about what you do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, because I don't like...yeah, I'm sure that's part of it. But there's even, you know; but it's like practice. It's like I'm not motivated to go to practice. I'm not motivated to ride my bike. I'm not motivated to do exercise. I'm not motivated for anything. (Pause). Just not feeling right. You know, it's just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean physically?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>[00:43:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I'm fighting something off or I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe. (Pause). </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have soccer practice today. (Pause). I guess we're going to be cold. It's going to be cold tonight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thirties, 20's.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my gosh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: People are freezing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:44:45]. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I hope my car is ready. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, enjoy the radio.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (giggling). That's fun. Stay warm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST; Thank you. You too.   </p>

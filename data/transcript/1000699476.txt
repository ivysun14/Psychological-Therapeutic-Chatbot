<p>Five Approaches to Linda: Session One, Cognitive Affective Behavioral Therapy</p>

<p>FIVE APPROACHES TO LINDA</p>

<p>SESSION 1</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>The unique aspect to this program involving inclusion of an actress who portrayed the role of the patient with the same problem each day at the five day presentation.  Students and participants obtained the first hand view of how each individual theorist dealt from their own prospective with the patient and her particular problems.  The case of Linda was developed to be a fixed role for this particular presentation.  Any deviation that occurs during the course of her sessions with these various therapists, occurred as a result of what the particular therapist chose to focus on as they facilitated the sessions, as opposed to any deliberate deviation by the actress herself.</p>

<p>The following session features Therapist #1, who is using Cognitive Affective Behavioral Therapy.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm, I think maybe a good, good place to begin is to find out what further thoughts you may have had after our last week's session.  Can you bring me up to date with what is going on with you since then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahh, do you mean what's with the family?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Generally, or with regard to a session itself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pardon?  I don't know that anything is really going on differently with our, ah, my situation.  I think it basically, remains the same.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And uhm, what thoughts have you had about our last session?  What we spoke about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, (sighs) uhm, I know that, ahh, basically, I, I have a lot to work on.  They say ahh—there's a lot I have to do, a lot to overcome.  Uhm, and I understand that it's gonna take awhile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Now, one of the things that, that you've mentioned toward the end of the session, is that you have some mixed feelings about being in therapy currently, generally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.  I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe, uhm, it might be useful if we, we talk a bit about that and tell me some about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, basically, I ,(sighs) I've never in my life had a, ahh, a good, uhm, thought about opening up to people basically, especially, man.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhuh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ahh, a, I consider myself between somewhat of a private person and ahh, I, I, I've seemed to deal with a lot, ahh, by myself ... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) but then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  So it, it really must have take you quite a bit for you to make this decision to ahh, to come in and, and see me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—Yeah, I feel hesitation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Even with all of that hesitation, you know, being who you are and, and being a private person, and also the fact that, that, ahh, I'm male.  Might make it even more difficult for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Well, it's, it's important for us to, to really focus on this initially because ahh, it's important for you to feel comfortable enough with me to be able to, ahh, at least, take the kinds of risks perhaps, in a gradual way.  It doesn't have to be all at once to, to share with who—with regards to what is going in your life and what prompted you to decide to take this big step, which it is a big step for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I, I do feel that ahh, I, I want to improve things with my family.  Ahh, the relationship I have with my husband, my children, ahh... (sighs)  Uhm, you see my father just a—my father is very ill and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I guess, that kind of just brought back a lot of memories for me. Uhm ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About him in, in the past?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, ahh, I could never really relate well to my father at all.  And ahh, I guess, by that and now that he's still and I don't know how much time really he has left... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) uhm, I think it's time that I try to make peace with him and to ahh, with my husband, try to find out what's going on between us and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (sighs) W hat—you know, that's interesting with that wo—when I was thinking about our ah, last session I did give you the fear manner of, of thought.  It occurred to me also that, that your relationship with your father might be a really important thing for us to work on because we don't know how much time he has left.  And any unfinished business you may have with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why you see, ahh, this is just—ahh, this is what's so ironic, I mean, on the one hand, I feel like I do wanna resolved things, but on the other hand, I feel like ahh, (laughs) ahh, I really don't understand my feelings.  I don't really have a, a real mo—emotional commitment to him.  I don't feel an emotional loss.  I don't feel there will be an emotional loss... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) when he's not there anymore.  Uhm, I, I just... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And at the same —excuse me — at the same time, there is something tugging at you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) to do something about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, that's very important and it's very good that you did make this decision, you know, even though, it's very, very hard generally, and even though your, your relationship with your father is so mixed.  Ahh, I think it's a wise move that you made.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think that it might have something to do with inferring my, my situation with my husband and the boys.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, my sense also is that it—it's almost as if your life is that, as a, at a turning point.  Will you wanna—in so many different ways, not just with your father, but certainly with your father but in other areas in your life, as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you're, you're right.  I think, I, I have reached that turning point, basically.  Ahh, I know, that I'm at the age now where uhm, I'm about to lose my, my children to, to life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're, you know, they're both—my son, youngest son is graduating from high school and ahh, I just don't really have anyone who, who needs me.  In fact, I, I never really felt that they did.  I—I've been so busy with my own career, my own life but I haven't, I haven't spent much time getting to know my children.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I, I don't know who they are, really and ahh, I don't think they know who I am.  And I'd get the feeling they don't care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think, probably, uhm, being the woman, I feel that, that's my responsibility to initiate some kind of change here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Being the woman, meaning what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess it kinda goes back to my mother, because ahh, she was a very nurturing and warm person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She loved her children.  But we just never had any doubts that she cared about us.  And I, I just feel I haven't been that kind of a mother with my, my sons.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.  So maybe it's time that I learn how to be that kind of a mother. (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So all these things seemed to be concerning your father... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) only having ce—a certain amount of time left, your, ahh, a younger boy getting ready to graduate... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) and leave.  Uhm, your being at the same age, that as you said last time, that your mother passed away... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) And the, the feelings of, ahh, sadness.  And ahh, it seems to be this thing of loss going on... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) ah, in your life add, add a particular turning point in your age.  You know, this significance of turning forty-five sometimes... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.  Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) can have that significance a-and meaning for people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.  You know, I do. (sighs)  I do feel that now that I am forty-five, same age as my mother, uhm, and I feel that I cannot have a sense of responsibility to, you know, everything ended for her, forty-five.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Indeed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ahh, I think, s-some forty-five, that should be a time of a beginning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Yes, I understand.  I have to say something, when to that, you know, for somebody who is reluctant to—into therapy and is, is weary of opening up especially, with a man, you're doing a pretty good job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, it's you. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Well, you're the one that's opening up. (laughs)  So, w-while I'll accept some of the credit for it, I think, you have to kinda acknowledge that you're the other one, that's, that's uhm, taking the risk in opening up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it isn't easy but I, I guess, I, I do a lot of uhm, talking to myself, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ahh, in fact, a lot of times when I'm supposed to be at work, and I'm not, I'm really out thinking and ahh... (crosstalk) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) thinking about what has taken place in my life. and ahh, where I am now.  And I really so much want to uhm, make things right with my family, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  The, the impression that I get is that you probably do a lot of talking to yourself, more so than talking... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... talking to other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel that there's really any point. I- I don't get the feeling that people really listen, people really care... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then that hold you back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then, what impact is that on other people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, they don't have a, an accurate, ahh, perception of who I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  They don't really know you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there has, in fact, from what you said last time, that didn't, didn't, did this kind of pattern ahh, throw out a lot of your life as being an outsider, being on the periphery, ahh, of people in an intimate way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.  Uhm, as a child, I really didn't have a lot of friends. (sniffs)  Ahh, I guess, by my own choosing, I'd like to think that, that was the reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahhhh, I was basically, ah, ah, I did things by myself, whatever I could do by myself... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... read or, ah, (sighs) ah, play, ah, with my dolls and that I did that by myself.  And uhm, even when I went off to school, I am wasn't really involved in social activities very much... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... never really dated either... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) to much in school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Was your dad that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahhh, what way?  A loner... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) type?  Ahhh, actually, he, he didn't really ah, do much with the family.  I don't know what he did on the outside, basically.  He was, he was a stone mason and I know, he had to work with people.  I don't know if he socialized with them, but uhm, actually not, not a whole lot of people were coming to our house... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... as I remember as a child, so I don't know.  My father was a very strong person... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) he was a very annoying.  Ahh, he was always yelling at my mother.  My mother was so obedient all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.  You didn't like that in her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not my dad being submissive. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hum.  And how have you lived your life in that regard?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, basically, I think ah, I-I, I can go through the motions very believably about being a cooperative, but inside it, I fight it.  I just, I just want to do it my way, by myself but I understand that you have to do certain things to get along with the world, you know? (sniffs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But uhm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that's about tight (ph) in with the difficulty that you have in opening up to other people?  You know, letting them s-s-see you as... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) as opposed to holding it back here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, the point of that is that, my mother never had time to really listen.  And my father didn't care to listen.  So there was never any opportunity to do that even as the young person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know as, as I grow up and ah, maybe I, you know, ah, hhmm, ah, created reasons why I didn't want to ah, open up to people... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ever?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) from that, but that's why I always trusted myself, I guess.  Trusted the way I was and who I was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  So it's a good way to protect yourself... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... but also kind of a lonely instance... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... to take?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so, very, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wanna say something about the loneliness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, like, like what do you want me to say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What it's like for you?  You know, I said, "Lonely," and you kind of acknowledge and said, "Yes, very."  So that I, I sensed that there was... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: See...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) you know a cord that I hit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I, I guess "alongness," "aloneness"... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) and "loneliness."  I like the "aloneness" ... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) most of the time.  But I don't like the "loneliness" that sometimes comes with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And uhm, that's hard to take.  And I, ah, I used to be more ah, more ah—I used to be able to talk to my husband about certain things, but then this time grew, our time and along I, I kinda like ahh, I just grew apart, maybe grew apart.  And ah, it's been—Oh my, I don't know how to, how to express how it feels to be lonely, except that it's a sadness, it's uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) I don't have anybody close to me.  I, I, I always feel a sense of obligation which is ahh, again, like my father... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) he was always very ah, into the uhm, the ah.. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The right way to do things... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... the rules... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... the rules...(crosstalk) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How to get things done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhuh.  And that's basically, the way I've been, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Except for more recently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not getting things done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You carry around your equipment when you go out upon the shoot, but... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) but you don't do very much except think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do.  I do a lot of thinking about everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: About my mother and ah, especially now, I, I think a lot about her and what changes maybe she should have made in her life, to make her life happier ‘cause I don't think she was really very happy when, when she died.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ah, and I'm struggling trying to ahh, make sure that, that doesn't happen to me; that I wanna get the most out of my life.  I wanna, I wanna have the opportunity to really grow in the direction that, that I feel,  ah, faith has intended for me to, or that I, you know, I just wanna be able to grow, more do more.  If in my life.. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Faith has intended you to, I mean, you set or, or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-uh.  Or that I, that I think maybe, if my mother were around, what she would like to have seen me accomplish.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Are you saying you're in therapy f-for your mother?  Like a tribute to your mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Oh, I don't think so but maybe.  I didn't think I was, I thought it was basically to, to help me with my own situation today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But maybe in a way, it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it's both.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In case, she's looking down I wanna her to say, "My daughter was able to do what I couldn't."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sobs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, well, there's a lot (sighs) of work we had to do.  A lot of different directions and, and ah, you know, one of the, one of the directions that you did mention is ah, your relationship with your husband.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And ah, maybe we could, if we could travel a little bit more about what you'd like to see happen there.  What's going on and ah, you know, if this is not at all uncommon when the last child flies away.  Uhm, there's nothing between the two people, a husband and wife, you know, or attention that gets diverted or the, the any unresolved issues they get eluded because things have to be done for him.  Once he goes, even to face each other... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wha—you see, you see, a strange thing about that, the kids never really relied on me for anything... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) they always relied on my husband because basically, he was home more than I.  His work was ah, being able to be, to be home.  Oh, he's a landscaper.  He's able to stay home during the off seasons. (sniffs)  But I'm working a lot—I used to really enjoy my job, I was out a lot.  So the kids really grew to be more dependent on him.  And they go to him for everything.  They have a lot of hobbies in common and we just never really did anything much except, you know, go to church when they were younger and that was that and uhm, so I don't really—I can't relate to them... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) easily.  So when you say, that he's going to leave, maybe subconsciously, I feel that ah, "I've always been important in their life maybe," I told myself that.  And now, they're going and I-I'm telling myself subconsciously (sniffs) that, "I have nobody that needs me..." (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "... anymore."  And that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that—one part of it maybe, once he goes off to school then—however, how much you did service as a nurturing mother take good care—taking care of him in doing whatever ah, (snifs) that, that will be taken away.  But I think, what I'm referring to more is, is ah, not so much how much you've done for him, but the fact that there's only gonna be two of you now... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) in the house.  And uhm, what is the contact that you make with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On, on what level would you...? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On, on, on both level. (snifs) On a sexual level, on the level of ah, of what you do together for companion (snifs)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... but we don't actually have ... (crosstalk) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) a friend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But we don't actually really do anything much at all together.  And as a friend, well, uhm, we've really lost contact, I think, through the years on that, on that level... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) friendship.  Uhm, I don't know what we're gonna do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sniffs) I would like to ah, keep our marriage together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're concerned that, that in maybe problems ahead?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know, I don't know if we're gonna share in anything.  Ahh, what's the— what's the point of staying together?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, our children are equipped to ah, face the world and ah, here we are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if, and if somebody's gonna say, "I don't think we should stay together."  Who might it be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It, it might—most probably, would be me.  He seems to be, I don't know, he's like an—I don't think he's really aware what's going on.., (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>
 
<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) he seems fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.  So who's to satisfy with... (crosstalk)</p> 

<p>CLIENT: Oh...</p> 

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) the lack of sex in your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, Who's to satisfy with the of lack of sex?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sniffs) Gee, I don't know, ah, I don't know if that's the problem or not. I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You kinda made a face when I said, "Sexually," (sniffs) you kind of like ... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) "Whose gonna forget, forget it...?" (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) funny... (laughs) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) forget about the type of reaction... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. We don't know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it maybe, that both of you are very satisfied or... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... with the (inaudible) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... with the actions of it.  Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) lack of his.  Uh-huh.  Unless, he's got some story that I don't know about that (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that thought has crossed your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's possible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, he seems very happy and content and from most of the things that I've ever read, guys usually aren't when they're not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. (deep breaths)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) how you thought about that. (deep breaths)  It's not (inaudible 00:24:27.589)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the—this is the first time you...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, I've never thought of this as an issue.  It might be—(sniffs) maybe, maybe, I thought about other things and I've just never really thought about... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who's to decide... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) that.  Are you sure?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) if you always had your work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I work and ah, I have an obligation now with my father.  Of course, that's not been going on forever but ah, he's always been around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has your relationship with your husband been different earlier on?  When you first met before the kids came along?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think it was.  Yeah.  I think we were ah—we enjoy doing simple things together.  Ah, we never really socialize with a lot of friends.  We didn't have a lot of friends, but we would, we would ah, ah, (sighs) take walks and we would uhm, go to movies and out for dinner and, you know, those kinds of things that we could, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) share our time with each other and that was good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  You enjoyed it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you sensed that he enjoyed it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.  I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he likes nature being a landscaper, he likes being out, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sniffs) I love nature.  I think it's the only thing honest in life?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  What happened to that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That contact between the two of you.  What happened just now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: About what's honest in life?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, I don't know.  I really—that's why I like to take walks now because it's surrounding myself with them—with the beauty of ah, nature and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are your tears saying right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm, uhm, the—I guess that I just wish that there was more opportunity to count on other people—rely on other people and (sniffs) and be—not be afraid to share what's inside of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Are you saying you want to be able to trust people enough to be able to share what's inside?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Do you think you're doing that now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right now, with me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sharing with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there is a "but" behind us?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean, we're not getting to the—any... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true.  But you are good, I mean, this is unusual for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is unusual for me, to ah, yeah, open up... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) and even admit there is a problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.  And there is a "but" after that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.  (deep breaths)  So I'm, I'm, I'm still trying to get a sense of where your relationship with your husband has gone over the years (sniffs) (deep breaths) ah, and what made the change?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess, for work.  I guess, work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My work.  I love my work.  Ahh, in the beginning and I, and I did up until, I guess, ah, few years ago until things, sort of, I don't know.  People, people are strange, people are very unreliable.  I've had people to help me in my work assistance and they, ah, they don't show up for work, and I do work.  They do half assed work, and I have to just get rid of them, find somebody new, that's constant change like that, I just... (sniffs)  And then people who hire me to do jobs, they give me a certain set of instructions; I go out and do it.  I come back but it's not right.  I, I just ah, you know, it's almost like I've just given up on...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not right because you—they're not pleased of it? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) that's not right from—it's not what they wanted?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... it's not—Maybe enough, for us.  It's not enough of what they asked for.  Or it's not the right kind of thing (sniffs) ah, ah, I don't know.  I should have been more creative.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.  Alright. (sniffs).  So do you think that, that (sighs) perfectionism creeps into your life (sniffs) into a number of different ways, at least, as far as your work is concerned?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd probably would say so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: As far as my work is concerned?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I try not to make a mistake.  I try to do everything and think he had to—not give somebody anything to, not like—I try to think of all of the angles.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that when I do present my work, nobody's gonna find fault with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  So are you pressured?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I suppose it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you put that pressure on yourself?  And you put that pressure on other people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.  Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, ah, my little simple philosophy is, "I don't expect anything from anybody that I won't give them."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.  Perfection.  Which is hard to sometimes achieve.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As when you show your work to the people that you're doing it for and they say, "No, it's not quite what I want."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that really is disturbing for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (sniffs)  So it, it must also be very disturbing that you're not able to work now.  But you can't move about your energies because with your feeling depressed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is the thing, I don't miss it now.  Ahh, I mean, I feel, like, ah, ah—my focus now seems to be figuring out what is wrong with my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not focused on my work anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  (sniffs).  So it was like, everything... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) is falling apart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.  I don't know if I would label that "falling apart."  It so much... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, maybe it's an overstatement.  Uhm . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I—it, it's transferred all that—tra—transferred into everything else, so I want everything else to be right and I don't know how to do it.  I don't know h—I don't know what to say to my children, or to my husband, or to my father, to make it right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.  Okay, so this—You know, there are a lot of different areas of your life that, that seemed to have issues that you want to resolve and get a handle on and understand better.  I think, one of the things we, we need to do is to talk about—we spoke about "goals," but I think it's probably a good idea for us to talked about the, the "priority of goals" ‘cause it's hard to know which to do first, you know.  Then an, unrelated all of these things.  Your relationship with your husband, with your kids, with your father are—there are probably things that cut through all three.  Uhm, but it might be just too much to try to deal with everything at the same time.  So that we could trust it, make sure that we both agree where to start.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ah, where would that be?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's something for us to negotiate.  What do you think? (sniffs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's possible that I need to resolve some issues with my father...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) first.  But I think it's also important to ah, that my husband know that uhm, that my husband know uhm, (sniffs) that I'm doing this.  That I'm seeing you and, ah... (sniffs)(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) and that I'm trying to work on... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't know that you're in therapy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.  I did this really on my own.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  What do you think he, he—how he would react if he knew?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't—I don't know.  I don't—I think he would probab—probably say, "Well, I didn't realize there was anything wrong."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.  It's kind of interesting how you do it.  It's hard to read another person, I mean... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) even if it is somebody you've live with for all these years.  So it's like, when you say there's nothing wrong, uhm, where—does he have a mistress on the side?  What's going on with him?  It's like a big question mark.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See, ah, ah, again I, I don't know if it's anything I've conned up, but it's something in my mind or... (crosstalk) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) or that is in fact, the reality of... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) the situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is a big communication gap between the two of you.  Big communication gap.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.  I don't know how much individual therapy alone would necessarily help that.  I mean, I think we already gave it a good try to see and ah, ah, and it maybe, that if our therapy is successful—our work is successful in dealing with your feelings toward your husband, then, then next step might be to see a marriage THERAPIST.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some and making that is the—is kinda like a success step rather than, you know, if all else fails type of thing, because in all likelihood, there maybe issues between the two of you that can only be dealt with, with the two you in the same room.  We can try to figure out.  Well, if he was sitting here, what would he think? You know, we're trying to figure out, what does he think about my being on therapy?  Or how does he feel about our love life?  Or how does he feel about us not doing the kinds of companion things we used to do?  And, but we could never really know for sure, unless, unless he was here or preferably, he—the two of you will with somebody else, if we continue working individually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But what's your thoughts about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sniffs)  I wouldn't have an objection seeing a THERAPIST.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But again, I can't speak for him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, he's not an uncooperative person.  He's just that, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) he may not reveal if there's anything wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Okay.  But the issue of your relationship with your, your father seems—I, I would agree this ah, oppressing natu—nature to that one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.  You see, ah—(sniffs)  Yeah.  I think so, too.  Although, ah, again, I don't really feel the—I mean, intellectually, I, I guess, I feel like there's a need to do that because I feel something unresolved between me and my mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I never really got a chance to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) to talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.  And that stays with you for the fact that you never finished... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Absolutely, it stays.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) never said certain things to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.  And again, I may not realize this until my father's gone, that there might be things I wish I would have said.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that, you know, as a more—as an adult now and personal (ph) is done a lot of thinking, that maybe that would be the thing to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Interesting how you say, "... as an adult now."  Ahh, now that I'm an adult at 45, who—how did you view yourself from 44 backwards?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, my mother died when I was a child.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.  Okay... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I remember...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) I misread that thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.  So, so you're attributing your lack of closure with your mother because you just didn't know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, yeah.  And I think ah, I think because I lost my mother when I was, you know, in a, in a time of change in my life, teenage, that uhm, there were, there were things that I needed to know and there was no one to, to talk things over with.  And ah, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.  That's just kind of interesting, in the sense that you've started off the session today by saying —oh, not quite saying, I kinda put the words in your mouth —that you're in therapy for your mother, as a tribute to your mother (laughs), you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) and you didn't quite say it that way.  But, but ah, it's kind of like, for things you wanna do, but in memory of your mother.  You wanna do now, what you, kind of wished, you could have done or wished that she might have done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yes.  But I, I do wanna try to get the most of in my life, you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) when you go around at one time and I, I kinda wind it, the most out of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let, let's talk in terms of which of the goals that, that you've—we should start with.  There is, ah, we both in agreement that, that, ah, was top at working on your relationship with your father?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, ah, I, I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.  And then, your relationship with your husband and your children and, and the other issues we can kinda hold for tomorrow? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there any—is there anything besides your relationship with you, your boys and with your husband that you had in mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so.  I think those are the, the two primary things that I, I feel need to be dealt with right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about you're work situation?  The fact that you're not able to bring yourself to function.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahh. (sighs)  I think that will fall into place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, uhm, yeah, I think it will fall into place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It may.  H-h-had a similar thought, but I think, it would be wise for us to check periodically, to see how you're doing in that.  Even though, we don't necessary spend so much session time on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really feel that this whole thing is me because my husband seems to be content with his life, my boys are, too, it's just that I'm not... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) I'm not content with their contentment, you know. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So if I'm dealing with the—these things that are going on inside with me, I think and I resolved them with my own family, I think possibly, once I have learned something there... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) I can maybe, apply those things to the people I worked for and with in... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.  So we know we were going.  At some point, we also need to know how we're gonna get there.  And what methods we'll use in, in here.  And uhm, to some extent, it will involve very much what you're doing this afternoon.  Oh, kinda being open and candid and, and taking the risk in prevailing things to me, that you don't usually, usually do.  Uhm, but you didn't come to see me because you wanted to work at issues with me.   You came to see me because you wanted to work at —Ooops! (paper flaps) —issues with other people.  And uhm, see you're gonna need to some of the same stuff in your other relationships, more meaningful relationships in your life to take these risks of disclosing things about yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) I suppose so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You say that with a sigh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) Well, you hate to make yourself vulnerable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who are you talking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Self.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you say, "I"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I.  I hate to make myself vulnerable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  You hate to or you're afraid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I think I really want to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) it's just that I'm afraid, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.  Okay.  So can you say that, "I would like to make myself."  "I would like to open up but I'm afraid to make myself vulnerable."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would like to open up but I'm afraid to make myself vulnerable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you say that again now, and substitute "and" for "but"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would like to open up but... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) and I'm afraid (laughs) (clears throat) (sniffs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Try it again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would like to open and I'm afraid to make myself vulnerable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  What goes on inside you when you say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fear? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  But you don't look afraid... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.  Maybe you've just been unusually brave for this afternoon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, it's the use of practice... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) concealing.  I, I think, ah, it's a scary thing to make, to let other people know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) when you're feeling weak.  Oh, when you're feeling... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you say, "I"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's a scary thing when I make myself appear weak to other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Can you say, "I'm scared."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm scared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When I make my—show myself to other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm scared when I show myself to other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So then, what we—the methods that we'll need to work on is to help you to be less afraid.  To think through what the danger is, you know, feeling scared is a very basic human emotion.  It helps the species to survive.  You know, when we live in the woods, (clears throat) we have to be scared if there were animals attacking us.  So it's a very important survival—emotional reaction to danger.  It becomes problematic when we have forced false alarms.  And we see danger when there is no danger.  So one of, of the methods that we'll use is to help you get in touch with what your expectation of danger is.  And I don't think it's an intellectual, I think it's, you know, it's a very emotional kind of thing that you may not necessarily be aware of, but you know, where is the danger?  To try understand that and then to start to gradually take risks.  You have already started it today and I must say, I'm totally amazed and delighted with the way our session's been going ‘cause I thought, you would be much more reluctant to take risks in here, so you are taking the risks in here.  And I think that's great, uhmm, so this is a good stepping stone for taking the risks, starting with your father. (clears throat) You know, we need to talk about, what you really want to say, ah, in order to do that, you have to be clear in your own mind as to what you really feel... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) about you, which is not a simple feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.  No, we would say it was a simple feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.  Okay.  So getting clearer on that is, is an important first step before actually taking, taking the risk.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does that sound to you so far, we've spoken about, you know, what our goals are and what our priorities are.  And also, have this, in a general way how we're gonna work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I agree.  I agree with that I think.  Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.  So, you know, one of the, uhm, predictors of what the therapy is gonna be successful or not, has to do with the presence of three basic fact—factors in the therapy situation between the two of us.  One is that we both have to agree that we're pursuing the same goals, we're headed in the same direction.  My sense is, at this point, so far, so good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm, the second is that we both agree on how we gonna get there.  You know, to least, in the general sense, how we gonna get there being—becoming less afraid by examining what the nature of the fear is.  And then gradually taking risks to, to open up and revealing yourself more.  And I have sense that we agree on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.  And then the third thing is, the kind of the—a chemistry between the two of us ah, ah, whether our relationship—whether we both feel that our relationship is, is an open one, where uhm, we mutually understand what's going on with each other, with the lines of communication are open where, you know, I feel you—you're comfortable in working with me, and I feel comfortable in working with you and that's important, as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that was one of the things that had me a bit worried after our last session.  So I need to check with you, as to the way you—how you feel about working with me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, that's tough... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, ah, so far, you haven't yelled at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So far, you haven't made me feel foolish.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think, ah, I don't think you're going to go out in the street and tell people what we've discussed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that it will work.  I think ah, I think, I feel trust.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somewhat.  Okay, that's fair enough, I mean, there's no reason after two 45-minute sessions together, that you can feel this total sense of trust.  But it's of caution, you know, cautious trust.  And, and hopefully, you know, that, that you will feel more comfortable, uhm, about what goes on between the two of us.  And we're gonna probably, from time to time; need to check on whether this open line of communication is good.  Whether we still agree and that we're heading in that right direction.  And, and whether we continue to agree on how we're trying to get there.  Ahh, we may have to come back to this is just that, it's important from—for us to make sure that we're on the same page, so to speak... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) each step along the way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we've got a few minutes left before we end today.  And I'm wondering if there are other points or issues or questions you want to reveal... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, ahh (sighs)...  I do have this dream.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, (sighs) I guess, well, really I guess, everything is really coming to a head since my father's, you know, had been sick.  And ah, but I've been having this dream that I have a couple of times a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was wondering if it had any relevance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mentioned it the last time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.  And that's—we really didn't go into that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just wondering if that maybe had any... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.  So, what thoughts and feelings do you have when you think about this dream?  What associations do you have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do I think about it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) when I think about having it? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What it means?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (deep breath)s</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure you've given a lot of thought to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.  Well, I think that uhm, it may have something to do with ah, my feelings about myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that there is a, a person that used to be alive... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) who used to be a person inside of me that, you know, but that, person is no longer there.  It's uhm, and I don't know what to do to revive that person. (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to bring somebody back who's already dead?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (sobs) (sighs) Sorry. (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to apologize. (laughs)  But compared to you—your father?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.  My mother and uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) and my father.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wish she would have been a different kind of a person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'd say he or she?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish he would have been a different kind of a person... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My life probably would have been... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (crosstalk) like this.  It's not what's my life is, I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (sighs) Well, I don't see you as dead.  I see you as unhappy.  Uhm, and in a very strange kind of way, which you may not fully get right now, I see it was coming to life.  Do you know what I'm referring to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see it coming to life?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you coming to life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, maybe no.  I see it.  You have a little wriggle, huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little wriggle (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Legal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wriggle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it?  What I'm think.  What is a "wriggle"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Starting to come alive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aha. Uh-huh. (sniffs)  Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just starting... (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, okay.  So you know, sometimes it takes a crisis to get a person to change... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) you know, the old Chinese word for cri—for crisis, the Chinese symbol for crisis, is the same symbol for opportunity.  You know that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I haven't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it should the Chinese apparently see crisis as, as a chance for something to happen different... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) and, and people who written about crisis: personal crisis, psychologist, psychiatrist, social artist; written about this have, have kind of likened it to a person who has gone from being in a firm position with both feet firmly planted on the ground, to being destabilized on one foot, and it's a terribly precarious position.  But standing on one foot makes it a lot easy to change directions, than when you standing with two feet planted on the ground.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So uhm, at least, that's the way I see your situation right now, as a, as a crisis is upsetting and fearful and sad and everything else that's, that's going on with you.  But in a, in a long run ah, an opportunity.   And hopefully, it's not gonna be that longer run.  Ah, you know, not that, I think we're, we're not talking about years and years, before you can start seeing some change in yourself, but hopefully more, I mean, area of months.  But, no, no promises of it, you know, exactly how long, but I'm just trying a backtrack for my long run...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: .... (crosstalk) or characterization.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I—what do you think I should do that with my father, right now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (sighs).  Right now, between now and next week, it probably would be good if you start it to think about what your different feelings are about him.  Different thoughts and feelings that come up and note them down on a piece of paper.  And ah, for an effect, you know it would be even better.  Get yourself a little notebook.  I mean in a year, you're a super organized, doer-type, so I can make that suggestion that you, you get yourself a notebook.  And in the notebook keep, keep a record of whatever thoughts and feelings come up with different times.  And we can use this notebook for other kinds of things that ah, that you know, that might seem to be indicated as our work together progresses.  But for now, uhm, I don't think that's a good idea to do anything with your father.  But rather, j-just tune in to what's going on inside you, surrounding your feelings about your father and your relationship with your father. (sniffs)  Bringing your notebook ah, in your twenty's little things you can just put in your purse, as things occurred you could jot it down. (sniffs) Ah, bring it in for our session next, ah, next week and we can talk about it and we'll start there.  And then hopefully, we can get clearer as to what you can actually do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.  So I'll see you next week... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... (crosstalk) same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause) Well, I'm thinking about uhm, I suppose in particular, the way I was feeling today.  And uhm, I don't know, right now, I'm sure it's connected with what we were talking about last week.  At one point today when I was thinking about it, I could think about Friday without feeling like I have to try to remember.  But right now I'm feeling as if I'd have to try to remember.</p>

<p>Uh, (Sniff) I don't know, it's one of those things too, that I think at first today I kept thinking well, it was due to some specific thing that was happening.  And, and I don't really think so now, because uhm, well, I don't know, uhm, (Sigh, Laughs) I don't even know how to describe it, except that I found it very hard to begin school and to concentrate and to sort of care about what I was doing.  But I don't think it was just a matter of being Monday.  It might have been partly that, but uhm, I think if I'd been home, I would have had similar feelings.</p>

<p>And uhm, well, I don't know, i—, the day also started that when FDO came back, uhm, I think w—, I guess I hadn't mentioned she, on Friday before she left, tossed out that she was going to consider taking some other classes that she hadn't mentioned before.  A—, because I just said something like, good luck when you try to straighten out the classes, she had already told me about.  And uh, and then she told me about these other ones, which would mean then, she won't take the ones she told me about, and these meet 3 nights a week.</p>

<p>And uh, (Sniff) today I asked her how it had gone, and she told me.  And then I already knew certain dates we wanted her to baby-sit at night, so I went over them.  And it really, it was just simply I happen to know them right now, and I like to let her know, or anybody who would be working for us, as far ahead as possible.  And uh, but it came right on top of her talking about her courses.  And I think there was a connection in my mind, in that we have, and I did this time too, when I mentioned Saturday night, have tried to uhm, I don't know, be sort of flexible about the weekend, because uh, I know that she would prefer to be at home.  But that if she doesn't have any specific plans and if we need her, then we expect her to baby-sit for us.  Because that was part of what we had made clear at the beginning that we would want done.</p>

<p>And (Clears throat), but I don't know whether our being sort of, uhm, if you don't have anything to do, can you baby-sit, kind of attitude, has made her feel that she can make other plans.  But uhm, after I had talked about the nights we'd need her, that I know of in the next few weeks, uhm, which is all within the number of nights that we'd established we would want baby-sitting done for, she said something that made me feel as if well, she will try to accommodate us if she can.  But if she can't, well, then that's the way it is.</p>

<p>And uh, I don't know, I began to get very upset about it.  As if, well, I'd been feeling well, hesitant, or, or something about asking, being very strict with her over what we want done, because we're not paying her very much.  And she's available to work harder and be paid more, if, if we could.  And (Coughs), and I think there is something about my being uhm, well, hesitant, in the way I deal with her.  And I was thinking that I was very bossy with FMC, who's younger and then with FDO, I sort of go the other way.  And uhm, and, and, and don't establish that I'm the one in charge.  Uh, so that seemed like that might be part of it.</p>

<p>And this whole thing was sort of disturbing me this morning.  And nothing particularly happened, it's just after school I had, I had time to be there for a while before I went to the dentist.  And uh, there were a number of things I really wanted to do that would make preparation easier in the mornings.  And then there were a number, 1 or 2 things that I wanted to check in the files before I had the conferences with those particular children's parents.</p>

<p>And uh, Mrs. BBF asked if I could talk to her about one child that she knew I was going to be having a conference on soon.  And he is a problem, but I don't know exactly what's going on.  I think, it seemed to me, after talking to Mrs. BBF today, a great deal of it is, is his parents being unable to see exactly what the problem is.  And they, they can't face it, they can't see what they're doing to contribute to it.  And they uhm, keep making excuses and — MTRZ's okay right now in class, but I don't think he will be if he goes to the kind of school they want him to next year.  And then I think he'll really start acting in a very bizarre way.  And already, there are signs that would suggest, maybe he's a bit disturbed.</p>

<p>But I, I don't know, I feel very uhm, I used to be so ready to decide, that child's disturbed.  And I don't know with this one, I just feel like I really don't know what's going on with him.  And uhm, so Mrs. BBF and I were talking about  it.  And I know certain things I can say to his parents that I do feel are true, about what we're doing that seems to be working with him, which is not what they're doing.  But I don't feel I can really get through to them.  And, uh, so I don't know, it was kind of a difficult problem to be talking about.  But I really found that well, somehow, I just was uhm, distracted, feeling distracted.</p>

<p>Or uhm, (Sniff), well, I sort of feel this way now, talking about these things that were on my mind today, as if (Sniff) — because I just, when I was quiet here, when I first came in, I just have the feeling that all day I've been sort of thinking, well these must be the reasons I'm feeling this way.  But uh, I don't know, it seems like more it's well, I don't know, not exactly symptoms, but uhm — (Sniffs, Pause)  But then, the other thing I start thinking about, uh, is that (Sigh) this weekend, when we did go to PTN, uh, when we got there ve—, we were alone, as it turned out in the end.  And uhm, I was c—, really looking forward to it, because we had planned to go up with a friend of ours.  And somebody he w—, had wanted to ask up — which was the whole reason we were going up to start with — and then, they couldn't.  And I was kind of looking forward to just our being up there alone.</p>

<p>But then, uhm, we got up late on Friday, and I don't know, it was sort of a luxury, because I figured, well, the whole next day, we don't have to do anything.  And then we'll have that next night.  So I read kind of late, even after we'd gotten there.  And I had dozed some in the car, so I wasn't really feeling that sleepy, and then it was a book I'd felt like reading.  And it was a real self-indulgent kind of thing to do.  And then, uhm, I was okay the next day, but I was tired.</p>

<p>And then, that night, uhm, well, as it turned out, FSO had been getting something again.  I don't know why she's getting so many colds, but she came down with another kind.  And then she had, what I guess is croup, that night.  Or something very similar, anyway, where she couldn't uhm, well, she'd cough and would choke.  And uhm, it was kind of scary.  And eventually, we worked something out, so we could help her breathe better, or swallow, or whatever th—, it is, exactly, that happens.</p>

<p>But uh, it meant we had to be up an awful lot, and she would keep waking up and having the trouble.  And uhm, the thing we had to fill with water, so it would boil, because it was a very makeshift kind of vaporizer, had to be filled about every half-hour.  So, MSCZ stayed up for a while, and then I did.  But it was uh, practically no sleep that night.  And might be — though I got a lot of sleep last night — might be another reason why I'm feeling sort of funny today.</p>

<p>But uhm, yesterday, I was able to respond okay.  And uhm, I kept thinking, well, maybe it's because I'm up in PTN, and so I'm away from what are pressures to me.  Whether they're really there or not, I, I create them.  And up in PTN, I can kind of imagine I'm away from them.  And I thought, well maybe that's why I'm reacting better, on a day after having had practically no sleep the night before.  Because I could imagine how I would have been in PKW.  And i—, I would have felt very much sort of just dragging around, and aimless.  Unable to direct myself.</p>

<p>Uhm, although I think FSO's easier up there.  But uhm, and then the other thing that, I don't want to think it had something to do with all this.  But I, i, it must is that, uhm, when we went to bed on Saturday night, I was sort of worried about FSO.  But I didn't really anticipate what happened, because it's we've never had that happen before.  Uhm, and then I was tired and I wanted to get to sleep early, and MSCZ wanted to make love.  And it had been on my mind earlier, and it had even been on my mind as a way — not only that he would probably want it, but that uhm, I don't know, it was as if I couldn't make up my mind whether I wanted it enough or not to actually agree to do it.  And uhm, when he wanted to, I still, I guess, had him in my mind.  But my inclination was to protest and say no.  But I didn't do it in such a way that would have made him angry, and then he wouldn't have continued to ask, so I guess I didn't really mean it.</p>

<p>Anyway, eventually we did make love, and I guess what was on my mind initially was uhm, — well, we must have been talking about it Friday, of uhm — my feeling that what happened between my parents was my father attacking my mother and uhm, well, something very violent taking place, that made, that meant my mother was the victim.  And I do—, I just started thinking about how I was feeling right then, and how I felt other times.  And uhm, well, I was feeling very tense at first.  And very much that I want to keep my body very closed up in, in every way.  And that (Sigh) I, I just sort of have to lie there, all sort of curled up.  And then after a while if MSCZ can stand me being like that, I re—, I begin to relax.  But that I can't approach making love with him initially, in any kind of relaxed way.</p>

<p>And uhm, and so I was thinking, well, I wonder if I was feeling that way because of being sort of ready to defend myself against a violent attack.  And uhm, (Sigh) I don't know, I was just, I don't know if I got anywhere in thinking about it, but just sort of struck me that maybe that's what I was doing.  Uhm, and it also struck me, because MSCZ was feeling very impatient, that uhm, anytime he does, I feel more that way.  More threatened, and uh, I don't know, if he's if he's feeling quite patient, and that he just wants to sort of caress me for a while or uh, I don't know, just doesn't convey to me he's in a hurry, and, and th, then he just does seem more uhm, violent and uh, and then I seem to relax faster, or, or I don't know if I exactly relax faster, but I feel more comfortable.</p>

<p>And uhm, but then, but then the other thing that was striking me about it was, I think I mentioned this about one time recently, and it happened again this time, that he had an orgasm quite quickly.  And this time he said he didn't know why he was having a problem.  Well I don't know, because, because I suppose, both of us had thought, well, maybe it's because we haven't been making love frequently.  But uhm, he said that he hadn't, he didn't have that problem before, and just lately, he's begun to.</p>

<p>And then I began to think, well maybe it's uhm, something to do with my going from, from I do—, I don't know what words to use, but being so reluctant to make love with him.  And then, and then when I sort of, I don't know, it's almost like I switch over from being very reluctant to being aggressive.  Or, at least I thought of something you said once, about uhm, thinking my asso—, th—, approaching making love, or, or, I can't remember how you put it.  But anyway, something to do with my being very aggressive about the way I made love, or had an orgasm, or something connected, anyway, with that, that was in line with something I'd been thinking about then.  Uhm, I guess I associated it with my being so self-centered and not thinking about MSCZ.  But just thinking about the pleasure I wanted.  And uhm, once I get involved.</p>

<p>And so when, when he said that, I, I guess I was just thinking about it and I, it seemed to me maybe he's caught onto, or maybe I've been more open about being aggressive lately.  Or he's picked it up more, lately, or something so that it makes him have an orgasm earlier, almost uhm, because somehow he's feeling threatened.  I'm not sure how all that would work, but that's what I was thinking.  And uhm, and then the next day, all I could think about, because it was the beginning of the uh, deer season, and my father hasn't posted our property, so that there are a lot of hunters parked right around that, well, mostly down below the house.  But you can see the cars from the house, and then some up around it.  Uhm, you just saw a lot of people around, and, and once in a while you'd hear a gun go off.</p>

<p>And I began getting very i, involved with this, and it reminded me of the way I felt about the rabbits, because I've always felt this way about people hunting deer.  And it's one of those things where I just try to ignore what happens.  And as long as I don't, I'm not up there at that time, or if I don't see the deer strapped onto cars, then I don't think about it at the time when I know actually, if I think about it, is deer hunting season.  But uh, I don't know, I get this very — and I even wrote a theme once, for high school, uh, when we could choose any topic we wanted, on uhm, a deer being hunted and killed.  And i—, f—, I, I can't remember exactly, I, but I think it was from the deer's standpoint.  And, uhm, well, again, I, i—, as the rabbits, I feel they're very defenseless creatures, and, and that the whole thing of being hunted is a horrible experience.</p>

<p>And (Clears throat), and then when we came down yesterday, we saw 2, I think 2 separate cars, maybe 3, but one car had 2 deer anyway.  And, and another car had one, with the deer strapped on.  And uhm, (Sigh) I could have just averted my eyes, but I wanted to look.  But on the other hand, i,i, it was very distressing to me, and I don't quite know, except it's all part of this way I approach the deer, of being so defenseless, and, and —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But you did look.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Umhmm. (Silence) Uh, because that made me think of some of the things we were talking about last week, but uhm, mainly uhm — maybe the week before — of my wanting to know what was going on bef—, behind my parents' closed door.  And, and then just now, I think, also wanting to look at my father with nothing on, which he would never let me do.  Uhm, and then, and then, just getting back to thinking about uhm, what happened that night at the BFM's, that again, I, s—, I don't know what it is that I'm doing with that.  But I still feel something is hard for me to understand about it.  And uhm, (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You said earlier, that you had thought of some, about some of these matters that we were talking about on Friday and last week.  Is there anything else that you remember?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause) Well, I suppose the other thing, because it sort of occurred to me, too, and I was thinking of the way I felt, started thinking after MSCZ said he didn't know why he had the problem of having such an early orgasm, when he didn't before.  Uh, and, and then I s—, s—, wondered if, if it's because he feels I'm so aggressive, and, and I don't know, as if he's defending himself by doing it that way, so that I'm in, in effect, at fault.  Uhm, then it just made me think of, and now, when you ask that again, I think of the whole thing of uh — which again, I don't think I fully worked out — of uhm, h, how, I don't know, I, I can't quite remember it, but it's a—, I mean, it's part of my coming to the table with just my slip on.  And then, part of it is, how responsible — because I think I was feeling guilty about, uhm, something else.  And I don't think it was, m, must have been Monday, because I don't think it was the day that I ran into the boy and then said I was sorry, and then clearly was feeling guilty about something then.  And I think that had to do with not having come the day before.</p>

<p>But uhm, anyway so—, feeling somehow responsible for my father getting angry and shouting, which I think I was thinking then, anyway, as possibly being, because of what I wanted to see, or wanted to do, and that he knew it.  So he would shout and be so excited because he had to defend himself against me.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, there's another way to think about it, that it seems to me is more likely.  And that is that in fact, you did go into your parents' room.  And you must have interrupted them when they were making love.  And that you saw them in some state of being disrobed, maybe naked or at least, with some clothes on.  And that your father was very angry with you, and shouted at you, and told you to get out.  And you were very distressed, and you forgot the whole episode.  And substituted for it in your memory the episode about the rabbits and the dogs.  What you were really recreating with MW was literally, behaving in a way that made him get very angry with you.  And I suspect what your father must have said, in addition to whatever else he said, was, "How can you be so stupid?" or something of that kind.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Well, m—, it makes me think of 2 things.  One is, just what's been bothering me every since Saturday happened.  And that is, wondering well, or, at least, after I began to realize I'd done it purposely, when, why I would set it up.  And I, I guess it's sort of reenacting that relationship, I, I, I do—, I'm not sure about what you just said, because uhm, I think especially when you said you thought I must have this attitude that my father was doing something violent to my mother, uhm, I kept thinking, well, where would I get that idea?  And I kept thinking, I must have seen s—, or heard something.</p>

<p>But then I keep trying to remember back, and uhm, the only thing I kept thinking was, well could I have heard or s, something, not seen it.  Uhm, because where we lived on uhm, the house we lived in after I was 6, my parents' bedroom was next to the room I had, for quite some time, until I had a room of my own.  But there was a closet that ran for the 2 rooms between them.  So (Sniff) I don't know.  And uh, so then I think well, I must d—, well, I keep thinking I couldn't have really blotted it out that far, unless it happened when I was younger.  And that would be before mm, I gue—, well, when we lived in the other house, which is where I saw the rabbits.</p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, just now, when you were saying that, uhm, it didn't make me think, "Oh yes, I bet that happened," so much as, what I started thinking of was, uhm, (Sigh) I don't know whether you'd call it a dream, or what.  Because I can almost bring it up into my mind by will.  But it would often occur at night.  So I think it came as a dream.  Uhm, but, well, it was that — I think I told you once about it — it was that one that seemed very visual to me, or red colors.  And uhm, as if I were being absorbed into something.  Or, I don't know how I described it then. But uhm, I had it a lot anyway, when I lived in that house.  And it was disturbing to me, but — (Pause, Sigh)</p>

<p>Because the other thing I think is, if something like that happened, it would have had to happen there, because I would have never dared open my parents' doors, at least certainly I had that feeling, once we lived in the house we moved to when I was 6, which maybe  partly, because of that experience.  But uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   — n—, (Laughs) well, I'm sort of assuming now I guess, that I maybe did.  And it would make sense, but I don't remember it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, the other detail that you had a lot of trouble with and can't understand what you were up to, is your wearing your slip to the dining room table.  And most of what you thought about that had to do with what would your father think about that?  And I think what you were doing was, unwittingly, reenacting a reverse of what you yourself saw.  Not literally, but in a state of having par—, being partially disrobed, you presented yourself to your father as though it were an invitation.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Interrupting)  Except, I knew he'd get angry and couldn't stand my coming down that way.  I guess that's what —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, that would protect you, at the same time.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You know, it does occur to me, that you really didn't say what happened, at least, when you remember doing it.  Whether he actually did get angry, or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Yeah, well I had trouble then, and I still do now.  Uhm, thinking about it as something I really did, and therefore, remembering.  I me—, i—, because I think it almost as soon as I said it, I began denying, well I didn't really do it.  As if well, it was just too unbelievable.  But uh, yet, I think I must have.  And, but what I imagined his reaction would be — and, and he must have been angry — but I, I keep imagining, well, he would be furious, and I would know it.  So I can't, that's what makes me think I can't believe I did it.  And then I just find the whole thing very hard to think about.  Uhm, except I'm sure I was sent up to put something else on.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I think I must have done, I, I'm not sure of when I did this, if I did.  I can't think I would have just thought I did, and then not have.  Even though now I feel as if I'm denying it.  Uhm, but I think it must have occurred after I was already well-established as being somebody that was very difficult, and picking fights all the time, and so forth.  So I think, probably my parents would have handled it.  And I don't know if my mother had anything to do with how it was handled, or not.  But that uhm, the attitude would have been to say as little as possible.  And so I think, if I, I, I think of it more as my father not accepting it, and making it very clear, it was unacceptable, but without going into any great rage, the way he would, in turn, if I might have seen him with nothing on, or in a state of undress that he didn't want to be seen in.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well so—, I just th—, well, I was just trying to think again, of if I could have come in on my parents when they were making love.  And, and then, then the next thing I thought was, the whole thing of finding it so hard to imagine them making love, which I could imagine could come out of that.  If, if I uhm, had gone in and, and especially if my father had gotten such a violent reaction, which I can certainly imagine if I did see them.</p>

<p>And uh, and then the next thing I thought of was that — and this was on my mind too, over the weekend — but I knew this before.  Uhm, MLW and FHF are going to have a baby.  The baby's due in May, I think.  And uhm, I got a letter sometime last week, telling me.  So, it wasn't a new thought.  But this weekend, we happened to go to a church fair, and there was something that had been made that I thought would be particularly nice for FHF to have, and so I got it.  Uhm, and then my parents came over to, from PTN just for a few minutes, at one point.  And they took it back, because MLWZ and FHF were going to be in PSP.</p>

<p>And uh, then, I don't know, I just began finding it very hard to imagine their having a baby.  And, and it being uhm, almost as disturbing to me as I must have felt when my mother and father were going to have a baby, probably especially MLWZ.  Because I don't know how aware I was with FNA.  But also just, uhm, I would want to think of MLWZ and FHF making love, and then being unable to, although of course, well, you wouldn't even have to have the proof that they—, they're going to have a baby as, that they do.  But uhm, I don't know, I just find it very hard, almost the way I find it very hard to think of my parents making love.  And uh, but maybe I don't, I don't know, perhaps I felt that way about everybody in my family, I'm not sure.  (Sniff, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I, I sort of have the feeling, this, because sort of the way I'm having trouble thinking about all this now, that uhm, finding it hard to think about MLWZ and FHF, is just a way for me to find it hard to think about myself.  Or, uhm, or, I suppose, maybe if, I don't know, if I saw my parents, it would just make everything make sense.  But uhm, I don't feel (Laughs) I know I saw them.  But, but just think—, because if that happened, then I imagine I wouldn't want to think of anybody making love.  Because it could lead back to thinking of that.</p>

<p>I also, thi—, I just, I just remembered this, uh, this weekend.  I suppose, partly because of what we talked about last week.  But we were sleeping in the room in PTN that we had had (Clears throat) that time we went up for our honeymoon.  And uhm, we've slept in there other times, and I, I think, made love in there other times since then.  And I haven't, always had a, I don't know, sort of a bad feeling remembering that first night.  But this particular time, uhm, I, I couldn't tell whether it was almost as if I were willing it, the memory to come back, or just what.  But anyway, I did think more of the feelings I'd had that first night, uh, than was usual, I guess.  (Unclear) It wasn't uhm, something that had happened a lot, the last few years.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yes?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Well, I don't know.  (Laughs, Pause) Well, I don't know, I just thought of this.  That uh, I mean, I sort of heard myself saying again, because this is after, it was after that you said "Yes."  Uhm, It wasn't something that happened a lot in the last few years.  I thought well, maybe you took it a way I didn't mean it.  But then I thought, well maybe I did mean it another way, too.  Because at first, wh—, I think what it was on my mind was that feeling, or remembering that feeling of the first night, had not come back much in the last few years.  But also, we haven't made love a lot, too, so I don't know.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What I meant was, uh, describe it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Oh, the feeling?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Uhm, (Sigh, Pause) uhm, (Sigh) well, I have trouble.  Uhm, it was very unpleasant.  And then, uhm, I think I felt very scared and uh, trapped.  (Pause) I can't really recall the feeling now, except I, I think it must have been because of anticipating something awful about to happen.  And even though, I don't know, maybe now because I know something awful doesn't happen, I find it hard to think that's what I was thinking.  But I think it was.  And uhm, and, and being trapped, that it's going to have to happen.  And uh, and then all I can think of right now is feeling very angry afterwards.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You know, you said uhm, awhile ago, uh, if you had indeed seen your parents make love, if you had interrupted them, then these other things would make sense.  You remember the one time we were interrupted here?  What you felt and thought?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Interrupting) Umhmm.  (Pause) And that also makes me think of uhm, well, first I just thought, well, that I kept thinking of that only as because of the way I was thinking about you and, and so what my attitude would be.  And uhm, although now, I mean, what you've pointed out about my going to the table in my slip, again that all seems to fit in.  That uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But literally, what you assumed, you know, what you were feeling was, that we were being interrupted making love.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Quite literally.  And you wanted me to tell the man to go away, and to leave us alone.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause) Now, and it also makes me think of, I don't know whether it's really part of it, but uhm, how there have been times when I've been very fearful of MSCZ and my being interrupted.  I mean at times, when I don't know, I know I felt it, and I think sometimes I felt it when it was ridiculous to feel it.  And I guess I've always interpreted it, as well, it's another way to stall.  But it's been a real, sometimes real, I don't know, it seemed like a real fear to me then.  And uhm — (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was just thinking about sort of, from the 2 points of view, that I must have, if I did this to my parents, I felt I'd done something just dreadful, from my parents' reaction, or particularly, my father's.  And uhm, yet when I think about it from my standpoint of being afraid of being interrupted, or thinking when the person knocked here, that they're interrupting, uhm, or now, something else was, because I don't know, I, I wanted you to tell that person to go away.  So I don't know.</p>

<p>But also, it was sort of on my mind of uhm, what would they think, how could we be presentable enough, so when they finally did see us in here when you did open the door, that it wouldn't be so terrible to us.  As if something would be terrible.  And uhm, my fear of it with MSCZ is, because it would be something terrible for me.  And uhm, and then I also have been thinking about just now, uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) What would be pres—, sorry.  Go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   What?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I just wonder, what would be unpresentable?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Well, uhm, as if (Laughs) we really were making love.  Uhm, and that part, that aspect of it would be unpresentable, to be seen in the actual act.  And this is what was on my mind, too, because we were once told about uh, the mother of friends of ours, I mean it's all kind of, gets kind of complicated.  But in, in any case, it winds up it's a brother of a friend of ours — and somebody else was telling us about this, uh — and his wife were making love at one point during the day.  And they have five kids in a small apartment.  And the fellow's mother was living with them right at that point, or staying with them.  And uh, they suddenly realized there were 2 of their children watching them, and then, their, his mother had come in to find the children, and so she was watching.  And she was shocked at the whole thing, and so forth.</p>

<p>And it was kind of an amusing story then because of the context it was told in.  But uhm, now I think of it as wondering, well, I suppose in part, what was, what happened to the children?  Although I don't imagine these people getting distressed quite the way my father did.  But then I also wonder, well how did, how did the uh, couple handle it?  Wasn't it awful for them, and how could they go out afterwards and face the people who had b—, seen them.  Or, I don't know, just, just was wondering from both sides, the children seeing it and the parents being seen.  Uh —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.

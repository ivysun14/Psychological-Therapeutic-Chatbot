<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry I'm running late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry I'm running late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's okay. It's—- you know (inaudible at 00:00:35). So, I kind of moved yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yesterday? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Oh my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) It was a good decision. Yeah, we'd been planning to move today, but then work closed because there's a hurricane.</p>

<p>[00:01:04]</p>

<p>So I was talking to my landlord about to, you know, nail down the specifics of his unreasonable demands because he's not very clear in e-mails at all. He often gives you the impression that he has not, in fact, been reading your e-mails which, now that I've talked to him, I realize is probably the case because he does not, in fact, listen to anything I say. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this the new one or the old one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The old one. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [That's good]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and you know, he was upset about James having been there, and so I was just like "Fine, we'll just leave." So I got half of my stuff, which is one-quarter of the total stuff. Filled up a moving van and took it on over and unpacked it. It's good. I didn't start packing until yesterday morning, also. </p>

<p>[00:02:04]</p>

<p>I did most of the packing, and James did most of the carrying. It's been a hard week, just been really hard. He has a grant proposal due on Friday for the project that would fund him for the next year or two (inaudible at 00:02:31) haven't had a chance to work on that. Showing the apartment has just been a huge pain in the ass, and he's been doing most of that. (pause) </p>

<p>I'm just really tired. I've been working really hard and, you know, it's physically exhausting work. Like my body will adjust to it over time, but like one of my knees is getting stiff. It's like I'm on my feet that much.</p>

<p>[00:03:05]</p>

<p>Because basically you're just running all day. Well, for safety reasons you're really not allowed to run, but you're just going all the time. And that's fine, that's good. I knew that it would be like that, and that's okay. I'm just really tired. So I have today off [which is good].</p>

<p>And then I went to church on Sunday. That was really nice, except that there was a—- church was really good, and there was kind of a social hour afterwards. One of the priests is leaving, so they're saying goodbye to her. I hate those things. I hate them. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:04:07]</p>

<p>You know, it's kind of hard to get to know people at this church, and I hate standing in a crowd finding people to talk to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've gotten better at it, such that I don't think like my overwhelming panic shows on my face, but it's not easy. I was talking to one man who's probably early 50s. I was one of the ladies' (inaudible at 00:04:44) ministers, carrying the torch and all that, which is something that I really enjoy doing. He was one too. He's this very kind of goofy person. I said "So, what do you do?" He said "I work for Blue Cross Blue Shield," and I said "Oh, they're my health care providers. Lucky you."</p>

<p>[00:05:08]</p>

<p>Turns out he works at getting patients admitted to mental health facilities. I was like "Oh, I know from personal experience that's really good work." And he was just like "Huhhhh" and he just kind of booked it out of there. (pause) And he's not a very smart person, and I don't actually care for him very much, and I don't need his good opinion, but that does not mean that he doesn't get to hurt me. Like really hurt me. </p>

<p>[00:06:02]</p>

<p>So then I come home, and James is just at the end of his rope. He's just so upset. (pause) You know, he's so upset and I'm so upset. He needs me to take a more active role than I have been previously, which is fine. It's what I had been expecting. It's just that James has been taking the lead, so I just let him do that. Then suddenly it's "Oh, you haven't been doing this all along." I think he was explicitly trying not to do that, but it didn't really work very well. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:07:01]</p>

<p>I'm just so tired, and I'd been working all day, and then went right to church, and then came right home, and he was a disaster. (pause) So I cut myself all up one arm, and James just started sobbing. Just sobbing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was he in another room when you did it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But I felt better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:08:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday was kind of just more of the same. It was better when we actually got to the apartment. It's a really nice apartment. I'm really excited not to be living with roommates anymore. It's like once we left, both of us were like "Okay, thank goodness, I hated those people." (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, [I like Wes (sp?)]. I'm starting to actually hate Eric (ph), which is very scary for me. I don't hate people usually. (pause) You know, the things I found likeable I find not so likeable. The things I found kind of naïve, I can say "Well, I can have compassion for you in this situation that you're in, you don't realize you need compassion, but that's kind of running out." (pause)</p>

<p>[00:09:20]</p>

<p>He's just not a very nice person. He's not good to other people. I just don't have much use for him. I'm glad we have this apartment, but there's so much work to do still. (pause) James and I are both hurting so much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:10:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's breaking his heart that he can't make me better, that he can't take good enough care of me to make me better. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I imagine is hard for you to bear. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:11:14]</p>

<p>Because I have to not lie to him, you know. (pause) I have to say (inaudible at 00:11:26), and I can't do that. But I also really do not want to—- I don't want—- (pause) I can't be as bad as I am around him, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry? Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:12:20]</p>

<p>And I—- (pause) He said recently—- I don't know what the conversation around it was—- he asked me like "So are you feeling really bad at this specific moment in time?" and I was like "Yeah." He's like "Wow, you are really good at hiding that you're doing badly." I said "Yes, I am really really good at it." (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why did you cut up your shoulder (inaudible at 00:13:23)?</p>

<p>[00:13:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a very good question. (pause) I guess because part of me wanted it to be more visible, but of course it's long-sleeve season actually. (pause) Sort of a blank slate (inaudible at 00:14:02). </p>

<p>[00:14:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also imagine it was closer to your throat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was my overwhelming thought. (pause) Yeah. (pause) [This is kind of an] acceptable damage. (pause) Or more acceptable. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a way you can get yourself [okay with] (inaudible)? </p>

<p>[00:15:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, [and that other people are okay with it]. I mean, I know [I'm okay. It doesn't] necessitate a hospital visit. That's the last thing [I need right now]. (pause) [And they want me to be at work] on Sunday. I hate that. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:16:17]</p>

<p>I wasn't absolutely on my A-game, but—- not my co-workers, customers. My co-workers are almost without exception amazingly patient with me. I move too fast and mess things up. (pause) Because I don't have the muscle memory yet to do everything right. (pause) </p>

<p>But yeah. (pause) (inaudible at 00:16:58) (pause) Bad stuff happens, you know. </p>

<p>[00:17:13]</p>

<p>I know that's part of my job. I don't think (inaudible at 00:17:18). (pause) And the church thing really got to me. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I'll bet the church thing really got to you. [And the feeling of James's to not sort of be able to take care of you].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, James being so angry and there's nobody else around but me. Not even that he's directing his anger at me, it's just that he's upset and angry and I'm in the room and I feel like it's on me.</p>

<p>[00:18:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And he knows that I feel this way, so that chokes him up and it's not fair to him. But I get so scared and I feel so guilty. (pause) </p>

<p>[00:19:35]</p>

<p>It's just hurting really, really, really badly and he couldn't do anything about it, [that he had to be there for that]. (pause) I think he's only cried like that once or twice [since I've known him]. (pause). What else am I going to do? (crying) (pause) </p>

<p>[00:20:43]</p>

<p>People can't tell that I'm working really hard just to be standing there holding a glass of wine and talking to them, or just to be wherever I am. I work really hard. (pause) James is also working incredibly hard. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (long pause)</p>

<p>[00:22:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [And nobody can make it better]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (long pause) </p>

<p>[00:23:25]</p>

<p>And I know that the easy ways I have to cope are not good for me in the long run. I'm not interested in developing an alcohol dependence. [That's a] bad road. You cannot do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I totally see how it happens. It could happen very easily. (pause) I already have this thing where I cut myself, and I'm running out of body space—- I mean, not really, but getting there. (long pause)</p>

<p>[00:24:58]</p>

<p>[And this whole internal war], it just doesn't register with people. Like shouldn't Wes (sp?) have seen me really upset when I told them basically most of what's going on with me, and it's like they don't—- (pause) there's no space for that concept in their lives. (pause) Yeah. This guy at church was clearly terrified that I was going to go up to him and bother him in some way. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:25:59]</p>

<p>I can see where he's coming from but that doesn't make it okay. (pause) I can't—- (pause) I can't talk about the most important things—- not the most important things, but the things that are overwhelmingly front and center of my attention. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you could [use a little help bearing what] really hurts you the most. </p>

<p>[00:27:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [I was telling people that] would help. I don't know it would help [the bearing part] but at least I wouldn't be lying all the time. (pause) At least I could feel like my presence (inaudible at 00:27:33). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think you also have hopes that get dashed like with the guy at church, not that you're going to sit there and tell him everything, but that, you know, in a small kind of distal way that he would be understanding and supportive.</p>

<p>[00:28:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's his fucking job, so you might hope so. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you also get angry if people don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Shockingly, yes. Yes, I do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or I think with Eric (ph) and Wes (sp?) or with James. I know you know at one level, James is doing absolutely 150 percent best that he can, and then at another level it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think some of what's hard for you is when you know you're being -quote- unreasonable like that.</p>

<p>[00:29:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or when I know that people are working as hard as they can to support me, and want to support me, and think they are supporting me, but what I need is just so far outside what people can do. I don't even know what it is most of the time, and I just—- yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I imagine there's another way in which you feel like, you know, from a very different perspective, you're just hurting and someone's just there, and they could be helping and they weren't. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:30:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so. I am a lot more used to the idea that nobody can help me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm actually not so sure. I mean, I know it's very familiar. In that sense, I agree. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I still keep hoping.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm not so sure it's the kind of thing you genuinely desensitize to. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:31:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: At (inaudible), I'm not exactly panicking, but sort of panicking, that in between times I see you I am doing this wrong. (chuckles) I worry that you despise me, et cetera.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmmmm. What do you mean "et cetera"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (voices overlapping) Oh, more just worrying that you despise me, more despising myself. Feeling as though I am—- just feel stupid in here. I feel like I'm missing things that I'm not—- (pause) You know, or even I'll think about something and then suddenly the picture will just kind of snap into place and I'll say oh, that's what that is, but that's not happening in here.</p>

<p>[00:32:14]</p>

<p>Or something that was clear in here and as soon as I start talking to you, I just get bogged down and I can't talk about it or even remember what it is sometimes. (pause) It's almost refreshing in the last couple of days that things have been so very bad because they're bad in a clear way. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmmmm. Rather than the kind of muddle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) One of my favorite books in high school was A Room With a View. I don't know if you've seen the movie or read the book. It was a good movie [and a book]. </p>

<p>[00:33:10]</p>

<p>It's E. M. Forster. It's about class and how that's terrible and freeing ourselves from the constraints of society. But the kind of figurehead of wisdom is always saying (inaudible at 00:33:36), people do bad things to each other because they just can't model [what they're thinking] and aren't true to themselves, and don't know what they want, and don't know how to ask for it. (long pause) </p>

<p>[00:34:31]</p>

<p>I'm so glad to be moving into our own apartment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When will you start sleeping there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, we did last night. (laughter) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, we were going to get out. (laughter) Yeah, it was good. We had dinner over there because every place around is closed and we don't have Internet yet so we couldn't look up anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) We hadn't brought any of the—- we brought some of the kitchen stuff, but none of the utensils or plates, so we made dinner using James's pocketknife. And at the very end of the evening, we were like desperately searching for something to eat the ice cream with. I remembered that we had my great-grandmother's silverware silver. (laughter)</p>

<p>[00:35:35]</p>

<p>It was good, it was good. [That's why we go] camping. Trains me for exactly that situation. Like I can totally make four dishes and eat with just a pocketknife. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: A pocketknife instead of a silver spoon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) But things got better once we were there. (pause) Yeah. I feel slightly able to do some more. I'm just so tired, like physically tired. It's so weird. My arms feel like they're made of jelly. Part of that is work, and part of it, I think, is just being so sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Depression is exhausting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>[00:36:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Very exhausting]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the whole day before and that day, and it's just like, you know, just put it away. If it hurts this bad, just put it away. You can't handle it right now. I don't know (inaudible at 00:36:48). (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The therapy and the muddle are pretty exhausting. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They are. (pause) (laughter) It's like when I started running in college. I don't know how much we've talked about sports for me. Well—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:37:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were a big part of the way that school was pretty fucked up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>[00:37:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And both of my siblings are incredibly gifted athletes, but I'm less so. Actually, I think I'm decent, I'm just not a prodigy in the way that they are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did they play?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Amanda played soccer in high school and then swam in high school and college. She had like a bunch of concussions from soccer, so they made her stop doing a contact sport.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From getting hit with the ball? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Amanda had a concussion playing spoons once. (laughter) She just—- we do, in all fairness, play full contact spoons. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) I guess so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, you take one spoon and you throw the rest up and down the hall in this game. It's the kind of game where like you—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [What is the]—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: You try and get four in a row. When you get four in a row, you grab a spoon. It's like musical chairs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>[00:38:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) So, yeah, she swam. Jason played lacrosse and is a sailor now. He sailed in high school. And we had to do kind of a little bit of a bunch of different sports for like six weeks at a time in lower school, and I was always the last person picked. Always. All the sixth graders are in JV, all the eighth graders are in varsity. In seventh grade there was me and two other girls on JV. All the other girls were on varsity, and the two other girls in JV were best friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, awesome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) So I decided I needed to exercise in college, so I decided to take up running. Periodically I would do this until I'd decide, you know, I just fucking hate running and I'm not going to do it. Just no more.</p>

<p>[00:39:40]</p>

<p>I keep thinking I'm going to hit the place where it starts to be fun. It's never fun. It always just sucks. (chuckles) It's nice to be done with it, but—- so, you know, following my sister's example, I would just run every day until I threw up, and then I would kind of say well, I guess I can walk for a little bit, and then I would start running again. Every day for like a month. </p>

<p>And then I had to stop running because I had injured my feet because you're not supposed to run every day. The point being, I just thought—- (pause) But that was what running was supposed to be, that you go until you're so sick that you can't move anymore, every day.</p>

<p>[00:40:40]</p>

<p>So this is sort of like that, except that I don't have the throwing up to tell me when I can take a break, and I can't actually take a break. There's no way to take a break. (pause) </p>

<p>That's the nice thing about having a car. [I don't have to walk]. People have stopped giving me shit about exercise, or my doctor anyway. Other people suggest that I exercise, then I think about the running story. (chuckles) (pause)</p>

<p>[00:41:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I actually think there is some way that you want me to help you bear how awful things have been, and that I'm not doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course there is. (pause) But I want you to, but I'm not expecting you to. (pause) I know you're doing what you can. I know that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there particular things you also [want me to do]? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) [Just be nice]. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:42:37]</p>

<p>But nobody can, and I don't know. (pause) (sniffling) So another thing they say about AA even in jest is that nobody knows how it works. Like nobody. It shouldn't work (inaudible at 00:43:11) from a fairly skeptical perspective doesn't like the sorts of clichés that I (inaudible at 00:43:35). But yeah, it works. So I think, well, I don't have to know how it works. I just have to keep showing [and hope it will work]. </p>

<p>[00:43:37]</p>

<p>And sometimes it does, is the thing. I do feel better, and I don't know how that happens, but sometimes I do. So I don't know what I want you to do. (pause) I guess it's just better than the alternative. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess—- (pause) Yeah. I'm asking you in part because in a straightforward way, I want to be helpful. But I'm asking more because I think, you know, whatever fantasies you might have about how I could help, or how you want me to help, or even how I ought to be helping are reflected.</p>

<p>[00:44:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, okay. (sniffling) No, that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:45:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I was just going to say, I just imagine you'll say something that will make me feel better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well. Have a good day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

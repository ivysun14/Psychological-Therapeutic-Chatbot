<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a month and a half ago. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I wanted to know if they were still available on your schedule. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Alright. Yeah, in the next week we're on to Monday and Wednesday and we'll see how that goes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I'm also taking a class in the fall and I don't remember if it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Wednesday or if it's Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'll have to find out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if it's Monday/Wednesday we can look.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um because it would finish at like 5:30. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, okay. I think (pause) uh, let me...you could let me know today or tomorrow about that. It occurs to me that I can probably, now that I think more about it...I can actually probably arrange the Thursday. I may be able to give Lucy a later time on...the later time that we're talking about on Wednesday instead...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...because I think she wants like later. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, basically so if I know whether you want Wednesday or Thursday I can at least try to arrange that, like okay...what I'm actually saying is Wednesday I can definitely do. I may also be able to arrange Thursday is Wednesday is not good. So that's what I'm saying. [0:01:46.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright. (pause) So, I don't know, I've been thinking about a bunch of things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (pause) so one of them um...so my friend Zoe um is (inaudible at 00:02:24].5) was uh in a...there was a fire in her apartment. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I told you that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um the other thing is that I really, really hate Zoe's boyfriend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I knew that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, and so somehow—I can't remember—like somehow her crappy boyfriend came up and also I was talking to some friends and like also that she had been in this fire—uh, one of my friends was like oh, you didn't, ya know...you didn't tell me. I didn't know about this. (inaudible at 00:03:04].7) met Zoe before. And when I was telling about it, I'm like wow. I really hate her boyfriend. Um, and I think one of the reasons why is that I can't like...it's almost impossible for me to see her and not see him. So, and I'm not entirely sure like...so last time I visited her was, ya know, was a while ago, 4 years ago, and it was partially his. I was just so angry at him for...like I was (inaudible [00:03:52].5) like in a vague way and then I got in on Sunday morning, like he was already drinking and you know like 10, and also pretty clearly had been like, probably like sneaking drinks. So on Friday we I think Zoe purchased a 6-pack of beer. She's like oh yeah (inaudible [00:04:19].1) some and I purchased a 6-pack for her as well, and then Sunday morning they were down to like 4 beers. I'm like I had 1 or 2, Zoe had 1 or 2 and what the fuck. And she said yeah, he often drinks some wine with like (inaudible [00:04:38].6). Um, and so that was kind of intense conversation. Well, at first I was like, I was trying to do...(inaudible [00:04:46].8) was like needing to leave right now or I'm gonna kill your boyfriend. (inaudible [00:04:52].6) around and then (inaudible [00:04:57].9) I was just trying to be calm but I can't believe he's drinking in the morning like it's just normal. He sucks. And her thing was is that she felt like she couldn't break up with him because they'd been together too long. Like if she ever broke up with him, like, ya know, (inaudible at 00:05:18].4) and now it was too late. And she also said it was really hard and people ragged on him because like she felt (inaudible [00:05:31].0) about it and didn't know so I told her that I would, ya know, try not to insult her boyfriend. Um, and after the fire uh, he was like very...he felt very guilty for not having gone for a fire extinguisher which he saw and thought about but didn't...like I think he would have had to either walk past what was burning or like...it was kind of weird, but he saw the extinguisher but didn't use it and felt really bad about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did that relate to her getting burned, how she was burned? [0:06:15.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you told me this. I just couldn't remember...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What did happen is that the fire alarm went off. He got up and looked in the halls to see what the heck was going on and was like oh, I see a fire. Like and he also I guess saw the fire at the end of the hall...I mean the fire extinguisher at the end of the hall. And what he did is that he basically yelled for her to get up and then sort of ran down the stairs. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She had been in the bedroom where he just came from. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so she's like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think she had woken up. She sleeps really, really heavily. Um, so he gets to the door and he yelled, and then she came after him and I think he was like maybe like a half a flight of stairs ahead of her and so she's burned over her back and her hair caught on fire and he was barely burned. He had very minor burns. He was just further ahead of her. Um, and I also (inaudible at 00:07:23].8) like get her out of bed. Like, when she was telling me...or her parents told me, and then she was telling me...I'm kinda like why. It sounds like he saw a fire, told you and ran. And didn't like...I don't know, grab you. Like I understand the situation but I would be saying like you're an asshole. Why didn't you grab your girlfriend? Especially since you know that she's sleep heavily and like all these things. Um, and he was like oh, I should have gone for the fire extinguisher blah, blah, blah, and Zoe had said that she didn't want to talk about like what he could or could not have done because it already happened. So she said, ya know...she said I don't want to listen to him angst about it and you can say whatever. I don't want to rehash of what happened. I'm like, alright. Like that seems fair. Um, but I was talking to her recently and she's gonna go to a conference for (inaudible [00:08:35].7) virus and so we were kind of talking about things that she could do, like it's in the area so she was asking me about it, and it just made me really angry like all over again. I hate your boyfriend. And I can never...I haven't talked to her or seen her as much because he's always there. Like he visits her family at Christmas and Thanksgiving. Um, and (inaudible [00:09:15].7) she's there, he's there. Um, but I try to be like oh, you're in the City for a day trip. He always wants to come with her. And like one time...I had convinced her to do it one time and he still came with her. Like she stayed in a motel with me but he stayed with one of his cousins. And I just feel like I can never just...like I just want to see her and it's hard in general to (inaudible [00:09:48].6) your boyfriend, but I'm also like I don't understand why you're attached at the hip when you agreed he's kind of a jerk. So she, you know me, (inaudible [00:09:59].0), her family does a trip every summer like so she's with me right now and uh, so she was like oh, so I'm going to be coming up and seeing you. But I'm pretty sure that it's going to be her and her boyfriend (inaudible at 00:10:18].0). Like community visit. (sighs) I actually haven't...I don't...I haven't seen her boyfriend since the fire, so I think maybe he wasn't there the last Christmas. I just (inaudible [00:10:30].8). (sighs) It just (pause) like I hadn't really thought about how we, I don't know, have been a little more distant. Or I...like you know she used to be like definitely my best friend, be my closest friend. She's been (inaudible [00:11:01].3) the longest. Um, and we're both bad at keeping in touch, but as I was thinking about it I was thinking like what part of the issue is that. But I also want to see my friends in person and I don't like calling as much and I find seeing her in person super frustrating. Like, I don't know. And also what depresses me is that I think she's probably at this point...because she (inaudible [00:11:34].8) cigarette burns she's probably not gonna break up with him. Like she said one reason she doesn't break up with him is she's like, ya know, dating's so hard, blah, blah, blah. Maybe I should work on the relationship I already have cuz I won't be able to find a new one. And I think that felt that she's not...she says she's not attractive enough, so I feel like having severe burns is not like, she's gonna not want to date even more. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like make her less confident of her appearance? [0:12:17.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though like...ya know, I don't know. Like they're not visible when she's dressed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but like (inaudible [00:12:34].5) boyfriend, so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure what to say, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Like (pause) I think...I mean I'm like well...I mean...I sort of feel like I feel stuck because I don't think there is any work to go with that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: One thing that occurs to me is whether (pause) um (pause) your sadness and frustration with I guess her denial about him or her disinterest in leaving him resonates at all for you with stuff with [inaudible]? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it does. Also with um (inaudible [00:14:32].9) Elliott that I dated for quite a long time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And at the end of our relationship like probably for 2 years I had this well, I was like well I know I don't want to get married and I don't want to have kids with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't like the longer we date the more that (pause)...I don't know I felt like the longer we were dating the more it seemed like we should be doing something to go to the next level and doing something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, um, he's like 10 years older than I am. So when I was dating him he was, ya know, much more at the stage of wanting to like his friends had kids...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know, etcetera, and I'm just like I'm not doing that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [0:15:29.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet...although he never pressured me about it. Um, there was this really like weird moment where...so he's Jewish, not religious, his parents are Jewish, not religious...but they really wanted him to marry someone who's Jewish, and out of nowhere his dad told him that he could get married to me even though I wasn't Jewish. I don't know it was just like, wait! (laughs) (inaudible [00:15:59].8) would be his reaction as well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...cuz it's like they were like, ya know, (inaudible [00:16:03].5) agrees getting on the bus cuz helps (inaudible [00:16:09].8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, I was like well, good, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...oh God. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, so I got your dad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know! (pause) It was just really, I mean it was really just weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And also he has two younger brothers. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like his parents have given up on them (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? Like, um, yeah it was...and I just...they made it (inaudible [00:16:41].1) and I was like alright, that sounds like...I feel like a wedding is slowly being arranged around me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. [0:16:52.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ya broke up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was really hard. Um, cuz I had dated him for like 8 years. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember it had been a while. I don't remember you sort of talking much about the breakup or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a weird breakup in that I kind of processed it (inaudible [00:17:24].8) and then told him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, and...I don't know. Like I really sort of...and I said a lot of like (inaudible [00:17:39].6) reasons. I don't want to talk to you for 6 months. Or I don't remember, it was like a chunk of time because I thought like...I thought we needed a break, the habit of talking to each other and being (inaudible [00:17:54].5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Had you guys been living together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I spent like sometimes weekends at his house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And like we just spent the weekend together. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And ya know (inaudible [00:18:10].5) reminds me a lot of Elliott. It's just that (sighs) I think...my friends are kind of like why are you dating this guy? Well he's an okay guy but like, what are you doing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like well, I don't know. And I felt like I didn't have a good reason to break up with him. Like it's my fault ya know. Mm...like I like him but there are things he does that annoy me but ya know (pause) I mean like riding to work when he would...if I told him he had upset me he would say I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and work really hard to fix it for a month and then go right back to being (inaudible [00:18:59].7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (inaudible [00:19:02].5) I had done this and let me tell you he's not going to stop and it sucks. You just need to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...go. Um, (pause) yeah, also just kind of weird to me that like in general, ya know, she's a smart, intelligent, together woman and she's like her career...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...she's like perfectly...(inaudible [00:19:45].9) exerting control and control like, ya know, making decisions (inaudible [00:19:52].5) do whatever. But it...like with her boyfriend it's just...I don't know. She just doesn't (pause). She's just really stuck like, which is like (inaudible at 00:20:08].3) is that while she's advancing in all these other things—her career, her life and her other things—she's sort of stuck in this weird rut with her boyfriend. And I knew that emotions don't work like that. Ya know this is sort of like, like you are this smart, intelligent, awesome, successful woman and you're boyfriend's a loser who doesn't have a job and still just (inaudible [00:20:37].5) his parents and takes her money and is an alcoholic and all these other things. Um, I feel like, I think I know a...probably like a dozen women that are my age who are these awesome, successful women with really crappy boyfriends and husbands. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:20:56.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to say why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like why are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! And like they even acknowledge that their husband or their partner's kind of crappy but they're like well, but (pause) ya know he does that or he's this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like they make excuses for them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! And like (pause) I mean ya know it's not (inaudible at 00:21:39].0) it's just ya know...I don't really know. Like I'm painfully aware of that, but (pause) (sighs). Like I really...I mean when I (inaudible [00:21:59].8) which is not like possible is to know what is the thing that (inaudible [00:22:07].3) this relationship (inaudible at 00:22:08].4). Like is there something I could do that would like...I don't even know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a way you could make her see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Or be like no, I'd totally help you move out or find a partner, just like I'm like what is the barrier, a barrier that I can do something about. Um, when in reality it's like...I mean it's not about her finding a place or any of those things. Because, ya know, she has the money, ya know, to afford an apartment, um, etcetera, etcetera. Like it's not all the structural stuff. It's whatever (inaudible [00:22:53].6) with him. (pause) It's also my least favorite couple, uh, one of my least favorite couple of things is when someone is in a relationship and you can't see what one sees in the other. Like because that doesn't always apply (inaudible [00:23:33].0)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and like...I don't know. For some reason like it's not (inaudible [00:23:44].2) and I find it slightly creepy because I feel like why can't you separate. It's like (inaudible at 00:23:54].7) I don't. You are separate people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't always want to talk to you as a unit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) So you're pretty helpless all around? [0:25:19.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And I also, like I don't (pause)...I just do not feel great about kind of pulling back because she's in this relationship. Um, but there was a time when like she could use an extra friend...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and...I don't know. Like I just...I didn't really decide it but I just haven't...I just always have like 3 reasons and an excuse why I haven't called or haven't whatever. And when we do talk what's funny is it always feels like—and not because (inaudible at 00:26:34].3)—it just always feels like I just talked to her. It feels very, I don't know, like I don't feel like oh, I haven't talked to you in a year. It's like oh, blah, blah, blah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sort of pick up...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, the only drawback would be just (inaudible at 00:26:54].8) in January or February. I was trying to talk to her about possible layoffs and she said like well, (inaudible at 00:27:07].9) the devil's advocate. I mean it's not probably going to happen and etcetera, etcetera. And I was really upset. I don't care. I don't like devil's advocate game...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I realize it's like oh, I think that either she's forgotten that I hate devil's advocate game. Like we haven't talked enough in a while that like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...either you kind of forgotten that or we're not picking up each other's like conversational signals, whatever. Um, (inaudible at 00:27:55].7) (A) really upset that (inaudible [00:27:59].7). I was upset that my friend...I feel like she was blowing me off in saying like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...(inaudible at 00:28:04].2) and crazy and I was like fuck! Should be better friends than to have this kind of a communication and pratfall. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (inaudible at 00:28:20].8) not want to talk to her again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, which is also frustrating. Like I've been thinking like I should call her, I should call her for the last couple of weeks. So it's kind (inaudible at 00:28:33].5) also it reminded me that (inaudible at 00:28:42].2) was very nice except the hard part that I don't want to see you with the boyfriend. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you're kind of also annoyed with her, and these other friends of yours for like not ditching their lousy boyfriends and husbands? I mean (pause) you wind up having to be sad for them. You wind up frustrated because you can't do anything about it. Half the time you have to deal with them because they can't do anything as individuals, only as units. That's pretty annoying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also you feel bad for them and that's what a lot more of your sort of focus is on. Like feeling bad for them and wanting to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...do something about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's (inaudible at 00:29:49].6) pissed. Like I'm, like upset. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And partly I don't know. And part of it is sort of having a repetitive conversation of your boyfriend really sucks. Yes he does. Okay, I don't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:30:06].6). I don't know really what else to...like I don't know like I'm tired of if you agree that he sucks, then I don't know. Like I'm like...do I not....like I feel like I sort of want my friend to stop complaining or stop agreeing or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's just...it's just so...having a conversation with someone about how their partner is crappy and then having...and with her partner like attached to her hip for 2 hours. It just feels (pause)...it's just like a classic mistake and it sounds like you just said that your angry at how he's a jerk and now we're going to spend 3 hours with him silently on the sofa right next to you. Like can I have one or the other (inaudible at 00:31:23].7). I don't know. I feel kind of weirdly, sometimes really drawn into some kind of...like are they just (inaudible at 00:31:34].3) and then like kind of that and then just go back to their partner. Like I feel like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're kind of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I'm really involved in this kind of weird tangential way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. (pause) These tug of wars are like an enabling thing that they can go back to you and then...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that kind of thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it does also make me think about I mean how a couple friends asked afterwards like if they had done anything would it have helped and I think the answer is probably not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:32:36.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like (pause) I wasn't going to get out of that because someone else said this really sucks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, like he was really good here afterwards...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but like I don't think (inaudible at 00:32:52].9) the other way or it wouldn't have (inaudible at 00:32:59].1). So that's frustrating to sort of like want to be like blah, blah, blah except I'm pretty sure it won't do anything, and I think yeah why it won't do anything but (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you been dating much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not at all. It did...I don't know...2 years ago a...I've done two speed-dating events which ended one it was no (inaudible [00:33:59].3) and one sort of (pause) there were (inaudible [00:34:08].9) like we were going (inaudible at 00:34:08].8)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I remember that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah. And it sort of didn't really go romantically or sexually but it did go like you're awesome, which, ya know (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:34:43].3) marry. Is this okay? Are you (inaudible at 00:34:46].3) </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm like...I don't...I don't think about it a lot. Like I do sometimes but I don't like spend time (inaudible at 00:35:03].2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you just want to get occasionally like (inaudible at 00:35:13].0) I would want to do a partner. I'm like hmm. It would be nice to be with someone but like (inaudible at 00:35:25].8). But I don't like...I don't sit around feeling bad about it. Um, I probably do sit around sometimes thinking...I mean not fearing...am I feeling okay not dating because I'm too scared to date (inaudible at 00:35:53].0). Like I feel like shouldn't I feel...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible at 00:35:57].5) kidding about being upset about this more often. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I think part of it's cuz Ashby is so obsessed with dating someone... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that periodically I'm like, I don't know. I really don't feel that way...at all. But I've never felt that way. I don't even...like not since high school. And I was acting like oh my God I have to be dating someone. I have to get married. I have to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm a failure if I'm not dating someone. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think it's that you care about dating somebody? Or do you think this is, ya know...(inaudible [00:37:38].3) that much. [0:37:42.1] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like it feels more like I'm just (inaudible at 00:37:47].3). Um, the one thing I do (inaudible at 00:37:59].4) is I'm like mmm, um I haven't been...I just haven't gone to um like (inaudible at 00:38:07].4) parties or things like that in a while and actually (inaudible [00:38:17].2) and I haven't really played at them either and it's sort like mmm...I mean I like sex, so I guess sometimes I question myself like why aren't you going out and getting some casual sex if you wanted to? But like I don't...I don't want to say I don't really feel like it. I mean definitely, I definitely had a...like very strongly felt for a while that I was really scared of dating again...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and it's just...it's, ya know (inaudible [00:39:00].5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In effect. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If they just (inaudible at 00:39:07].6). And I don't feel that way. Like I don't feel scared so much as...I don't know...I guess it's not really a life...it's not really a goal. I guess if that makes sense. So some people I know really like (inaudible at 00:39:42].3). They really are just like I want to do this. It's really important. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I want to say mm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:39:49].5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel that way...I mean it's not the way I want (inaudible at 00:40:04].2) like I don't feel like I totally...if I die unmarried that's fine. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, the only thing like I think about right now is I kind of want... there's another theme of wanting a kid and I'm like wow, we're getting kind of...eggs are getting old. We're just kind of like being (inaudible at 00:40:28].0) being an old parent. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I don't want a kid right now. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like I'm (inaudible at 00:40:39].9) right now but what kind of frustrates me is I'm like, so it's like it's slightly time related regardless of how I feel about it. There's just a point where it's like well, (inaudible [00:40:53].5). And I'm kind of upset about that but I also don't want to go have a baby. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a couple people I know has been (inaudible [00:41:12].3) single parenthood, which is fine. Um, I really don't know. And I think I in some ways would be not as happy but I would be totally satisfied if like my brothers might have kids and I was able to be their aunt...like if I shared a house with like a friend of the kids that that would be very satisfying. (inaudible at 00:41:51].6) I want to experience being pregnant and having (inaudible at 00:42:01].8) a child but, then you'd have a kid. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:42:05].8)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I was like oh that's stupid. I can't do anything with it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're gonna stop for now. Next week Monday and Wednesday. [0:42:33.6] </p>

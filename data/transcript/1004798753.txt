<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(inaudible at 00:00:15)</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Last we spoke, I started talking about how (PAUSE) like my mom has, like my mom was very concerned about raising mixed race kids. And like (PAUSE) both weirdly took the heat for it from other people... I don't know. So, in some ways, like some people reaction to my parents and our family had been symbolic. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>So when my parents were first married and like we were little the high (ph) people used to come up to her a lot to talk to them because like (inaudible at 00:01:11) culture and religion and one of the things they think is very important is interracial marriage and mixed race people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (PAUSE) like my mom mentioned this, you know, at one time and she was still clearly like, you know, twenty years later annoyed about it. And then, there are people who were like, "Well, interracial relationships are okay but, you know, their children will always be like the children will be so horribly teased or whatever." [00:01:59]</p>

<p>And then sort of the like, "How can a white woman raise black children? Are we black children or are we magic rainbow babies?" Just like stuff. (PAUSE) So (inaudible) my mom didn't say it, like did not bring up when we were younger. Or like, the one thing I can kind of remember her getting at is that, like one time when I was younger... so (inaudible) Santa Lucia Festival.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:02:39)</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's this thing called the Santa Lucia Festival (ph) and so what happens is girls wear like these long white dresses and a crown of like evergreen and there are like candles.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Candles on it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So this was clearly amusing. Like this was super amusing to me. I was always really into it and I had, I got one year... They stopped using real candles mostly. But it was like battery operated. [00:03:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you still light them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They'd be on fire.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My mom remembers this from when she was a kid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) And like also the crown was like actual like tree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Sounds like a great idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds really cool looking but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was like, "Mom why did you?" And she was just like, "That's what we did." So I had this battery operated crown and I really loved it and I was super into it and then our Christmas books... Like some of them were these Finnish books that my mom had like handwritten the translations. Like when we were really young she would just read it to us and at some point, she sort of wrote in translations so that we could read them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:03:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can't remember who the author is but like they were just these super traditional Finnish like books about like Finnish traditional Christmas stuff and like all these things. [00:04:09]</p>

<p>So on our Christmas tree we had Finnish ornaments and like other things. So at some point, I, I think I asked her like... Like I wanted to go to some like Finnish cultural like thing. And I did. Like I went with my parents. And I don't remember it super well but I remember people being super confused that I was there. And people asked, "Why are you here?" And I was like, "Oh because my mom is Finnish." Or I would just say, "Because I'm Finnish." And we never did that again and I'm assuming it was because like there, there was something that people were freaking out or more that it was uncomfortable for my parents and that I just didn't notice. [00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like we never, other than that like we never did like American Finnish cultural things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, so there was like, my mom always had these like raising black children books and other things. And it just kind of... (PAUSE) I don't know. (PAUSE) In some ways, it's kind of weird to hear about like her parenting concerns, you know, like years later. Or her like theories or sort of whatever. (PAUSE) Yeah she used to have to ask my father's sisters to mail her black dolls because she couldn't find them where we lived.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:06:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she wanted me to have black dolls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. (PAUSE) And I don't know it just, I feel like she didn't like to talk about it. She really doesn't like talking about being in an interracial relationship or raising mixed race kids. Like, (inaudible at 00:06:29) kids. Like, if I ask her, she's just like, "Yeah, you were my kids." Or like occasionally she'll say something where like her worries about my brother on the bus and that he might, or something might happen. So sometimes it's clear that like something's happening but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's very into not saying that. And then at some time in college my brother... My brother and I never really identified ourselves racially when we were kids. Like I don't know. Like, there weren't enough black students or really non white students to kind of have, like... (PAUSE) It wasn't like there were the black kids. There was like the two black kids. [00:07:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So... Like it was an issue and it wasn't an issue in a sort of like weird way. But in college, my brother started identifying more strongly as black and was like into (PAUSE) kind of like black pride African awareness stuff. And at that time, I was really identifying (ph) as biracial. (PAUSE) So my brother and I actually talked a little bit. Like, I was like, "Oh. It's kind of weird that we right now identify ourselves in two different ways." [00:08:03]</p>

<p>And then I asked my mom, like, "Well, what do you think we are?" And she just sort of fumbled and was like, "Well, you know, you're my kids and, you know, that's how I think of you but everyone else thinks you're black so it's important to be aware of that. Like, it doesn't really matter how (inaudible at 00:08:35). And my dad didn't really contribute to the discussion. He was just like, "Yes. You're my kids." (PAUSE) So, yeah, I don't know. Like I feel like as I get older sometimes my mom or my dad reveal like a little bit more of the inner workings of my childhood and it's always a surprise. [00:09:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah for instance, generally you are really not sure how much (inaudible at 00:09:17) they are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much they sort of thought about it or were aware of it or... (PAUSE) Sort of without telling you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I also just sort of... And one of the things they didn't tell me... I could never really find out if they were trying to hide this from me or just didn't say anything (inaudible) was deliberate or accidental.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:09:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think some of my mom's extreme anxiety about people criticizing her parenting has to do with that (PAUSE) I don't know, like fear or anxiety or something about raising mixed raised kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you probably... (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:10:35) like (PAUSE) in a way have been like trying to fight her. I guess that's (PAUSE) especially when you mentioned (PAUSE) like really getting into the like Finnish stuff and wanting to wear the thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you know, that sounds like a, I don't know, identifying with your mom and like trying to be like her and... (PAUSE) [00:11:09]</p>

<p>I guess I get the sense that some of not knowing more about where she was coming from and what she thought about these other things left you kind of groping around a little more for sort of where she was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) And yeah. I think it's also sometimes... I used to think it was more of a language barrier because English is my mom's second language.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And sometimes, like, not often, but sometimes she would, she would like, you know, because she was tired, she'll kind of forget a word a little bit or scramble English a little bit. [00:12:00]</p>

<p>And so sometimes I would think like, "Oh, the reason why she's not explaining this more or talking about this more is that, you know, it's hard to talk in a foreign language," or something, like... But I don't think that's actually true. I think she just didn't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah when I was, I mean, when I was younger I also thought that I was really convinced that I would look just like my mom when I grew up because we resemble each other a lot in our face. And so, I don't know like I just, for some reason like, in my head... So my mom had these like long thick braids when she was a teenager. And I would see pictures of her with these, this those like long braids. [00:12:59]</p>

<p>And then there were younger pictures of her sometimes where her hair was shorter. So In my head, I was sort of like, "Oh yeah. When I grow up, I'm going to have really long hair or like I'm going to have..." Like I don't even know. It was kind of like... So I was thinking about it and I kind of imagined I would have straight long hair which wouldn't happen. But like, I was kind of like, "Oh no. I'll have this thick long braid like my mom and I figured I'd be really tall like my mom and skinny. Like not because I wanted to be skinny but because I thought (inaudible at 00:13:35) I'd look like my mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like your mom. Yeah. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And one of the more disconcerting aspects of puberty was not looking like, actually resembling her less.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So as my mom used to put it, I was much more developed than she was ever. And I never like... [00:14:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like in your shape?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I had a lot bigger breasts than she did. I still do. Like a curvier body and then at some point, I was like, "I just weigh more than my mom." (PAUSE) When she was a teenager, she felt very self conscious about looking like a boy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I would sort of... She said that she hit puberty... Like I hit puberty early, she hit puberty late. So she was always like, "(inaudible at 00:14:39) I look like a boy."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was on a late growth spurt. So for a long time, longer than practical my mom (inaudible) growth spurt (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh you mean if you had grown taller.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay. [00:15:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because like, I grew like some.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I stopped. And my mom was like, "Oh yeah. Whatever, you just hit a secondary growth spurt." And then eventually, "I was like no."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like we were both very like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:15:23)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How tall is she?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's like 5'11''. So that... And so were her sisters so I was just like... And her like shortest sister is still taller than me. Basically my mom's whole family is taller than me. Which is annoying. But (PAUSE) yeah, I don't know. I just really thought I would look like my mom. And it was really weird to not look at all like her...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:15:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...physically. And also like (PAUSE) I sort of resemble like my father's sisters but not really. I actually look more like... My dad says I look more like one of his aunts that, a couple of his aunts that I never knew.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was also a little anxious about because my dad's sisters were all quite heavy. So I was like, "Great. I don't want to be..." I was just kind of worried like, am I going to be really, really fat somehow magically. Like (PAUSE) I don't want to say it but they're really fat. And on the one hand, they used to have these like sequiny (ph) sparkly outfits that I loved and that I thought were really cool but I was also like, "Um... That's not quite." You know, as a teenager, I don't want to be fat. Like it was not cool, not okay. But also their their bodies weren't like mine so it was kind of like... (PAUSE) I don't know. I just didn't look like kind of anyone around me. [00:17:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really weird mostly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I felt like (inaudible) I always felt like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I came from these people and yet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there was that and also it's just like, I don't know what else is going to happen. Like I was like, "Will my breasts stop growing please? Will I get taller? I don't know." Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just kind of felt like I had not idea what was going to happen... [00:18:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...with like my changing body or just stuff. (PAUSE) But also hitting puberty earlier than my friends was just really awkward because I had like suddenly, I looked a lot older.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And... (PAUSE) And so like my mom was sort of good at explaining like, like biologically what was going on and about like her experience of being a teenager. But a lot of it was kind of predicated on the idea that I would look like her, eventually develop and look like her so when I wasn't, my mom was really at a loss. She was kind of like, "I don't know."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: "What are we doing? "</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:18:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah like, it was just, we would be at the store and we would both be like, "I don't know." Like getting bras was difficult because my mom didn't really need to wear one and I really did. And like juniors clothes didn't really fit me very well. And so my mom was not interested in clothing so she was just like, "I don't know where to go next."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And sometimes she could call my dad's sisters to be like, "What is happening?" But (PAUSE) I don't know. It was just kind of like, it was just very disconcerting. Also looking a lot older physically was weird. (PAUSE) Like partially in terms of street (ph) harassment and just also in terms of like I didn't think I looked older but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like standing out? [00:19:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was kind of like, "Whatever. I'm, you know, fourteen and a freshman in high school and obviously...." (inaudible at 00:20:15) freshman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I would be somewhere else and someone will think that I'm a freshman in college and I was like, "What? Hey, whoa."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it was like I'm not ready for like. I don't know. I just felt like I wasn't ready for it. And then, I don't know. I just, I felt (PAUSE) very much like I didn't look like anyone else in my school. Which was fairly literally true. I don't think there was another black girl in my school. [00:20:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In your high school now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. In my entire high school. I know there wasn't in elementary school or middle school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like elementary school, my brother and I were the only black kids in the school. And then in middle school there was like one or two other kids, probably one. And then, in my high school, like my year there was one other black kid and at the end of the year another black kid moved in which was kind of weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was like (inaudible at 00:21:37) replaced.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think there were south Asian kids, Indian, Pakistan and Taiwanese, Japanese but (PAUSE) (inaudible) it's like, basically, it's like scientists who worked for the electric company.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Their kids. Yeah. [00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) So yeah. I don't know. It was kind of a combination of being a self conscious teenager and also literally really standing out.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also like, I just never knew what to do about that. Like (PAUSE) I don't know (inaudible at 00:22:51) like high school... Middle school and high school was when I noticed I felt more like I stood out. And I always wanted to do some things so that I wouldn't stand out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But there wasn't really anything to do. [00:23:05]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:23:31) hitting puberty early or like being really smart... (PAUSE) There's a bunch of dimensions (ph) there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah and I had a time of like trying to... I mean actually probably throughout middle school I had like times of trying to fit in more like with like buying whatever clothes you're supposed to wear in junior high school. And then I had times of like wanting to dress really outrageously and I don't know... [00:24:07]</p>

<p>Like get attention for that instead. And so, you know, like thrift store clothes or like I had a pair of neon yellow green bell bottoms that I was extremely (inaudible at 00:24:31) in large part because I was like (inaudible) part of wearing them was also everybody's looking at the pants because they're hideous and kind of, like, that was the distraction. Like I also really like clothes and I liked things about them but I also like that they were really loud.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:25:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was that fun at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it was like sort of, going to thrift shops was fun with my friends and putting together weird outfits was definitely fun. (PAUSE) [00:26:00]</p>

<p>And I think a couple times I got like sort of more seriously bullied about it (inaudible). But yeah. I also, at some point, was really into the Beatles and sort of like, I don't know, like 60's nostalgia was back again. And I really liked... I was like, "My parents were in the 60's." And so I really wanted to wear my mom's clothes from then and I couldn't. Like they were so... I remember being able to wear what had been a tunic top on her as a dress for like a year or two and I, I just loved it. I was like, "You know, it's vintage and it's cool and my mom wore it." I also thought it was really cool that it was a dress on me and like a shirt on her. But very like... [00:27:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) kind of like longing and enthusiasm for her today that sounds like it feels really good to go back to in a way but that you (inaudible) like don't generally refer to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it was. I think part of it was like at the time I wasn't, like my mom was like my mom and not a person. If that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like (PAUSE) like she, like, sort of like in my head like basically she like used to just be my mom and... [00:28:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Of course she did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That was it. And she was a stay at home mom, which kind of reinforced that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know. I didn't really think of her as having like particularly in her life or other things. I'm like, "She's my mom." That's just kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It also at the time, she was, at least to me like, she wasn't controlling. She was, you know, she was very willing to let me wear what I wanted. So I really liked (PAUSE) and it was kind of another example of my mom's decorum (ph) she would wear these things, she didn't, you know, like she didn't care if I wore a shirt as a dress and she was totally fine with me doing God awful tie dye and just like... (PAUSE) I don't know. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More power to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More power to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She was just like, "Alright." And I don't know. (PAUSE) It was just, it was just kind of like, on the one hand, having these like I don't look like her (inaudible) which was had. It was also overall easy to interact with my mom. Like I don't, like I mean, like, we fought about things but there were also all these things and ways that she was like, "Okay." [00:30:00]</p>

<p>When I was in college, she was totally fine with me being a Folklore Mythology major and everyone else's parents flipped out. And like all those sort of things. So, I don't know, it was just really easy to be her daughter. (PAUSE) Yeah. (PAUSE) (inaudible) thing about it is I've definitely heard a lot of women complain that they never, their mother never taught them how to like put on makeup or how to wear or how to be a girl properly or how to do all these things. Like when Ana (ph) and I had our makeup party, everyone was like, "My mom never taught me how to wear makeup. It's so horrible." [00:31:01]</p>

<p>And my thought was always, my mom didn't teach me how to wear makeup either. Like she doesn't wear makeup. She doesn't shave her legs. She thought I was silly for shaving my legs and my armpits. You know she didn't like fashion. But she was basically just didn't think it was an issue. Like she didn't want me to wear makeup to school and neither did I really. But yeah, I don't know, I felt kind of free to. (inaudible at 00:31:41) Yeah. But I felt kind of free to... Like it's just kind of like as a kid to just too like just sort of be myself and do like whatever thing I was into. (PAUSE) [00:32:05]</p>

<p>So, you know, if I wanted to read books forever that was okay as long as I did my homework. (PAUSE) Yeah, I don't know. (PAUSE) Like also, I mean, part of the thing is also I felt like holidays were also a lot easier. I mean, right now, I feel like everything this coming Christmas is super stressful. (PAUSE) When previously they weren't. And also like family vacations when we used to go camping at various times. [00:33:00]</p>

<p>And I didn't mind it. Like I kind of liked it. Because I like my father and like he would, you know, talk to me like I was, you know, like a normal person and we would play card games.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) You mean as opposed to his little sister?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) But, you know, it was really fun. (PAUSE) And now I feel like it's just really, I get really stressed when we do trips together. (PAUSE) [00:34:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I can see how like (PAUSE) what you're describing like today, growing up with your mom, is so at odds with how you describe going home to visit them now.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like (PAUSE) I don't know. Like one of the, we had a fight one Thanksgiving because my mom wanted us all to go see, I think it was Dreamgirls. And I just didn't want to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it like a movie?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah a movie. And we ended up having a fight in the car about it in the middle of the day and then a pre-dinner fight about it, right before they went fight, afterwards argument, and then like the next day or two. [00:35:05]</p>

<p>And, basically what the argument was, I didn't want to go see the movie and my mom really wanted me to go see the movie. (PAUSE) And at first, I was just like, I wasn't interested in seeing the movie. And then I was just like, "I'm now really stressed and cranky and have headache and still don't want to go see the movie." And sort of (inaudible) into, "Oh my God. Why don't we let this go? I've already not seen it." Like (PAUSE) I mean, her argument basically was we should all go see the movie together like as a family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A family thing. Yeah. [00:36:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was like (inaudible) weren't married yet so I think it was also like (inaudible) family (inaudible) family and (PAUSE) she just, I don't know, she felt like... I don't know. It was mostly, actually I mostly felt like she wasn't she didn't listen to anything I said about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, "I don't want to see it." She was like, "Well, but we're going to go see it as a family. "Can we see a different movie?" "We're going to see Dreamgirls." I'm like, "Can we, you know..." Like, it wasn't a discussion it was just ignored that I don't want to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also like when my mom and I have these arguments like my dad sort of withdraws and doesn't talk about it. [00:37:03]</p>

<p>My brother will sometimes try to kind of mediate, sometimes not. Or like, you know, come up with a suggestion and it just doesn't really... Like, It's super frustrating. And the way (inaudible) I end up feeling like a child because my mom, like in a way my mom's trying to control like what I'm doing. (PAUSE) And the other thing which, I don't know. Like, I can see what my mom's trying to do is like, let's have a familial pleasant experience. [00:38:07]</p>

<p>But it's, like it's impossible for her to let it go or have a... Like once she's decided it, we're just all going and it will be enjoyable and (PAUSE) like me being pissed doesn't matter. I kind of feel like she feels like if I just go then it will all be fixed. Like, if I would just go to the movie then we would be happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you would be fine. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:39:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'm getting a little more convinced which I've admittedly been stubborn about, your mom actually being different now than she was growing up. Like, that the sort of differences in relationship have not just been due to your being older or different things being important, you know, you're expecting to have a different relationship based on your age and so forth. I'm actually kind of getting convinced which I've sort of been reluctant about, like her treating, her being different in this way, like, more autocratic, less flexible with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm still not necessarily convinced about the anxiety but I'm more open to the idea. I mean... (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I'm saying it like sort of tongue in cheek because because obviously I don't know but... (PAUSE) Yeah. [00:40:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's... (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I had... Sorry. I'm just totally interrupting you. I had thought about it in terms of a kind of anxiety about feelings and differences between you that was just so very non-spoken about that it wasn't clear that it was even there although it was palpable. Do you know what I mean? Like sometimes that happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I'm now (inaudible) there wasn't that sort of thing earlier like when you were growing up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, the only, like the way I experienced...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:41:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...differences between my mom and I was mostly around like that I read so much and that I read, like I read a lot. I read fantasy a lot. And I was really imaginative. And so, she like, like I remember (inaudible) her being kind of like, "Huh, okay." Like she didn't seem to understand what I was doing and would sometimes like kind of ask me about it because it didn't make sense to her. But she wouldn't try to stop me from doing it. [00:41:57]</p>

<p>And sometimes like I remember, she sewed me like a very, she would sometimes sew me costumes like mostly for Halloween. But if I wanted to wear them to play outside, she was basically like, "Alright." So (PAUSE) like she really did not get why I wanted to do that but she was okay with it. (PAUSE) And maybe more willing to just, just let me do whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) Just roll with what you wanted to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And when I was talking about this with my sister in law...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:42:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was talking about how her dad is kind of narcissistic and is was always trying to one up people about knowing more about a subject or just, you know, whatever. And she was like, "Yeah. He's been that way my entire life." And (inaudible) dad and (inaudible) this. And I was thinking about like, I don't, like, that's not how I felt when I was younger. And by younger, I mean like through college.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't get a sense that your mother is particularly narcissistic either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No she's not. (PAUSE) (inaudible) her sister in law was like her dad had always been this way but it's hard to connect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And for my mom sort of (PAUSE) been more like felt like recently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. [00:44:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I never really understood that. I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure that I totally did either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just seemed like, the idea my mom's changing dramatically seems weird. You know, like, she's my mom. She's supposed to just be my mom at all times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (PAUSE) Let's finish up for now. But we'll talk more next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:45:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: On the fifteenth of October, I just remembered.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Monday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to cancel (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Do you want to try and reschedule or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, can I e-mail you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

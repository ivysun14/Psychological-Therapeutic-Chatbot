<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I didn’t see her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they’ll jump right out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God. It’s something I’m not used to. I was just thinking about how there’s just so many more pedestrians here. And they’re so annoying but yet I’m one of them, too. On weekends I walk around. Anyways, how are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m good. I’m good. Yea. Hey, checking in about next week. I am going to be in. What… do you know what your plans are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, Monday. I’m off Friday, Monday and Tuesday. Is traffic going to be crazy? It shouldn’t be, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would guess by this time of the day, no. I mean, it’s tricky getting over here between… until like 1:00 or so or 2:00. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If anything I’ll take a day trip somewhere. [00:01:01] And I’d like to come in. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I’ll be here. I mean, I can’t afford it. I wish I was saying like, “Oh, I’m going to Miami.” No, not yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, so you get… are you just taking some time off for yourself? Is it…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I actually have not taken a single vacation day since I started in July. That was pointed out to me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right? Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I mean, we’ve had… because we work in a university, there’s a lot of like special days that we just get off. But I haven’t used a single vacation day. So I was like, oh, maybe I should do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And are you guys ever closed over like…</p>

<p>CLIENT: We’re closed Monday. We’re closed this Friday. We’re closed for graduation which is on the… like May 19 or something. So yea, we have a lot of days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about over like Jamestmas holidays and stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, we got a week off. [00:02:00] No, so it’s… I have had some breaks but just not… there’s a lot of people that just… they take off… sick days are based on like… it’s like the honest policy or something. They call it just whenever you need it, we believe you. And my associate director was joking the other day how like, “Yea, there’s the regulars who once a month guaranteed they’ll take their sick day or just people who just go on vacation.” Like, “Oh, we’re going to the beach.” </p>

<p>And I feel bad because I wish I was at a point that I could afford to do something. I like staycations. I like just staying at home but not for too long because then I get depressed. I wish I could travel or spend quality time with people. But there’s no one to spend quality time with. Brian has a crazy schedule and I can’t count on him really. And then my family is not here. [00:03:01] </p>

<p>I had an interesting weekend. Friday was calm. Saturday Brian had told me that he would be in Vermont because he was teaching there. And he had a very crazy schedule. I think Friday during the day he had to teach and then he went home and napped for a while. And then Friday night from 11 pm to 7 am he worked at the hospital and then got in his car and drove to Vermont to teach from 9:00 to 5:00. </p>

<p>And so he had said, “If you’re free on Saturday come stay with me.” And I was really excited about that because we had always joked about doing that. He had always kind of said when we just met like, “Oh, I go out of town all the time. Maybe you could come with me.” And I’ve always wanted to do that. But this is the first time he actually asked me so I was all excited. [00:04:01] And it was Saturday night. So of course I have this fantasy of, oh, I’m going to get all dressed up and he’s going to take me to dinner. And then maybe we’ll take it easy because he’s exhausted. But I got there all dressed up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In Vermont.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In Vermont. Got there like around 6:00 and he looked exhausted. I mean, he’d been up for a long time and I hadn’t had dinner. And he just laid down and we pretty much just went to sleep from 7 pm till the next morning. </p>

<p>But it’s funny. I remember thinking in advance like, hmm. It’s 6 pm. I ran four miles today. I must… I’m getting hungry. [00:05:00] That morning all I had eaten was like eggs and fruit or something. And so I had to eat dinner. But it’s like when I’m with him, I so… there’s two feelings. I’m like kind of offended that he won’t look out for me and be like, “Are you hungry? Have you eaten?” I want to be taken care of. But the side that ends up winning with me is just I don’t want to bother him. He’s worked really hard. He needs to sleep. I can handle starvation for one night and I just go to sleep. And I went to sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, but without dinner.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (chuckling) I just like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no. I see. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was just funny because I did my hair. I wore heels. And he commented on how pretty I looked. But then it’s like I took everything off and, OK, we’re going to sleep now. So… but that’s just like our relationship. We spend all our time in bed. That’s all we do. And I understand he had a very crazy schedule. [00:05:58] </p>

<p>And then the next morning he got up at like 6:00 in the morning because that’s his regular wake up time and I had slept so many hours I was awake. I didn’t mind. So we got up. He took me to breakfast which was very nice. We went to a really cute place and actually talked and had conversation. And he says sweet things. At the end of it he was hugging me and he said, “You know what’s funny. We got to the restaurant and we were the first ones there. And then the whole restaurant filled up and I didn’t even notice because I was just so focused on you.” He was sweet. And we hugged and he paid for breakfast. And then he asked, “Can I fill up your tank?” He filled up my tank. He took care of me. I think… and then I started thinking, well, last night he must have been completely out of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I was like not a big deal. I went hungry. I got a good breakfast the next day, whatever. And then he had to go back and teach that day again from 8:00 to 4:00. [00:07:02] So he did that. I went home, did my day and it’s getting hot, right? I heard a rumor somewhere that today was supposed to be 75 and my apartment gets so freaking warm. So I had bought an AC recently and he had offered to install it for me. And I said, “It’s getting really hot.” I had been asking him for a few days and he said, “You know what? It doesn’t matter. When I come home from the city, from Vermont, when I come into the city I’ll do that. I’ll just drop by for a little bit and install it.” And he did. </p>

<p>So at the end of the day he came. He couldn’t find parking because my neighborhood sucks like that. And so he parked illegally in a corner and said, “Come down. Sit in my car. Give me your keys and I’ll do it all for you.” And he did it really quickly. (chuckling) So I’m sitting in his car and reflecting on what a nice day we had and everything is fine. And I’ve never snooped before. [00:08:01] </p>

<p>I’ve stayed at his house. He’s taken a shower like in his home, in his family home. I could’ve looked through stuff and I just never did, never looked through his phone even though he barely ever leaves it there. I remember it used to impress me that James used to leave it face up like and go take a shower. And I’d be thinking to myself like, “Wow. This guy has nothing to hide. Brian would never do that.” Anyways, for some reason I felt like snooping. He had some papers right on top there about the courses he had just trained and I was reading through them and it was all this gun stuff and medic stuff. And then…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gun stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he trains military and cops in what to do if someone has a gunshot wound. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, and so he has to get up on…</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like an all-day training. So as part of the training is shooting, defense and how to be a better shooter. [00:09:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then his part is the medical part.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like a company…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: …that different professionals - this guy he works with is ex-military - he heads the whole thing and he does the medical portion of it. So I started snooping and I looked in his glove compartment. It was interesting because the day before when I got to the motel he was looking at me upstairs from the balcony. He was like, “Hey, can you get me my charger?” And he unlocked his car. And he’s like, “It’s in the center console.” Yea, in the center console. And I stuck my hand in there. I was like, “Is this it? Is this it?” </p>

<p>And so I knew there was nothing in there. I had already looked in there the day before. But for some reason I was just looking so I stick my hand in there and I see a piece of mail that says his name, his wife’s name, whatever. It’s a piece of mail. Back to the reality, oh yea, he’s married and they live together. [00:10:08] And then I find another piece of paper in there and I take it out. And it’s a little notepad, like a little piece of paper from a notepad that big that says Best Western on it, hotel stationary. And it says, “I, Francesca so-and-so, Brian completely agree to…” like all this explicit sexual stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, on the notepad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On the notepad. Like her name, her full name. “I agree to comply with whatever he tells me to do. To have all my holes violated. To be fucked no matter how hard I scream and ask for him to stop. Signed…” and her signature was there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a contract. [00:11:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a contract. And on the back it seems like it’s something filled out afterwards like, “I, Francesca so-and-so, thank you for treating me like a whore. I thoroughly enjoyed it even though I protested and screamed and it hurt and I might bleed for a few days. Signed…” And my heart just sank. And I went numb and my whole body was on fire. And I was like, “What do I do? What do I do with this information?” It hurt for a variety of reasons. Number one, we do stuff like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you’ll write stuff like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, he’s made me do that. And I guess I was aware that he’s done stuff like that in the past. [00:12:05] But not knowing how recent this piece of paper was. The thought that he could possibly be doing these intimate things with someone else. It’s like someone took a jackhammer to my face. It was just so painful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To your face, yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The second thing…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A jackhammer to your face.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (pause) And the second thing…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s like another violation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I wasn’t that shocked because I mean, we’ve been suspecting this. I’ve been saying in here like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: …that there’s a possibility. Even though he… the last I heard he had said to me like, “All that was a lie. I was trying to get you to confess. I’ve never cheated on you.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. No, I remember. And you had that… you’ve had that…</p>

<p>CLIENT: But still, who knows? [00:13:05] I just… there’s a part of me that can’t completely trust him. He’s cheating on his wife, for God sakes. She’s supposed to be a wonderful woman, a wonderful mother. Not enough for him. And also what went through my head is this is not about me. This is about him. This is not that, “Melanie, you’re not enough. You’re not pretty enough. You don’t give him enough.” </p>

<p>It’s completely like this is what he needs for his ego. He needs to be the big and powerful daddy with a huge cock to many women, not just you. This isn’t about you. He needs that because of his messed up history. And he has just such fragile self-esteem. That’s what he thrives on. </p>

<p>And then the next thought was, “Wow. I can’t believe when he tells me, ‘I don’t have time to take you to dinner or go for a walk or just watch a movie with you.’” [00:14:03] That all he ever seems to have time for is to come over and have sex with me, cuddle and go to sleep. But he finds some time to go to a Best Western hotel with some girl and do this to her. I thought you didn’t have extra time. So I took the note and I stuck it in my pocket. And I decided I’m not going to say anything tonight because if I do it’s going to… I’m going to destroy him with my words. I’m just going to put him down and call him a piece of shit and tell him I never want to speak to him again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you feeling that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were. OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I really… like I can feel it all over my body. It’s on my feet and it’s going up, the tension and the anger. [00:14:52] And I felt like saying like, “You piece of shit. Yea, I know I wasn’t perfect but this wasn’t a perfect relationship. You’re cheating on your wife. I was dicking around looking for a real relationship. But now after what’s happened in the past few weeks and me being completely open and honest with you.” </p>

<p>Honestly like I got rid of all telephone numbers, all apps, all everything. I’m not talking to Peter. I’m not… I erased all of that and I told Brian I’m going to be completely honest and faithful from now on and I expect the same. And it was just so hurtful thinking like, “Wow. If this is recent I can’t believe... what a piece of shit.” And at the same time I thought it doesn’t take away that I think he loves me. I do believe him when he says he loves me and he cares and what we have is special and different. [00:16:01] But it doesn’t matter to me because if he’s sleeping with other women, it just… it won’t work. I need him to be loyal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need that loyalty. Yea, it’s making me think about… for some reason I was thinking about the note that when it was written. And that it’s…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had brought it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking about how it seemed to kind of indicate a one-way loyalty. That… and I was wondering if like the… if there’s anything to the dynamic of it being a one-way loyalty at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean? She was only loyal to him and his wishes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, not vice versa. And I was wondering if it can feel that way. I mean, actually for some reason I guess I’m just caught by you sort of saying… you saying in a lot of ways, “Yes, I’ll be loyal to you. But I need you to be loyal back.” [00:17:09] And in some ways it’s such a… it’s a different than that note implies of kind of a… what I would sense in a one-way loyalty. And in some ways that I hear it in you a one-way loyalty that I hear is kind of implied sometimes - at least in the fantasy between the two of you, a one-way. You Brian be my pet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am serving him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The loyal pet but the owner not necessarily being… the owner might have more than one pet. And not to say that that’s the case but thinking like the loyalty is one-way in some way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But for some reason like when we play like that in bed and everything, I know that it’s not like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s play. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything he’s doing, it’s for me. It’s because he’s doing it because it turns me on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s right. OK. So it’s kind of in the context of a play, of kind of a play kind of context. [00:18:02] As opposed to it being kind of outside that boundary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I mean it’s almost like I call it debriefing. We debrief afterwards. When we’re just cuddling and holding each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, I know you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He’ll talk to me. I said… I’ll say something like, “Oh my God. When you said that, I wasn’t expecting it. But I can’t believe that turned me on.” He’s like, “Yea, I knew it would and that’s why I tried. And I’m glad that it worked.” And it’s like a mutual arrangement even though while we’re playing, it might seem like it’s all for him because that’s what’s turning me on…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. No, that’s the play element.</p>

<p>CLIENT: …to use. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you stop the play and then it’s… and then you’re asking him to go, “That was just play, right?” </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it feels like that. So when he came back out to the car, he finished quickly. And right away he could tell something was wrong. He’s like, “What’s wrong? You look worried. There’s… you’re looking at me funny.” [00:19:05] And I’m thinking to myself, “This bastard knows I found the note.” That was my first thought and I tried to act as normal as possible. “Thank you so much for doing that for me. I’m going to be so nice and cold and comfortable tonight.” Gave him a hug and he looks at me. He’s like, “Are you sure? Are you OK?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He knew.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he got in his car and he left and I walked away. And the first thing I planned to do was create a face… a fake Facebook account and look up this girl by first and last name. And I found her and who knows if it’s her. But it is a college student from like… what is it – some community college. I wasn’t impressed. I was waiting to see someone completely hot and oh my God, of course. [00:20:04] And I was just like, seriously? She just looked regular. But I know he gets very turned on by being with young girls. She’s probably 21 or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so she’s college age, too. Not just going there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It says she still works at Starbucks. Nothing against people who work at Starbucks but he’s always ranting and raving about how proud he is of me, that he can’t believe that he’s with me and on top of that I’m a psychologist. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you’re a psychologist then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m a professional and I have a doctorate. But of course different things turn people on. And sometimes it turns him on to be with somebody who has an associate’s degree or a high school degree. He just gets off on different things and I get that. </p>

<p>So as I’m trying to make this fake account and trying to just breathe and keep from crying because I just want to pull it together and find out as quickly as I can what’s the story here. [00:21:01] The phone rings and it’s him. (chuckling) And I guess I sounded surprised answering the phone. And he’s like, “What’s wrong? You sound surprised to hear from me.” And I was like, “Well, you just left my house. I thought you were driving home.” He’s like, “Yea, but can’t I call you? I missed you. I wanted to talk.” I was like, “Oh, OK.” </p>

<p>And then he was trying to fish again. Like, “What’s wrong? You sound weird.” And I didn’t want to say anything yet because I didn’t know what I wanted to say. And pretty quickly I got off the phone again. Like, “No, I promise. Everything is fine.” And I made an account, like just very… like some… pretended to be like a young college girl. I put a fake picture of a bunch of girls standing together so you can’t even tell who’s who and I just messaged her. [00:21:53] </p>

<p>I sent her a private message saying something like, “Hey, I’m sorry to bother you. And this may seem kind of awkward but I just started seeing this guy. I don’t know if you know him but his name is this and he’s a nurse and he’s tall and dark hair. And anyways, we’re just starting to see each other and I have some doubts about whether or not I can trust him. And I came… I was snooping through some of his stuff and I came across your name so I was just curious if you guys were talking now or if this was from something from the past. Girl-to-girl, I just wanted to know can I trust this guy?” She hasn’t written me back. In fact, before I left work again I sent her a quick message saying something like, “Sorry to bother you if this isn’t the right Francesca but I really just want to know. Please write back if you can.” She hasn’t written back. And went to sleep, didn’t get any answers. I normally sleep until like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is last night. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is last night. I normally sleep until 8 o’clock when I have to be in work at 8:45. By 6:30 I was awake and I couldn’t sleep. And got up, went to work early. And I had a bunch of no shows. I had two no shows in a row. So I had two free hours. And I got on Gchat and I noticed that Brian was on. And so I was like, “Hey, what’s up? Are you doing your homework?” because he had a paper to write. And he’s like, “Yea. That’s what I’m doing right now. Hey, were you upset about something last night?” asking again. And I said, “Yea, I actually was.” I felt like I was ready to talk to him about it at that point. And I said, “I have no shows. Do you want to talk on the phone?” And he said, “Yea. Call my house.” </p>

<p>So I called him and it’s exactly what I expected. He was very serious and I said, “Brian, do you know what I’m upset about? When you came out to your car you noticed I was upset about something. Do you know what it is I’m going to talk to you about?” [00:24:04] He’s like, “I don’t have a frigging clue,” and just started getting very defensive. </p>

<p>And then I said, “I’d like to talk to you about Francesca so-and-so and about how you took her to the Best Western hotel and had her write a contract about how hard you were going to fuck her and how you were going to hurt her. And I want to find out more about that and why you did that.” And he’s like, “Who?” And I repeated the name and he’s like, “I seriously have no clue who you’re talking about.” And I was like, “Brian, I found the note. I have the note in my house. I took it from your car.” And he was like, “If that’s who I think it is then that was like from a long time ago.” And I was like… and he’s said, “Over a year ago.” [00:25:03] </p>

<p>Mind you, we’ve been together a year and a half. I said, “Well, I know that that’s not true because this is a new car. You just got this car last spring.” And he’s like, “Yea, but I bet it’s like paper that I stuck in there from my old car.” I was like, “That doesn’t make any sense. If you’re like cleaning out your car…” And he keeps this new car of his really pristine clean. His old car used to be a piece of garbage. He just like threw garbage in there. I was like, “If you were just cleaning out your car, you wouldn’t keep pieces of paper like this and I know your wife occasionally drives your car. You wouldn’t care if she found this? So it’s just very confusing to me if this wasn’t done recently why you would have this in your car.” </p>

<p>And he got kind of mean. He was like, “Well, if you would shut your mouth for just a minute, I could explain myself.” [00:26:07] And I was like, “I’m controlling myself and the reason I didn’t talk to you about this yesterday is because I was going to be really mean. And I’ve decided to try to make this a mature conversation. So don’t be mean to me.” And so he stopped. </p>

<p>And he completely denied it and said, “Yes. If that’s who I think it is, I think it’s some girl that I met and we did that once and that was a long time ago. But I promise you that that is in no way recent.” And at first I wasn’t believing it. But I don’t know what happened that he tried to turn it around on me in saying like, “Well, you’re one to talk,” or something. [00:26:55] </p>

<p>And I was like, “We know my sins. Let’s leave my sins out of this. And I’m not even so sure they’re sins because you’re married and I was trying to find a real relationship and whatever. Fresh start since this whole thing happened with the drinking incident. I told you I was going to be loyal. I’m being loyal. And by the way after I found that note, I went on OkCupid again just to check if your account was still active and it says that you were on yesterday. So explain that as well.” </p>

<p>And he’s told me before, “Oh, I never…. I have a hundred windows that open up whenever I turn on my computer. When I do homework those windows pop up and I haven’t even gone to OkCupid and that’s why it says I was there yesterday.” I said, “Well, you know what? I’m not OK with that. If you’re being loyal to me, I need you to delete that. Are you going to be OK with doing that? Can you delete that for me?” And he’s like, “I’m fucking doing it right now as we speak on the computer.” “And I was like I just I can’t comprehend why that would be in your car if it was from a long time ago.” [00:28:05] </p>

<p>And he’s like, “I don’t pay attention. I don’t know.” And in a way I started to believe it because he’s not that careful. Like the time he left his phone when his wife was getting dressed in the room and I was texting him and his wife could just pick it up and read it and the fact that his wife knows. I, again, clarified because I think it’s so hard for my brain to understand that. </p>

<p>Like I said to him, “What would she think if she found that in your car?” And he’s like, “We’ve been over this. She knows this about me.” I was like, “So she knows that you fuck other women occasionally.” And he’s like, “Yes.” And I’m like, “And she just chooses to live in denial about it?” And I was like… that’s when he said, “If you would just shut up for a minute, I could explain.” I was like, “Well, explain.” And he says, “She… that’s just the way it is. We don’t talk about it. She knows I do this.” [00:29:04] </p>

<p>I guess if they’re not having sex, I mean, it’s a sexless marriage and I guess she accepts it. But I said, “But something so explicit, she wouldn’t freak out about it? Let me ask you this. Does she know that you’re with me?” He’s like, “No.” “But she assumes that you’re fucking other women.” He said, “Yes.” And I was like, “Well, I’m going to make it really clear. I’m not your wife. I’m not OK with it at all.” (pause) And at the end of the conversation I don’t know if I don’t care or if I believe him. But I wasn’t mad anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, what were you feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know how I’ve told you that whenever he does something that really hurt me, it really hurts intensely and then kind of I feel close to him again and we talk things out. [00:30:02] And everything is just whoosh, swept away. And that’s what happened this morning in the conversation. And even now I told him in the conversation. I said, “If I ask Francesca when this happened, is she going to tell me the same thing that it was over a year ago?” He’s like, “You know what? If that’s what you feel you need to do, go ahead and do it. But I’m telling you it was a long time ago.” And I didn’t say anything more. But I hope she responds. I don’t know what to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you…</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I were to say this to any of my friends… I was too embarrassed to even tell my friend, Carly, at work. Because anybody would be like, “Are you a freaking idiot?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course it’s recent. His story doesn’t make any sense. And the fact that he took me to a hotel and it felt good. [00:31:01] He had always kind of told me these stories about how he used to take some…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, and that was at a, what, hotel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, he took these girls to the… these young girls to the hotel sometimes because they would have dorm roommates. He couldn’t take them back to his house. Or how about the one time that some girl told him that she was in college and then she found out she was a senior in high school, had just turned 18. Of course he couldn’t fuck her at her parent’s house so he took her to a hotel room and had always kind of teased them. Like, “Oh, I’m not enough of a whore that you need a hotel room. I wanted to be taken to a hotel room.” And here we are finally going to a hotel room and it was like a really nice, loving time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, right. And right after that you found the note.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it’s like here’s a note. And a part of me even felt like jealous. How dare you do this with other people? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn’t even get this at the hotel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I was thinking… well, you didn’t get what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, like we had sex but it was nothing compared to the normal sex because he had been up for 36 hours. We had sex for about an hour and…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. That he got really into it with this Francesca. [00:32:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I get that all the time. But I hadn’t had it the night before. And a part of me was like, pshaw. But it’s like… and I automatically after the conversation…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It brought up… that’s important. You kind of said it brought that sort of feeling of… and withholding something from you or something that he gave to somebody else and kind of…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, and he never withholds that from me. If I want it rough like that, he’ll give it to me. But the fact that he’s giving it to other people, too, I’m not OK with that. (pause) I think anybody who would be listening to me would be like, “What the fuck are you doing?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it… I mean, what I hear you saying is that, yea, it doesn’t pass the sniff test to you, right? [00:33:05] But all this stuff and yet… and I know there’s the level you feeling angry by it, angry with him about it. But I also hear like something in you wants to… I don’t know if it’s right to say but wants to find a way to forgive him. Wants to find a way to…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I know he’s not perfect and I even told him on the phone. I said, “The reason I’m not feeling so sad and insecure right now, yea, of course a part of me is insecure. But more than that I know that this is about you and your ego and what you need. You need to be all that to different women. And maybe I’m not enough. Maybe there’s something wrong with you that you need to get this from different people. It’s like validating.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, what is it about him that needs do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He stayed quiet. [00:34:02] He listened to that. And I said… I gave him the chance. I said, “I’m giving you the opportunity. Tell me right now if that’s what you need and that’s how it’s going to work because I’m not going to judge you. I’ll just walk away because I can’t be with you if you’re not going to be loyal. So you need to tell you right now. Because I promise you if anything else comes up that I suspect that you’re being loyal to me, I Brian never talk to you again.” And I know that he thinks that I Brian never be able to do that. But I swear to you. I have… I’m able to just shut off like that. I’ve stopped talking to my father. My best friend in high school who stabbed me in the back, I stopped talking to her for three years. I can do it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would it mean… why would it be this point that would do it, do you think? What is it…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it’s like a fresh start. Because I feel like I scared the shit out of myself a few weeks ago when I did that, when I acted like a complete imbecile. [00:35:06] Could’ve risked my career, could’ve risked my life. Oh, I got my wallet mailed back. Did I tell you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: An ETA. I think that I feel asleep on the subway. Can you imagine? I must have looked like a homeless person. I could’ve been raped. Anything could’ve happened. And I think I really, really scared myself. And I just like… I want to start new. And I don’t want to mess anymore and I want to try to be more honest. (crying) And so that’s why if he’s not going to be honest with me, then I can’t do it. That’s not fair. (pause) I feel kind of foolish, though, for just being so forgiving. [00:35:58] But it’s like at the end of the conversation all I wanted to do was have catharsis and have sex with him because that would make it all better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I sense that you felt like you wanted to find a way to forgive him and try to find a way to make it right or something. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now if this girl ends up writing me back and saying like, “Oh yea, that happened a week ago or something,” there’s no way he’s going to be able to explain himself out of that one. That’ll change things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, do you think… I mean, what do you… I mean even the way you’re talking with me right now I can kind of sense that there’s a little bit of a kind of a step… a few steps back from how you’re feeling. Is it… I mean…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m going to be a lot more careful. I’m not going to trust him but I don’t think I ever trusted him blindly but now even less so. [00:37:04] It’s almost like now he has to earn my trust. (pause) But it didn’t feel like it used to. If something like this had happened before… remember when I found that picture on his phone of the girl. Before I used to be vengeful like, “Ha, you’ll see. This weekend I’m going to go out with my friends and I’m going to have a few drinks and I’m going to see who I can give my number to.” And I don’t feel that way this time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In fact the thought went through my mind. Patrice has already called me. My friend, she said, “Oh, can we hang out? Let’s go out.” And hearing… like the thought ran through my mind like, “Oh Melanie, you’re basically single. You have no reason to be loyal to this guy. You can go out and have fun. In fact, you should activate your dating accounts right now.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I said to myself, “No. I want this to work.” </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. And you… I mean, and also asking him about what’s going on here? [00:38:05] And trying to be very straight and direct with him about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He thanked me at the end. He said, “Thank you for trying to be rational and calm and talking to me through this. And I have very strong feelings for you. And I love you. And I don’t want to lose you. And I promise you.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you tell him about… when did you make the comment to him about… when was it that you made that comment about, “Listen, if it’s more than one person, your just ego needs that.” When did you put that out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was today. Yea, yea. That’s the sense of, “Tell me what’s really going on here. OK, let’s really face this. What is inside of you? What’s going on? Tell me.”</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because maybe his wife acknowledged that and accepted it. But no, I need to be enough for your ego. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that… so that’s some of the dilemma you face, right? I think that’s part of the dilemma you face is if that’s part of the package here, it’s not easy to kind of keep them separated. [00:39:11] And I think in a way you’re trying to put it all together actually in some way. Like, “OK, on this one side, well, we’ve got this powerful relationship and I want it.” And the play is tremendously powerful between you two, the sexual component. And… but you got to know what’s really going on under the mask. Or is the mask… is it real?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, I don’t know what’s going on sometimes under there. (crying) You know what just made me cry? I was thinking about how good it is what you do, how you do it. I can sit there and help me make sense out of everything and not judge it. [00:40:06] And I know it’s possible. I do it all day with people. But it’s just different when you’re sitting in this chair because I just… I judge myself so harshly right now. Am I making the right decision? I can’t even tell my close friend, “Oh yea, I found this note and we’re back to normal now.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, I think there’s something to that. I think it’s been something that you’ve been really needing. Now watch out for those Kleenex by the way. They are... did you notice that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Menthol. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. I bought the wrong brand. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I’ve done that before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn’t even realize they were Vicks. Anyway…</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s good for people who have colds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for people with colds. But it seems like, yea, you’re digging at something inside of yourself that’s something that’s very important. Just the way you were trying to dig at Brian. [00:41:03] Like, “All right, let’s… we’re not going to judge. I just want to know.”</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t jump to conclusions. Let’s understand first.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. “Is this something about what you need? What does this mean about the two? If you need…” Really trying to find - in yourself and in him - what’s at stake with these? What are you both looking for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like we’re getting closer. He finishes classes this semester in four weeks and then he has clinicals which is just like a few hours a week at a clinic shadowing a nurse practitioner and then he’s done. And he keeps talking about potentially… over breakfast he was telling me, “My life could really go two ways.” It’s like he’s been a paramedic and then ER nurse and had this crazy schedule. And basically worked his ass off taking on more hours than any human should and sacrificed being a father. [00:42:07] Having a life, being a husband. </p>

<p>So he was talking about how as this draws to a close he’s going to have the choice like, “Do I want to get a job that pays really well but continues to have this kind of hectic schedule or do I want to kind of have a life?” And he’s not sure yet what he’s going to choose. I keep thinking like if he chooses having a life maybe that might include me. It’s what I’m hoping for. Who knows? I try to take it one thing at a time and right now I’m dealing with what I just found in his car. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess trying to confront the question if what he does offer you maybe put it down to the heart of it is enough. I mean the conflict for you around that. [00:43:01] Well, I guess even if he is doing this other stuff, you’re still presented with a question. Do you… would you still want it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so it just feels like a fair question to ask yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I’ll see you next Monday same time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next Monday, yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I’m guessing meters might be free because it’s a DC holiday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It should be free.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

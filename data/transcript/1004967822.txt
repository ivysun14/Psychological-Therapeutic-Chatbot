<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I'm sorry, Louise. I do not like to hear that you're almost falling down climbing up the stairs. And you know what? Our next meeting is on the 2nd of January, which is Wednesday, so by the 11th I'm going to work on getting us the time over there. I think noon would probably work for me on Fridays. Would that be possible for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You got that machine working, right? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's gone, right. Turn off incoming phone calls. How close did you come to falling? [00:01:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty close.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my God. Where were you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Coming up the second landing. If I had bent down to pick something up, I sometimes just lose my balance all together. I can't bend over and pick something up. I had pushed this up through on the landing there, but I bent down to pick it up and I almost went completely over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you can't be climbing the stairs. No. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry you went through that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No problem. I'm making sure I didn't have two different shoes on. Oh, God. So, let's see... [00:02:05] I think I'm definitely close to being over with Mark. Yeah. I don't want to see him; I don't want to talk to him; I don't want him over to my house, you know? Slowly but surely he kind of killed all the feelings that I've had for him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Since he made that comment about sex - I forget what he said specifically - but it killed a lot of the desire you had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just when he calls he'll ask, "Is Deborah there?" Nothing like, "Hey, Louise. How are you? What are you doing?" It's just like, "Look - does she have any pot?" "No, she don't." "Okay, bye," and that's the end of it. He doesn't bother to come down - nothing. [00:03:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, he treats you like a girlfriend. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I think I'm just finally ready to say, "Fuck you. Don't bother coming back."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where has that been between the two of you? Treating you like a girlfriend and treating you like a love interest? What have you noticed from him lately?</p>

<p>CLIENT: His excuse is that Deborah's always... He and I can't had a conversation alone because Deborah is always sitting there in the room with him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's been big, too. [00:03:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: We can't sit and have a normal conversation anymore because she's there listening. And, of course, all he wants to do is smoke marijuana and drink; and I don't need it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, though, you're getting at maybe one element of something that's been lost between you two, which is, I think, an intimacy that you had together when it was just the two of you. You could talk, I would imagine, in a different way. Sex was available there to you guys. You felt like you could do that in privacy. You had the necessary privacy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We could no sooner get into the bedroom than Deborah would be back in the apartment so, of course, that ended that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is it your end that minds it? His end? Both together, that she's there? [00:05:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I could see that. You don't have privacy. It's a small place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know he's got a lot going on at home with the daughter. We can't even discuss that now between us. To me it's just like, hey. You've got your own problems. Straighten them out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't share that much with you anymore?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. You don't have to treat me like a piece of shit just because you have your problems. He's been ignoring me so - hey.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's been ignoring you, too? [00:05:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So, as I said, I'm just ready to get him out of my life. Of course, I say that, but then I always wind up letting him worm his way back in, which he'll probably do after the Holidays are over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about the Holidays, do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know how to explain the Holidays with him. They've always been like this. As soon as there is a holiday coming up, he ignores me or will pick a fight with me. "You can call me at my other phone any time you want. You can call me on Saturday and Sunday." I said, "No, because that's your time with the family." "I don't care. I miss you guys on Saturdays and Sundays, so you can call me." [00:07:09] He called me on Sunday asking if Deborah had pot. I said no, so he wasn't interested in coming by. He started over on Monday. Never showed Monday. Tuesday they had something up at the school yesterday for the daughter, because she's already not going to classes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the charter school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There are maybe only two or three students in the class. It's been two weeks now and - a week - and they already have to go into a meeting because she doesn't want to go to classes. She's sick. She doesn't want to go speak to her worker because she has nothing to say to her. [00:08:10] And if I suggest anything, he just doesn't want to even listen, even though my suggestions are probably correct. He doesn't want to listen. I had asked him, "Tell me something. Does this psychiatrist or psychologist have a degree in helping trans-gender children? Is that what she deals in day in and day out?" "No." I said, "Well, don't you think you need to get her somebody who deals with these things day in and day out?" "I don't know. Deborah is doing this and Deborah is doing that," - his wife. [00:09:02] I said, "Evidently you're doing something fucking wrong." I guess she's supposed to be taking her medicine at a certain time in order for it to kick in, but the kid doesn't want to take it so they don't bother giving it to her. What's the sense in me saying anything to him when he doesn't want to listen to it? I go forward on it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't want to talk and engage around it, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because he knows I'm right and what they're doing is wrong - and yet he won't admit it. That would be like me talking to you about wanting to change into a male, but this is not what you're focused in on. [00:10:07] It's been nice and quiet without him. I think I might like to keep it that way. I don't need all this aggravation from him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's really, really hard on you when he kind of worms his way back in and you open your heart back up to him and he not at all. He starts to ignore you right when he's gotten back in. It sounds like you feel very ignored and kind of put off, not listened to normally. I was curious, you were mentioning that he said, "You can call me on Saturday or Sunday." How do you feel about doing that? [00:11:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. That's family time for you. It was at the point where I would say to him, Monday through Friday," or "Monday through Thursday." I was used to that. He always told me from day one that his weekends were his time with his family, which was fine by me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then he gradually sort of said "well, you can call me if you want." But for you...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he'd be like, "I miss you guys on weekends. You guys are funny. I really like coming here. You are my best buddies. You are my best friends. I love you guys." [00:12:10] I said, "This ain't love. Forget it. It's not even liking each other."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which do you mean - the no sex and...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. "You only want me for my body." Fuck you. He's so into himself it is unbelievable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's where he goes with it, though? You just want him for his body?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm like, "Yeah, right." He said, "I think I'm ready to go. See you later." [00:13:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He gives you just enough hope, though? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. "Oh, what? You don't want to be my friend anymore because we're not having sex?" I said, "No, that's not it. All you're interested in, Mark, is smoking with Deborah and drinking the beer, drinking the nips. No more. Not buying them for you. Forget it. You want to drink, bring your own, and don't ask me for the money for it either." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thing is, too, that I think he's partially right in terms of you're not satisfied about having sex. It's something really gratifying; it's not felt romantic to you. You feel like it's been some sort of weird situation where he comes over to smoke and really not to have that kind of relationship that you used to have when you were together. [00:14:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, of course, he'll tease me. He'll stand in front of me, lift up his shirt and show his chest and things like that. And so I said, "I don't even want to look at it, Mark. Put your shirt down. Forget it. It doesn't interest me." "Ooh, yeah." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, yeah, he would kind of tease you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just look the other way or I go in my bedroom and shut the door. Let him sit there with Deborah. Sit there with your drink and finish it and then leave. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, he really puts it in your face is what he's doing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, yeah. [00:15:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would it be for you do you think if Deborah wasn't there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably 90 percent better. Yeah, that sucks. I have no time of my own. None.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get the feeling that Mark doesn't really know how to connect with you when Deborah is there, in the same way that you had when you were in the privacy... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's this totally different thing when she's there. It's totally different. I was thinking in a way he can't get into that side of himself with you when she's there. How does Deborah treat him? [00:16:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So-so. When she wants to get high she'll call him and see if he's got any pot, things like that. When she gets pissed off at him she just says, "Fuck you, Mark. Get the fuck out." "I don't like the way you treat my mother," she's told him. She's told him a lot of things that she doesn't like about him. (chuckles) Fun city. I don't know. [00:17:07] I went and saw the psychiatrist yesterday. We didn't even get a chance to talk because we were so busy talking about my meds. I can't take this one med with this other med that I've been taking. She had to figure out a different formula of medication to take.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the med you can't take anymore?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't take Solexa.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: With my Imipramine. I use it for pain also, but it's also for bladder control. That's why I take that. She said okay, because I guess the pharmacy called up and said that I shouldn't take the Solexa with the Imipramine; and I'd rather take the Imipramine than the Solexa. [00:18:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what did you guys end up doing? What did you switch to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She increased my Wellbutrin. That's all we got to talk about the whole time, but then she suggested that there's a group there - I think it's a Tuesday they meet at 12:00 noon - and it's just a support group of women who are in the same situation I'm in. It's run by this psychiatrist. I forget what her name is. She was going to let the lady know that I might be interested in going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you think about the group? [00:19:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sounded okay. I'm waiting to hear back from the psychiatrist on that deal and see what happens, see if I can fit it into my schedule. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking people in your situation - a real tough one. I was thinking how it would be to have a group where they're dealing with things like how to live with a daughter that can't launch and stays at home with you, and all the complications that's meant to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to say she's back to stealing my medications. She suggested that I hide them. I said, "I hide them, but while I'm sitting here in your office she's probably rifling the whole frigging house to find out where they are. I've gotten to the point where I mark on the calendar how many pills I have left in the container, and yet I'll go to open it the next day and count them and there are four missing." "I don't know where they went. They were there yesterday." I said, "Well, yeah, that was yesterday. Today there are four gone. Where the fuck did they go?" She had me so pissed on Monday, so pissed. I was shaking like a leaf. She found this new friend in the building. Her name is Dolores; she's black. [00:21:02] The day of the Christmas party last Saturday she and Dolores took off to go smoke a bone at Dolores's apartment. Of course, the meal is starting. There's no Deborah; there's no Dolores. I go out to ring the doorbell to see if they're at Dolores's. I see her and Dolores hopping into the car and going somewhere in Dolores's car. Of course, I was 45-minutes late to the party. She's been up at Dolores's all day, every night, smoking, taking Suboxones, and having a good time at Dolores's. [00:22:01] And, of course, I've been so pissed about it because she's supposed to be minding the dog that the girl drops off every day. I'm stuck with the dog plus I own two cats. I said, "Deborah, I'm not getting up and going outside to walk this dog at 10:00 or 11:00. That's not my job. You're the one that offered to do it, so get your fucking ass down from Dolores's and let this dog out for a walk." Last night she was at Dolores's until 1:30 in the morning. Of course, in the meantime, the dog has already shit and pissed on my floor. [00:22:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Driving you crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "I'm not cleaning it. You can." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does she get paid for it? Is that it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So now it's on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been willing - well, not willing - but you've been doing it for her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she doesn't lose the gig?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. This morning she's already stoned and Dolores; and, of course, everybody knows Dolores is trouble in the fucking building. She stabbed her boyfriend a couple of years back. People said to Deborah, "Deborah, watch out being with Dolores." "Huh?" Because they know Dolores's into drugs and... [00:24:01] One night she and Deborah - she had taken Deborah for a run down to pick up some pills. I said, "Oh, you get arrested, Deborah, I have no money to pay to get you out of jail, so you'll be going bye-bye." She said, "I don't care because everybody will know I'm Dolores's bitch so they won't touch me." Dolores is bi-sexual and she's got the hots for my Deborah so bad it's unreal. Unreal. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does Deborah think of that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: She thinks it's all a big joke. I said, "What are you going to do when she forces herself on you?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Makes a move. [00:25:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Makes a move. "I don't know." I said, "Yeah, you never thought about that, did you, Deborah?" She introduces Deborah as her girl. "This is my girl." I said - ohh. Of course, my new song is "Strap on, Strap off." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's been looking since Bennett.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I said who has the dildo, Deborah? You or her?" (laughs) I tease the hell out of her. I said, "Yeah, you're just up there watching TV. Yeah." Last night I had her and Dolores in my apartment until 11:30 or 12:00 watching the basketball game. [00:26:11] I said, "Oh, this is nice." And, of course, the smoke was so thick that I had to go in the bedroom because I can't inhale the smoke. And then my friend, who's mother lived across the street when you were on Mass Ave over there and I told you I dated...? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.	</p>

<p>CLIENT: He shows up last night out of the clear blue sky. My doorbell rings. Nobody rings my doorbell except for people I know, so I ring the buzzer. It was Rob. He stayed for a while and then he took me out to eat - nowhere expensive, but we just went out. Then we came back home and he watched the game and got stoned with them and I just went in my room and played with my Kindle - my Kindle that Deborah was going to give me the money for but never did because she was supposedly going to get cash assistance from welfare, which averages to like $300 a month, but they break it up into two payments; $150 and $150. Oh, yes, so she was going to give me the money for that. She never got a check so of course you know I'm like... [00:27:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As far as you know, or do you think she did and [...] (inaudible at 00:27:49)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because then she wouldn't be able to cash it. She called yesterday and she made an appointment to see the lady. I said, "Oh, you're just doing it now? I thought you did it a long time ago." "Yeah, I did." "Oh, then why didn't you get any check?" "I don't know." I said, "Well, don't you think you should call and find out?" I have the Kindle, she goes on and charges things on the Kindle that I don't know about, and then I went to my checking account and I see $13, $14 - you know. [00:28:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does she buy? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Games to play on my Kindle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so she can play games when you're not around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Her Playstation III she's already [...] (inaudible at 00:29:04) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's bored with it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she's bored with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, then she's smoking herself through life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I heard her with it already this morning. "Uhh. I'm going up to Dolores's room for a minute. I'll be back." I found out later she's still not back, so I call on the phone. She said, "When are they coming to pick you up?" I said, "Very shortly." "Oh, I'll be down and get my keys." She comes down, gets her keys, I said, "Deborah, what about the dog on the couch? What about her? You're supposed to be taking care of her, not disappearing with Dolores up at Dolores's house just so you can get high. If you want to move up to Dolores's, you certainly can move up to Dolores's because I'm not putting up with this shit." [00:30:11] The more fried she gets, there's nothing there. It's gone. She got a letter from SSI. They haven't qualified her for Social Security. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Denied her claim.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They usually do on the first time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is the second letter, though. They disqualified her. If she gets some attorney from them, they won't take the case because all the retro money will go to child support that she supposedly owes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, they don't want to invest in the case because they wouldn't get paid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I said, "Deborah, I don't know why you never went to the courthouse and told the officer or judge whatever that you have no money. You live on a park bench. [00:31:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think she tends to smoke all of that away, all of those feelings away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like she has such a hard time with the realities of her life that... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and she's at the point again now where, "I don't care whether Darla calls me or not, as long as you get to talk to her." Okay. The kid calls to talk to both of us, not just me. She wants to talk to her mumsy. "Mumsy." Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she's kind of turning off to a lot of things, getting more involved in this pot life, life with Dolores. [00:32:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Okay, Deborah. Talk about being black. She's really dark.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Dark skinned?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. We'll call Rob dark chocolate where Mark is milk chocolate and then Dolores is dark chocolate. I said, "I don't want to hear from people in the building that you're hanging out with her and all of this stuff."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that mean to you? What kind of reception does that get? [00:33:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I know she's going to wind up getting into trouble. This one is just as spaced out as Deborah. Deborah had convinced her to go down at nighttime when daddy's working and slash his fucking tires up. Threw a brick through his car. Oh, yeah. Dolores's just as hyped-up as Deborah when it comes to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They'll do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. She's going to be in trouble sooner or later, Deborah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a miracle she's stayed out of it. Well, she's been relying on you to keep her out of a lot of really bad situations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my Deborah is into drinking Jack Daniels. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's never been much of a drinker, huh? [00:34:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. The only kind of booze she liked, though, was Jack Daniels. She and Naomi used to drink it. I said, "Okie-dokie." I never buy it for her. She just drinks it straight up. I said, "Ooh. We're really going to town, Deborah, huh?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is not what you dreamed of, huh? Your daughter becoming...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not going down a good path at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Life sucks and then you die. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really troubling to you. It's very distressing. You know, she has moments where she rights the ship a little bit here and there; gets back in contact with Darla a little bit; gets some regularity to appointments with the psychiatrist and the therapist. I don't know. I think sometimes it sounds to me, Louise, that sometimes when she starts to confront her life in some way, she quickly moves back away from it. She starts to get really overwhelmed of the realities of her life and just wants to smoke herself into forgetting it all. [00:35:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. She doesn't have to see this new psychiatrist until February. He gave her a three-month supply of her medicines and the psychologist hasn't called her to come back and visit with him. So you know Deborah is not going to go out of her way to call him up and say, "I think we need to talk," you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think talking is too much for her, facing up to these realities in her life. It's a lot. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, God. I don't know. Maybe I should just do drugs like they do and learn how to smoke marijuana, you know? [00:37:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the appeal, do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, maybe then I'll be just as spacey as they are and not give a shit about anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not give a shit about anything. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're off in la-la land, why shouldn't I be in la-la land?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, there's a certain kind of freedom from any kind of distress or realities of life. La-la land.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this girl, Dolores, you name it - she's got every drug going. She's got Valium; she's got Percs in 5's, 10's, 40's, whatever. She has methadone; she has Oxycontin; she has Fentanyl patches; she has medical marijuana. I'm like oh, okay. [00:38:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's a drug store. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. One of these days they're going to find her up there passed out. Deborah will be on the floor next to her. Then maybe we can send my cousin, Mary, up there and the three of them can overdose. I said, "Oh, does this mean I can send Mark up there when he calls?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, a whole group of people trying to forget about their own miseries. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that's why Mark drinks, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Smokes. [00:39:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's to forget about things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you've been the one, just like with his daughter, with Keisha, trying to have him face up to his life and reckon with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Never going to happen. That kid is so spoiled. She won't even get up and make herself a piece of toast. She'll call, "Dad, I'm hungry." "Put something in the microwave." "No, will you make me something?" This kid won't even get up and get a bowl of cereal for herself. I said, "Okay, does she do any chores?" "No." "Oh, all right." It was supposed to be "her dog," but Mark is the one that walks it. If she doesn't want to go to school, she doesn't have to go to school. I said, "Hey, as much as Deborah didn't want to go to school, if I had to I would have sat right next to her in the classroom to make sure she was there." [00:40:40] "Oh, but she's so smart," and ba-ba-ba-ba. I said, "That's not the point. Mark, my Darla is an all-A student. She's got the highest scores on her PSAT's. She's already been accepted at one college and then another college is interested in her, too. "Has Keisha gotten these offers from colleges yet?" "Well, no." I said, "Well, I don't know, Mark. Is she as smart as you say she is?" [00:41:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think that's your point about Deborah in some way - engage in her life in that way fully, go to school, go to class, deal with the friends and all of these situations. She's kind of backing away from it trying to avoid it all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can't she join these after-school programs? Darla joins them all. She joins the drama club, she joins this club, this club and this club. She taught herself how to play the guitar. She taught herself how to play the piano. Mark's daughter, Keisha, draws nice, very good drawings. She's just the same way. She loves that. I don't know. Is this kid smart or isn't she smart? I don't know. He tells me that she is and ba-ba-ba-ba. Okay. [00:43:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, listen, Deborah has a lot of - you saw her grades from high school. She has plenty of potential. You must see in Mark the warning signs of what happens when you start to withdraw from your life. You see in Keisha some parallels between Keisha and Deborah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Deborah is like, "Oh, she's my kind of girl." Good luck. He's got his hands full with that one. I said, "She must love you coming home blasted all the time." "Oh, she doesn't know I drink." (laughs) Right. Tell me another one. [00:44:17] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a tough time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said I'd just like to go to sleep and never wake up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can identify with their smoking, just go into la-la land. There's a lot of pain you're confronting. You've been in her confronting a lot of pain with me over this time. I think what seems to be different is that you somehow have the strength to do it, to really look at these things - look at the pain you've had to endure and talk about it, put words to it; speak from that place. [00:45:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. If I mention anything to Dr. McCormick about increasing my pain medication, it goes in one ear and out the other ear. The pain medications I'm on for my chronic pain do nothing anymore. What can you do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a lot of different pain, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you feeling about the Holidays?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They suck. I went and bought a Playstation for $280. I took her shopping last Friday and I spent another $250 for clothes that she needed. It's just one thing after the other. Does she appreciate it? No. She thinks I owe it to her. [00:46:36] I owe it to her to buy [...] (inaudible at 00:46:40). I owe it to her to buy clothes for her. I owe it to her to put a roof over her head. I mentioned to the psychiatrist yesterday about how my meds are missing. She said, "Do you want to call FE? That's abuse, taking your pain meds." I said, "What the fuck are they going to do?" The kid needs a place of her fucking own. And then I don't care if she fucking smokes money in the night. I just don't like the odor coming out of my front door when people are walking by in the hallway. [00:47:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Plus you want your privacy back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I smell marijuana and it's coming from Louise's"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you know she kind of puts you in a dangerous position in terms of your housing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She's not supposed to be there. She's been there almost a year. And then she's writing to Bennett on Facebook under my name and telling his girlfriend that she's nothing but a fucking slut and the girlfriend is writing back to her saying, "Leave my fucking man alone. He don't fucking want you, you bitch. And if you think you're so smart, I'm fucking crazy. I'll take a two-by-four to you." This is all going on my thing. [00:48:24] On my Kindle one day - I have AOL on my Kindle and Facebook - and out comes Bennett's name on this little square that says "Facebook." It says "Bennett." I said, "What the fuck are you doing now?" And the girl is saying she's saving all the messages and ba-ba-ba-ba. [00:48:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, she was used to be addicted to Bennett and she's addicted to pot, too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "I can stop."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the key is right underneath it. But the pot goes first above everything else, in front of everybody on the planet - her own daughter, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You figure she's doing her Clonidines, her Abilify, and then she's on Zoloft, and then she's doing all this smoking, drinking the Jack Daniels, putting the Suboxone pills under her [...] (inaudible at 00:49:40). [00:49:44] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not getting her anywhere. La-la land, as you say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't talk to her. When she was small, I would send her to the store to get flour and she'd come home with sugar. I have to write a note now when she goes to the store.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's tuned out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go to bank, go to Rite-Way, pick me up my script and a newspaper. It's like having another five-year-old at the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It reminds me how you see your cousin, Mary, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's going to be Deborah, falling asleep in the yard. She sits on the couch, she nods.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Listen, I'll have my phone with me the entire break. I'll see you on the 2nd and that will be the last meeting here, okay? All right, Louise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okie-dokie. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can I bring anything downstairs for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm all set.</p>

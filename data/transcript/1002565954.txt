<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  We'll do that later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.  No problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What's up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well you know I've got an [DEIDENTIFIED] agency.  My business is going like extraordinarily well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ooh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, I just still [INAUDIBLE] anything different, but I still just struggle, you know.  I struggle with this depression problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know it's a thing but obviously to some degree I'm overcoming it because, you know, there were times in the past when I wasn't doing, you know, too well professionally as you know cause some of the times I was doing nothing professionally but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But this is despite taking Remeron and Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes and a lot of it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wellbutrin at 450.  Yeah and Remeron at 30?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Taking what, ah, yeah 1, 1 Remeron and three 150—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did we ever try Lamictal?  Do you  know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We never did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, ah, well over, oversimplified it's an add on for people who are kind of resistant or the depression is resistant to the antidepressants.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It hasn't, it's really a mood stabilizer but it has its own antidepressant properties.  It started out as being as a seizure drug, so it's been around a long time and it's not dangerous or anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well let me, let me tell you how, how I feel about things.  That might help you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To tell me.  You know I, I have to push through symptoms of depression.  I just have to like every day, you know.  Now obviously there have been times in the past when I didn't push through it.  So this is an improvement but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's a constant battle, you know.  It is a constant battle to keep working hard, to get up and get going, to not let things, you know, bother me.  You know, like, like we got a couple of computers a few weeks ago, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean there're no fun for anybody usually really.  You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Especially if you're a perfectionist and you want it just right, and those damn things never are just right.  You can never, you know what I, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's because it always come back.  It's, it's you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That makes it even worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] worse but it's not really you because it shouldn't be so damn—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hard, tricky.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hard for an intelligent person and end up being him.  You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I know exactly what you mean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like handing you the keys to a new car and say okay now you got to do 473 things before this thing will go.  You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like why can't they do?  Anyway, it just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're getting, ah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I get—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You shouldn't be as irritable as you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am very irritable about that damn thing.  In fact, I'm having to redo it all this weekend and it's just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  I know just what you mean or [NAME OTHER] will type a, she'll be at the end of a 3 page report but for some reason the thing will just erase it.  It's like, oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well tell her to, there's an automatic saving device on some—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Somewhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  You tell it to like save it every X minutes even when I don't save it.  Anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a good idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's because I've lived through that.  But anyway, um, you know, then to push through it all the time, you know, and, um, shoot if I didn't have a business partner to kind of get me up and get going who knows what I'd do, you know.  Seriously.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's the partner?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, a good friend of mine who I worked with in radio and we decided to open this add agency.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But ever since I started taking Remeron, you know, it makes it easy to sleep but 50 pounds heavier.  At least—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, man I'll tell you, and, ah, you know how these mirrors lie.  You know, there're all made to lie, right?  So someone took a photo of me like a couple of weeks ago and I said, Jesus that's me.  Jesus Christ, you know.  I mean really.  So there's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well in the mirror it's just gradual so you can deny it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well the mirror, the mirror they purposefully make them to make you look 20 pounds less.  You know that especially in stores but ah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well photographs will put 5 to 10 pounds on you.  Just, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, all right sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're still overweight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah right.  Okay so I'm 35 instead of 40.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well if we try this new thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well tell me about the side effects of that.  That's important to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I haven't had any people have problems with side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At all?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  You see cause it's a seizure drug.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Doesn't make you sleepy because it, otherwise they wouldn't have been using it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And those people take a lot more than we use.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Every day.  The only thing it is, I'll have to tell you about it.  You have to build it up slowly so it's to the point you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the reason for that is they found that, ah, if you did it too fast or started off with a big dose—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A big percentage got a allergic rash somehow from it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then you couldn't use it cause you were sensitized to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you, you just got be a little patient in the beginning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I'm taking none now so I can be patient.  Um, what will have to do to the dosage of my other?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well we'll just leave them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I take a lot—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't want to play—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, you like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well it's kind of a lot.  I mean it's on the high side but it's not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Every time there's a new pharmacist—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At the [DEIDENTIFIED], he looks at my things and he just, you know, gives me this big lecture.  He wants to go on and on.  I said, you know, and it's like look I've doing this for 8 years.  Please, you know.  Do I have to go debate this with you, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But he is right in the sense that 450 mg is like even beyond really the considered upper realm, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I got 10, 15 people on 450.  All the, those—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anybody higher?  Anybody more?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those, some people more, 600.  The trouble with 600 is that's what they started out with when they tested the drug.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And people got seizures, you know, a, a, a percentage that you would not want, like 7% or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, that's too high.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Therefore, they have sort of a seizure warning, but nobody ever goes to that.  I mean that, that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're desperate, you're desperate when you go on the 6.  Yeah.  But 450 plus another one, yeah I got, I bet if I look back, though, a bunch of the people I've had on that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've put on Lamictal and we, then it's, we start lowering the other one, you know, the other ones Wellbutrin or whatever—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause you may not need them at all but we don't know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You mean in other words you may not need like Wellbutrin if Lamictal works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is that what you're saying?  At all?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You've actually had people go down to like none?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When they've been taking quite a bit?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just Lamictal.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?  Really?  This usage is fairly new I guess, huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's another approach.  You can do both at once and that's, ah, which certain, I just, you know, read this stuff, there's certain people, ah, I forgot what the percentage was, 18% or something of people who don't absorb enough folate, that's a vitamin,  into their brain—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when they do, when you give them this super vitamin, the antidepressants then work better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So this would be a case where if I had that circumstance I would not be absorbing enough folate?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Now we could try that first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] how much I take is it?  Cause I have taken folic acid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	These, ah, yeah I know but, ah, I have the pills here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There're like some formulated differences of like some super folate.  What you buy over the counter could never deliver as much as this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mother used to take one for her heart condition.  Maybe it's similar.  I can't, what's the name of this?  Do you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh this is new stuff.  [INAUDIBLE] is the name of one of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We could try that first.  I'd say you have to give that probably 3 or 4 weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But you said also I could try that and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could try both but we wouldn't know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wouldn't know which one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which one.  Yeah.  Well let's see, the Lamictal will take you, ah, let's just say 4 times 4 is 16.  It'll take a month to get it up to where we'd want it, and therefore, you'll be taking this other one for that month.  That'll be the trial of that.  The Lamictal won't be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Start it first with both so that if something happens quickly we know it's not the Lamictal.  Is that the point?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause, cause if this, if it worked, the other worked—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll know it's the vitamin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The other if it works, it works like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Real fast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like in a week or two?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I would say—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a good thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The articles didn't say that and that's and I just have people come back in a month, the ones that it's helped, and they say yeah it definitely helped me, and then other people will go, no everything's the same, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So let me—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It does make it a little tough, though, to figure out what's what when you're doing that way, aren't you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  They cleanest way would be to do the vitamin first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is that what you recommend?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's maybe more benign if it works than the other one?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.  I mean it's not a drug.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just a vitamin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's a medical food.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So why don't won't we try that?  Could we try that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's try the medical food first.  Let me get some.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Okay and I don't, like, you know, maybe, maybe the other one—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] say it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like have with me so I can do it some or I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, yeah we could do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I kind of wish I could get off that Remeron.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well I mean, ah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I tell you because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you want to do that one first, let's do that one first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In other words if, if things do better, the only thing is the very positive for Remeron is it allows me to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sleep.  I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But since I started taking it, I haven't exercised and I haven't stopped eating.  I'm serious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well you could exercise at least 3 times a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think the exercising part is a, a hangover of the depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of course, a lot eating is a direct thing of that Remeron cause I tell you man, oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Okay here's the [INAUDIBLE] and that's 1 a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  So this is the vitamin, huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Okay 1 a day.  Um, does it make you a little queasy?  Probably should take it on a full stomach?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  I've taken it, ah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I thought I'd try it myself just for the hell of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's free but it didn't, didn't do me anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No?  Hoping it'd make you feel better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To make sure I had plenty of folate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm, you know, I'm [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well it's good for your heart anyway, right, at worst, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, see the thing about getting, you know, about eventually stopping the Remeron is it just helps me sleep and you might remember, that was a hell of a problem I had almost all of my life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, ah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A hell of a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It might, if it made the drugs work better or your brain respond better—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then we would just need less Remeron.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I see what you're getting at.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or maybe you'd respond better to something else, so it has a lot of possibilities.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  So we'll just kind of like don't try to over triangulate right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  We don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just see.  You know me.  I can't help it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you're going to have to be patient with this one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well maybe.  I've been doing this for 10 or whatever, 20 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  This now, do what I tell you.  You start taking this.  Don't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There are instructions in here.  Don't follow them, they, they take longer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The only way to open this, so to do this we want to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know I weighed 160 pounds when I started taking Remeron.  I weigh 200 now.  I swear to God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know I've been thinking, you know, now I'm going to start making some money and it's like, so what?  I mean, I mean money's for more than what I want to talk about but it's like I won't have any fun because I'm 40 pounds overweight.  You know the old joke about I wouldn't join a group that would have me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"Yeah. "</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wouldn't want to nail a woman who would want to nail me right now because she's probably 30, 40 pounds overweight herself.  You see what I'm getting at?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but they might look after a while or else lose weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They don't look good now they ain't ever going to look good.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, let's put it this way—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm a victim of my earlier—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"Let's put it this way.  I never thought I'd be having sex with a 64 year old woman either.  "</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've, ah, I have, ah, wondered if I could ever do that myself, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well when you both get there, it's a different story.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm a victim of, seriously, you know, I mean, I, I really had a lot of [INAUDIBLE] looking women, you know, and it's like I can't change my view.  I don't know.  What can I say?  I just am not attracted to overweight women.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well it become where you draw the line too, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean I would not be attracted to the 300 pound woman or 250.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyway, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what you got to do with this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you decide to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So how much—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If and when you decide to start.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How much is each of these pills?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Twenty fives.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] these.  These are hundreds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This says 100.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, okay.  Okay so the next one up is, it goes from 25 to 100?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So once I've done three of the 25, the next step is to go to one of 100s, huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And somewhere around there you get back here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you're taking 100 or 150.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	These are what, 56 of these things?  Fifty six 25s, huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That should be enough to do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or some combination of breaking these.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I'll get my calculator out.  This, this, this therapy sounds like it's made for somebody who's anal retentive like me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, definitely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Analyze a lot of it ridiculously.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mg, you want the 90 day ones still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  I also need, um, here's, here's a symptom of my depression.  You know, it's like today is, all the pills I have are for today, you know.  I, I [INAUDIBLE] got to go to the doctor so I'm costing myself a bunch of money cause I, instead of mailing in nineties I got to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] now just for, to get a couple of weeks worth.  But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, so, um, I'll leave you alone while you're doing that.  You're doing the 90s now, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you know less, less Remeron doesn't necessarily, ah, if I remember from my [INAUDIBLE], sometimes less Remeron causes more side effects than more.  Is that right?  Did I remember that right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  But I don't think that's necessarily true if you've been on it as long as you have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I tell you, I love the ability to fall asleep.  It, it doesn't drug me to sleep, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you need any sleeping pills or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, yes I do.  Um, I've got a bunch of unused prescriptions that are out of date.  So let's see, I've been taking Ambiens and, ah, what's the one that doesn't give you that horrible taste in your mouth?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sonata you took.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So [INAUDIBLE] Sonata.  Um, I just had like a, like 30 of each I could just go send it off to my insurance companies thing and they'll just, it'll only cost me like 20 bucks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thirty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  In other words, I can get, I can get 3 months of any of these for like $20, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't need 90 of those.  In fact, I won't even use 30 in a year.  To be honest just having them helps me fall asleep, not taking them.  You know why?  I don't worry it.  I know I can take them.  Therefore, I don't need to take them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Those people carry Xanax around just for that reason.  They never take them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean like a big part of, if you have an ongoing sleep problem, you know, and the big part of it is worrying about it, you know, which then causes you not to fall asleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Now you want like a 30 day of Remeron and Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Yes please.  That's pretty funny.  I never thought I'd have sex with a 64 year old woman.  To be honest, I don't think I've ever kissed a woman over 40 other than my, my mother or my aunts and they obviously, ah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't matter.  Of course, that's because I've been out of commission for 20 years, you know, being broke and everything else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of advertising are you doing for anybody that comes along, any kind, anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I've got 3 car dealers.  That's huge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know car dealers on a consistent basis spend more than almost any kind of business.  You know they have to be out there every week.  Got 3 car dealers.  I mean when we opened our doors we had 3 car dealers.  That's impressive truly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It really is.  Got a company called [DEIDENTIFIED].  They send, ah, like stacks of postcard size little advertisements out.  Got them.  I think I'm getting ready to sign [DEIDENTIFIED] in a couple of weeks.  That'll be huge and I think I'm going to sign [DEIDENTIFIED] in a couple of weeks.  That'll be even huger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got, ah, I got [NAME OTHER] as of course you know who he is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, ah, appears in his ads.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been working with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good thing [NAME OTHER] had a good year, then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well let me tell you.  It was in the middle of his, right after his break out I said to my client, it's good to buy in an up market.  You can get him now cheaper than you'll ever be able to.  It was like after about his third 100 yard game, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] pays 1200 bucks a month for [NAME OTHER].  Think about that.  That's, I don't know if you know but I mean that's pretty cheap.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, when I see him I'll tell him you said you can like tackle him with one arm.</p>

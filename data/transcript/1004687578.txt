<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Come on in and have a seat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why I'm so angry at everybody. Getting off the interstate I was looking at my phone and the car in front of me literally had moved 15 feet and the person behind me lays on their horn. I pull out and as soon as I pull out they go zooming up around me just to get around me and in front of me. It was like, "Okay, you're now one ahead of me, you know? I tailed them the whole way and if they had pulled into the center parking lot, I would have followed them and said something to them. I was ready to do that, but they kept going. And then I'm at the coffee shop and the line goes in and you get your drink and you keep going. This couple—first the lady comes back the other way through the line, "Excuse me", pushing me out of the way. Then the guy comes. You've never been to a coffee shop before or in a queued up civilly? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. These people. It was like, "Have you ever lived in a civilization?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Know how a line works? [00:01:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you tourists? Do you come from Kansas? (both chuckle) I don't know why it gets to me so much. Then, of course, I went to the registry yesterday and I had to do some work. I run into the office to do work and it just happened that someone I used to do loans with needed me to look over something so I said, "Yeah, I'm in the office. Come on by." And while I was there Jess stopped in. It's not like she berated me, but just in a very condescending way she said to me, "You know if you're going to have meetings in the office, you need to tell me." I was like, "Well, that was kind of spontaneous. I was in here." I'm in shorts and a t-shirt. Clearly I wasn't . . . And then she was, "Well, I meet with clients in here and I work in here and it's hard to work with two people," you know? Finding a reason to say, "You let me know from now on when you're going to be in the office." I literally make the decision 15 minutes before I go in. She's becoming a royal pain in the ass. [00:02:34] Then she sends me this e-mail and into the e-mail she goes into how she's put up $4,600 for taxes. I've gone back and I've calculated it and I've put up over $3,000 for taxes. You're getting $2,600 a month and I'm making a mortgage and I'm getting $1,500 and paying $1,400 and I still only have half the rent from May. So it's like I'm sick of her shit more and more every day. At some point I'm just going to tell her to go fuck herself. The thing is I do that and everything else falls apart, you know? I had to order new checks today, which is over $100 for new checks. I'll probably have to order them for my other bank account, too. By the time we break up I'm only going to use half the checks but I need new checks, and you can't order less than 250. [00:03:45] </p>

<p>In some ways she kind of holds all the cards and I hold nothing. It's why I feel like I have completely nothing. I have control over nothing. She said, "What time do you want to see the kids on Sunday? I don't fucking know. I don't fucking care, you know? That was really my attitude. It's Father's Day. I'll decide on Father's Day when I want to see them. Don't have big plans. They're not going to make me breakfast or nothing. She's going to see her father. I don't know. I'll get some book or some picture or some more clutter for my apartment, a card to hang on the frig that will fall off and get in my way every time I walk by. Do I sound disgruntled?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. At least this much. [00:04:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So Karen wasn't at Frisbee practice yesterday and she was marked as a "yes". There were quite a few no shows. People didn't show up. So when I got home—we're talking about twenty to twelve at night I sent her a message through Facebook that said, "Missed you at practice. Maybe it was because you were up too late playing Words with friends." I was just trying to be humorous. I haven't gotten a message back. I'm like, "Did I say something that could be mistaken in there?" Did it sound creepy or just the mere fact that I sent it? Could she just be so busy? Obviously she was probably working is why she didn't go. Or is she a non-responder? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Just for the transcript, he just shrugged. All he did was shrug. (both chuckle) I don't hear anything weird or creepy in what you wrote. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. (chuckles) Well I'm anxious about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah. [00:06:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe she doesn't have access to Facebook at work or she's a non-responder. Who knows? But it's eating at me. The purchase and sale agreement says that they will receive the remainder of the purchase price through a wire, certified funds like a bank check, or a trust account check. They want to leave right from the table and go to Florida. First of all, they're not supposed to get their money until I get it on record. I think we might have discussed that. So I've already bent over backwards to give them money at the table before we go to record, and now they're making a demand that they want certified funds. They're not going to turn over the keys to the buyers—they're having the mom move in right after the closing—until they have confirmation of payment. I'm taking a $42,000 check, depositing it and then wiring it back out. I'm not real comfortable going to a Manchester branch at my bank and, having them never seen me before in their life, be really okay with it. I've really got to drive to the registry in Merrimac, drive back to Beverly, deposit the check, and then send the wire out. So it's going to be two or three hours before, at earliest, before they get the wire. Normally I wouldn't give a shit, but it's my contact's client that's getting fucked over this. I pointed it out to them. [00:08:25] I'm going to sit there. I'm going to walk in there and I'm just going to drop the purchase and say, "Is that your signature? Does that say trust account check right there? Explain to me why you want to breach this agreement." I've never done anything like that before, but that's how I'm going to start out the closing with these people because I'm that pissed off about it. I've bent over backwards for them and they're being assholes. I know there's a huge mistrust of attorneys in New Hampshire. I deal with it all the time. Builders specifically put certified—you're less likely to have it happen with a Massachusetts attorney. Maybe New Hampshire attorneys do it all the time where they fucking bounce their trust accounts, but I've already gotten into fucking shit for that. I'm not doing that again. It's fucking asinine. I'm all stressed out about this closing. We just got the clear to close today. I'm not going to be getting the documents until that morning, so I'm going to be rushing around. I have another closing I have to be at that evening. I can't go to my end-of-the-year soccer party because I've got to do this other closing. It's like I'm busy but I'm not busy enough to be stressed out over being busy. I'm just bitter and angry and stressed out. I've got a one-to-one meeting right after this with the executive director of the farm. [00:10:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems today like you're kind of . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Changing the subject?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Go ahead. It seems today . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you're kind of . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Fired up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, fired up . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ready to kill?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, as a part of that, laying more of this in my lap in a way that you usually don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not blaming you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you're not blaming me, but it's like you're sort of like, "And what are you going to fucking do about it?" (both chuckle) [00:10:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Someone better fucking do something about it. I tell you, when I left here yesterday and went to the fucking tax lawyer expecting to just sign and go. First of all, he originally told us that we'd be paying $150 a month to the DOR, which is now anywhere between $300-360 a month. So that's doubled. I left there and literally I'm just thinking to myself, "I don't know how I'm going to do this. I don't know how I'm going to get out of . . . I literally just was like, "I'm just better off killing myself because there's no way I'm going to get around this." Business is not going to pick up to the point where I'm going to be able to pay the DOR, pay the IRS, pay my rent, pay my wife, pay all my bills for the office, pay health insurance. My car is—the transmission is starting to go. I've just got so many things being thrown at me and so little coming in. [00:12:07] It's like after these two closings I've got three where I'm representing the bank and I'll make at least a grand or more—well four—and then I've got one lined up for July where I'll make $750. That will either cover my insurance or my rent. I just had to send $500 off so they didn't cancel my insurance for my office now. I have no blinds. I need to get blinds. I have no furniture. I don't have a coffee maker. I don't have a little frig. I don't have anything to put water in to water my plants. (pause) [00:13:05] The guy I've been doing titles for probably owes me $1,000. It's like when am I going to see this money? I don't want to have to be shaking him down every month for my money, but some of these have to have closed. He just sent me one for March and there are a bunch that I did in April and May that I haven't gotten paid on yet. And then I had a rush title for this other lawyer which—it was a rush and needed to be done, so it should have closed. I need my money. I'm complaining about something I do. I don't pay people right away because I don't have the money, but both of these are successful lawyers with good cash flow. It just sucks. It all sucks. The captain of the Frisbee team tells me last night how great I was playing, but then he decided to tell me that last two you were "sucking ass". Those were his exact words. [00:14:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was sweet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Hmm. Was there a compliment in there?" Maybe I only look better because I was sucking ass last—you know. I don't know. I was going to say I'm going to meet one-on-one with the woman from the farm, Executive Director, Claire (sp?), and I'm the only one the board who was not put on a committee. She knows things are all fucked up in my life. She's probably going to ask me how much I'm going to donate to the farm this year and I'm like I don't know. I really can't commit to anything. The only thing that's keeping me on the board is that I'm a lawyer. They have to have somebody they can pick up the phone, call and ask legal questions to, and that's it. Otherwise, they probably would have asked me to get off the board. Deep down I feel like some kind of suggestion is going to come up like that. "Maybe you ought to take some time off." They took away being treasurer from me. [00:15:51] They didn't even leave me on the finance committee. They left me off the committee all together. I'm on no committees. The only board member—did I mention that?—that isn't on a committee. So I'm just a board member. Show up at the board meetings. That's what I do. I'm sure there are some positive things out there but I just . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not right now apparently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . . but they're just a little lost on me. I mean I've got all these closings but it's June when I have them and they're going to be gone and once they're gone they're gone. I don't know what to do. I haven't even thought about—I haven't made a fucking payment to my student loans in like three months. I haven't even thought about paying them money. I called Jess this morning and I'm like, "Can you ask me in person what you wanted in your e-mail?" She was like, "I don't know. I don't have it in front of me." Something about scheduling and something about money. I'm out of scotch, too. (snickers) You seem concerned. Do I buy cheap whisky? Do I buy an ounce of cheap whisky? Do I buy a nice bottle of scotch? Something that makes me feel better. [00:18:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What shows you're really in dire straits is that you're asking me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're supposed to tell me, "You shouldn't be drinking. Don't drink."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that's worked really well. (laughs) I mean, that's not true. I never said, "Don't drink anything."</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Don't drink and drive. Don't fucking drink and drive," I think were the words you used once.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, absolutely. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if that included my bicycle or not. Biking drunk a little bit lately. Buzzed. Biking buzzed. (pause) My meds clearly aren't doing the trick. I guess I'm supposed to bring that up with the psychiatrist. [00:19:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think part of this is that you're angry with me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's all about you, isn't it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, not all of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What am I angry with you about?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For one thing, not that much has changed in the circumstances of your life since yesterday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's gotten much worse. I went and saw the tax guy. That really bummed me out. It really did. That's what got me thinking more about how fucking this is not going to turn around. I had to deal with these fucking idiots who are demanding a bank check and will go to the keys. Can't even get a response on Facebook. Being told that I'm not going to have my documents until sometime Friday morning. All that's happened since yesterday. People in the line at the fucking coffee shop. And all the assholes out there—and I hope I'm not including you in this—that don't understand when you have your wipers on you should have your lights on. I can't see you when it's raining and it's dark and it's foggy and my wipers are all fogged up. I've got a free pass because I have daytime running lights, so I never do that. My lights are always on. It really drives me crazy. It's how people get into accidents and die. Do you put your lights on when you put your wipers on? Do you have daytime running lights? [00:21:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not answering any of those questions. I think you changed the subject two or three times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's all the same shit every day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is exactly what you just told me it wasn't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now you're using my own words against me. (both chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope I'm using them for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what way have I shown anger towards you? I mean I have a general societal anger. As a member of society? Yes, I'm angry at you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if you are mad unconsciously for what I said yesterday to do with holding you responsible for things. [00:23:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't even remember. (chuckles) I doubt it. Refresh my memory, my recollection.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I said something like, "Look, you basically come in and unload stuff and when I actually try to say something or say you might have something to do with what's going on, you don't want to hear about it. You usually try to change the subject or make a joke out of it." And maybe you weren't very happy with my saying that. Maybe . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: The truth hurts? Is that it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Or like, "Get out of my fucking way. I'm upset about some stuff and I want to just talk about it. Don't hold me responsible for shit or tell me some stuff may be my fault. I already feel like everything is my fucking fault. I already feel like I'm fucking everything up. I don't need to hear that shit from you. Let me fucking talk. Get out of my fucking way."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't be Jess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:25:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're not condescending when you do it, though. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll have to work on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I need to see another therapist just to deal with my current therapist. Do you know why people see two therapists? Because they . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. It's very important that the person you deal with about your current therapist is your current therapist. (both chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. But there are people who see two therapists, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Usually only for very different types of treatment. In other words, you might see one therapist for a very behavioral or kind of behavioral treatment like OCD symptoms or cutting yourself. Something like that, and then see another therapist more like to talk about stuff. But you don't usually see precisely because you don't want to do what you're suggesting which is like going off someplace else with your problems about your therapist. But that was fine. [00:26:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Another beautiful day in paradise. Even Charlie Sheen has a new sit-com. It's like, "Can a person fuck up more than he did?" It's like I haven't even really done anything that I think has caused me to fuck up. Maybe not having the patience of a condescending, evil wife. Maybe that's the crime I've committed. I'm of the school men weren't meant to rear children. It's not my fault that I don't want to spend time with them. Not that I don't like them or love them or whatever I'm supposed to. It's not my bag. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:28:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even now I still can't get away with anything because Ian throws me under the bus no matter what I do. Something we did that I thought for sure he was going to tell Jess. Maybe he didn't or maybe he did and she just hasn't brought it up yet. She's waiting for a time she has nothing evil to say to me and then she'll bring it up. I can't remember what we did. We did watch Two and a Half Men and he asked me what sex was. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you trying to get a rise out of me? (both chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I'm telling you exactly what happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, but you look like you're waiting for me to say something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to figure out whether I did something horribly wrong or not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, oh, oh. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All I said was it's something adults do when the male flower takes his pollen and puts it into the female flower. Here let me show you this scene from The Wall. Do you know the scene I'm talking about? Pink Floyd, "The Wall". They've got these two flowers dancing around and then it gets very sexual and all of a sudden the female flower opens up and goes "womp" and eats the other flower. (pause) Are you hot?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sweaty. Maybe it's just because I'm drinking hot coffee. [00:31:34] Do you have the heat on? It's June? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're welcome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See. That's something I would need to talk to another therapist about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you can always pretend . . about what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What should I do when my therapist acts like a cock? (both laugh) I guess I could just ask you that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it hurtful when I said that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think it was hurtful, but I felt it was, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well tell me. I'm actually interested to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unprofessional. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How? How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you're supposed to be tough-skinned and take whatever is thrown at you. I have to do it all the time. That's why you realize I'm not going to walk into the closing, point at the signature and point to where it says "trust account check" . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . that I'll be nice as pie to those people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I can get away with that, sort of, but maybe a cock.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you acted like one. People do things that are out of character. It wasn't a huge transgression, but it came across as, "Oh, it's just one more thing you're bitching about. Me." You're welcome." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no. I know I was being snippy. To my mind I felt like I was kind of bantering back, but I guess it didn't feel that way to you. In other words . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that what was going on, banter?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I thought but maybe that's not what you thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Explain to me. I'm really . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. That I know. That wasn't banter. For me I felt like I was trying to be sensitive to the heat so I'll turn the heat down, though I'm not hot. And then you're giving me shit about . . . (both laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did. I mean you have the heat on and it's June. You're like a little, old lady. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: A cute little sweatshirt on or your knit sweater, a little cardigan. Now I know what to get you for Hanukkah. That's just an instant reaction for me. [00:35:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean coming up with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Saying things like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. See, I guess that's why I thought, to me, it sounds like kind of light, bantery stuff, although you're clearly kind of zinging me a little bit there, but I . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was making a point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which was that I'm like a little old lady?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You shouldn't have your heat on in June.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean what do you have your thermostat set to? Are you cold? (pause) So do I have you all discombobulated today? (pause) [00:36:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that it's probably a good thing. Yeah, I guess I think that in you seem to want me to be off balance and discombobulated and I think are antagonizing me. I could imagine a number of reasons why you would be doing that, but I'm not sure . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: You're afraid to tell me because then I'm going to be angry at you subconsciously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) No, I don't think so. I think I'm just not sure what's going on. It could be because you're angry at me. It could be because you're kind of changing the subject in a way or trying to keep me off balance so that I'm not thinking as clearly about what's going on with you because you don't want to be talking about that. [00:38:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, then why am I here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everybody's ambivalent about coming to therapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is there a high suicide rate among therapists?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Among psychiatrists I know there is. I'm not sure about therapists in general. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Just you saying everybody's ambivalent, you know, it's like dentists. There's a high rate. People don't like going to the dentist. People aren't ambivalent about the dentist. They're outright scared. That's what makes me brush my teeth in the morning. They channel that fear. I don't like being reprimanded by the hygienist. I've got enough women in my life telling me where to go. [00:39:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I guess my hunch then is that you want to be keeping me off balance or kind of needling me some because Jesus fucking Christ, everybody's doing that to you all over the place and often in these situations you have to smile or be nice or be polite or just somehow put up with it or deal with it. You're saying it's like the shoe is on the other foot. I'm supposed to be thick-skinned or sort of polite no matter what. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You're just supposed to go, "Hmm" . . . aren't you? Like instead of saying, "You're welcome," you should be like, "Well, what does he mean by 'I have the heat on in June?' Is that a real attack on me?" I don't know how you analyze these things. You probably have some process. Maybe you don't have a process. You seem pretty disorganized. Sorry. [00:41:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now's the part when I'm supposed to be polite? (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm having a bad day. You? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm okay. I'm sorry you're having a bad day. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Contrary to what you might think, it's not your fault. I just thought for a brief moment there last week that things were changing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is pretty tough to take. (long pause) [00:44:18] </p>

<p>CLIENT: So what did we learn today? Anything. You seem very contentious. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it's helpful for me to know anyway that part of why, at least from my perspective, you sometimes give me a hard time is because . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: I give everyone a hard time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want all of us to have at least some little taste of what it's like for you all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. Maybe it just seems funny. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like that. I mean, yeah. Like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What were you going to say? Don't get defensive. Don't start putting on a filter. Speak freely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever is on my mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just be professional about it. (both chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. Until Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, Tuesday, if I can make it that long.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let me know if you can't.</p>

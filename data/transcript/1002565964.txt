<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you.  You can keep that brochure that way you can kind of look at it.  Okay.  Uh, when you were here before, I think the question was that your family was thinking that you were having mood swings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That you were having instability and that you were having trouble sleeping and we were going to kind of watch that and see how that went, and see how you did and that sort of thing.  So how are things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're good, like, ah, the Benadryl, it helps me sleep.  Like I can go to sleep better, but I still wake up in the middle of the night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So do you ever have to take a second one?  Like at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does it work okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It puts me back to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how many hours do you think you sleep like from the time you go to bed at night until you get up to go to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I go to bed at like 12, like probably 7.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So 7 hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Six or 7.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now are you, are you pretty, pretty busy then up until 12?  Or are you just hanging out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just hanging out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	'Cause I know you were saying before that, that you also were going out some at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my curfew is 10 now.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have much schoolwork to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not really.  And you're graduating this year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you going to do next year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Go to school and try to figure out what I'm going to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	'Cause I know you talked about, didn't you say something about you wanting to be a teacher?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So where are you going to go to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not sure yet.  I think I'm going to start off at [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a good school.  Isn't there a new campus in [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's not new, they're building onto it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  'Cause I.  'cause I know that they had, they had the campus further south [INAUDIBLE], but I didn't know that.  [INAUDIBLE].  So, so the Benadryl helps.  What about this thing that your folks were talking about, this mood swing thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know if they see it anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you see it?  The [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I never really seen it, but I did occasionally.  Just not all the time like they say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When, when I  think of mood swings I think of periods when people are outside normal, either way up or usually in the, people, when people are depressed, people end up being depressed or they say, oh, you know, she's depressed or I feel depressed.  When they're in the mood swings, it's usually that they're up and down.  Or that they can get up too easily or they get too excited or too enthusiastic, but then they crash.  And that's kind of when people talk about mood swings that's kind of what I think of.  So was that what they were talking about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess.  That's what my mom said.  I've never seen it though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't believe it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When, when parents have bipolars, they, and they think about when they started feeling out of control, they sometimes realize that they were feeling the, the, the swings when they were teenagers.  And so, I think, and then, they find out, of course, that it runs in families and I think that's when they get concerned.  So, [INAUDIBLE].  So you're feeling pretty good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And skills progressing well and graduation's coming up and prom's coming—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm excited about prom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Going on a cruise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is the prom's themes are always [INAUDIBLE], there's always something do to with going on a cruise or something, boats and palm trees and all that stuff.  Yeah.  So, is, is, do you think your school is busier now that it's your last semester or easier?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't know.  It's really, it's pretty much the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Just the same, same workload?  Now are you taking regular schedule, full schedule [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I would have off periods and stuff, but I'm in cosmetology so it takes up 4 class periods.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, okay.  So will you do that during college?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do hair and stuff?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So now, do you have to get a license?  And just take an exam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Next month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Next month?  Wow.  So, if you do the cosmetology in school, how long does it take?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two years?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Your junior and senior year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So is that usually afternoon or mornings or is it 4 hour period every—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We have, we have, uh, A and B days, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And there's 4classes a day so 2, I'll have 2 regular classes and then, 2 cosmetology.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have did you get into that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just like it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  My mom does hair, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a very special skill.  It's not easy.  You guys make it look easy, but for those of us, you know, they say, well, you have this and this color's off and you go, how can you tell?  Well, this is too long.  What do you mean too long?  How could you, you know.  So you like it though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you consider doing that as a long term career?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, but I wouldn't make that much money though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Unless I got into like a really good salon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know.  The gals I know drive BMWs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  They do really well.  They do really well.  They got so much work they have to, one of them is so busy she has to have somebody else do all her washes and then she stopped doing all the nail work because she couldn't do that so she has to have somebody do all her nail work.  And all she does is the cut and style and she's getting to the point where doesn't even do color anymore.  It's, she'll mix the color, but she doesn't put it on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Color is my favorite.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're a colorist.  That's a new word that I never knew before.  I learned that word about 6 months ago.  Someone came in and said, I'm a colorist.  And I thought, a what?  Is that like a house painter?  And she said, I beg your pardon.  Yeah.  Color is a very, very interesting thing.  Interesting.  No, they do very well.  And I don't know that, I mean, I think they, you could argue, I mean, you could say, well, do they make more than a college graduate.  I don't know.  It depends what you get your degree in, but I think they make more than teachers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They do?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think so.  I think it's worth talking to some, some people who are really busy.  Go to some really good salons and see and really talk to them.  And or do, now, will you work this summer doing cosmetology?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that would be a good opportunity to find a salon, you know, needs somebody and, and see what the business is like.  There's also that part of it, it's all the product sales and, you know, all that, you know they go to these, these conventions and competitions in Miami Beach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lots of this stuff going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a big business, big business, so, so at this point, your sleep's okay, your mood's okay, you're not having swings, things are stable right now and the Benadryl works for sleep.  Okay.  Well, what we might do would be, I mean, we could schedule say for, you know, like schedule I can see you like in the summer just after graduation.  Or you can kind of see how things go when if you need to come in again 'cause if you need, if you need to come in, it probably would be because you're starting to have some fluctuations.  And we might need to talk about some medicine.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So would you think that would be reasonable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Any questions for me or anything that you're not sure about or concerns that you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really, other than like how do you help the anxious feeling, you know, I don't know, I gave up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it's something that is caused by something that you can put your finger on like I always get anxious before tests or anxious, always get anxious before I have to go on stage and sing, I always get anxious before I, we have a game that I have to play in or I always get anxious when I have to go to like the mall or is a lot crowds or I have to travel on an airplane or all those kinds of things that are very specific causes.  There's a, there's a way that we deal with those.  If you have anxiety and where it escalates and get things get out of control for no reason that you can see, like spontaneous attacks, we have a different approach to that.  They both might involve medication, but sometimes they, I mean you can use medicine in both settings.  What kind of anxiety are you having?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know 'cause I don't get nervous taking tests or anything like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I don't know, it just comes and then it'll go away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long does it last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For about 10 minutes, 15 minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you ever have occasion when you, um, would have enough anxiety that you would think about taking a Benadryl.  And would Benadryl help you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It would put me to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would it?  I know it would put you to sleep at night, but would it put you to sleep in the daytime?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I don't know.  I'm just, I'm just wondering if that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't tried it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's another medicine that we also use that happens to be a prescription medicine that is, has some similarities to Benadryl in, in terms of its safety and so forth, that we sometimes use for that kind of anxiety as well.  Then there are the other family of medicines like, you know, Xanax and Ativan and all those, all those medicines that are specific for those panic syndromes.  So those are possibilities also.  But, um, how often do you have them?  Everyday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you think that they are severe enough that you would want to try one of the medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Give it a try, I mean, I mean, kind of see how you do.  Kind of keep an eye on things.  Start paying attention to when you, when they come, how regular they come, what seems to be going on at the time that you have them.  See if you can pinpoint causes and issues that are, that are, that are at stake.  And see what, what you come up with.  And do you want to come back and see me then in a couple of months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Before graduation?  Okay.  One of things that would be too is, if you have anxiety that you can control, that you can say, well, you know, I get anxious and so what I do is I, I go sit down and I close my eyes and I slow my breathing down and I focus and I kind of meditate, and I bring things under control.  It's the anxiety that precedes and escalates into a panic attack are the ones that sometimes people really have trouble with.  And part of the problem that occurs with that is they start, they could start getting short of breath.  And when they get short of breath, they over breath, and if they over breath, they change their body chemistry.  They have a, what's called a hyperventilation episode.  And that precipitates this panic.  So if you can, if you can see it coming and you can sort of bring yourself down, focus, control, slow your breathing down instead of increasing your breathing, you can shut your heart rate down and it'll also bring the attack under control.  And that allows you to gain mastery over the, over the anxiety.  And then, that's a good thing 'cause you're going to have lots of anxiety off and on throughout your life, like we all do, you know, so, this—Okay.  You can also come back in a month if you prefer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't care.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your preference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I guess I'll come back in a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  See you then.  Okay.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're welcome.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so we had our last meeting on [DATE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you missed a session on [DATE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you had a consultation with [NAME OTHER] yesterday.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm sorry, [NAME OTHER]. And as of our last visit in January you were on Wellbutrin XL 150 in the morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And Seroquel was 50 mg at bedtime.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take 50.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's what the record says.  When was the last time you took your last Wellbutrin dose?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I would say a week and a half ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So one and a half weeks ago and how about Seroquel?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had it last night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you have been taking the Seroquel regularly but you skipped the Wellbutrin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I quit taking the Wellbutrin.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why's that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> High blood pressure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> High blood pressure?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Very high blood pressure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wellbutrin causing that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  I could feel it, it felt like it was causing it.  I've never had blood pressure that high or near that high.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How high was the numbers?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was like 165/100, before that the highest that I'd ever had was like 140/90.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you had...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Typically it's around 120/98.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Given your age, you are now just about [AGE], right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are being treated for blood pressure before all this happened?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.  Because medications like Effexor and Cymbalta are known to cause blood pressure elevation, particularly Effexor.  I have never heard about Wellbutrin though. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I went on the Internet and looked it up and there was some stuff people took, I mean, I don't know how the information is of course, but there was some talk about it causing in some cases very high spike in blood pressure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you are now only on Seroquel?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes and I feel like it's lower.  I went to the, to the health center at school and had my blood pressure and it is lower, 140/85.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's still for you age, high.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely, it runs in my family.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It does?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes but it's never been this high and I'm in the best shape since high school.  I mean, I run, I've been running regularly which I haven't done since high school.  I've been working out.  I've lost like 20 pounds.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You lost the weight.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I gave up eating meat for Lent.  I mean, I was expecting it to go down but...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The other thing is that, when we're talking about blood pressure, if it runs in the family, sometimes you might want to have your kidneys checked out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because even though body weight and diet and all those things have a lot to do with the blood pressure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They actually aggravate or increase if the problem already exists.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There is a blood pressure thing called primary hypertension, that means it just runs it the family, we may not know what the reason is, all we know is that we have it but there are lots of other kinds, as young as you are, some kind of kidney problem can cause blood pressure elevation.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you might want to check with your family physician.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And say, this is what the issue is, I'm young, I'm active, I'm not overweight, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, why should I have this kind of blood pressure because the number you said, 140+ and 85, even for you, that's pretty high.  You should be, the lower number should be somewhere in the range of 70, 72 or something like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the higher number ideally should be 110, 120 maybe.  So look into that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now, having said that, when you are on Seroquel only, what is it doing or not doing for you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's hard to tell.  I mean this is the first time I've been on Seroquel by itself.  It's been a short amount of time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I still feel like there's a little bit of effect of Wellbutrin and....</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You stopped the...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just quit taking it.  If I went from taking nothing to taking Seroquel, then I feel like I would be able to [INAUDIBLE] that, but...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The way it is, your diagnosis, I have diagnosis bipolar disorder Type I for which Seroquel can be a treatment but as a single agent, means not with nothing else, and at a smaller dose of 50 mg, I doubt that would be enough.  Typically in bipolar disorder Type I, I am very very cautious in terms of using any antidepressants because antidepressants in Type I actually can create mania but I am very judicious and very watchful.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If it is Type II, the issue is totally different.  Sometimes we treat with a typical mood stabilizer like Depakote or Tegretol, or Lithium or something for bipolar disorder Type I and nothing else, maybe a little bit of a sleeping pill.  And again, there are a lot of times when you are on full correct treatment, still you can have breakthrough mania or depression and there are [INAUDIBLE] might not be on anything for an extended period of time, you may not have no problems because this is not continuous, this is episodic, it comes and goes, comes and goes.  So even though you don't look like, clinically you don't look like manic.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, you're sitting quietly, you're talking normally.  How are you doing with your sleep at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many hours are you getting?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Eight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And when you wake up in the morning, you feel that you have enough rest?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Typically, yes.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any unusual crying spells or feeling that there's a knot in your throat.  I wish I could cry?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No when I need to cry, I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How often does that happen?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I cry once a week, twice a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what will make you cry?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sympathy or compassion for a sad situation.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sad situation for you or for someone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] weeping or anything but you know...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does anything specific have to happen to you or somebody else?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's usually a specific circumstance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And do you feel good about those crying or do you feel bad about it, oh my God why am I crying?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I feel good about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think for me personally, if a crying sort of situation gets worse, you know, I'm going through my depression, I feel like I want to cry but I can't but I feel like I want to cry all the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> My job is to prevent those from coming or if it comes, make it as far apart as possible and as less intense as possible.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's my job. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's okay to cry, isn't it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely.  I always encourage my patients that there's absolutely nothing wrong in feeling the way you want to feel.  Expressing emotion is what makes up human beings.  If we do not express our emotion, then we are robots which we are not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And again, expressing emotion needs to be in a constructive way, not in a destructive way.  Just because you're a man, I'll say you're a man, go and hit the pillow, don't break the wall.  Breaking the wall will be a destructive way of expression.  Hitting the pillow would be a constructive way.  I'm asking you to express but do it in a more acceptable way.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All my wall are intact.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> As of today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Don't know about tomorrow, right?  My thinking is this, have you had any recent episodes when you had a lot of racing thoughts in your mind, your mind is going on 160 miles an hour?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not recently, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Unusual spending? Spending too much money?  You need a lot more sex? No? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Didn't happen?  How about the opposing spectrum, have no energy, don't want to do anything, let me sleep, don't bother me?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I feel that way but I know how to, you know, control it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How do you control that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just [INAUDIBLE], you know, do what I have to, I just take care of what I need to do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's why Wellbutrin would have helped you.  Not Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, let me back up. Any antidepressant, okay?  In your case when I saw you the first time, that was December of last year, you mentioned that you had episodes of depression for almost ten years and I'm talking about our session on [DATE] and you classically described those things that we call major depression and you also had periods of mania which last for one to two weeks which are classic mania.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you have on one hand what we call major depression because you're meeting the book criteria for that and you also, on the other hand, have mania which you meet the criteria for, full blown mania, and that's why you're bipolar 1.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In this situation, a little bit of antidepressant will be possibly good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have been on Adderall in the past.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that's why I went for Wellbutrin.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because you also have a history of an alcohol problem in the past.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I wanted to avoid the Adderall which is an addicting medication. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I went to Wellbutrin and it looks like we got into trouble with the blood pressure.  Have you tried any other antidepressant, for example, Lexapro?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I tried Lexapro.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did it do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I felt like it helps, I did, I felt like it helps, not as much as the Wellbutrin.  To me the Wellbutrin was like, it was amazing, but because of the blood pressure I want to get away from that but I'd be willing to try Lexapro again.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And when you did try the Lexapro in the past, did you try the Lexapro with something else or only Lexapro?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Only Lexapro. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now you'll be taking it with the Seroquel.  I'm not going to stop the Seroquel.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So Lexapro will be on top of that.  It will kind of replace the Wellbutrin. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Treating the depression part with the Lexapro and I'm treating the manic part with the Seroquel.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In certain situations when I'm having difficulty, I add a third agent like Depakote or Lithium or something.  In your case, I'm going to hold back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What do those do, the Depakote and the...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Depakote, Lithium, these are the typical mood stabilizers.  They don't want you to go down too far with the depression.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or go too up, too far up with the mania, that's why they're called mood stabilizers.  Seroquel type of medication originally was designed for treatment of schizophrenia.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That we talked about before.  Lately, we are using it as a mood stabilizer as well and because you also have trouble with sleep, I have five or six drugs and I picked the Seroquel, not because it's a sleeping pill, but because as a mood stabilizer.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which can help you to sleep.  So I'm trying to keep the regimen as simple as possible and trying to avoid medication that has any addiction potential because of your past history.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Either Lexapro or Seroquel, neither one of them are addictive medications. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just to mention that Lexapro, because you are a young guy, might have some negative impact on your sex like, particularly erection.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which was a benefit for Wellbutrin.  Wellbutrin doesn't do that but if it happens to you, let me know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Please do not try anything like Viagra or Cialis or Levitra like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because I used to use them a lot, now some research data came in that some cases of sudden blindness have been reported and people who have taken this...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is it reversible?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We don't know.  That's what my problem is, that I know that blindness has been reported but further details, who was susceptible, who was not.  If my patient has some eye problem, what do I do, such thing, I don't know, that's why I said blankly, until I know more about it, I'm not going to use it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And if you can go over it again because it's been a while since our first meeting, you told me about the long term, some of the long term side effects of Seroquel.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Seroquel, as I mentioned, originally was designed for schizophrenia.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Over a period of time it has been used as a mood stabilizer and that's what I'm using here.  In a short term side effects, there is a thing called extrapyramidal side effect, which means people can certainly develop a jerking movement like that or very painful [INAUDIBLE] cannot rest like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's if somebody will have to have it, it can happen in a matter of a day or two, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The long term side effects, we look at three things. All three of them are possible, but rare, but possible, number one is tardive dyskinesia, tardive means chronic, dyskinesia means abnormal movements.  Some people develop involuntary abnormal tic like movement and I'm watching you, you don't have none, that's one.  Number two is called neuroleptic malignant syndrome.  People who are sensitive to these drugs can develop sudden kidney failure.  If it was the case for you, it would have happened already so I'm not that worried.  The thing that we have to keep in mind and we check from time to time, the Seroquel group of medication also can create diabetes and might make lipid control difficult, cholesterol control.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So we do check it from time to time just to make sure that nothing like that happens.  If something like that...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The long term that would affect, the blood pressure?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you develop the cholesterol, say if you have 200, 300, 400 cholesterol, yes it will affect the blood pressure.  If you have uncontrolled diabetes, yes it will effect the blood pressure but we'll be checking it from time to time.  As young and active as you are, I'm not that concerned, but I have an obligation and I will be checking it from time to time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To make sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the most common thing is if it does happen, all we need to do is stop the medicine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any other questions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have enough Seroquel at home?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. So I'll write you a prescription for the Seroquel and I'm going to write you a prescription for Lexapro as well but I'll give you some samples so that you can start and see how you do.  If you have no major problem, then you can fill the prescription for the Seroquel, Lexapro.  Seroquel you already have tried so that's not nothing new to you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I guess the Lexapro is the best option we have as far as, you know, sexual side effects.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Of the ones that we have available considering the fact, Effexor can cause blood pressure problems, my answer would be yes sir.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And whenever you take Seroquel type of medication, obviously you have to be careful driving.  Make sure that you are not too dangerous a driver because you are sleepy or something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  I only take it right before I go to sleep. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You only do what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Take it right before I go to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it's not a sleeping pill so you cannot go without and take some days and not take the other days, you have to take it every day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, absolutely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sleep is just a byproduct, that's not the primary purpose of this medicine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right but I take it before I [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That'd be good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, so how long?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how much time you spend before you go to sleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I try to do it about 30 minutes before I go to bed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If it's any longer than that and I actually have to sit down and like do homework or grade papers then it makes it...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how is the MCAT preparation going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's moving along.  You know, I'm just trying to stick my head in the book as often as I can. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And when is the test?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know. I just started studying and the Friday that I wanted to do this was two weeks ago, so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'm in the beginning stages of that.  I need to find out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's one area I'm not jealous of you.  I'm so glad it's over for me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll see you back in about four to six weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how often are you seeing [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Every couple of weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Is it working out all right with her?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's going great, yeah.  I think we fit well together. She's a sharp lady.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She sure is. Okay, here is your prescription, Lexapro 10 in the morning, a months' supply with two refills.  Don't fill it yet, use the samples first.  If you have any problem, call me, if not then go ahead and fill the prescription but the Seroquel you already have tried, I wrote 50 mg one of them at bedtime, a months' supply with two refills.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I'll see you back in four to six weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if you wait for me at the counter, I'll meet you there with the samples, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right, great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thank you sir.  Wait for me there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

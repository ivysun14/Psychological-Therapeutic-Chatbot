<p>PATIENT:  (4-minute silence) It's funny, I find starting talking very hard still in the beginning.  Something can even be on my mind and just breaking the silence, I have to f—, really force myself to do it.  Like, I can just see I always choose something really innocuous (chuckle) to say, so I can do it.  (Pause) One thing that's been on my mind quite a bit lately and sort of bothers, well, it's always bothered me, is uhm, my great desire to be organized and sort of get my life organized and know now what I'm about half a direction and then just do it and especially to stop procrastinating which I so often do because I'm not too sure how I want to approach something so I just keep putting it off.  And this fall I was feel—, again another aspect of feeling very good at the beginning when I started teaching and so I felt organized and I was doing things like throwing things away at home and I knew what I wanted to do at school and I didn't have to sit around and think about it very much and, of course, that didn't last very (chuckle) long and it's really been bothering me.</p>

<p>Now this is, I'm sort of getting back into my own groove again, which is finding I just can't just throw things away or knowing I'm going to have to so I kind of say well, leave it out and I'll think about it and ending up with just stacks of things all around that I keep telling myself I'm going to have to handle someday but I keep putting off.  And the whole thing of feeling that now there's, there's some kind of a dependence on having all these things even if I don't look at them.  Just anything.  I just can't seem to throw things away.  And yet, by not throwing them away they're always around my neck and I know they weigh me down and frustrate me and I keep thinking I'm going to have to tackle them and, and I, I know it's better just to throw them out, but I have to really be sick of it, and sick of myself being that way in order to throw it out and then it will just be one massive clean up and then I'm all back again into saving things.  And also when I first started just in my lesson planning and I knew what I wanted to do and I really thought out the order of things that I should approach and everything, but I already hardly feel that I have absolutely no confidence in it anymore and I have, I want to have everything written down and, and uhm sort of it's compulsive that I keep reading what other people are doing.  And not just because I know that by reading these things I might get a good idea that would help what I am already doing, but it's really because I don't trust what I'm doing.  And, if I don't happen to read anything, I, I feel, very uneasy about just making up my plans without any crutch anywhere else.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's funny too because just sometimes things have happened so I haven't, if an idea has occurred to me I haven't written it down or some, something will happen so I, you know, I'll put them in a lesson all of a sudden and I know it it's better if you, if you can be generally organized but spontaneous for the moment and not trying to always think well what was it now that I wanted to do, or where is that thing I wrote down.  And yet I can't stop doing it.  Or if I take a course, I'll, I don't know, I'll make copious notes probably most of which I'll never look at again.  Or else I could just read the books and know they exist and I can always go to them if I have to.  But instead I just make lots of notes and spend hours doing sort of worthless work like that.  I think I almost feel, the only time I really feel directed is when (chuckle) I'm taking notes.  I know that's the way I used to be in high school when I'd, or probably through college too.  But I'm thinking particularly of a history course in high school, and, and I liked the course, I liked the teacher I had and, and I enjoyed working for it, but I went way beyond any reasonable limit on what I would do and it was so much of it just busy work anyway, it wasn't adding anything to the creation I'd made.</p>

<p>For instance I might spend hours just copying over something from handwriting to typing it or I don't know, just seemed like I was always working on it and I think I was afraid to stop working on it.  Gave me an excuse to turn to something.  And I don't think I realized it at the time.  Sometimes I might have been vaguely aware of it, but it was long after that I realized if I just had leisure time I had no idea what to do with it.  And I was really afraid of it.  Not, uh, uh, I, I think that was one reason why I was, one thing I liked particularly about the time I spent in PEC, and it was almost one reason why I wanted to go.  Because I knew that I would have leisure time and or I'd have to sort of have to find out about myself and I was hoping maybe I'd be able to develop a capacity to enjoy leisure time.  I think I did to some extent, but if I have any excuse to do work or take notes, (chuckle) I'll always do that first.  But even with throwing away clothes, the only way I can throw them away at all is to give them to somebody or to the salvation army.  And it's not because I feel I'm doing somebody good, it's just simply that then I think well, at least it isn't actually thrown away, it's being used.  And otherwise they could sit up in the attic somewhere for years and I, it wouldn't bother me if I'm not seeing them, it's just knowing they're there.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And something that disturbs me too, uhm, that happens all the time but it happened this weekend, is my almost inability to think and respond when I'm in a conversation with somebody and they're talking to me and looking at me and I, I just, I'm listening to them but I'm also, I think more involved in thinking that, what if I have nothing to say in return, or just on, I should just say something and keep them interested in talking to me or I don't know what it is exactly, but in the end of course, I can't say anything (chuckle).  And I begin to get complex about the fact that when there's a general conversation I'm sort of feeling out of it.  (Pause) Or else, sometime if they're good friends, and I feel much more relaxed but if I, and that's the only time seem to be able to work myself up to even telling a little anecdotes and something like that, but then I know I'm not very good at it, and uhm, because I get so nervous, and I usually end up just timing it all wrong.</p>

<p>So MSCZ, who loves telling them to the point of telling them too much, will interrupt and start telling it his way and then I just get so f—, really defensive and mad because I don't know, this time I'd worked myself up into just saying some things and I want to go ahead with it and I feel sort of childish then, feeling that way.  But I know that I do have this feeling that if I just, I'm sitting there and, and taking it in and totally being a listener and that I'm not contributing.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And in regard to my saying last time that I always feel I have to criticize somebody when I'm feeling friendly with them before I can go ahead and, and accept them as a friend, I guess, the, we had a couple for dinner and the uhm girl is well, quite different from me in many ways she is able to do things or be things that I would like to be able to be because she seems to stand for me, just feeling free about herself and so in many ways I admire her a great deal and I, I can just feel myself after they were for dinner, just trying to think there must be something I can find wrong with her (chuckle).  And then I, well, I realized I was doing it so I tried to stop myself but it just seems I have to do it for everybody, almost as if I'm building myself up by pulling them down somewhat.  And I'll also begin to think things in terms of the fact that they prefer being with E and talking to E than to me and I'll often make an excuse, not just then, but pe—, lots of friends and that.  If I'm cooking I'll keep myself, I'll in a way plan that I always think I've just not had enough time but it's almost as if I'm planning it so I can be in the kitchen more often and not be with the guests.</p>

<p>And I, I've never really enjoyed being hostess, sometimes I do but I'm really not relaxed being a hostess and all and my enjoyment comes more because e really is relaxed about it.  And I know, I can remember in high school thinking well, I should have parties to return to other people and there are times anyway when I would just like to have had people over and I could never really if ever bring myself to having any kind of a party and then it would be the most generally accepted type like a party when girls would come and sleep over night or something like that.  I don't think I ever had anything that involved having boys over too.  And again, I just would feel I didn't know how to be as a hostess and used to, I've always felt much more at ease when I'm a guest in somebody else's house.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because another thing that has occurred to me after I left on Friday when I was, when you asked if there were anything that I had thought of in criticism of you.  Uhm, I can't, I can't remember exactly what times it's been, it's been just lots of things like when I've been arranging what time to come or uhm, well, I think the first time I can't, oh I can't remember now, exactly what it was just, but anyway, it was just, it was a matter of planning out either the first time I came to meet you before I started or uhm, I think also when you mentioned the time I would come regularly and I, I think I had said then could we see how it went and your response was well, uhm, I remember it as being, well that's understood or something anyway that, and the other time too you had a response that to both times to me seemed very abrupt and I can't tell whether it seemed abrupt to me because I was feeling very unsure of myself and so I wanted to have a kind of treatment that I don't know, would make me feel as if I were going to be taken care of, I guess is what it really boils down to.  Because I know, I know, I immediately began to feel defensive both times when that happened, and as if, well, maybe even to the point of, I had said something stupid and you had something against me then for saying something stupid and therefore were kind tos—, of abruptly answering me.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I keep wondering when I think my mind is blank and then when I start thinking my mind is blank, well, my mind must be blank whether it is or whether, I don't know, it seems when you're trying, maybe I'm trying too hard, but when you're trying hard to have things clear enough in your mind when you're thinking them so you can, say them that you would be aware of whatever it is in your mind.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   It was after you commented on my seeming abrupt that you fell silent.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Hmm.  Well, first I felt relieved, because I think maybe I'd been trying to say it since I came in here (chuckle), it's very hard to say.  But then I thought, well now, if things will all come into my mind, and (chuckle) nothing seemed to come.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>One thing that did strike me sort of odd uhm, I think it was on Friday when I was early, well, anyway, whatever day it was when I was early and uhm, I was waiting there and there were several people around talking and I think at some point you had been down someplace else in the hall and came out and I had a reaction I didn't expect of uhm well, again this might be because of reading enough so I know too much but don't understand what I know.  Uhm, I know with children if they're having any kind of therapy they feel very possessive about the person they're working with and it's only in, it's one sign of their growing up or coming to terms with themselves, that they can think in terms of sharing person that's working with them.</p>

<p>And I suppose in a way this was an element of how I was feeling that I can think in terms of somebody else coming in here and doing the same thing I am with you, but I, I find it very hard to adjust to you being another person which is working with all these other people that I was seeing around.  And I almost had to keep, keep you in your rooms down here, or uhm, I don't know, it was, I don't understand exactly what the feeling was but it was, well, I just felt sort of strange thinking (chuckle) about it.  (Pause) I guess, I guess it was a matter of sharing you I suppose, between two different things.  And I think I can think in terms of your having another person come in here and I wouldn't it wouldn't bother me but maybe if I actually had to see it, it would.  And this was something I was actually seeing so it was bothering me.  (Pause) It seems so, I don't know, I just thought I'd be old enough not to, I guess I call it being kind of petty or immature or something that you're asking for all the attention yourself.  (Pause) I suppose that's one of the hardest things about doing something like this, you when you actually say things you realize how immature they are.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And, when you feel that, you find it hard to think of anything to say, I suppose.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I, I never know whether that's why I was finding (chuckle) it hard, if what finally I say is what was making it hard for me to think of anything.  Because it always seems to me that they just suddenly come to my mind after I'd been, you know, wondering what was on my mind.  You know, almost as if I passed beyond what was ever I couldn't think of and you know, maybe they are.  I know I, there are many times when I am immature and yet somehow just these little incidents make me realize that, more clearly than just, you know, generally knowing it.  Or also upsets me more than I thought it would to say things that make it clearer.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Something that just came to my mind that I was thinking of after talking about my father last week was that in talking about him he's just, well, I know I still have strong emotional reactions to him and things he does, but in a way he, he's just becoming more of a sort of pathetic figure in my mind.  Partly because he's old enough now so he can't really be anything else and he's spent his whole life being whatever it is he is and I just, I obviously don't agree with whatever he's been in his life and, and just at the time when I was thinking about it, it just struck me as being very pathetic.  (Pause) I was just wondering if that might, seeing him as pathetic, might just be another way of my now feeling that I am bigger and stronger than he is and now I can control him to some extend because I see him as being pathetic.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then I jump from that to animals.  And I was wondering, why?  And I, I think, I don't, I was just thinking about what is a person's, any person's need in having animals anyway.  If you're completely adjusted and mature maybe people just wouldn't want animals around because it does seem that most people want animals because then its something they can dominate over, order about, get affection from without having to do too much to it.  And at least these things are all things, I, I'm sure I like having in animals.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And it's been funny too, uhm, keep wondering well may—, it is a sign of a weakness in yourself that you do want them and I was thinking of the fact that, with my parents.  I think my mother liked the animals all right.  We always had dogs and cats but, or other animals too, but I, I imagine that we had them mostly because she thought that it would be nice for us to have them.  And now my, we had two cats when most of us left the family and uh, my father became very attached to them and then now there's just one and he's extremely attached to that one and uhm for years when we were in the home and these cats were there, he used to always say, "Keep, keep them in the kitchen.  Don't let them come in here."  And he would never go near them because he was supposedly allergic to them.  And he used to be really nasty about where they could be.  But now he cuddles the point where I up to this one, and has it in his face and it's got, it's got to think my mother would have it put to sleep if she were the one to decide.  My father won't part with this car.  It seemed a kind of funny reversal for him to make.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I guess I was thinking back to this feeling I have when I'm, I'm the one who has to converse with another person and there's not a third or a fourth person there and uhm, I, I well, the thing that I was thinking of particularly was, there is a science teacher in our school who's quite talkative when he gets going.  And uhm he's very enthusiastic about what he's doing, which is really nice, but then he keeps going and he never seems to stop and you know, say what he has to say and leave.  And sometimes the only way you can get him to finally stop is by just not really participating.  But today he was up talking about something and I, I was finding I couldn't really participate even for the short time he was there and again it seemed like almost the weight of carrying the conversation was on him and me and I couldn't stand up to it and it just occurred to me now I, I, think I've lost complete judgment on when something is just plain not interesting to me so there's no point in my participating and when it's a matter of my feeling too insecure to, or feeling incompetent, that I can't, because I'm just inclined to think in every situation that well, I just couldn't, was incapable of doing anything.  And I never think in terms of well, am I interested, do I want to, and if I don't want to, can I just leave?  Which is true of other conversations when they're going on and people are around.  I'm afraid of missing something so I never can just leave if I know I'm not interested.  (Pause)  And I can feel myself, when something's happening around me somewhere I have to know what it is too, so I'll listen even if it doesn't concern me, almost as if I'm afraid I'll be left out of something.  And that way, I'll know if I'm being left out, if I listen and hear what it is.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Then I think of, I don't even know when I do, sort of gauche things but, but something that happened today is kind of typical of my just not knowing.  I was talking to a mother and there were a whole lot of mothers around picking up their children, some of them were mothers that I knew from several years ago.  And I always get kind of nervous then, I don't know why, except I guess it's almost like, I mean you have to kind of make acknowledging comments to them and I'm never too sure if I'm going to put my foot in my mouth, so I always get nervous.  But when I was talking to this mother it was something that we're both interested in and then I didn't know how to end it, and I do this so often, I just sort of will almost leave without ending it.  And then after I've left I realize that I really hadn't ended it and then I'm not sure whether I did end it and that it doesn't have, the ending doesn't have to keep dragging out or whether I really did just sort of abruptly walk away.  But I know I'm so busy thinking about myself and how awkward I'm feeling I stop thinking in terms of the other person and maybe, what (chuckle) they would consider an ending I, I don't know, it's just, you know, I always feel after that I've done something wrong.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Our time is up.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (6-minute silence) My mind just still is on school and everything I've been talking about all week.  And I was thinking of something that bothered me today just, it was just for a few seconds, which made me think I probably talk too much when I'm talking to the boys, or give directions too many times.  It was, some of the boys who were, there were a couple of boys who were quite quick to follow directions who looked a little, well just sort of, well, why does she have to say it again, expression on their face.  And just thinking about it now made me realize that I think this week, on top of everything else that's bothered me, I've just started the thinking of, not only do I feel inadequate as a bore, and, and the whole kind of thinking that I go through, I went through, or teacher but the children must hate having me as a teacher or find it a I still do sometimes, about how you must find it awful to sit in here and listen to me and how I find, well, I think that when people have to talk to me at parties they must find it awful.  And now I'm thinking about it in that way for school.  And when I think this way I get so, it's not only that I'm confused about what I want to do but there's, it's almost that I get afraid of the children.  And, I don't know, I just can't seem to do anything. (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>And then I began just now thinking about things I can do at school.  And it was on the idea that I've been working on different independent activities but it's almost as if, after thinking a very depressing thought then I have to think, what can I do about it so that the children won't mind having me as a teacher so much or so they'll like to have me or something of that nature.  (3-minute silence) And thinking about all this in circles, the way I keep doing, certainly for this whole week, has just made me just feel so tired so I don't even feel I can break the circle, whatever it is.  (Pause) And for some reason, today anyway, I'm finding it very hard to talk about it.  I keep thinking it's because I've said everything already and, I don't know, somehow it bothers me to, it bothers me that I'm harping on it in my own mind so to have to say it aloud bothers me even more.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I think perhaps one of the things that I particularly don't want to talk about today is something I believe it was yesterday I started to talk about.  And that's my feeling right now toward my assistant.  And just today anyhow, and I think yesterday after the mother left, uhm, it's almost a feeling of jealousy that she can naturally and spontaneously handle the children in a way that I would like to be able to.  And the only way I can feel equal to her is that I know more about certain aspects of teaching than she does.  But she basically handles them better than I do.  And this really bothers me.  (Pause) And when it bothers me in this way, part of what bothers me, I think, is feeling inferior to her.  And then part of it's the fact that I think then the boys respond much better to her and, of course, then would like her better.  And then it makes me think about what is it I'm looking for from the children or asking from them.  And it's something that I think it's almost the same thing as what I ask from animals or, if I had a child, I'd ask from a child, of just having them be obedient and very dependent on me and responsive to me because I am the source of everything for them.  And I think I want that in, at school, although I cover it up by telling myself all sorts of other things.  (Pause) The comparison just came to my mind: it's almost treati—, my treating the children the way a child would treat a doll and imagining the doll's response to her, in what I would like from the children. (Silence)</p>

<p>And thinking about that reaction to the children makes me go back to feeling so inadequate as a teacher and just thinking about everything I do as wrong.  And I began immediately to think about something else that struck me today, on how, the way I pace things, the way I change things or the way I am with them, that I'm so erratic.  I'll either, instead of introducing things slowly, throw something all at once, new, a lot of new things at them or else I'll one day be strict and the next day be lenient and one day be sure of myself and the next day be so unsure.  And it's just creating a very confusing situation or atmosphere for them.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Have you yourself found yourself in such an atmosphere where you feel one day you were being treated leniently and the next, very strictly?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I don't think so because, at least in recalling how I felt at home, which is immediately what I started thinking about, I re—, I recall always knowing what I could get away with and what I couldn't.  And in a way, if anything, my mother was the one who was more lenient, although she was, she had limits that we just couldn't go beyond ever.  And my father was always strict in that he was always yelling at us.  Well, it seemed like there was practically nothing we could do.  So, but, but I always knew.  (Pause) Seems like the only time I have experienced that atmosphere is when I've created it with myself.  If I'm not feeling particularly good about myself then I'm very hard on myself and when I am feeling alright about myself then I'm not so hard.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And yet you contrast, and you have before, several, many times, ah, your father's, ah, limits and your mother's.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I don't know, it's just, I so automatically assume them now that it's hard to think of them in these terms as being confusing and back and forth without warning.</p>

<p>ANALYST: That's not exactly what I had in mind.  What you, what you seem to say is that they did have different set of requirements, your mother and your father.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes, I think so.  (Pause) I suppose the way that would have confused me was the way I took in both of their sets.  Because I've often been sort of surprised at how much I'm like one of my parents and then I'll, another time I'll be so much like another.  And I suppose this is part of it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>After saying that it seemed as if I were holding myself to the train of thought which wasn't getting anywhere, of, well, if I know that, how does it apply to this problem I have of being so irregular at school, and then how can I change, how can help it?  And I just sort of, how is it going to help me to know this?  It seems to so often bother me when I see different connections so that I can't even think further on the connections.  It's all part of hours in high school doing it, of constantly analyzing what I'd done and what I was and so forth, firmly believing that if I did, then I could always become better.  And it was, I thought what I was doing was sort of the something I used to do, well, I still do it but it seemed like I spent thing of know yourself but it wasn't that at all.  (Pause) It's almost as if, if you can review all the things you do that you don't want to do or the things you've said that you wish you hadn't said just by sort of cataloging them, you'll never do them again.  And all it really does is sort of makes me feel overwhelmed at all the things I do that I don't want to do.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I'm back to thinking about very specific things to do at school as if I'm just making lesson-plans in my head.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Coughs) This, uhm, difference, ah, in your mother's and father's, ah, attitudes, strikes me, has its counterpart in what you described this week when you said that if the headmaster knew what you were doing he'd be horrified.  But when I asked you, you said specifically that your advisor encourages you.  And again that's the dilemma that you feel in, who are you going to follow, your inclination to follow the supervisor and incur the headmaster's wrath or keep in good with the headmaster and be unhappy about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) And I think in a situation like, well, the one at school, if I could just do what I personally thought was right as far as working with children then I could handle this dilemma.  But either I can't or I won't let myself think about what I feel is right or come to a decision on it.  I tell myself I don't know enough about education yet to really know but it's almost as if I don't dare.  Because what I might think might be a third thing.  (2-minute silence) I just kee-, it's so difficult today there must be something that I'm just not willing to let myself realize I'm thinking.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just trying to let the time go quickly and not think about it and ... up and down the elevator when I'm alone and work on my monologue. I mean the one thing I think it will do for me is make me organize my time much better and when ... and make me work much harder because I will have less time to spend on what I really want to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder though if you're really letting yourself get fully into the fact that you HATE this job. That it sucks, that it's ... you know, I kind of start to hear it, and then I just hear this kind of, "Well, they tell me that they're going to ..."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no, yesterday I did. I guess that today I figured I would just ... I mean if I'm THERE ... I mean, I've got to contribute something. Beth can't do it all. She wants to ... she's been carrying me for a long time. That's not fair. I have to ... I have to bring in SOMETHING. Until I can figure out what else I can do and only work FOUR days a week or three days a week or if I can get this job to go to 2:00 instead of 3:00. That would ... that one hour is a big, big difference. Originally (ph), it's just five hours not six. You know, to get out at 3:00 in the wintertime, it's like, well you might as well stay until 5:00 because it's almost dark already. I just don't work ... I don't create well at those hours. I don't. I work in the mornings, (inaudible at 0:01:31) nighttime [it's over. I can't do] (ph) shit (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you took ... so you took this job because ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Strictly for money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For money.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if things ... the way they are comparably so, it's more than a lot of people are making doing that kind of work, you know, for customer relations. I'm really independent, nobody ... I'm working by myself. That makes it a little easier. I just get the orders, I (inaudible at 0:01:59), I put it all together on a card and go and take it and everyone who works there is very nice and people who work at Washington Mutual Bank are very nice. It's a nice atmosphere but I just don't want to be there all the time. And it's also like a ... you know, I was thinking about it yesterday, I was pushing this cart around ... I did this five or six years ago and I'm still doing this work. [0:02:23]</p>

<p>And it's frightening and I don't want to stay in that mode. I don't want to get there and feel "Poor me" because mostly ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's frightening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's frightening that it will always be that way - I'm always going to be in the fucking customer relations crap (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you just said something afterwards, that you don't want to get to that "poor me ..."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to fall ... because things are different. I'm not in Ohio (inaudible at 0:02:43) I'm in Chicago. I'm writing now and I wasn't writing then and I believe in myself more than I did then. I just don't want to go over that line and be negative and think that things will never change. But it is frightening, it's like, you know, a drink ... you're an alcoholic ... always know that he's available (ph) to take a drink.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if you were to be negative about the situation now, it would be sort of getting into that feeling that, "Hey, I'm stuck here and I'm not going to change ..."</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was nasty yesterday, I was really ... I hated (ph) ... I went back to old ... you know, thinking the whole world is rotten because of everybody else and just being really agitated. And I AM really agitated, but I don't want to be like that. I want to be a ... if I'm going to be there, I want to make the best out of it. And I was thinking last night, "What would be ... what could I really get out of this job besides the money? What else can I get? And who could I meet? What relationships could I make besides friends and what relationships are going to make ... help me in my artistic (ph) career?" I mean, I'm in a BANK for Christ's sakes. Maybe I can get the money out of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just ... figuring instead of trying to think the other way - I'll be sick whenever I'm working, miserably sick - how can I change this into something better? (whirring sound)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling) Is that the camera? [0:04:08]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) (chuckling) It's a warthog or something. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I lost my train of thought. But I'm curious about ... I guess I'm a little curious about that feeling that you're stuck and that dealing (ph) (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Stuck, trapped, elevator, subway ... I don't know what it is. I can't explain it. Just feels like, you know, ["It'll be] (ph) forever. I'll never get out from with under." [Sometimes I'm under] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so if we were to look at everything ... all the feelings that are coming up in you in this job now, what would be [fine and] (ph) (inaudible at 0:04:50)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What would be fun (ph)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I'm wondering if there's a reason, you know that ... I can HEAR the negativity about the job, but I also see you're trying to be POSITIVE about it. "Well, yes, I'm not where I was." But I'm a little curious though which feelings are beneath that, underneath the positive feelings and maybe some of the more negative feelings ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just try and stay in control I mean I have a responsibility to, you know, bring in money, to make money. I have to do it, but I want to ... I want to bring in money. I want to try and feel good about it. I don't want to drive myself nuts if I'm going to be there until something else comes along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you'd be driving yourself nuts if you were really ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I start thinking about where I am and what I'm doing and thinking, "This could be forever. I'm not going to make it as an actor. I'm never going to get money solely as being an artist. (inaudible at 0:05:46) now so I don't feel like anyone [in myself] (ph) I'll ever get to be a working artist if I have that attitude. I've always had that negative thing, bleakness, sparseness and trying to come from a point of abundance now and try and go with the flow. And part of going with the flow is letting go when I'm at this job. I've learned that you can't fight [virtue with virtue] (ph). I've tried that (inaudible). It was easier being there today. I didn't mind it so much. [0:06:22]</p>

<p>The other feeling of hating it is, you know, a sense of failure. There's still one thing I'm still afraid to do that I know I have to go out and do someday. And I will, but I'm scared to death. It's almost like taking a train, kind of scary that way. I know that I'll have to do it and I WILL do it, but it's scary. And that's ... you know, to really go out and just really knock on doors and trying to get an agent and things like that. I'm a month or two away in the process of doing ... really have my kit of tools together and I'm going to go knock on doors, prepared to be thrown out of doors and be prepared to maybe accept some good that may come of it, but I have to do that. I've never done that. And once I think I can get over that, I think I'll be a different person. [0:07:15]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is it that's keeping you from doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think I don't feel totally prepared yet. I need a couple of different monologues, [if there's "Give me that. Give me that. Give me that."] (ph) I can do a play. But the other part that's keeping me from doing it from anyone ... is cold-calling on anyone is the possibility of suddenly being thrown out on your a**. [I saw on the door] (ph) No calls. Don't enter. Don't knock. And to have the balls to go in there and do it anyway. They're not calling anyway, so what's the difference? I mean, you never know. And I think after a while, people will appreciate persistence anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm wondering if ... again, I think what's been this ... part of what's keeping you from knocking on doors (inaudible at 0:08:08) is that fear that, you know, it's just going to lead to rejection.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once again it's feeling like [a little bit] (ph) pessimistic about what might come of it. So ... like you said, that negativity, that pessimism is always with you and there's a scary thing. (inaudible) [0:08:30]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well pessimism isn't scary. Pessimism is familiar.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Familiar.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I ... part of me LIKES being sarcastic and pessimistic (inaudible at 0:08:37). I even write that way now. It's good. But it's different. It's softer. It's not obnoxious. [I'm writing] (ph), there's a difference. It's not angry. If it's angry, it's not ... I don't like it and people don't like it. I don't want to be ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? Why don't people like it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not so attractive. It's not becoming. Nobody likes the angry voice, screaming and screaming. Nobody listens to that kind of person. No one listens to the - crying, you know, screaming, obnoxious person. And there's so much more strength just drawn in to the people that I've always admired that can get their point across in a quiet way. I think it's true; you draw more bees with honey than you do vinegar. You just talk directly and confidently to somebody and get your point across. [I'm not an] (ph) anger (inaudible at 0:09:38). There's a difference between, for me, persistence and anger. I want to get to that point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, although everyone has a different way and a different style of getting their point across. Maybe you're just a little different than (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you're right ... I think ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about Lenny Bruce?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. But I wonder how many doors he got thrown out of? I mean I like Lenny Bruce. In fact I was trying to find a film the other ... I'm glad you reminded me because I'm right in the middle of researching to write two one-man shows. And I was thinking of doing one on him but he's been covered so much. I didn't want to (inaudible). [0:10:15]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My sense is that there's a way that you want to be, which I think, yeah, I think it's an admirable [way to feel] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're right. I know what you're going to say but I'm trying to find ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, what do you think I'm going to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just think there's a certain way that you think I think that I should be, but is it really my way and the way that I CAN be and what's truly in me? Or am I doing that ... and if I'm wrong, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but ... and then am I trying to be that way because it's true to me or am I trying to be that way because I THINK I should be that way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just stole my brilliant point!</p>

<p>PATIENT: Were you going to say that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Perfect.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Both. But I'm learning to (both chuckle) ... what I think is right. And in here that's helped me, doing that - the difference between what I think is right and what ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well how am I helping you? You seem to have a pretty good sense ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: In here, but we've done this together in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like you're throwing me a bone now. [No, well you can have a little bit] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. (laughs) We'll be driving along, and you go, "Oh, look at that over there, isn't that nice?" "Oh, that is nice. I think I will travel over there."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know, I also got the sense, you know, maybe ... I'm sure what might have been going on when you said, "Yeah, I know what you're going to say. I know what you're going to say," like, wasn't sure what that was...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was trying to stay one step ahead of you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you were?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well in a sense, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell me a bit about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. (laughs) I can't! I mean ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure you can.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You embarrassed me now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? What's the embarrassment?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh because it's that thing about being right and knowing what you're going to say and [no, I mean I know] (ph) what I'm going to say [to seize] (ph) control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I think you're trying to stay one step ahead of me here. [0:12:19]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. That's what I meant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, even now. Are you trying to guess what I'm ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not now. But I do like ... "Oh, I know what you're going to say. I'll show you how smart I am."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh ... okay. Because ... because I might not know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, just so I can show you how smart I am. How clever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Can you say anything more about that? Can you tell me more about that? Is that a familiar tune?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah. I like being clever. Not because I want any response out of you, it just makes ME feel better. It makes me feel better. I enjoy it. I think everybody likes to (inaudible at 0:13:05).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what if you DID want to [a response out of me?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Then I'd ask you for one.] (ph) I would. What were we talking about before that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I think THIS is pretty interesting. (both chuckle)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why is that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I don't know what ... I'm not quite sure ... [there seems] (ph) to be something kind of ... charge or something about our interaction that might be worth staying with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Charge?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well sort of fun, playful, but ... you know, uncomfortable. Feel uncomfortable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a little uncomfortable when you embarrass me. Do you want me to be uncomfortable?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. I don't know if that's my first intention.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like dig up something. That's your job. But what was your original question? [0:14:15]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just ... you know, it seems that we're sort of talking pretty directly to each other right now and I'm just curious what sort of feelings come up with that, what the discomfort is, what the embarrassment is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think the embarrassment is like, "I caught you."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't remember what you said to me that made me embarrassed. I can't remember what you said. Something along the lines of "Oh you're so ... you think you're so smart, aren't you?" Isn't that kind of what you said?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what it sounded like I said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. Yeah, I guess because ... I don't know why can't I ... that's okay ... yeah, I can ... I guess you know because I want to feel like some ... you know (inaudible at 0:15:11) [need that people to] (ph) tell me that. Like even when this guy came up to me and said ... and I think it was a nice thing just on a business level and he said, "I want to sit down once a week with you and give me your opinion." No one has ever said that to me on a job before, especially [one that means nothing to me] (ph) and I admired him for that and also ... then I thought he was trying to stroke me, which he was. But then the other point was like, "Good. I've got a lot of suggestions for him to make me even richer." I don't care how successful he is. So that was good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there was something though about the way I kind of said ... I just sort of made ... I TEASED you a bit about that, about wanting to be smart or funny or (inaudible at 0:15:53). Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's different coming from you than it would be from someone else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean I'm open and raw in here, I mean, there's things I've discussed with you I'm not going to discuss with him, my boss. [0:16:10]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I decided when I went in there I wanted ... I didn't want to really show who I am. I want to keep myself distant from this job because I've always opened up ... and I don't want to do that. I just want it separate. It kind of protects me (inaudible at 0:16:23) that way. I don't want to get too friendly with these people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would some of the embarrassment in my comment - that you have about my comment - because you thought that I was sort of trying to knock you down a little bit? Like saying, "Don't get so full of yourself" or ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I guess I just got ... maybe I felt that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't think that was your intention, but maybe I felt that, "Well maybe I'll just sort of come down a little bit. Not to be so clever."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not be so clever because ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I learned that somewhere along the line that that's not attractive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Because I find it quite to the contrary, you know, I find it very attractive and fun, you know, when we're sort of playing here and sometimes I notice that we get to a point where we can just sort of rib each other a little bit, but ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you don't seem to like to get to that point sometimes - that you try and steer me back ... not [to take something else] (ph) that would ... that wouldn't (ph) bother me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe I don't ... I'm not always comfortable with it for my own reasons. But I don't think I've ever had the sense like, "Oh, he's getting kind of obnoxious."</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I didn't feel obnoxious, but I ... you know, I guess getting back to where it was ... the embarrassment [comes from] (ph) ... maybe with ... maybe it was that finger, like, "Are you out of line? You're out of line." You know, and that hard line for me and a lot of people that I've talked to about it's like, when you start ... when you color out of the lines, when is it okay to color out of the lines? Somebody says, "You're coloring out of the lines." Now I don't WANT to color inside the lines. I don't want to do ANYTHING like that corporate world that I work in. And most of the people that make up the workforce, I don't want to be ANYTHING like that. Just because it's not fun and also just to be defiant. [0:18:33]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm, and yet you're quick to see someone as saying, "Hey, you're out of line."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I'm also quick to say, "Well, I'm sorry I [was bad] (ph)." You know, I'm still not real comfortable with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm starting to learn and it really gets in the way of my life, my creative life. I'm censoring myself all the time. It's a goal of mine. I'm working on that right now, not to censor myself. It's working.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe there's something to the embarrassment that came up when you thought that I was thinking you're out of line that maybe we could look at. Does that make sense? Would you ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no, it comes from my upbringing, my family and my ... I remember one time [when I was a little kid] (ph) my mother was downstairs and her screaming because she wanted me to wear a suit or something to some family event. Kids don't want to wear a suit so I said, "I'm not wearing a suit." She says, "Well you'll wear a suit to my funeral." "Don't count on it." I mean, that reminds me of that.</p>

<p>And I remember the first time I can remember being punished for being creative. And it's late 60s, early 70s and Laugh-In was on and it was popular. And my parents had bought me this little turntable, flip-top carrying suitcase turntable. And I remember writing ... because on Laugh-In they always did this all the time, sex is a no-no, and I remember taking pastel crayons and writing it all over, [furious they bought me this new thing.] (ph) Of course I ruined it with this graffiti. And the other thing was that they got a shower curtain and I remember taking (ph) on the bottom of the shower curtain in Magic Marker on the liner around it "Made in the USA by Ted and Sue." And that was that. And the other thing I defaced was my parents' wall. In our neighborhood, growing up in row homes, anytime anybody in the neighborhood that we were friends with would get new wallpaper, everybody went and got measured and wrote it down and it got plastered over and the next time [in ten years you take it off and see how much you grew] (ph). So I figured, well it was okay to write on the wall. So I decided to paint the entire Declaration of Independence over my parents' headboard. The wallpaper was coming the next day. And my mother, she freaked out. She, "Don't you know that I'm getting sheer wallpaper and you can see through it." So that's kind of like coloring outside ... as opposed to, you know, the way I wish she would have said, "That's really creative. That's fantastic. But we have a problem here."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. Mmm hmm. What does that feel like (inaudible at 0:21:21)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was awful. It was like ... She just pushed me right there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She just pushed me right down, you know, pushed me out. Ate (ph) and squashed. Any creativity in a sense was squashed. Like nurtured by my sister but squashed by my mother. My father was kind of ... he really didn't rear me that much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just so I have a better sense of what that squashing was, would you mind showing me? [can I get another chair?]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. I hate this game.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hate this game.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that mean you don't want to do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'll do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't pull any of this compliance stuff on me. (both chuckle)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now what do you want me to do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want you to squash Ted for being creative. Be your mother, then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I hate being my mother because it reminds me of what's in me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Get into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have a hard time getting into ... I do, I get embarrassed, it's like, it's so hard for me to show my feelings sometimes, you know what I mean? I get embarrassed that I would do that. Then I feel ... it feels ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you would do ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels false to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What feels false to you? [0:22:39]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Doing the role-playing thing. It does. I don't know why. It doesn't feel real safe to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel safe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm ... and I WANT it to. But then ... it's GOOD for me. I think it's good for me, but it just doesn't ... you know what I'm saying? It's uncomfortable. [And I'll say] (ph) uncomfortable is in flushing out things about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. What's going on now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It feels like ... I get embarrassed. Like even to do this in front of you is embarrassing and ... not because I don't trust you, I do, but ... I don't know, it's just uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're just feeling sort of ... the idea of doing it is embarrassing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember one time in an acting class - I wouldn't give it that much respect calling it an acting class - but it was like psychodrama and they were doing this with us. Totally unsupervised, unlicensed person telling us to talk back to our mothers and do things like that. And it was like, let go and commit to it. It's wonderful. But I just feel so weak when I do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel weak. Does that have anything to do with the embarrassment?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so? I'm not (inaudible at 0:23:58).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the embarrassment ... I mean I'm embarrassed because I feel like I'm not like being responsible, I mean I'm not being mature, not being a man even though I've cried many times. I have a hard time with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're ... when you're doing this role play or when you're being ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well if I finally let go and capitulate to my feelings and I show them, it's okay. [0:24:23]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ted, I'm having a hard time figuring out when are these feelings coming up. You mean they're coming up now ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I mean, when I would do this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you would do a role-play for (inaudible at 0:24:31).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel embarrassed, you feel weak, what else? Weak because ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why. (inaudible at 0:24:44)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's just; it's very hard for me. I don't know why. I mean it's like you know you show your colors and you show people how you feel and you're weak. You'll be taken advantage of. I don't want to be weak. I mean, I guess I learned over the years that it's important to show how you feel and it's not important what other people think of you, but I guess it is important to me. I guess because it would just bring out feelings about how awful that was and to be ... feeling that little squashed feeling when I was a little kid and how, you know, I always felt like I was wrong. The same thing about having to wear the suit. It's just never ... no one was ever good enough in our family for my mother. We still aren't. [0:26:01]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a really painful feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess that's why I (inaudible at 0:26:07).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In hearing you speak about it gives me a much stronger sense of what that squashed feeling was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I said hearing you speak about it gives me a much better sense of what that squashed feeling was or is for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean it still goes on with her. [I mean being with her] (ph). It's just ... all kids ... Beth and I talked about how she feels the same way with her relationship with her mother. One she used to have. You know, you always just want your mother to say you're good enough. And mine didn't. Hers didn't. Never ... if they said it, we didn't believe it. It's never, you know, never good enough. And it doesn't really matter to me whatever reason. She didn't know any better, you know, whatever her background was all fucked up, I don't care. One day, I would like to hear that. You know, as opposed to saying, "Oh, you've got a job in a showcase? That's great. You know one day you'll be on Broadway." It's just never ... it's never good enough. "You look fine the way you're going. You don't need to wear a suit. It's more important that you're there."</p>

<p>That's pretty hard. The more I talk about I'm afraid to show my feelings, I feel like my brother which I don't ever want to be like. Being very stern, I mean not showing his emotions. I'm not like my brother, but he'd never tell me he loves me, never would hug me. I tried last time I saw him he got out of that. He won't do it. [0:28:34]</p>

<p>You know, I would do that thing because you're right, I mean, it would feel like I'm in compliance because it felt that that was right to do. And I should do that. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's a good thing or a bad thing? Compliance?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, sometimes it's good not to lose myself. I just still remember really clearly I'm ... not really clearly, but I must have been like five or six, and I remember my mother taking me to the zoo. [The time was in the school year] (ph). It seemed like it was a weekday for some reason. I think it was in our neighborhood. I remember getting ... I'm thinking water ice or cotton candy, I can't remember. And I remember my mother just standing there holding my hand and looking up at my mother and her looking like she did NOT want to be there. And looking so afraid. And I wonder what she was feeling? She's afraid. What am I supposed to feel like? I guess I was thinking about that the other day. [0:30:30]</p>

<p>Now if we just (inaudible) we just kind of like poke at each other. Now she's back and hiring a detective for my brother to hire a private detective to follow his ex-wife around. For whatever reason. I didn't tell you about the time my mother hired a hit man?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh uh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have to write a story about this. She and ... my mother and Beth and I were out to dinner one time at a diner. And this is right after my mother got really screwed up with this doctor that frauded her out of $60,000 and she was on medicine. I think she was taking Xanax or something she shouldn't have been taking for someone her age and it really screwed her up. And this man embezzled a lot of money out of her so somehow she (inaudible at 0:31:18) she's telling us in the diner (inaudible at 0:31:20) looks at my mother saying that she's hired this hit man - two of them - to rub this guy out. (chuckles) And we're just like ... I had no response. And she went there and went to this guy's house and (inaudible) got there, she's like, "No, just rough him up a little, you know, don't hurt him. Just make the point." And as we're going in she changed her mind and she hid under the seat, and of course they wanted their money anyway, didn't they, yes, but I think about how fucked up it would take somebody to do that. But this is my mother. It's like unbelievable. Now she's hiring private detectives to spy on my ex-sister-in-law, which is insane, even though she's a crazy b**** anyway, but it's just nuts. This is my family. [0:32:16]</p>

<p>You know, I look at it now like about her holding my hand when I'm four or five and what it is now, and I look at her now ... she's just as scared and just as nuts. For 30-something years. When (ph) I don't hear from my mother, I know there's something going on. She's doing something, she's devious, she's gambling, she's doing something she shouldn't be doing. And this time it was hiring a private detective. I get frightened that I'm going to be nuts like her one day. I'll have this chemical imbalance so-called chemical imbalance that she's had. I'll have to make a movie out of this life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you aware of any feelings that are coming up now [as you're telling me this] (ph)? How [comfortable or uncomfortable] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well part of me feels like I'm doing this to avoid space to talk. You know, what we talked about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About [being in touch] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I feel like I'm ... I don't want to get too close to those feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too close to those feelings about your mother. [What you didn't get] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the other point too, is that I say, "Well I'm 35 years old. I'm not going to be able to get that from my mother now." I'll think, "She's being the best mother she can be. She doesn't know how to do anything else. Not capable. Doesn't have the skills." Maybe somebody 38 shouldn't want them anymore. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's a critical attitude you have about feeling (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well (inaudible) they all (inaudible). That might be to help you think for me. You know, I ... I mean it broke my heart like when my wife won the Barrymore award, which is the equivalent of the Tony Award in New York for the sets she did. My mother said, "Oh, that's nice." [That's what she heard but I didn't hear the conversation] (ph). It's so important to her. Her own mother (inaudible at 0:34:48). Unbelievable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you sense that if you get in touch truly, you know, if you feel and touch with the feelings about your mother and your anger and the sadness [that are] (ph) getting what you needed from her, to get in touch with that fear, that that's just going to drag you down or it's unhealthy or ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't feel so ... I know that I just get ashamed. I mean it makes me upset that I feel that I would get ashamed, but I do, I mean I feel like I have tears coming on now, I do everything to fight them back. I don't know what it (inaudible at 0:35:30). I watch a movie and something will just bowl me over and I have the biggest lump in my throat because I can't let the tears go. I mean sometimes I do, and sometimes I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is it that you fight them back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: WHY is it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, how is it. What do you find yourself doing to fight them back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't let myself do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that work? You think about other things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I just, "I'm not going to cry. I'm not going to cry." In the movie theater. You know, I've never looked at myself that way, but I guess I am that way. [0:36:07]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just one of those typical male things that you're not supposed to cry and you're not supposed to show your feelings. But if I was talking to somebody else and someone said that to me, I'd say, "Of course you're allowed to cry." I feel a lot more emotional than a lot of my male friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you keeping the tears back now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Same way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it."</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:36:40).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And of course (inaudible at 0:36:50) shame and experience real experience the whole experience. (inaudible) all my life. I'll just kind of get involved and put my toes in the water, but I'm not going in. How I (inaudible) job (inaudible). I'll do it. I'll stay away from myself that way. Because it will mean I'm really not an actor. I'm meant to work. Some guy called me today and recommended my sister and wanted to know whether I wanted to take over his business with him. (inaudible) God, am I getting a sign from God I should (inaudible) business? No. The universe is tempting me with the fact to keep straight on my mission. And I can say "no." It's okay to say "no."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe it will be easy for you to move ahead once you understand and find some acceptance for the feelings that are keeping you from moving ahead. I think those feelings are important. And I think your relationship with those feelings is important too. [0:38:19]</p>

<p>PATIENT: How do you suggest I go about understanding them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I wish I could give you a magic cure, but ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't mean a magic cure, but a way to go about approaching them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're doing a lot of things to do that. It's not ... it takes time. (inaudible at 0:38:41) finding a love and acceptance of yourself which is not an easy task.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's not. I mean that's the hardest part. That's what really gets me every time is thinking about ... people ... if you say to me, or someone says to me, "You're just really are just really okay," that's when I lose it. I don't know if that's a good thing I'm okay or because it is okay to feel okay. (inaudible at 0:39:40) I fight, we all fight about, fight with ... accepting and you know, loving myself is ... it's hard. [0:40:05]</p>

<p>I don't know if I kept ... I want to get to that point. I'm learning that it's a lot easier to get there with, I mean, with help than to help and (inaudible at 0:40:23) yourself and try to get in touch with my spiritual self. I don't give myself enough credit. I don't. I mean I've done some wonderful things over the last few years, but I just ... it's like, it's not enough. I'm not ... I'm not even enough for myself. A guy that I became friends with recently, springtime, very good friend now. [He said] (ph), "God, you are really tough on yourself." Part of me likes hearing that because it's that old work ethic. You should be tough on yourself. (inaudible at 0:41:02) He never cracks. But why is that a GOOD thing? It's not a good thing.</p>

<p>Okay, I cried. I'm still alive. (inaudible at 0:41:34). What else do you want to know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anything else you want to know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything else you want to tell me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:42:08) felt better. I feel better. I seem to ... (inaudible) self (inaudible) drugs and questioning whether if I set aside a certain amount of time to work on something that's enough time. Why aren't I doing it? Why aren't I doing that? As opposed to just [okay one step] (ph) I set my time to do it and I don't know if I can blame (ph) him. It's the old same thing. It's not enough. When is enough enough? And is it okay that you're (inaudible)? [0:42:57]</p>

<p>Something I want to work on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel better. Feel a little more content. At ease. (inaudible at 0:43:11)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because the embarrassment (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I've always ... always acting, thinking about auditions (ph), thinking about myself, body language is [like this] (ph). Study tapes of us. Not feeling so comfortable sitting like that, are you? Crossing (inaudible) Of course I don't know anybody who feels comfortable sitting like this. I just like my legs crossed. (inaudible) Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is the "thank you" for?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that I feel better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm glad. [0:44:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's this guy at work ... (tape ends)</p>

<p>This series of six transcripts features a couple, Dennis and Renee.  The following is the first of the six sessions.</p>

<p><b>Session Transcript</b></p>

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So Dennis and Renee, I really appreciate your coming and doing this with me and I'm glad we're going to have a chance to spend several sessions together.</p>

<p>What I know about you is that you have two kids, 13 and 11.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thirteen and nine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thirteen and nine. Boys?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're an artist and you're in business?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And been married how many years?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think 15.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fifteen?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Sixteen. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sixteen? (chuckles)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sixteen years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Sorry to put you on the spot. (female client and therapist chuckle)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's alright. I know she was waiting for me to come up with that number.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've been in therapy for some time now?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: On and off. Renee has been in therapy a little bit more than myself and I've been in therapy a couple times with Renee as a couple and I'm in therapy now on my own.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I am, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And let me – before we get further along with that, just let me ask about how you're feeling about being here in this context and doing this with me and – how we doing so far? [0:01:33.9]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm excited and happy to be here to work on our relationship and get through some rough times, so I'm happy to be here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm nervous. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. OK. What's that nervous part saying to you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Just not having worked with you before and being in a crisis right now. So …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But that's difficult I think, for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure. Of course. Then if there's anything I can do to help the nervousness – given that I'm new to you, a stranger – I'm happy to do that. Anything I can talk about, about myself, or whatever feels right to you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, I want you to feel as safe as possible in this context and as much in control of what we do as possible. So …</p>

<p>So if I ask a question and you don't feel comfortable answering it, please just say you'd rather not.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK? [0:02:53.6]</p>

<p>You mentioned a crisis. I don't know if you want to jump into that or not but it piqued my curiosity.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (chuckles) [You heard that]. What do you think?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, sure.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You go for it. (chuckles)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I had an affair some time ago; back at the end of – what, ‘96 was that, Renee? I think about the end of 1996. And it came back to haunt me. It's something I never shared with Renee. And we got a phone call – Renee got a phone call from this person, we believe – we're not sure; she never gave her name – and kind of shared with Renee that there was a problem and that problem was me having an affair. [0:03:55.8]</p>

<p>So this happened about a month ago and it's been very tough, for this last month, dealing with this situation. And I never really shared what happened in the past before this phone call and I'm in therapy now to try to figure that out and understand why I've done that. And it's been tough. So, been a lot of questions. Renee has had a lot of questions that I've tried to answer but I didn't answer them – I didn't answer all her questions all at once and there have been many problems with that, of course.</p>

<p>I have a hard time – I've had a hard time being honest with all of the questions because I feel so ashamed about what I've done. I still love her; I still care for her even though this happened. So I still have – I'm still very much in love with Renee and even though that happened, I – it's painful for her; it's been painful for me and it's been very, very hard on Renee. And I'm thankful that she still loves me.</p>

<p>So we're trying to work through this thing and that's it in a nutshell. I mean there's a lot between what I've just talked about here but me not being honest with all my answers, that was tough on Renee and me. I just, for some reason, just have a hard time – had a hard time being up front and honest right away with what happened. [0:06:03.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So you would hedge or you would say …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I wouldn't give her all the particulars. I just wouldn't …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wouldn't go into details at first.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, she wanted to know everything that happened. Well, you know. She almost had to pry a lot of that stuff out of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. So you would skirt around things.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:06:26.0) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then later, when Renee would ask more, then you would be more honest.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Things had changed; the frequency of the times I saw this lady would change a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. But she would catch you and see the difference in your story.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So that was pretty devastating for her and me. I just don't know why I couldn't be honest right up front, right off the bat, but I couldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So you're feeling quite guilty …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … and ashamed at the moment.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. I have been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And grateful that she still seems to love you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And boy, what's it been like for you this past month? [0:07:19.9]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's very devastating. I have a lot of ambivalent feelings about – just about everything. One moment I'm really angry and the next moment I'm really in love with him and I have a lot of trouble not beating up on myself for still being in love with Dennis. That's really a difficult thing for me and the difference between needing and being needy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Say some more about that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: In my past, my mother was a very needy woman and I never wanted to be like that. And so needs and needy kind of are together and I don't recognize that there can be healthy needs in a relationship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I want to be able to do everything on my own and I'll be fine and …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Independently. Yeah. Don't need anybody. And then something like this happens and it further confirms that part of you that says, “Don't trust anybody, don't depend on anybody. You should only look out for yourself.” Is that right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, that's pretty close.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So – and it's that part that's critical of you for still needing Dennis or being in love with Dennis.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's saying, “How could you forgive him?”</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah, exactly. “How could you stay? He's crossed your bottom line and you're still here and …”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're still here. Right. OK. And are there people outside of your relationship that know about this or is it …? [0:09:05.5]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And are those people taking that position also or what's the position of those people?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The people that I – like I've been through a lot of therapy and I've done a lot of work, so I know pretty much who my support people are. So they're supportive of whatever I choose and whatever I do. You know? And they can kind of help point out that, “You know, you're really beating yourself up” and “Don't do that” and – I don't know what …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Everybody has been real supportive, quite frankly, and just hoping that we can work things out. And my parents, for example, are very supportive and helpful with – I told them Renee still loves me and I still love her and we've got a long way to go to figure all this out and to make things, hopefully, right; and hopefully we can do that.</p>

<p>I haven't told too many people. I don't associate with too many people. I have a few friends and I've explained to them what happened and they're there for me to lend an ear or talk. And …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So nobody has really taken a hard position either way.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So that's been helpful.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. OK. So it's more your own internal battles that you have to deal with.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. Alright, so there is this part that's always wanted you to be independent and not rely – maybe even not get too close to anybody. And it's really working on you now. And is it – did it get to a point of making you want to leave or …? [0:10:58.5]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You mean when the crisis came?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well – did I want to leave? I think I did. I mean I thought about really briefly about leaving the kids and Dennis. But I really wouldn't do that to my children. I might make him leave. (chuckles) I wouldn't end up leaving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, so you thought about making him leave, too.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And is that still going on or has that died down, those thoughts?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I mean we – no. I don't – it depends. Sometimes I get really, really angry and I want to say “Just leave” but I don't think I have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, so you think it but you don't say it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Because when I'm really angry, I mean I can just say really hurtful things and I want to be somewhat careful about what I say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. And so before you got this call, how had things been in your relationship? [0:12:12.3]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Go ahead.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, last year when he started to have the affair, which was 1998 … (chuckles)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, ‘98? Sorry. (inaudible at 0:12:22.5) (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, it wasn't ‘96. OK.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, that's ‘99. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Now I see why you got in trouble. (female client laughs)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I had a dream that he was having an affair and I told him about the dream.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I journal a lot, so I have a lot of record of what was happening. And so I told him about the dream and he responded that we should spend more time together. And he was putting together that business at that time and working another job, so I didn't see him a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And during the time of the affair, we struggled a lot. He was angry a lot. I feel cut off. A lot of the things that meant a lot to us are – gardening; he was angry about the garden not being taken care of and that really was his thing, on a daily basis. And our children would mention, through those months, that they were worried whether we were going to get divorced.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Back then?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Really?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Especially Evan, the older one, was really in tune. [0:13:43.7]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That was some of the time. There were still a lot of nice moments, too, where we did things and went out to dinner and did a little gardening maybe. I mean we did some things together, I know. We did a few things with the kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. But it was pretty rocky (inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (chuckles) It was rocky to me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well yeah, but you make it sound like it's every day. It wasn't like that every day.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. You want to read the journals? I mean you're welcome to read them. It was pretty brutal to me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Really? Every day?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean a lot of the time.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean we went to church together. I mean church was always nice. You know? I mean not every day is all I'm saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it wasn't great.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't think it was as bad as Renee is making it sound.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, isn't that very convenient?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was going to say …</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Wasn't real bad for you. (chuckles)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, no, no, no. I'm not talking about that. I'm just talking about we still did nice things together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. OK. And how long was the duration of the affair? [0:14:43.8]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, almost – probably nine months, ten months maybe. Something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So it ended within a year.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And the last probably six months of that was just on the phone now and then.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And a new piece is revealed tonight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You didn't say that you saw her for six months to me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I didn't say I saw her for six months?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, I don't know – I saw her right before November of that year, 1996. That was the last time I saw her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ‘98.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Or ‘98 rather.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What year was it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ‘98. Whatever. So what's the new piece?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, you're saying that you saw her for about six months?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. No. Phone contact for the past six months. I didn't see her for ten months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I saw her for maybe several months at the most and then from there it was just on the phone. That's what I was trying to clarify. [0:16:09.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. (clears throat) And so it ended how many months ago then, from now?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I talked to her on the phone. I called her after that phone call.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, OK.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So, a month.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: There were two phone calls.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Two phone calls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, I see. So you had had phone contact up until that phone call.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And then after that, you called her and told her that was it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, I told her, “Did you call my house?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, and she denied it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And since then, you haven't had contact with her.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Correct.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And you plan to continue to not have contact with her.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's correct.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The reason I feel that I was contacting her by phone was that she was – I was afraid of her calling my home because I knew …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. So I thought I just wanted to end it long before that but I kept calling and …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To try and appease her so …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … so that this wouldn't happen.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. Alright, so – yeah, so it's pretty fresh that there has not been some kind of relationship with her, too. OK. So yeah, I can see you guys are really in the middle of it and I know it feels terrible to both of you. If there was something that we could do in these six sessions that would be helpful, is there something specific? Do you have some kind of vision of how you'd like it to go; how you'd like to change things with the two of you? [0:18:03.7]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I'm not really sure what you can do for us to help us in six sessions, so I really don't know what to ask for. Do you have an idea?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, suppose I could. Suppose I could do a lot. What would you want?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm just looking for us to become closer than ever and wanting Renee to know that I care for her and love her more than ever and that's my main concern, is for her to know that I really, genuinely, care for her and want to be married. And this mistake I made is awful and I'm trying to understand why I did that, in therapy. And I want her trust, if I can ever get that back; I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Suppose you couldn't.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Get her trust back?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well (clears throat) …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would that be like for you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know. It'd be – I'm not sure how I feel about that. I'd feel a little bit empty, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. How about you, Renee, in terms of a vision for how you'd like it to be? [0:19:36.1]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. The issue of trust is very large for me, so – and I guess separating out what reality is and what – for me, what goes on in my head, that would be helpful; just to see what the reality is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What the reality is in terms of what?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Of what our relationship is; I mean if there is really a foundation for rebuilding it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So to do an assessment of what's still there and what isn't, for you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like that? Because it's hard to trust these extreme thoughts you get about it in your head all the time in one direction or the other. They both kind of pull you in ways that don't seem like you can trust those perspectives. Does that sound right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, that sounds right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So to maybe clear out some of that so you get more of a sense of what you as yourself feel about it or see it; how you see it as yourself? Something like that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. I'm pretty good at helping people do that kind of thing.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. OK. [0:21:31.5]</p>

<p>So before the affair, when things got worse – sounds like worse in your perception, during it, and that's typical; I mean when one partner is having an affair, their energy is not in their relationship and they're kind of grumpy a lot of the time. Before that, what kind of stuff had you guys been working on in your relationship? Sounds like you were in therapy even before that. So are there chronic issues, is what I'm asking.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think that one of the chronic issues is intimacy. I think it's been difficult. Some of my history that might be helpful is that the reason I was in therapy – I started in ‘91 – was recovery from child sexual abuse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So that precludes a lot of things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes intimacy pretty scary sometimes.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: One of the other things is I tend to take responsibility for everything instead of just taking responsibility for the parts that I have, both in our relationship together and in my family of origin. So I have a tendency to do that. I'd like to learn how not to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So the part of you that tells you it's your fault or you need to do something to fix everything, you'd like some help with. [0:22:52.2]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. The therapy you did for the sex abuse, did that help?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's been good for you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's been really good. It's helped on a lot of different levels with my art work. I used art to do the recovery.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) [Has that been any help?] (ph)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I have a better sense of self.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: This kind of puts a little kink in it (inaudible at 0:23:24.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kink in it. OK. So (clears throat) – so you did a lot of intense therapy, starting in ‘91, around the childhood stuff.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it stuff that you were aware of coming into therapy?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I had just gotten one clue and that was triggered by – I believe by my son becoming about the age that it would have started for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And so you did a lot of intense work. And so how did that affect intimacy with the two of you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't even know how to …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How to describe it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know that it affected it a lot but I'm not sure how I can describe it. Maybe you would have a better idea.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what I'm asking – because a lot of times when people are doing that work, they don't want to be intimate for a long stretch of time. It's just very threatening.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know a lot of it was really threatening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot of intimacy?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The intimacy. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And did that shift at some point where it was easier to be intimate or did that continue to be a scary …</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think it shifted for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean I could actually see the shifts. I could. I'm not sure whether you did or not. (clears throat)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Hmm. (pause) I don't recall. I mean five years – over that five-year period, you know, there were plenty ups and downs and emotions were up and down and I know that Renee tried to work with me as far as learning how to be intimate because it's something I never was. I've never been intimate. [0:25:34.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it was something unfamiliar to you as well.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely. So, the last several years we've talked about intimacy and how to become more intimate with each other. And after learning how to be intimate, I'd probably never practiced or worked with it as much as I should have to become close. And you know, I – so I still have a long way to go. I know more now than I ever have as far as Renee's needs; you know, to be intimate and say the right things and – so I'm working on it more than ever, now especially.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're talking about being able to speak intimately from a …? (clears throat)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, just being able to speak intimately and doing intimate things to bring us closer together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Alright, so you came into the marriage pretty ignorant about all that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And Renee has gradually helped you open to that more.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Alright. So how – obviously, this month has been a bad month for intimacy. (female client chuckles) But how would you characterize your abilities to be intimate; more recently, I would say. As a couple, not individually. [0:27:22.1]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I would want to say better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Better but not where you want to be.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And again, let me just try and get a little more specific about it. So if you had a vision of how you wanted it to be, what would that look like?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just being able to be open about any issue or just be able to communicate better than ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So it's along lines of openness and disclosing to each other and being able to be present when you're hearing about intimate things from the other partner.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's true for you as well?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That is true for me. I have to say that Dennis has acted like a different person. Not in the …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The last month?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he's been more that way.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think the first couple weeks were really hard, so half of that time was spent with the disclosure and the nondisclosure thing; that was really difficult. But over the last several weeks, I mean he really has made an effort to look in my eyes and to touch me and to tell me things that I've always wanted to hear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's something about this that maybe cracked him open a little bit; about this crisis. Does that sound right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, it does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there's probably a part of you saying, “He's just doing it to get back on my good side or something like that.”</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've said that before. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, so it's hard to trust it but if you kept it up, it might be a pretty good thing. [0:29:05.7]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It would be a really good thing if he kept it up. And my fear is that it won't stay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But if it did (clears throat), then this crisis would have been a blessing, in a way.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Hmm. I wouldn't go that far. (chuckles)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (overlapping voices) OK, if you have to say it that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't want to put words in your mouth but …</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: OK, let's not say that the affair was a blessing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, that's not what I mean.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But we could say what came out of it would be a blessing, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I would say that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, sometimes these things happen and they do crack people open in ways that, if you had just kind of trudged along in your ordinary life, never would have happened. So it's nice to take advantage of them is part of what I'm saying; these opportunities, these openings.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So – but it's also important to sniff this out and be sure you're not being taken down a garden path and be able to see with some clarity; which I totally understand, in your position, would be a big concern. OK. But you're pretty interested in – I would guess you're happy to hear that Renee can recognize that you're different. [0:30:32.1]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that you're pretty interested in maintaining this.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's all that matters to me right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Alright. OK. Alright, so what I'm hearing is in the time we have together, if there was something I could do for you to help you just get more of a sense of where you stand versus these warring parts about this issue, so you can make up your own mind about how much of Dennis's change to trust and how much to let him back in, that would be helpful to you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And maybe, from your point of view, if there was a way to keep your momentum going in the changes you've …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Already made.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … already made this past month …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Keep it up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … you'd be interested in that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like you're also curious about why this thing happened to begin with.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you might be interested in our exploring that? It sounds like you're doing some work individually on that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, that would be helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if there was something that we could do that would expedite that, you'd be interested?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Alright. Well, these are the kinds of things I'm good with.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we'll see what we can do. How are you feeling right now, having disclosed this? This was a big thing to say and to talk to a stranger about with cameras and stuff. So how are you feeling right now? [0:32:14.6]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm feeling pretty good. I'm not really too nervous. I know Renee's a little nervous.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm hot and sweaty. (chuckles)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Are you? I'm comfortable. I'm OK. I'm happy to have your help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And let's just focus on that hot and sweaty part.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Is it the lights? (chuckles)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's a sweater. Look how thick the thing is; a big, thick sweater.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's get a little reading of what that's about. What's going on in there?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think that the disclosure is difficult to make. I feel like it might be a little easier on his part. You know, he's been validated outside. I haven't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By this woman, you mean?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Woman. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. OK. OK, so the affair maybe boosted his ego but left you feeling bad about yourself? Is that right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, it didn't boost my ego.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm listening to it from Renee's point of view.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (chuckles) Really?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. I'm sorry. Go ahead.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So there are parts of you that make you think you're not attractive enough or something like that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, or the responsibility again if I'd done this or that or if I was different or 20 years younger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK. Ah, OK. Alright, so there's a part that's beating you up about what you did to create this; saying that if you'd been a better wife that this wouldn't have happened.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's really hard. Even though I know intellectually that really it didn't have anything to do with me, that that was something that you chose, it's very hard for me not to emotionally be ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Criticize yourself.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. So that's still going on. [0:34:20.2]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, it kind of goes in waves.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. And when you get down on yourself that way, how do you wind up acting toward Dennis?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I think I feel like I feel needy; you know, that I need to be reassured and – I mean sometimes I can get angry. I mean I've been angry; really angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So sometimes you look to him to reassure you that you are attractive or that you didn't do anything to trigger this. Is that right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I haven't really specifically said that. Or actually, what I'm looking for is I guess the reassurance that he does love me, that he does want to stay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. That makes sense. That this thing is over and that he really is committed to – OK. That sounds like you're getting a lot of that verbally from him.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So – but there still is this part that, you know, why should you trust that because he's lied to you about things. So every time you find out that he didn't tell you the whole truth, it probably brings all that even more into the foreground.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, there are a couple of things that kind of trigger that thing. We've had trouble with the phone. We've had our phone number changed but we've had it changed three times, partly – I mean one was because I felt like she may have still been trying to call, because we were getting a lot of hang-ups after the disclosure. And then the phone company – we tried to get it unpublished, unlisted, and the phone company kept releasing one of our names because we had it listed under two names. [0:36:06.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So every time that happened then …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Be reminded.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Hmm. (inaudible at 0:36:12.4)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. That was really hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. So, so far as you know, she may still be trying to reach you and cause trouble.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. You never know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. So if there was a way to help you with this part that blames you all the time …</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That'd be tremendous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … you'd like that a lot.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Alright. Yeah, we might even be thinking about starting there. Because that can't be pleasant.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, it's not pleasant. And it makes me defensive, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It makes me defensive to say I didn't do anything; you know, that I …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it triggers another part that comes out and yells inside at that critic but then also probably comes at him sometimes, too. Does that sound right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. And when Renee gets angry at you, what happens for you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I tell her I'm sorry more than I ever have and I just try to be there for her and hold her hand and ease her pain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It triggers this guilty part of you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. OK.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean I've …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't defend yourself inside. You just kind of …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, no. No. I've admitted that I was wrong in doing this and I've taken responsibility for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. And other kinds of feelings, like the guilty part starts in on you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then what happens inside of you, would you say?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, I get kind of hurt – I hurt inside.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, say some more about that. What's that like when you hurt inside?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's just – oh, boy. For me to describe it, just – it's real tense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. There's a tension in your body.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whereabouts in your body? Can you get a bead on that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not a particular area. Maybe my stomach sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Mm-hmm, in the stomach.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know, I just get real (inaudible at 0:38:53.1). You know, when this was really intense, I was really feeling pretty crummy about myself and what I had done to Renee.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So you can feel guilty and start to criticize yourself and how bad you are and then there's another part of you that really feels that badness.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feels like you're really worthless or …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep. That sounds about right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a horrible person.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Want to shrivel up and hide.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Felt pretty bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you get like that inside …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … what happens then or do you stay that way or …?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just stay that way and just ride it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. But that can't be pleasant.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if there was a way to not feel so worthless, so bad about yourself, you'd be interested in that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I think I've been able to – by doing the right thing this last several weeks, I've been feeling better about myself. I mean I still – you know, I try not to think about that first couple of weeks where it was really intense. [0:40:23.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know, I tried – you know, this to me is like it's happened and I want things to be better and I focus on being there for Renee and doing the right things. And so I've kind of like not gotten over it, of course, but I mean I've put it behind me and I know it's still there but it's not there like it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How well do you know the part of you that made you have the affair?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: How well do I know the part of me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What's that part of you like? What does it say to you? What …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm just learning about that now, so it's kind of new.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just tell me what you know about it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I know that that part of me was interested in just sex that was real quick and easy with nothing – with not much caring involved with this person; I didn't really have a lot of feelings for her. I mean I liked her as a person. She had problems with her family life and stuff and I think of myself as a nice person but, after getting to know her, I mean there were no real, deep feelings for this person. And she was ready for me, I think sexually, just to become close to me. She was ready to do whatever. [0:42:02.2]</p>

<p>And so that part of me that recognized that took over and I think that the other good parts of me were in the background kind of stuck down or whatever. You know? So I think that that part of me took over and pretty much let these things happen without me really stepping back and having my other parts say, “What are you doing here?” You know? Because – so …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. You know, the kind of worthless, shriveled feeling that you talked about, about when you felt that earlier …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … when this just came out, is that a part of you that's in there beyond just this incident? In other words, have you had those kinds of worthless feelings at other times in your life?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Don't remember when but – right off the top of my head. But oh yes, I've felt bad like that before in my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So that's been around different times.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not as bad as this time, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's probably been the worst, I'm sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's been the worst so far.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. So you're pretty angry at that part that got you involved with this woman.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK. Well, we just have a couple of minutes left, so let me just ask if there's anything else you think I should know or that you want to say before we stop.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Anything come to mind, Renee?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How you feeling now, Renee?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (chuckles) Feeling I'm trying to squelch like how mad I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This maybe wasn't the best thing to bring up in the last five minutes of the session. OK. So this discussion about that part, Dennis, triggered your angry part.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So just take a second and listen to it for a second and see what it wants you to say for it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It feels pretty twisted right here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your body feels a little twisted in there?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you just focus there and see what that part wants you to say for it? Maybe not have it take over but just what it wants you to say for it, to Dennis.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Just how angry I am that you would seek pleasure with someone else and not seek it with me. Because I wanted pleasure, too. And I'm committed to you and it offends me and it makes me really angry that you would seek it with someone else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, good. So focus there again now and just see how it feels now.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Maybe a little less tight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Little less tight? OK, good. Alright. OK. Anything – last words from you? (clients chuckle)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. (laughs)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You sure you're not grateful that I didn't lose it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's it for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Well again, I really thank you for coming down; particularly in this big crisis time. And I am good at helping people do the kinds of things we talked about.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Fantastic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'll think about these goals some more and I'd like you to also. And I guess we'll get back together in a couple of weeks. That sound OK?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sounds good, Dick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, good. Thanks again.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It didn't record the other day but I think it's recording now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it says recording.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So today is definitely not a good day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I use those for a bunch of things in the morning where one of my cats was very restless in the night and woke me up and then just wanted to keep me awake for a while (inaudible at 00:00:39), so that was a little tiring.</p>

<p>But yeah, it's harder for being a grumpy old lady. And I accidentally gave her one of her medications twice is what I think woke her up. But sometimes she just does that.</p>

<p>And so I just had a really, really hard time getting dressed and leaving the house, which like I was okay, then I grabbed like my favorite tee-shirt and then I started thinking about like oh, I can't find my tights so it was just really frustrating because I can't wear a dress. [00:01:28]</p>

<p>And I kind of went back and forth, can I wear a dress but I can't find my tights. And like doing that for a while and kind of looking for them and like no, I should just get dressed. But seriously, where are my tights like for a while.</p>

<p>And I started some laundry but then I was like wait. And then it was like nine o'clock and I said wait. [00:02:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when I realized it was nine o'clock I just like I felt really like just overwhelmed and immobilized.</p>

<p>So like for me like if the bus I may take like there are two of them. I catch it at 8:47 and one is at 9:05.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like whatever. And if I'm like 20 minutes late but I don't care. But so now it's like still being at my house it being nine o'clock, it's just like I don't know, I can probably - I kind of like staying home because I just can't even get out of the house normally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it's just sort of like I was thinking about all the things that I have to do this week and like all the work issues from last week and also, I don't know, just the meeting I have with Chet every Tuesday. [00:03:10]</p>

<p>And it's just I just really didn't want to go in. I just did not want to go to work. So the good thing that kept me going to work was well I have therapy and I have a doctor's appointment - a dentist appoint, so I have to go through the Square anyway, I should go to work. But that was about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I also was like kind of crying but I thought if I did that would just be like it. Like that would be it for the day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>[Crosstalk]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:03:59) pulling it together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:02) out the door?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm usually, you know - I'm good at just like, probably like here are the clothes okay, leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I'll put them out the night - I'll decide the night before and be like all right, I know what I'm doing and I can have a good routine to kind of get me through the morning. And just - I don't know, I just could not pull it together.</p>

<p>And I was feeling like wow, I can't like pull it together. Leaving the house I don't know if I can pull together everything else. [Pause]</p>

<p>And I also didn't want to just like call and be like, I'm running late. So I texted them I was running late which I feel really didn't help but it was like the only thing I could do. [00:05:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. [Pause]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Saturday - Saturday, this friend of mine Jenna just got dumped by her long-term boyfriend of ten years. And so we went over to a mutual friend's house and just like after dinner and drinks and, you know. [00:06:18]</p>

<p>And I (inaudible at 00:06:20) on Friday, it's hard because she didn't have these very, very intense self-hatred like she's someone who really wishes she didn't have a body at all. Like if she could just erase her body, she would.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And right now she feels like - she had a lot invested in that relationship because she has felt like because she is tall and fat and has student debt that no one would ever date her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:07:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And to her the most important thing was getting married and having a kid because otherwise she'd be a complete failure.</p>

<p>And so she's not dating her boyfriend anymore and she just feels like - and so she says very explicitly like no one is ever (inaudible at 00:07:18) again. I'm never going to have a kid. Even if it is like artificial insemination, I couldn't afford a kid. Everything is horrible, I (inaudible at 00:07:28).</p>

<p>And it's pretty hard to feel it and be around, but also one of the reasons why her boyfriend broke up with her is that he's uncomfortable with people who express emotions.</p>

<p>Yeah, her boyfriend had a really horrible, horrible childhood and his mom was schizophrenic and didn't (inaudible at 00:08:01) medication and was emotionally, physically abusive.</p>

<p>And her dad, he (inaudible at 00:08:09) for a while. He was like an absent-minded professor slash had (inaudible at 00:08:14) probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To him whenever someone expresses emotion it means something horrible is about to happen. Like his mom had locked him out of the house for four hours or whatever. So he basically memorized Ms. Manners' books to understand dealing with people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, (inaudible at 00:08:40) mentioned it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He mentioned it. It's really, really sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And one of the things about learning about Ms. Manners' in (inaudible at 00:08:48) was that, you know, that's the social fa√ßade, it's not to do with your emotions at all. And in many ways it's like it's not expressing your emotions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's - so it's hard for me tell Jenna like I - please stop. It's hard for me to talk about how much you hate yourself because like that was kind of that's the big star point of the breakup. [00:09:19]</p>

<p>One of the big star points of the breakup for her is she feels like if she expresses emotions then people believe her and will never speak to her again (inaudible at 00:09:30).</p>

<p>But that said, it's hard to like, you know, we're sitting around talking and then she launches into like - I guess what's so hard about it is that she feels it's very much like facts. Like it is just a fact that her ex-boyfriend will get married within the next year and she never will. [00:10:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that no one will ever find her attractive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did she tell you how it is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's just true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's also feeling really right now very angry but everyone tries to be like no, it's going to be okay. She's going to say, "No it's not." I'm like well I mean true, you're not going to get your boyfriend back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what you want but there's somewhere between that and dying in the gutter, you know.</p>

<p>And to one of the things that she feels is like the fact that she's going to, you know, die alone is that she's fat. She's tall and she's fat and that no one could ever find her attractive. And like but not just that, it's like she really, really hates her body like very intensely and very like also like she doesn't self endure which is kind of amazing, but she does everything. [00:11:17]</p>

<p>Sometimes she'll like - she doesn't as much anymore but she used to like hit herself, like hit her thighs or her belly and be really angry about them.</p>

<p>And yeah like I'm like it's hard to listen to that. And it's also difficult like well, you know, it is true that when - women who are tall have a harder time getting dates. Women who are fat do have a hard time getting dates. Like that's true and I don't want to lie to you, but they also...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't mean she's going to die alone in the gutter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it's just really frustrating to deal with or even to be around. [00:12:07]</p>

<p>Like after listening to her for a while I was like wow, I feel really just kind of upset and depressed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>[Pause]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's - it's a combination of depressing that you hate yourself so much like that's just kind of sad. And just a litany of things that she hates about herself. I'm like well, you know, some things are like shared traits.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I know things that I don't hate about myself. It's the kind of thing where I'm like okay, you loathe yourself for being geeky and you feel like that's going to - that's ruining your life. And I think its awesome being geeky. [00:13:11]</p>

<p>And, you know, and it's also jarring because it's kind of jarring just concerning that. I'm like well, you know, when I get up in the morning or I'm doing whatever, these aren't things I think of about as being negative.</p>

<p>And like I'm aware (inaudible at 00:13:33) like yeah, you know, like society and larger culture sense, these are (inaudible at 00:13:41) negative but I don't really - it's not, like I (inaudible at 00:13:48) think about it usually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like you don't wake up feeling bad about being geeky? [00:14:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean if somebody stopped and quizzed you about cultures you're a geek, it's not like you wouldn't know, but it's not about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess there's something about her hating it and like persecuting herself for it sort of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not very troubling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is. It makes geekiness - it's like her geekiness, her fatness, and her height sort of all combined, she really, really hates.</p>

<p>And I guess, you know, it's like I never hated myself that way which I'm glad; really glad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I definitely think about that sometimes and part of it's because it's really horrible. [00:15:05]</p>

<p>Like I mean I know Jenna is not the only person I know who feels this way about theirselves and it's just kind of awful thinking like, you know, people I know and care about are just - or even don't know are just walking around hating themselves really, really, really intensely.</p>

<p>[Pause]</p>

<p>And I (inaudible at 00:15:32) like well, you know, it's not entirely untrue. Like some people will really dislike you for being fat or tall or geeky. Like that's true. I think it kind of makes it harder to think about and deal with because it's not that what she's saying is completely out of left field or completely wrong.</p>

<p>Like there's some amount of truth in it but she taking you to this like whole very negative place. [00:16:12]</p>

<p>I'm just really determined to sort of - it feels like she's very determined to say in the hitting herself [Pause] - I don't know she's determined to stay sort of hitting herself or that it's hard for her to think about her options. But when talking to her like you feel like whatever, it feels like sort whatever I say or someone else says kind of bounces. [00:17:09]</p>

<p>Like she has all these reasons why - and one she's like well that's not true because of this or that, but a lot of it comes down to like well, that's not true because I'm horrible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not quite sure what to do with this but you're into - people oftentimes or one of the frustrating experiences that you told me about is like people's implacability. I mean in this case about her self-hatred.</p>

<p>But (inaudible at 00:17:52) you're afraid of like absolutely no way to like get through to somebody or sort of no flexibility or nothing like modulating like how they're feeling or reacting.</p>

<p>It sounds kind of like this with her that there's like this sort of implacable self-hatred she has that you're totally helpless to do anything about and that I can imagine like somehow like starts to wear you down as you're confronted with it. Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean yeah. It's one of those where I feel like, you know, it's not that I think I can change her mind...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...in the next four seconds, but yeah, it's like there's sort of - it feels so wearing down because there's no room for another - for other options like. [00:19:10]</p>

<p>And it feels like she's sort of trying to like pull my - the (inaudible at 00:19:20) experience in to and then everything stops.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. (inaudible at 00:19:25) talking about for as well like how there's really no room for you and your job is sort of like jump on her bandwagon kind of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like she definitely wants you to agree, (inaudible at 00:19:40) trying to pull me in and I'm like no, I don't want to be pulled in to this (inaudible at 00:19:46).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then it's also well I just don't understand because like I have some exemption too. Like (inaudible at 00:20:02) hates easy for you because you're funny like. Or she's like well, you know, like no one wants to date someone who is fat except well I mean but you're not super fat and you have big breasts so that makes you different and I don't.</p>

<p>And I'm like well, like it's weird. Because she's (inaudible at 00:20:28) trying to pull me in to this everything is horrible and also like trying to tell - like I don't know, like re-identify or like say I'm not really - like she experiences all the negativity of fatness that I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. What, like she sort of kind of suck you in to what it's like for her and what it inevitably and absolutely going to be like for her. But at the same time like she's saying you're not really part of my cup of awfulness? [00:21:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that if I only understood how horrible it was then I would totally agree with her. And also just the sort of weirdness as her saying like no one loves me and no one ever loved me. And I'm like I'm right here, like I really care about you.</p>

<p>It makes me feel like I don't count or don't matter. And like I get that she's really upset and kind of lashing out, but it's also sucky to be there and trying to be sympathetic and getting this well like (inaudible at 00:22:03) doesn't like her.</p>

<p>Or if I try to bring up like this person is interested in you; this person isn't (inaudible at 00:22:10) would love to hang out with you.</p>

<p>Well like again, those don't matter or she sort it to the worst possible way of describing things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But where is the opportunity for you to actually have any feelings about anything, right? Like on one hand you don't know how horrible it is so you couldn't be feeling bad.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you've got to understand what it's like for her. On the other hand like, maybe like there's this way (inaudible at 00:23:06) like she's kind of talking you out of the opportunity to have any feelings or reactions to any of these kinds of things yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do think that. I also - I don't know, I also like why am I (inaudible at 00:23:30) like why am I spending this time trying to talk to her about it which is really tiring and exhausting if I don't know that she's listening or cares.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think - I mean if I would be right, but I think there's something in you that also fits in with this which is - to be dramatic, but like I think you have trouble having temper tantrums, you know. [00:24:02]</p>

<p>Like for kind of any - I think it would be hard for you to like take up that sort of space emotionally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she absolutely is making it very difficult, you know. Like no matter who you were, I think how she was treating you would make it very difficult.</p>

<p>But I think there's like something you have trouble with that gets like fitted in to that at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's true. I would have a hard time with a lot of what she's doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I don't know, like you're not involved with anybody long-term and like you may have some feelings about that. And I know you told me you have like course feelings like about how our culture treats better people. [00:25:12]</p>

<p>And you don't have the same kind of self-hatred that she does, but for me to sit and watch, you know, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that the other thing is like reminds me that sometimes I do have this like - all these moments of like (inaudible at 00:25:35) clothes and I'm like I really hate that none of these clothes fit or look good, and I'll get really upset or frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like to me like the part where I'm mad that I have a belly or whatever is relatively brief. It's mostly like I'm in the store and I'm really annoyed. [00:26:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, too quickly I'm like right, it's the clothes, it's not me. Like, you know, I'm not the one that's defective.</p>

<p>And some part of listening to Jenna talking about this, I won't say under - it also kind like undermines how I - how that experience worked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I suspect there's a way that she's trying to make you feel a bit of what she's feeling. So she either doesn't have to feel it so much or just feel so lonely or something else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:26:54) work out, get in there or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the other - the other big problem with Jenna in particular is that she has a lot of hatred towards the mental health system; like a lot. So it's very confusing. [00:27:17]</p>

<p>So her father is bipolar and her parents are divorced in part. She thought it was because her father is bipolar they got divorced; it was because he had an affair. She only found out recently.</p>

<p>But - so it's confusing that she blames her father being bipolar and not him getting any help for it and she's very mad at him about that because he was an asshole.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he started getting - taking medicine and getting help and she's mad at him about that as well because she feels like medication made him more of a jerk or made him like totally change his personality and made him more horrible. [00:28:01]</p>

<p>So she doesn't want to take - take any medication at all, ever. And she feels that anyone who takes medicine long-term or suggests she take it long-term like - so she felt like if I were to say, "Jenna, have you thought of like an antidepressant," that I'm saying all of her emotions are invalid and wrong...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and that she should - I'm trying to tell her she's (inaudible at 00:28:39).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she feels (inaudible at 00:28:44) that - she also feels there's something wrong with people who take medication long-term. It fundamentally changes who you are; your personality and I don't know, like it's definitely bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So part of what's really frustrating and upsetting is that she will often like weigh in on how much she hates taking medication and what it does to you and it's horrible and it's all these things. And I'm like, so Jenna you know that I'm on long-term (inaudible at 00:29:23); you know that.</p>

<p>And she said, "Well, it just kind of like doesn't really" - she would be like well, that's different. It doesn't really - sometimes she's back away from it; sometimes she won't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess the thing is it doesn't feel different to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It keeps really frustrating and insulting. And any discussion, like even if I just say like oh yeah, you know, I'm on (inaudible at 00:29:53) medication or something, it sends her off into this really - we usually get her this like very tense, angry, defensive are you saying I should be doing something.</p>

<p>It's the worse thing ever. I will never take it. Why would you even say that, which is hurtful. [00:30:10]</p>

<p>And also...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe she's getting angry that you're taking up space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. You mean taking up space in the conversation?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like having a right to your own feelings and reactions to what she's saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well with her it's sort of like it's not that I'm having my own feelings about it. She always thinks of it as I'm telling her what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I guess I - I'm sort of - I'm sort of creating those in my mind maybe they're different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think they are pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That your reactions feel like an imposition to her even though - because it's not at all how you mean them. [00:31:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it really keeps you in a corner I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does. And the other thing is that - so she also - she has suicidal feelings or expresses them at least (inaudible at 00:31:22).</p>

<p>And she won't - she doesn't want to discuss them with her therapist because she feels like what will happen is that she has this sort of like if I tell my therapist she'll be mad at me and will send me to the hospital right away or she'll stop the therapy and say I have to take medication.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or if I try to take medication they'll just ignore me and say I'm bad. And like there's this whole thing. But she like won't do it. She won't talk to someone about it.</p>

<p>And it makes me feel like she's walking around with a broken leg and like (inaudible at 00:32:09) sprained ankle. And I'm like, you're going to break your leg if you keep on doing that, and she just won't do anything about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Except keep talking to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. She'll talk about it a lot, like it hurts so much. This really sucks. I can't walk. And I'm like umm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So yeah again, it seems to me it puts you at a really unfair position.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it, it puts you where essentially, helpless to do anything about it, in addition to being the only one or one of the few people who knows.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I would feel so much - it would be much easier to give myself space or to say like I need to not talk about this for a while, if I thought that she was talking to like; was actually talking to her therapist or would actually like call for help if she was feeling really suicidal. [00:33:09]</p>

<p>Except that I don't - like I don't want to put myself - it makes me feel like pulling away feels like very scary and dangerous because I don't really - like I don't know that she's going to do - doesn't do anything to take care of herself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you're feeling pretty responsible for her safety?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't want to. Like, I really don't want to be responsible for her (inaudible at 00:33:45).</p>

<p>[Pause]</p>

<p>And the thing is like I actually like I do think it's unfair to dump your suicidal feelings on someone repeatedly. Like I don't think like - I think that is an emotion that's too big and scary for people to handle and that's okay. [00:34:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. You mean too big and scary for her to handle; not for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think if whenever things have been like really - like (inaudible at 00:34:24) like you have all these feelings and they're too big and scary and I just can't handle it. And you sort of refer to all your emotions that you have.</p>

<p>And I'm like well there's a specific subset of emotions that you have that are too big and scary for me to handle, and I'm too big with those being too big and scary, like self-injury, wanting to kill herself, like I don't want to be the person handling it and it is really scary.</p>

<p>Like if she talked about self-injury and was also talking to her therapist about self-injury it wouldn't - I wouldn't feel as caught up in it. [00:35:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Yes, I imagine you would feel like, you know, it could be difficult to talk about, an upsetting subject. But it's not really in your hands in the same way, even though she's talking to her therapist about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I feel like people I know who do (inaudible at 00:35:27) super hard to talk about, but people who are working on it and doing something about it, it feels - like that's really scary to talk about because it's upsetting to for you to think about you hurting yourself.</p>

<p>But like I also feel like you're trying to not hurt yourself, generally speaking. But with Jenna I feel like I don't have that like okay, you're not actively trying to hurt yourself right now. [00:36:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what can you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I'm trying to kind of ease in to. One thing I thought of doing is she wants to get out of her apartment a lot because it's - you know, it's depressing to be at home at night, and her apartment is having horrible plumbing programs and has had for a month. They don't have drainage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm like well, if you did something which didn't really involve talking...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh sorry. Okay, go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like we could go see a movie and we wouldn't really talk, it would be great. But yeah, that wasn't what you were assessing. [00:37:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I guess there's nothing wrong with dealing with it directly if there are ways to deal with you directly. So she just keeps putting you in this position.</p>

<p>I guess what I'm saying is like if that works; great. [Pause]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But is there more directly a safe way to stop?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I don't mean to be (inaudible at 00:37:37). Like [pause] I think it's probably pretty hard for you to speak up about how it feels to hurt - to be put in this position, though you have a right to feel like scared; overwhelmed, kind of unfairly put upon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really not fair to you. I mean (inaudible at 00:38:24) sometimes or things like that. But it's very to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She should just take responsibility if she's jut telling you and not telling anybody else. And like, you know, she might be smart with it and feel a little less (inaudible at 00:38:42), but it's an impressive thing to do and it's not fair to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's hard to think, well I think it's like well, she's having this moment of crisis and can I say like is this a good time to be like stop.</p>

<p>But I think also that like no, she's actually like been doing this for a really long time. [00:39:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Pause]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she's stressing you out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. Like it's - yeah, it's really stressful and it's hard to - I find it hard to talk about with other people and like yet I would like to be some part of her but I don't - like I don't know that she's really letting me do that in a way that I want to or that I can.</p>

<p>Or that's, you know, saying it makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. We're going to stop for now.</p>

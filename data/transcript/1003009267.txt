<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's why I have to know who's who.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Speaking of which, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never went beyond a whole one of the BuSpar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, but I am doing half in the mornings and half in the evenings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But most of the time it's like I don't remember to take it until like 9:00, 10:00 at night, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I have it all in its little thing, you know, right, sitting there in the kitchen, so I take it with dinner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But most of the time I don't remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, by the end of the evening, I've pretty much taken it, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the darkness does seem to be lifting a little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I have some medical questions I wanted to ask you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been trying to figure out when it is that [NAME OTHER] died.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want me to retrace from our notes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because the first session you gave me some pretty precise information.  I don't remember what I wrote down.  Oh, my goodness.  You were, you had said, uh, you had said [DATE] 3:00 AM.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that's what I'm trying t figure out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, I mean, he may have been brain dead at that time -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he was certainly still breathing when they took him away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, what, what I realized, I got a bill recently, and the bill was for anesthesia when they did the organ harvesting -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At which point he had already been declared dead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I asked them, "Why did you do anesthesia on someone who was dead?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they said it was the law, if there, you know, if they were harvesting organs, um, anyway, it just, I mean, is brain dead legally dead all over -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I understand the question now.  Here, here's my, here's my guess, because I'm not in that area, but, um, he had a massive heart attack is, is what you think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A hemorrhagic stroke.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hemorrhagic stroke.  Okay.  That makes even more sense.  So he had a massive injury to his brain, but his heart was still beating?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if they say someone's brain dead, in, in polite kind of terms what they're saying is that there's been such a injury to the brain, you have [INAUDIBLE] that, um, that the person will never recover and be able to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Be themself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Be themselves and have thought and interact and so forth and so on.  So I imagine that they keep, they, I'm guessing that they do anesthesia because, if they're using their organs, kidneys, and what have you, for transplant, they want them to be, they can't use them from someone who's died.  They use them from someone who is not going to recover, but they, you know, they remove them when they're still vital and healthy.  That's what I'm guessing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Yeah.  They told me it was a legal thing.  It just struck me as -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But why you get a bill, that, that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that's why I called them actually because, I mean, I said, "Why am I getting this bill?  Why am I being charged for anesthesia?"  And they said, the hospital said, "Well, you have to call the organ donation network, the sharing network."  And I  tried to call them a couple of times, and every time I called them their line was busy.  And finally I realized, you know, I had been harboring resentment against the organ donation people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And finally I realized, you know, Blue Cross Blue Shield has already paid its share.  If I make a big fuss about this, it's only going to be aggravation.  My share is like only about $200 or whatever.  I'm just going to pay it.  And that actually seemed to be liberating in some way because I finally, you know, accepted that the organ people were good people and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's shocking to me that they sent you a bill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's shocking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been, I've been giving donations to my local First Aid Ambulance Squad for years, and years, and years.  They sent two ambulances.  I got one bill for $1500.00 and one bill for $1800.00, so I don't know what I give money to.  It's clearly a profit making organization.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Volunteer.  The volunteer ambulance sent you a bill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They surely did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's also, what town?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because my son had his -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> First Aid Squad.  [DEIDENTIFIED]  First Aid Squad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> My son had -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> FAS.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> His appendix out and I was going to drive him.  We thought it was bad, and I was going to drive him and all of a sudden he got ashen and collapsing and everything and he said, "I can't make it."  So we called the First Aid Squad, and we never got a bill.  I think we made a donation because we appreciated it, but are you sure it's a voluntary -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it's from the [DEIDENTIFIED] First Aid Squad.  Maybe there's two different ones, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, they did a considerable amount of work on him at the house.  They didn't just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Transfer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I, I got you, but still.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, you know, I've -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's, uh, you know, there's, there, in certain towns have professional, uh, EMS, and certain towns have volunteer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, the bills are winding down and it hasn't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But that, that is shocking that, that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Oh, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because at a certain point they said, "He's not going to recover.  Would you like to donate his organs?"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that was not until he was at the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  But then -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The First Aid Squad people would not have known that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no.  But the anesthesia just, just say, uh, "We would like you to pay" -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I know.  The whole thing is, is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's bizarre.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's bizarre and outrageous and, at some point, the energy required -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To, to deal with it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is, is not worth it to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, it would just become this thing and at some point, you know, one of the great lessons I learned from my mother was, if a problem can be solved by throwing money at it, and you have the money to throw, get over it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, there, there are principles involved, but yeah.  I just, I mean, how many days was I going to spend trying to reach the organ people?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so, but that, that did suddenly raise the whole issue of when was he actually, and I still, to me I really don't know, well, I don't know really what dead means anymore.  You know, he's gone, I know that.  [CRYING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't know what dead really is.  Not breathing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, yeah.  I mean, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Since nobody has ever come back to tell us what dead is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I guess, when there's a head injury or it's, you know, the kind of thing that he had, I guess, the centers that affect thought and, you know, making a person a person were affected, but not the ones that affect -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they, they -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Keeping your heat going.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They did resuscitate him and intubate him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he was not breathing on his own -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At that point.  And they, in fact, said if they were to take him off the life support they didn't expect him to be able to sustain -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> His own respiration.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that, that's what, the difference between dead and brain dead -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I still don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] person alive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When he left the house, he was breathing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  So some point -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, at some point, when he got to the hospital, he stopped breathing, because they resuscitated him.  So, you know, he did die sometime on Saturday [DATE], although they pronounced him dead on Sunday, after they did these tests and checked the electricity in his brain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, so it was like 24 hours or more after?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes.  I mean, he was declared dead on [DATE] at 8:00 PM.  So, um, Monday was my birthday, which was a very hard day.  I stayed home and pretty much just cried all day.  [CRYING].  I mean, I feel like I'm starting to accept that he's gone, but that doesn't make it necessarily any easier, doesn't make the pain any less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I, I feel like I'm no longer waiting for it to come back.  You know, I go through these moments where I think, "Oh, well, I'm over this."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.  I, I'm very frustrated.  I feel, there's, um, this CS.  Lewis Book, A Grief Observed.  I don't know if you've read that.  It deals a lot with God and that's, you know, annoying, but at some point he said, "Grief feels like waiting.  Everything becomes provisional."  You know, there's no, there's no more permanence.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's how I feel.  You know, like, I can't, I can't get back to normal because there is no normal and I just feel like I'm stuck in limbo.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but then there are moments when, you know, I feel okay.  And it's like, okay, [NAME OTHER]'s gone.  This is all over.  You know, that, that doesn't last for very long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.  Well, there's no question it's two steps forward and one back.  I mean, uh, uh, I think, I think even,  you know, the, uh, Kubler-Ross book, On Death And Dying, is about a person themselves, like she studied people who are -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] cancer.  But I think people, survivors of people who die go through a similar thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she has another book out called, um, On Grief and Grieving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which is, for the grieving person, a much better book than the On Death and Dying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's a fairly good book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so I'm sure if you've read that, you should know that people don't go through these -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] stages.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They go forward and they go back and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, yes.  It's not you go through anger and then you're done with anger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  So, you, you, you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Move fluidly back and forth and, uh, there might be times that you catch yourself and you're involved in things and you're thinking, "Oh, I'm kind of doing okay."  And then something, a TV commercial -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Another moment -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you'll be right back where you were.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the fact that you are able to, you know, get to those places where you're doing a little better allows you to think that, "Maybe in time I will spend more of my time like that."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I have been very angry at [NAME OTHER], that he left me because that's how it feels -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that he left me.  It just breaks my heart.  The whole thing just breaks my heart.  I mean, that's how I feel mainly is that my heart is broken.  It will never be whole again.  [CRYING].  This was the great love of my life, and so now I'm just alone.  I mean, I have friends and I'll go out and I'll travel and I'll do stuff, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is not what you pictured happening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Not at all.  And I was telling this to [NAME OTHER], um, last time I was there.  I always used to think people with children had an automatic built in reason to live.  Everyone else had to sort of find one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I had found one in this relationship.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And now that's gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, uh, what you, have a, let me first me first ask what she said about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, she said she felt that was right about people with kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's true that it's automatic, but I would also wonder whether a therapist wouldn't say, "Well, whether you have children or not, you're supposed to feel, you know."  Mental health would be that you would want to live for, for other reasons.  You know, not just because of the kids.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean, the kids do eventually move away and you have to find, you know, other reasons, but I think people with kids -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  They're still, no.  I, I'm not disagreeing with that part.  No.  I think then you feel like there's always going to be another stage.  You're still their parent.  Then, they, they, you still want to have a relationship -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If they still need you in some ways -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but other people, who don't have children, um, you would hope would develop relationships and activities and things that foster them feeling a desire to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and I had that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that was the only thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it was the main thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That was the main thing?  Well, so that's a tremendous loss.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That was the main thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was the main -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you have other things.  You've told me about other things too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  And, and, actually a good thing has happened recently.  After five years of teaching crappy composition for [DEIDENTIFIED], they have finally offered me a literature course.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm hoping it doesn't get cancelled because I assume that this is an elective, not a required course.  So it needs, seven people somewhere in the world have to want to take this course.  So I'm hoping that that happens.  And I don't know if I told you about my trip to Alaska that I'm planning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think you did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's, that's something to look forward to.  But, basically, the core of, of my life, the light in my heart is gone, and it just pisses me off.  It's hard to not, it's hard to not feel that this is some kind of rebuke.  And it's interesting, as I was talking to my friend [NAME OTHER], the woman's whose husband died, and when I said that, that I felt like I was being punished by God, she found that very, very, "Oh, no.  No," you know, and then we talked about depression.  And it was interesting to me, she said, "No.  I'm not taking any antidepressants."  And I said, "Well, I've always had a history of depression," and she said, "Oh, well, I never have."  And suddenly I saw that there are people who don't get depressed.  They get sad, you know, they grieve, but they don't get depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or at least not, I mean, it's interesting people have been telling me things like, you know, they've known all my life that I had tendencies toward depression.  [NAME OTHER] used to have her dark moments.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Still, in all, you've never had, never like this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.  I mean, the first time I really suffered a major depression was when my mother died.  And, and I do think that, you know, that the, that the death brings up all kinds of abandonment issues from when I was a kid and my mother's parents died and she essentially was, you know, out to lunch.  She was like no longer there.  I was five years old.  I view, I have this one memory of being in the car with her and wanting her to take me someplace, and she just kept saying, "We can't go.  We can't go," and I was like hysterical.  I mean, I just remember at that moment feeling that my heart was breaking.  I don't even know what it was that I wanted, but whatever it was, um, and I remember that, you know, really vividly.  And, and I feel like I, I go back to that little girl, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The other thing I was going to say is that, hopefully, your friend won't, won't become depressed, but she might.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She might, well, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it can happen to anybody whether they've had some milder symptoms in the past or, or not.  You know, it can happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A friend, another friend of ours said, you know, "I wonder what [NAME OTHER]'s going to do after this documentary gets made," because she's, you know, like got this focus right now on making this documentary about her husband.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  He had some un, he had some recorded material that had not been made into an album, and so she started to work on that.  And people started coming out of the woodwork to help her, musicians and things, and so she decided to make a documentary about that process.  And so this other friend of ours, [NAME OTHER], said, "I wonder what's going to happen to [NAME OTHER] when the documentary is done," and I said, "Well, at least it'll get her through the year."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's true.  I mean, she sounds like a strong person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  She -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, to, to, I mean, if she, if you tell me she was doing this five years from now I'd say sure, but to do it now it's kind of amazing to me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that's when, um, what's her name wrote her book apparently.  Um, oh, what is her name?  She was on all the talk shows and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> About what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, The Year of Magical Thinking, um, Joan Didion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She wrote a book called The Year of Magical Thinking after her husband died.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She was already a writer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  She was already a writer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And here she's taking on this big, you know, that's what writers do, but here's this lady is taking on, I mean, her -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  There, well, she gets to, you know, be with all the musician friends and yeah.  It's her, it's become her project.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.  I mean, it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's become her, her obsessive project.  I actually had intended to, to write our story.  I have not been able to do that.  I've been keeping a journal, but I don't like thinking about the bad times, and we certainly had many years of them before the 20 years of the good ones.  And I just haven't been able to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  It was still, you still could.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I still could, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you started out by saying you're coming out of the darkness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I do feel the darkness is lifting a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not that much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I still cry every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you, you mean that because there are times that you're a little better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.  So, the Zoloft we paused at a 100 because of the, the GI [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, because certainly people are on more than that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I really do want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, and you felt [INAUDIBLE] also on the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On the 150.  All right.  So the trazodone, you're on 15 twice.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I'm not doing any of the trazodone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sorry.  The, BuSpar.  Sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm, I'm taking half of the three, the [INAUDIBLE] divided into threes, and I, and in half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking half in the morning and half in the evening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm taking a whole one of those.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Now, um, that's, that's still very modest.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, did you have any side effects from it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I've had indigestion -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Lately.  Um, and I take Pepcid every day, prophylactically, so the fact that I'm having indigestion, but I'm also taking the folic acid thing.  Now, what is that supposed to be doing for me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the, the reason we added that is that, uh, some people feel that, well, folic acid is a cofactor in the synthesis of neurotransmitters.  Some people feel that adding that it enhance the response of, I guess I did that because we hit that ceiling with -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Zoloft and I want to see if we can get a little more oomph out of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's actually a prescription, like a more high powered form of folic acid that we can use, but I thought we'd just use that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think that may be part of what's causing the indigestion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  The folic acid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I, well, I have a very fritzy stomach.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So you want to just stop that one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I mean, I'm willing to, to keep trying, you know, to see if I could tolerate it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, because the, um, did the, did, do we have any way of knowing which, if either might be adding something between the BuSpar and the folic acid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It seems unlikely to me that it would be the BuSpar, but I don't really know.  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we, we gave that to you.  I mean, I hate to, uh, we, we did two things at once which is always a little dicey, but we gave that to you because you're complaining of anxiety.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  And that seems to have -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Improved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Improved.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  So we can leave that there.  That's a very low dose of BuSpar.  I've had people on that dose, but more typically are in like 30 to 60.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I think that that is what I was on -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was 30?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In the past.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that would mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was just the one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, half, uh, just one pill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fifteen mg.  So you tell me.  I mean, we could increase that a little bit or we could let that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm not eager to, to change the meds at this point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I feel like the changing just, you know, yeah.  I just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I would tell you that, if you wanted to skip the folic acid for few days -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two or three days, and see if your stomach was better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If it was better, I would stay off of it, and then I'd see whether, you know, is it any downturn which -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which I wouldn't suspect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I can, I can give that a try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But you'd rather give it more time and, you know, you're going to see [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go that way and keep the medications modest.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Definitely, because, I mean, I never got off the Zoloft, ever, ever, ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't really, even though I was taking a tiny, tiny amount -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I still could not totally get off of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't like that.  You know, I don't, I don't like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were, you were on a very tiny -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Amount.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was.  I know I was.  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But when I would totally stop taking it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would feel depression symptoms coming back, just this total, you know, like down feeling and, and I, it would make me eat sugar.  And that's the other thing.  I'm trying to wean myself off sugar right now.  That's, I mean, I'm, I'm off candy, so I'm trying to get off the sugar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, you're still on a moderate dose of Zoloft, and a very modest, a very modest of BuSpar.  So we can stick with those and that, as I said, I would try skipping the folic acid because [INAUDIBLE] your stomach's better then -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It, it's not worth taking that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I'll, I'll give that a try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think I have to give you more Zoloft though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I, I actually brought them so you could see what -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the BuSpar you've got -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Zoloft we've got to give you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no refills on the BuSpar, on the Zoloft.  I have one refill on the BuSpar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Plus you still have a lot left.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I have no refills on -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lorazepam.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

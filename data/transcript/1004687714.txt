<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess just let me know as far as, do you know when you'll be starting on the?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll start in August.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't actually signed the contract or whatever or done the application but he said, I had talked to the person that you gave me the number.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was he helpful?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was very helpful. He said that they wouldn't know the numbers until the (inaudible at 00:00: 34) on the tenth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine. So he said he'd pick you up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I don't know where you and I left off with this but I should be back on Blue Cross as of this week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well by the beginning of August. I'm thinking it's quite likely, especially after this last go around with them, that I will quit Blue Cross as of January 1st. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that will just mean that basically that I pay you and they pay me back right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes that's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might also mean, depending on the plan, that you have a deductible and your co-pay is a little higher.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I do have a deductible it's either one thousand or two thousand dollars.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I need to—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The co-pay don't worry about because the recording will take care of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I knew there was going to be a deductible anyway so not to worry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's not a big deal about the claims (inaudible at 00:01:46) until next week, at least for me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That was a lot of trouble. (Laughs) That appeal. Do you think they design it that way so that people will (inaudible at 00:02:00)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs) Sounds plausible. [00:02:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I'm taking the medicine Depakote, I've been taking it for three days. I'm taking the baby dosage so I can't tell if it's making a difference. It's not unexpected, it's unexpected for it to make a difference at this point. (Pause) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry I must have just (inaudible at 00:02:34) the clock which I entirely forgot to do. (Pause, zipper sound).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, hopefully. I'm trying not get my hopes up as always.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry? [00:02:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying not to get my hopes up as always (pause, sighs). I don't know if the Adderall is, I've started skipping a day a week so it'll work more effectively for the rest of the month and it really does. I feel like (laughs) I kind of feel like the result is that I'm manic in the morning and depressed at night (both laugh). So I think I'll (inaudible at 00:03:37) to plan that around ten o'clock in the morning—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, I'm more functioning so that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:03:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really good to have grandma here, she's good. A very good listener and somebody that's easy for me to talk to. She was here for just kind of one whole day we kind of (inaudible at 00:04:15), had lunch, and walked around some. Then we went home and were like let's try having a beer and we kind of sat down with a sandwich and she was like 'Tanya (sp?) how are you?' And so I was just like well I'm having a really hard time. I told her what my life has been like and you were right, I did feel better after. Go figure (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) And I'm just all over the place. (Pause) Sorry I'm having trouble even (pause) putting a sentence together. I spent about two hours last night thinking about when I started the medicine, I usually (inaudible at 00:05:45) like NIH website, Wikipedia, and all that. And I found a site called crazymeds which is extremely entertaining. It's written mostly by a man, I think, who has severe bi-polar disorder with a lot of contributions from other people and they just try to cover all of the (pause) you know all medicines that are prescribed for mental illness or for like neurological issues. And it's refreshingly subjective. (Laughs, pause) Yeah I go back and forth with that (inaudible at 00:06:58) about whether or not I think it will help, or can help. You know, what degree of unpleasant side effects is worth it? I mean my major concern for, could be for all of the ones that work basically is slowing your brain down, is that it will slow my brain down (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it's mostly a false choice and it's mostly a choice that is made up in my head, but I kind of think well what happens if I do have to choose between feeling better and (pause) you know (pause) being at full competence capacity? What do I do? (Pause) There is a girl in the hospital who is having a manic episode, two girls actually, were both in a manic episode and it was hilarious and awful at the same time. But also very sweet people, but just crazy but also very like my sister so I kind of could handle it pretty well (both laugh). After that hospitalization I told Jordan I thought she had bi-polar too. (Laughs) But this girl was just adamant, I mean she was in there basically against her will where she had attacked her mother and her parents had put her in the psych ward, reasonably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they just, they weren't handling her case very well because nobody was telling her what was going on. Like she didn't hear, she didn't know that they had diagnosed her with bi-polar disorder at like the first or second meeting with her until the day that she left the hospital. And she left the hospital because she was being transferred.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not because she was leaving, but she just didn't want to be there, which I think was a really good choice for her. And she just said over and over and over again, you know, I don't want to take medicine, I like who I am, I don't want to change, I don't want to be somebody different. (Pause) And then I ran into her when I was at the partial program she was, you know at first she was just kind of like wandering around because they can do that, they basically (inaudible at 00:10:17) the ward. And then she was also in the partial program with me so we were in the same session on manic bi-polar disorders, and having five manic people in a room while the intern (laughs) is trying to explain mania is the funniest thing I have ever seen. (Both laugh) I felt kind of bad for the woman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (both laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway, but she started taking Respitrol (sp?) and it just really helped her and she said (pause) she said 'yeah I still feel like myself, I just have control now'. (inaudible at 00:11:15) good, happy ending for her. (Pause) I'm kind of worried about that. (Pause) And I also just feel like it's just not fair that everybody has the one medication that really works and they feel better and that's what they need.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not in the slightest, I mean it's not fair.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles) Yeah. You know, and then I recognize that the fact that it's not fair (pause) in one sense, in some sense does not mean a damn thing. That's just the way it is, but (pause) I'm glad this girl's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:12:23)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I wish we all got good treatment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) (inaudible at 00:12:53)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) (inaudible at 00:13:15) And yeah I just, didn't feel good about the things I need to do instead of feeling crushed by them. But it's more like it muffles the (inaudible at 00:13:41) that it takes away. And I will take that, that is great. (Laughs) That's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right that's a good deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) You know, if I'm ever going to sleep I have to stop taking it eventually, I have to, it looks like, skip a dose once a week in order for it to keep working because it tends to stop working unless I do that. (Pause) Yeah I just don't - (pause) So okay, if I find the medicine that makes me feel better, what happens after that? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) What happens in terms of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean like in terms of you and I, in terms of my treatment? I don't (pause) I (pause) and maybe it's just because things have not been so bad the last few days that I'm saying, okay well (pause) what happens if I can skip all these (inaudible at 00:15:37) and whatever?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) You sound (pause) even a bit worried by that? Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (Pause) You know I guess part of me is afraid that then you're just going to cut me loose. I'm not really worried about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just, it seems (pause) it seems clear to me that part of this depression is physiological and part of is has to do with my patterns of thinking and I don't know which part is which or how to separate them or how to make them work together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) So it's not clear how a medicine could help kind of change what things are like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (Pause) You know I could see a world in which a medicine that helps would just make it easier for me to (pause) you know, use the coping skills that I've developed that are (chuckles) mediocre at best. (Pause) It's funny, I don't feel (pause) you know that wake up scares me more. I come in here and I can sit down and I just, every time I just get so scared. (Pause) Sometimes it dissipates after and sometimes not. I'm really scared about different things (inaudible at 00:19:03).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I'm looking for things to attach to it, does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah I get the impression as you're talking that you're looking for something either from you or from me to kind of hold on to (pause) because, yeah, you are feeling so frightened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause, sighs) James and I talked last night about how his schedule is for the rest of the summer, which is always incredibly stressful because we want to see each other but it's hard to get there (chuckles) and expensive, and he has to get his work done. I think he's feeling a lot more pressure to just keep his head down and work. And I feel like I really rely on my sessions with you to keep me a little more stable and so (pause), and it's just a pain in the ass to buy plane tickets. And then I'm worried about money and so we worked something out and I think it's better to try to see each other less often but for longer than me flying two days to see each other one day. (inaudible at 00:20:58).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess this is sort of a side issue but if it would ever be possible to Skype while you're there (inaudible at 00:21:12).</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be really helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That could be really helpful, yeah. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:21:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) James doesn't currently have internet in his apartment, he'd still have to pay some, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not fast enough to Skype but he's been talking for about two years about just about (inaudible at 00:21:42) so. I think this would be a (laughing, inaudible at00:21:44) for you to do that. (Pause) What was I going to say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Insurance won't cover it once it kicks in, they would do spec (sp?) visits but, whatever. I mean for my part I'm not concerned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I would be missing like one of my (inaudible at 00:22:22) rather than three. (Pause) I don't (pause) I'm flat on [inaudible] And I've started doing this research for work. And it's really fun, but I can only go for a couple of hours before I just get too tired. [00:23:03] I mean, you know, it's hard to do more than a couple of hours of mental work at a time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah I just (pause) I can't tell if I'm scared because everything in my life is in disarray or whether that just what I'm using to make sense out of it. (Pause) Yeah, could be (inaudible at 00:24:11). [00:24:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) I (pause) I wonder if you feel (pause) scared in here (pause) because (pause) you can feel (pause) terribly alone, very much on your own (pause) which (pause) and as you can certainly feel other times and places, but which doesn't, kind of hang there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it hangs there. [00:25:21] I mean, I don't know. That's something to think about. (Pause) I don't know what I'm feeling. One thing that is a possibility, you know I come in here and I, mornings are my best times and so usually I pick it up and I mess around on the Internet for an hour and a half before I get on a bus and I'll be reading a book before I'm here and (inaudible at 00:26:16) some coffee beforehand and just be well. And then I get here and I sit down and as soon as I stop it's like, oh God it's still there. [00:26:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Every single time it's still there. I still (pause), eventually I recognize patterns (laughs) it's a hard thing to have to expect but I guess (pause) I don't know. You know they say that the (pause) issues in the patients' relationships will play out in the relationships between patient and therapist. So I've been paying attention to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:27:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not coming up with much (both laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Imagine that I like you and I trust you, and I really trust you. (Pause) But that's not (pause, sighs) you know it doesn't feel like I'm upset with you because I'm not getting better. I keep expecting that to happen but it doesn't. (Pause) I don't know. (Pause) The string's kind of (inaudible at 00:28:28), I mean the therapy string. (Pause) I don't know, I guess I really trust that if you could help you would. I really do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:28:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But in some ways that makes things a little (groans) a little harder. (inaudible at 00:29:08). (Pause) And this is it. (Pause) sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry because not helping means I can't (client laughs) rather than I don't want to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is (pause) a more helpless situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Pause) And (pause, sighs) the Adderall makes me feel like I have control over my life and it's a pretty good thing. [00:30:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause, chuckles) at least on some level I definitely think it just gives me the illusion of control over my own life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (Pause) Yeah I guess (pause) it does seem to me like (pause) on one side the degree of control you have or the things that you do that feel constructive or connected is a good thing, but on the other hand (pause) I guess it seems to me like they can be distractions and even alienating from (pause) the more depressive, painful feelings you have. [00:32:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess (pause) what I've started thinking about in here is that (pause) there are fewer of those.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Distractions?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes (laughs). Yeah I mean most therapists that I have seen in the past have been oriented toward problem solving. You know, what am I trying to handle in my life let's find ways to help me. Which is helpful. But you don't really do that (laughs). And I know there's got to be a good reason for that, there's got to be a reason for it anyway (laughs). And yeah, I mean (pause) those things do often, you know I can talk about the best way to solve an individual problem and then it doesn't really get to what's actually going on. [00:33:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then it distracts from that. But at the same time, I have to get out of bed, and call my parents, and find a job, and get insurance, and not be homeless, and I don't have of good sense of any one thing as being particularly more difficult than the others, you know, it's as difficult to do laundry as it is to fight with the insurance company often. You know there's no getting around those things. Or I can't just not do them. You know that's what living is. (Pause, therapist clears throat) And I don't know what to do about it. [00:35:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause, door closes) Wait, there's something going on there. (Pause) What is it? [00:36:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause, crying) Actually I just didn't have anything more important to say than wanting to cry (laughs). (Pause, crying) Which is kind of how it works sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause, client crying) I don't (pause), I guess I understand but (pause) I don't think what you were just describing a decision so much as a decision. [00:37:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah. It feels like one, but that doesn't mean it is one. What do you mean when you say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) You can call these things distractions, doing the laundry, calling the profs, getting out of bed, but that's life. (Pause) I (pause), and then maybe it goes further. [00:38:46] Maybe it's (pause), it starts to be a little bit like you and I are going to take sides on that and we know which side we're each going to take.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually don't know which side you're going to take. I don't know what the sides are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean maybe I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Voices overlapping, inaudible at 00:39:12) and the (client laughs) these things need to be done side.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm trying to avoid putting you in that situation, so really I just put you in that situation in my head (both laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think there are two different sides here, I don't think this is a dichotomy at all. (Pause) Imagine if all your life, of course getting things done, getting out of bed, getting yourself moving is life. [00:39:59] As is all this awful stuff you're feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm. (Pause) Yeah, I mean I think the whole (inaudible at 00:40:19) about what would happen if I just stopped doing it all. And I just don't like myself in that picture. (Pause, crying) Yeah. (Pause) You know (pause) I'd be more of a burden on other people, more than I already am and the things that I actually value I wouldn't do. [00:41:14] (Pause) I'd just starve to death and then that would suck. I guess I feel like I'm just like (pause) trying to push my life in the directions that I believe are good even though I really don't want to go there. Even though I really don't want to be doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean you can't just cry in public all the time. I mean I cry in public probably more than most people (chuckles) but you just can't do it all the time. (Pause, crying) Because people don't hear you when you're visibly upset in the same way that they do when you're not. [00:42:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause, crying) I don't know. (Pause, crying) And I also wonder (pause) to what extent, you know, dwelling on the sadness just makes it worse. [00:43:25] You know will it just go away if I never really think about it? (Pause, therapist clears throat) The sense that I get from you is that you do not thing that that is the case, but I might be wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause, chuckles) Well if I were going to take sides (both laugh), which I've apparently already done, I guess that's the side I'm being assigned. (Client laughs) I mean -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I feel like a jerk (laughs). [00:44:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not a jerk you're just trying to manage something incredibly painful and overwhelming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah but I don't like to manage it at other people's expense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I guess I could say, as a matter of fact I fully hear that statement but I don't think trying not to think about it to make it go away may not work out so well, so far anyway. [00:45:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: However, what I think is more salient at the moment is (pause) I think making that dichotomy out of the more (inaudible at 00:45:33) (pause) it's simple, keeps that distance from how awful it is. I mean I guess it highlights how impossible it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's time to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we'll talk more tomorrow. (Pause) I'll also probably send you a bill (inaudible at 00:46:12).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Last couple of times I've stood up I've been a little dizzy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm trying to take that a little slower (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is there a water fountain in this building?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There isn't, one floor down there's like a vending machine that has bottled water in it. If you the the elevator to the first floor then go right.</p>

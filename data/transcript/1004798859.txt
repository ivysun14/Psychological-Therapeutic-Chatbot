<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that same pressure [inaudible [00:00:06].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, which reminds me of scheduling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I'm still not sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. No problem, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't behind on [inaudible [00:00:18] from you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I'm waiting to finish some homework, and then figure it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this is starting soon. My last birthday is November 2. But I also need to rebook all my appointments. So if you look, my physical therapy appointments. At least some of them, because I had scheduled them conceptually around working a full day. But now I'll reschedule them, so I guess not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Yeah, just let me know and I'll do my best. [00:01:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. So the other thing is I have been feeling like kind of guilty. I haven't been that good with taking medical leave. Because I'm like "Well, you know, I've been working full time this long with pain, like whatever. Maybe I should just continue working full-time," even though like specialist and physical therapist were both like working full time and having a class is not—but then this weekend, I was in away on vacation and so one of the things that happens sometimes is I get referred pain in my lower back. And it really fucking hurts. [00:02:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Referred pain?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Referred pain, yeah. Like I'm standing weird or doing something else and then my lower back will start to really hurt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that started Saturday night, and hasn't really stopped since then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Which sucks. Yeah, so we were having like a party on Saturday night, and then I was just like "I have to go." Like I couldn't stand, I couldn't sit, and I was trying pacing, I'm like all these things hurt. And all these things still hurt. And sleeping hurts. So I do not feel as guilty about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad you're feeling less guilty, but I'm sorry for the reason. [00:03:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's—I don't even know. I'm kind of like "Well—hm." (pause) On the other hand, I also think that I internally pressured myself to come back from a leave probably earlier than I needed to for fibroid surgery. Like (pause) I sort of was like didn't admit it. I was like "Yeah, I can sort of kind of work." And I went back to work. And I do regret that. I think that was a really dumb idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. You [inaudible [00:03:38].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or at least afraid of both.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it was physically exhausting. (pause) And I think just it was [inaudible [00:03:53]. So I am working on trying to convince myself not to lead back immediately. Although we'll see. (pause) </p>

<p>Although, even though I feel bad about taking leave and everything, being able to tell Chet "Guess what, I'm taking a medical leave," sort of was very satisfying. Mostly because he just looked very much like "Oh fuck, what am I going to do." And I met with him again today [inaudible [00:04:37], whatever, and he was still pretty much "Fuck, what are we gonna do." It was mildly satisfying, but on the other hand, I'm trying to find out if I have to pack up my cube before I go, and he hasn't been able to answer that question. And (pause) I would just like to think. I'm kind of like "Uh, I have a limited amount of time." So I don't know. [00:05:13]</p>

<p>I mean, especially when it's like when I came back from vacation, everyone was like "Oh my God, thank God you're back. I have all these questions, I have all this work to dump on you." So it's kind of like, "Well, I'm glad that you noticed I was gone and that you sort of appreciate that I do a really good job. On the other hand, your appreciation is kind of expressed in [inaudible [00:05:51] pieces, which included like (pause) like a little effort. Like I hadn't had my coffee yet. I just sort of sat down, when I get into my office, freaking out about the candidate presentation, and I'm just like—I haven't, what... also because all of the prep had happened while I was gone. And I foolishly had thought that Chet would take care of it, and he didn't. (pause) I don't know. [00:06:32]</p>

<p>(pause) I guess I just sat freely. (pause) Like I'm really glad that I have great benefits, etc., etc. But (pause) like I also partially want that time off just to be—like one big benefit I see from [inaudible [00:07:10] physical therapy, it's like I won't be at work for a period of time. And (pause) I feel kind of (pause) a bit part of my anxiety about not being able to take the time off is because I just really don't want to go to work. And I'm kind of like "Well maybe, you know, like do I really need this time off physically, or do I just not want to go to work?" (pause) [00:07:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So really you're anxious in part just about how you're going to work? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like (pause) there's a little bit of like—it's almost like it's too good to be true. Even though it's (pause). I don't know, like in this weird way I feel like it's almost (pause) not too easy, but (pause) I don't know. I feel somewhat like I'm unfairly getting to have a paid leave when other people don't get any paid leave because it just isn't offered, or whatever. [00:09:24]</p>

<p>I mean, that's another thing I'm worried about, which I couldn't get an answer on for awhile. So my physical therapist was sort of like "Do you have a physical assessment?" I'm like no. "How far can you bend this joint and this joint?" And I don't have full range of motion on my right side, like in the leg, hip. Kind of like everything. And she was—I mean, she doesn't know if that will all come back. And that's worrisome. [00:10:08]</p>

<p>Like I didn't (pause) I didn't expect like hip, leg, back pain to be an outcome of fibroid surgery.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I wasn't really [inaudible [00:10:26]. So that worries me. And also that (pause) [inaudible [00:10:38] 25 pounds, and physical activity. And so that makes me nervous. (pause) Like I just don't (pause) Like not being able to have so much arm function would be a way to like get laid off or get fired. [00:11:12]</p>

<p>I don't know. I just, the level to which I don't trust anyone who manages me is (pause) periodically a little like (pause)—I didn't think about it the other day, but then periodically I'll sort of pause and think, I'm like "Wow, that really is kind of ridiculous. And I don't really know what (pause) there's not a lot really to do about it. (pause) Other than like jumping ahead, like going further and further up, and (pause) I just don't think, I don't feel like I'll get what I want. I'm not even sure if I could get like a half hour of time (pause) like with Karl's manager, because she's so busy. [00:12:20]</p>

<p>And also, you know, more like depressingly practically, does she like—she's very occupied with like [inaudible [00:12:33] and all this crazy stuff. So I kind of feel like why would she bother? Like me being upset and miserable and frustrated is probably the least of her worries. (pause) So I don't—I feel like I might not be able to get an appointment with her, and even if I could, it might just make me feel worse. Like I just don't totally trust that. But also that's shitty. [00:13:13]</p>

<p>And then I was also somewhat (pause) I didn't have much—I had a super frustrating conversation with Chet where I was saying that I didn't feel like the university would do the certain disparity design, and he was basically like "I hear that you don't want to do work unless all of your recommendations are followed."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, you did mention that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which (pause) it's kind of stuck with me, like as a worry. I don't think he's right (pause) because (pause) I mean, like obviously I would love it if everyone did what I wanted. But what I think actually I'm bothering is about, or why I keep on complaining, is I just want some kind of acknowledgement that like I might have something to say, it might be valid, and that it would matter enough for someone to say (pause)—to actually pay attention and then respond. [00:14:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You (pause) seem to be worrying about being at fault for things. I mean, even in here. Things that you know aren't true. Like that really what you want is to tell everybody what to do all the time; without that, you're not going to work with anybody. [00:15:25]</p>

<p>Or having just told me that you were pretty incapacitated for a time over the weekend, and that it's crucial in your job description to be able to use your body, that maybe you really shouldn't be going out on this leave and you're kind of taking advantage of your benefit. Or (pause) that it sort of requires an explanation for example of why you don't trust people who manage you. [00:16:02]</p>

<p>So I'm wondering about that. (pause) Yeah. Like I'm getting a sense of you kind of wanting to be reassured—well of course it makes sense for you to go on a leave. And of course you couldn't—really, you anticipate that meeting with another manager might not go well? (laughs) I can't imagine. Or (pause) what do you mean, I've always thought that—well, of course there's a big difference between not being able to at all and being the only one ever listened to by anyone else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, but I wonder—yeah. [00:17:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think part of—one of the things I've been thinking about with this like pulse, I just want to really do what I want, is I guess it's not—I mean, I don't think he's right, but I also wonder like "Do other people think that?" (pause) It's hard, because I don't feel like I have a career or [inaudible [00:17:38] a library career [inaudible [00:17:40]. I'm actually very confident in that, I think. But (pause) I also don't want to (pause) I would like a good recommendation at some point, so I don't want—I do worry a little bit about like do a lot of people perceive me as—I don't know, not quite a loose cannon, but (pause). [00:18:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess you seem to be wondering if I perceive you that way as well, and that you seem to be doing this here. (pause) I mean, I can understand your concern about (pause) work, in a way. I could have [inaudible [00:18:46] where you imagined I might be that way too, and maybe that's the concern. I would think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, what you're saying is that—I don't know. (pause) I'm certainly not aware of feeling that way. [00:19:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a possibility. Maybe your feelings of sort of guilt about some stuff make you feel like you have to defend yourself. Like, I mean the more obvious one is not going out on leave, I think. But I imagine you might feel guilty about feeling so angry and critical of Chet and other people at work. I'm not saying they don't deserve it. I'm not saying anything wrong, but I guess I imagined you might feel that way by being so angry and also critical of them. [00:20:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I think—I mean (pause) it's one of those things where I sort of feel like I'm talking to a wall, but (pause) not saying anything also makes me feel really frustrated and angry and upset. I was talking to a friend of mine, and her comment was, her interpretation of what was happening with like [inaudible [00:20:45] other things, is that these various managers felt anxiety and concern about like "I'm not really sure what we're going to buy, or what we're going to do," and that once they bought it, whatever, they don't want to recognize that they made a bad choice, or they possibly made a bad choice. So instead, it's really important that they spend all this time and effort demonstrating how this was actually a brilliant idea as opposed to maybe not. [00:21:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she was kind of like, think about how insecure and (pause)—it's more like think about what sort of what it is like to be someone who's super insecure about your decisions and so unable to say "Oh yeah, I make a mistake" that (pause) that you really just can't respond to anything. Because you have to be right, you have to make this really great decision, and even though you might realize that you made a mistake, at a certain level, the most important thing is shoring up your image. [00:22:26]</p>

<p>Which (pause) I don't know, like I do see her point of there's probably a lot of other people's egos caught up in why I'm stuck with various things. (pause) [00:23:00]</p>

<p>I guess part of it, just it seems so ridiculously childish. Like (pause) yeah, basically, it made me feel sort of—it feels childish and also like cutting off your nose to spite your face. (pause) And it's just—it makes me uncomfortable to think that three levels of management are more invested in not being wrong than anything else. (pause)</p>

<p>And then also, and I feel like, again, like why am I bothering to do a good job or try and be productive and be preemptive and blah blah blah blah blah, when it doesn't get anywhere. But I'm really terrible at not doing that. Like it's really hard to not get out and fix it. [00:24:35]</p>

<p>(pause) And the other thing, which is also super not comfortable for life is (pause) I don't know, I think last semester plus this semester, being in classes that I just don't like in school and other things, it makes me feel like—have this worry of "So what if I become a librarian and I'm still really frustrated?" [00:25:42]</p>

<p>I mean, I can see where a lot of these—like, most of the problems I'm having are people plus really toxic work culture and those things, you know, aren't going to follow me everywhere. But (pause) part of what I want [inaudible [00:26:11] is to have a sort of weird like—"I have more authority because I'm a professional, blah blah blah." [00:26:21]</p>

<p>And like I just really can't advance any further in my career right now without that degree, etc. So I just have these worries that I'll get the degree, I'll move somewhere sunny, and (pause) I'll still feel really mad and frustrated. Like whatever new job I have, will be terrible. (pause) [00:27:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess at first (pause) I mean the first few things that I said, I wondered if (pause) if you were feeling guilty. And then you said (pause) you sort of talked about this that maybe the management at work is really insecure and that's their issue. And I know that made you uncomfortable, but it was also frustrating, but it was also hard not to—hard to lose the job. [00:28:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) you know what I mean, like maybe you were making kind of a distinct step away from the conflict that I was referring to, that was the source of guilt. Like maybe they're really, really insecure and that's a problem, but it's not exactly a problem between us, and I'm going to lose my job anyway, because I cannot do anything—you know? [00:29:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Somewhat. I mean (pause) I guess part of what I'm thinking about is, is it possible to just ignore or drop the conflict? And (pause) like realizing that instead of talking about how it sucks, which it does, to just stop doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like let go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but beyond kind of letting it go, like let it go in an ongoing way. Just (pause) trying not to worry about it or think about it. (pause) [00:30:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like maybe it if made more sense in certain ways, why things unfolded the way they did, you'd be able to kind of not think about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, that would totally help. But also, if it's (pause) really nonsensical, then (pause) there's like nothing—[00:31:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if they're part of the same thing, you know? Or similar things. Where you're saying like, you know (pause) "if I didn't think of this so much in terms of the things that frustrate me and bring me in conflict with the people who are in charge (pause) they won't bug me so much."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you tired?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I am really [inaudible [00:31:52].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you been feeling that way—when did it hit you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't know why. (laughs) You know, I know [inaudible [00:32:04] tired. I sadly had a 4 a.m. airport shuttle on Monday for a 7 a.m. flight. Yes, and then I didn't sleep very well last night, so my back hurts. [00:32:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was not very [inaudible [00:32:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I also wanted to be [inaudible [00:32:30].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I went to see my doctor, but. And then also, I don't know, today was really—I felt like I was just running around all day. (pause) What I planned to do was work on this library homework assignment that I wanted to finish yesterday. And then like I couldn't find a way to sit down comfortably enough at all. So I just sort of gave up and watched TV. It's a project with a partner, so I feel like a jerk if I don't—[00:33:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Do your part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And also I'm pretty sure I know more about the subject than she does. So I'm being an extra jerk. But yeah, I don't know, I never got back to—like I said. And somehow—it's one of those days where I just was running around doing a lot of things, but I'm not sure that I could sit down and say "Well first I did this, and I spent an hour doing this, and I spent a half hour doing this." It's more like I was just busy and everyone was wanting to do things immediately. And like I said, it makes me feel kind of more pressured to do it quickly. [00:34:10]</p>

<p>But I saw my [inaudible [00:34:15], and after our appointment she's like "Oh, I have to e-mail you about getting your training," and my response was better do it really quick, in the next two weeks. (pause) So I'm worried about that too, where I'm just like—I mean, I know I can't get everything done, because something new always comes up, but I also know like (pause) when I'm out, anything to do with IT and developing is just more complicated. And more time-consuming. It takes longer, and blah blah blah blah blah. [00:35:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think you're feeling guilty for being out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And [inaudible [00:35:10] there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think—I mean it seems to become clear as we're talking that there's something about the guilt I think that has to do with sort of avoiding feeling conflict with people. Such as, well you know, it's really too bad that you need that inaudible [00:35:41]. I'm going to be out. You know, like it's not just like we're at cross purposes here. You need something from me and I need to be somewhere else, but that you feel bad. And I think it may be the sense of being at cross purposes or having sort of conflicting agendas. [00:36:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean part of it is that I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if the tiredness is related to coming up as we were both converging on that. And I know you're tired and it sounds totally different from what you're saying, but the way that it kind of hit you, that always makes somebody in my shoes kind of suspicious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean the other thing is, it's this weird way in which like the people that I support are like "Shit, you're out dang it." And Chet will be in a way because he has to do some of my work. But like Karl won't care. He'll just be like "Hm, stuff." (pause) [00:37:00]</p>

<p>And like when I come back, when I told Chet I was going to be out for six weeks, he was like "Oh crap that's a long time," blah blah blah. And (pause) like I don't—I'm not getting a "oh that really sucks that you're uncomfortable, you're getting physical therapy, wow that sounds really tough."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Oh my goodness, something must be going on, that you're going to be out for six weeks. Are you OK?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I mentioned briefly that my back really hurt, and his response was kind of like "Oh, be careful." I was just like "thanks." Not very useful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Also not very nice. [00:38:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just (pause) I feel like I would be nicer to someone I don't like, like out of reflexive niceness, than he is. And I also feel like (pause) I guess it's like, it's a valid complaint, but there's nowhere to go with it. (pause) And trying to get just like paperwork through has really reminded—made me feel super alone in that seat. The HR department will be like "We're dissolving whatever" and didn't want to fill out any parts of the paperwork even though they were supposed to. [00:39:00]</p>

<p>And you know, Chet doesn't care, or no one's really (pause) I don't know. Because I was thinking, like this weekend, I just imagined that people that I don't particularly like at that event were still totally capable of being like "Oh, that's too bad, blah blah blah." And I can't get my coworkers or management to do that. Even though I'm like "Oh, blah blah blah." How was my vacation, how was whatever. (pause)</p>

<p>And I feel weird saying it, but I think two of the things I want is someone to pay attention to me and someone to be nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And (pause) why do you feel weird saying that? Or what feels weird about that? [00:40:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess what feels weird about it is that there are emotional dividers about work, you know. I guess I feel like it's not OK, like (pause) it's not OK for my manager to be nice, like he only has to be concerned with like my job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're hurt, disappointed, and angry. Like (pause) you know, you're in so much pain you can't function, your doctor encouraged you to take time off [inaudible [00:41:00] this has been going on for two years. It was unexpected and certainly unwelcome. And (pause) nobody at work has even mentioned—certainly the people who work closely with you don't even give a shit. [00:41:19]</p>

<p>And (pause) I guess it seems to me that that's a much starker way of putting it than you have. But it also, I think, is pretty clear from the things you're saying. In other words, I don't feel like I'm telling you something you don't know, but I'm the one putting it starkly, more so than you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It's just so sucky to have it (pause) be like that is what's happening. And I really don't want that to be what's happening. [00:42:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. (pause) And also, I think I've definitely had several [inaudible [00:42:29] managers who (pause) don't feel like—don't think that how I feel emotionally is relevant. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what it reminds me of a little bit (pause) the thought that passed through my mind as we were talking about this is this kind of contributed a bit to what happened with Josie. I' not saying you're being used to treated badly in that way. That doesn't sound to me like what's going on. But what is similar, because I can imagine then as well, for not wanting to see how shitty certain things were, you kind of overlooked them, the way that I think you'll later wish you hadn't. [00:43:30]</p>

<p>Again, I'm not saying the same thing is going on. I'm just saying, I wonder if there's some of the same dynamic.</p>

<p>We have to stop for now, but we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I think I'm going to need to be out, I think it's a week from today. I'm sorry, from tomorrow. Out for Halloween, actually. But I will—I'll confirm it tomorrow. [00:44:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:44:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

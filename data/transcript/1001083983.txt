<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I'm seeing you a little earlier than planned, by a couple of days.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm, like I say I, ah, um, didn't plan on it.  I know, uh, was, um, I don't know.  Mostly it's, mostly seems to be my feet.  I, I don't know.  I tried to control my feet more than anything else.  I think I had this once before, and, um, I shake.  I mean at least I feel like I'm shaking.  But I can't seem to control it. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel like you're shaking right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel like you're shaking right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just my feet feels it that's all.  My body's not shaking.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum.  Okay.  Well, you know, [NAME OTHER] called me today up at the hospital and said move the appointment up.  I talked to your wife, too.  I wanted to see you alone only because I was hearing so much, yknow, concern since our last visit about the anxiety, um, that, yknow, obviously they're worried about you.  Um, I guess what [NAME OTHER] had said was that, and your wife as well, was that they've seen you do well at certain points, but then at other times you just kinda burst into tears.  Get overwhelmed.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It seems once in a while, yeah, because I think I feel that I try to control my, um, my feelings, and then all of a sudden it just grabs a hold of me and I just can't understand why.  I mean I don't want to shake, I don't think, I don't think I'm shaking, I don't know.  Am I shaking?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I didn't notice any shaking when you said that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But is it more like anxiety?  I mean is it more that, that you're anxious inside and feel like you're shaking.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it nerves?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I feel like I'm shaking, it's, I feel like my feet, I feel that, uh, when I walk, I'm not walking right.  I don't seem to be walking the way I normally, what I used to do before and it's seems like it was like this for the last two weeks and I can't understand why all of the sudden my walking is feeling the way it is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, what's changed in the last couple of weeks?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's different?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm.  I don't really know I mean I'm trying to figure out just what is different - nothing that I know of.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean I saw you a few weeks ago because of the anxiety after those accidents, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.  And I, when I, when I'm talking to you I feel good because you're here and it seems like when I'm off by myself I don't feel as good.  I don't know, sometimes I just get all mixed up and I try to get away from this feet problem here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just seems like it, whatever's doing this controlling my feet it's controlling my feet.  I try to relax my feet.  I can't relax my feet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you sleeping at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-hum.  My wife says I'm sleeping, but what happens is that I feel that I'm up most of the night.  I feel like I'm, um, seeing every hour.  But my wife says I sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So maybe, um, it's the shaking thing that does it.  I just can't - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your wife says that you sleep most of the night, but if you wake up once or twice with that shakey feeling it feels like you're not sleeping at all.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.  Usually because you didn't sleep at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now tell me what happened with the Buspar that you started.  That, I understand from [NAME OTHER], that you were taking it, but then you felt really groggy with it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, but I.  Ya know I, um, I just sit here talking with you and I say to myself I just wish this feeling in my legs would go away and I can't seem to find a way for it to go away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you take the Buspar today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This morning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I take it like, but then [NAME OTHER] said something about maybe don't take two of them, it'll make you sleepy.  But I can't feel it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But when you take it - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] tells me I sleep, but I think I don't sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, when you take a tablet of the Buspar in the morning what happens after you take it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't remember anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you go, do you fall asleep or nap?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I don't fall asleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Do you feel less anxious?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's what's happening.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> After you take it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  Well, after, afterward like right now I feel my legs very anxious.  I feel like I want to get up and just run away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ya know?  And I feel like my feet keep on and keep want to go.  But [NAME OTHER] says I don't walk right.  She says I'm not walking right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  And you're not on anything else new medication wise besides the Buspar?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're still taking your Depakote?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Depakote you're still taking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm still taking that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're taking 500 in the evening right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I have a, I don't know, feel kind of a shivery, shivery feeling that goes right to me and I just can't get rid of it.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And does it have any pattern to it?  Is it all the time? Or is it - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, when I'm home [NAME OTHER] tells me I sleep, but I think I don't sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She says that she doesn't think I, I think I don't sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But what about during the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you're awake during the day is there any pattern to the shivery feeling?  I mean do you get it a certain time of the day or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just kinda comes on any time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Comes on anytime.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does it go just as quickly as it comes?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Sometimes it does.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think if I could just get my feet something, I keep bouncing on my feet because it, I just can't seem to feel like I'm walking right.  Something bothers my feet to stop me from walking right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, let's just run through it.  I mean you're taking the Depakote and now the Buspar.  Anything else at all?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, no, just the Buspar, nothing else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Buspar and the Depakote.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Actually, once in a while I take aspirin.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Well, hum.  It sounds like anxiety to me.  It sounds like nervousness.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Although [NAME OTHER] was saying that you kinda burst into tears this morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I guess I did that mainly because I just don't want to be that way anymore.  I don't wanna be that way.  And sometimes when that happens then it goes away.  I, I just don't feel the same way I did when I came into the hospital that first time.  When I came in before the accident. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, in to see me you mean?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Come in to visit.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I came in the one time for a visit and uh - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Since the accident or before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, before the accident.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well before the accident you were doing pretty good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then you had the accident and you were in a few weeks ago and we tried the Buspar, although the question then was, yknow, were you more depressed or more anxious and nervous.  I think the answer a few weeks ago was you were more anxious, shaken up by the accident.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's, that's what - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's why we went to the Buspar, although it seems to me today that I mean you actually seem a little bit more depressed.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, well that's because I can't get to do what I really wanna do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now we chose the Buspar over the Wellbutrin because it seemed more anxiety?  But when you had a similar episode in the past, you did pretty good with Wellbutrin, when you had more depression.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, we did use, we had the Wellbutrin.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  They must have done better and better with the Wellbutrin - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you do seem more depressed today than you did the last time you were here so, yknow, if the Buspar's not doing much at this point, I mean you're fighting, I heard you moved it to bedtime, too?  Morning and bedtime, instead of morning and dinner time?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe we should go with the Wellbutrin.  Yknow and stop the Buspar and just go with that in the morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> See if I can do something with that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, cause if that did you well before, and you seem, like I said you seem more depressed today.  So maybe, maybe that'll help kinda get you out of the - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I seem to be able to drive, like why should I be able to drive a car and that shouldn't go away should it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I mean you still are able to do a lot of things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I seem to be doing a lot of things. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're able to do a lot of things it's just that your confidence is pretty low.  Yknow, it's not as bad as it was when you were in the hospital on [DEIDENTIFIED] in the past when you were hospitalized for depression.  It's obviously not that bad.  And we don't want it to get that bad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We want it to get better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just, just the only thing is, right in here I feel like a nervous thing that I can't stop.  It's right in here.  It's right in there.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a puzzle to me what that would be.  Buspar usually doesn't cause something like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just feel like a, a shakey feeling.  I think I'm walking, I know [NAME OTHER] says I'm not walking right.  I seem to be shuffling sometimes.  Trying to learn how to walk.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, which is funny because, yknow, you're describing side effects of things like Haldol or like Zyprexa or Risperdal, that class of medications, but Buspar's in a very different family, so I don't think it's the medication, but if you're anxious or getting more depressed that might be what you're noticing too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hum.  I think I'm getting depressed.  I seem like I just want to do everything.  It seems like I just wanna do but [NAME OTHER] says you wanna do this and yeah, I say I wanna do this.  I'm eating, I try to eat.  I don't have any problem.  I guess in a way I seem to look too far ahead.  Now when I came here before I came here I filled up my dryer and I, I think too far ahead.  And that seems to be the problem and I have - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm thinking of something, I'm ahead of myself.  I seem to be ahead of myself.  Right now I'm shaking.  When I get in the car I'm gonna be shaking.  I just can't get rid of that shaking.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you weren't when you drove down here?  Or you were?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A little bit yeah.  I was a little bit yeah.  I was a little bit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, let me go see if I have some samples of the Wellbutrin okay?  Cause I think we do.  And what I'll do is I'll bring, um, bring your wife in too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Let me, you stay here - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me go go grab the keys and I will go check on the samples and I will be right back and we'll bring your wife in too, okay?  I'll be right back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<p>CG: You're all right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's like I said it's just the anxiety type thing.</p>

<p>CG: Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I try - </p>

<p>CG: All right.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not - </p>

<p>CG: I wish it was me instead of you [PATIENT NAME].  I really do because he's so good to me.  All the time.  Forty five years.  I always pray to God, you take me first God.  You leave him here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You guys are good together.  The difference between the last visit and today is, even though you were saying anxiety, he just seems more depressed today.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah, he seems like really down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The last time it seemed more like anxiety.</p>

<p>CG: And I blamed it on myself because I thought maybe I shouldn't have written that damn letter and told him to call that man up and tell him his insurance was not, yknow, and then I blamed it all on myself this morning and I think [NAME OTHER] could detect that.  I said I think I need ten years in the [DEIDENTIFIED] and she said mom you're too God damn smart.  She never curses - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: But she says, I don't wanna hear that so she hung up on me.  But that's all right she'll, we'll talk.  And she's such a terrific kid.  But he does seem, and I said hon I'm sorry, but you always tell me when the home office calls to let you know everything that's going on so I didn't think that was a bad thing but then he got, he started to cry and said I can't compose the letter and I said well I'll call the man tonight just tell him you're insurance is, yknow, they're not gonna get rid of his insurance it's no big deal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you think?</p>

<p>CG: What do you think sweetheart?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> About that this morning?</p>

<p>CG: You got yourself so upset you started to cry and said you couldn't compose the letter.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I couldn't compose the letter no, I forgot.  </p>

<p>CG: Mm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My memory seems - </p>

<p>CG: He keeps on saying that his memory's goin.  But I don't think it's that doctor because anybody that can drive the way he is, no.  I'm sorry. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you get depressed, I was using the word confidence - </p>

<p>CG: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> His confidence goes down.  That sounds more like what I'm hearing.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And since he did well with the Wellbutrin before and the Buspar he moved it to morning and bedtime - </p>

<p>CG: Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think it might be better that we just stop the Buspar and go ahead and start Wellbutrin at this point.  Initially I thought it was the accident and anxiety - </p>

<p>CG: Yeah, that's what I thought.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The anxiety from the accident.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The accident, the accident keeps coming back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you know, by taking the antidepressant I think it's going to help with your anxiety down the road, too.  And it worked well for you before.</p>

<p>CG: It did, hon, remember?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It did.</p>

<p>CG: It worked so terrific.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah, it was Wellbutrin and and - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is the same version, the Wellbutrin XL.</p>

<p>CG: How many of -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just one a day.</p>

<p>CG: One a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yup.  And there's a month's worth right in there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wasn't my legs the same way shakey.</p>

<p>CG: Well, honey, you heard what [NAME OTHER] said to you.  She said you've got two herniated discs and she said one's in your neck and she said one's in your back and she wants me to see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] with you on the Thursday, which we were gonna see and she, the only thing that can be done by that, I mean [NAME OTHER] is brilliant, but, doctor, what are they gonna do at his age?  Ya know?  I mean I don't know if there's a medicine he can take as far as the shaking in the feet go or what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you're depressed physical symptoms get more pronounced in your mind too.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah, I think so. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's my, it's more in my feet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you notice, I mean you might have been living with those symptoms for a long time and just not as aware of it.</p>

<p>CG: Oh, I think he was, doctor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you're more depressed, you're mind only focuses on that.</p>

<p>CG: That's very truth.  I'm gonna have another CT scan for my bowel, and the only think I can think of right now is that damn CT scan and drinking that barium yknow, it's the only thing I can think of.  And that's true, I think you do focus on something that's bothering you.  I've been having this constant pain on my bowel.  I think it's only normal that you think of it and I think that's what he's focusing on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<p>CG: I said to him the other day, what's the matter and he said I can't walk right, I'm shuffling along it's my feet.   And then this afternoon when we were sitting out there talking I said what's the matter hon, he says it's my stomach now. And I said, well before it was your feet.  So I think it's just everything that's just focused, he's just focusing on everything right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Focusing on too many things - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, we'll try this change then.  We'll stop the Buspar and we'll go, you take the Wellbutrin.  You can even take your first dose when you get home.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then just tomorrow morning start it in the morning.  Take a dose today when you get home.  Okay?</p>

<p>CG: I've got the, um, the Depakote.  I asked [NAME OTHER] that one time, how does the Depakote and the, um, the Wellbutrin they can be taken together?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They were before.</p>

<p>CG: Oh, okay, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  When you took the Wellbutrin you were on the Depakote all along.</p>

<p>CG: Okay.   And still three Depakote a day, or two.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, let me look back.  I think the last prescription was just for two, right?</p>

<p>CG: I think it was, doctor, but then you and [NAME OTHER], oh she's such a doll, but she just send me two big bags of Depakote.  She said they had a previous date on them, but she said it really didn't hurt because she said they really never go stale or anything.  I think we were on two a day.  I think that's what you were taking, sweetie.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It looks like it's, uh, three.</p>

<p>CG: Three a day, okay.  What does the Depakote usually do, just - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you, did you mail in a prescription per chance?</p>

<p>CG: He mailed in something to the VA is that what you're talking about?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That one - </p>

<p>CT: They just sent him some, they just sent him some, what did they send you, hon?  Did they send you the Depakote, or what did they send you?  You just got, oh, I know what you just got from the VA, the Fosamax, we gotta pay for that yet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How did you take your Depakote yesterday?  How much did you take?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I believe I only took one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The whole day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: Oh, I told you not to skip it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: Hon, I can't be on you every minute.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I skipped because I figured I was coming out here, that's why.</p>

<p>CG: You were what, hon?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I was coming out here today?</p>

<p>CG: No, we didn't know you were coming here yesterday, hon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<p>CG: We didn't know that at all.  And why are you only taking one?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I just took the one that's all.</p>

<p>CG: You have to take at two or three hon.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Definitely two.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, I forgot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've only been taking the one.  Try to get back on your schedule with one in the morning and one in the evening of the Depakote.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what I'm not doing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because that could be the other reason why you're feeling worse too.  </p>

<p>CG: Mm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were very, very consistent with your Depakote before the accident and then when you're feeling well sometimes I know you'll cut it back a bit, but when you're not feeling good you want to take it as prescribed.</p>

<p>CG: Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And don't let it drift away.</p>

<p>CG: Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because when that level gets too low then you start feeling worse, too.</p>

<p>CG: Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  One twice a day.  Maybe that's even the answer too, why these aren't working all as well, but, that's a month's worth - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I was on the Wellbutrin before I think I was all right, I don't remember - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. This is what helped you get better before - </p>

<p>CG: Are you gonna give me, you said that's a month's worth and you wanna see us again?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Um-hum.</p>

<p>CG: Okay.  Because I was gonna say, would you give me a prescription if I run out of that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I, yknow, hopefully - </p>

<p>CG: You wanna see us after a month or so?</p>

<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can erase it if you decide it's no good, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, good.  So anyway, so, um, and I don't think —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, wait.  You're saying that you, you tried the SAMe or you continue to take the SAMe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh no, I'm continuing, I'm taking the SAMe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You are taking the SAMe?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And sitting in the sun.  And, um, my aversion to coffee and, um, meat and stuff is finally gone.  I don't think that, you know when I was, like the ambulance came and got me a week after, six days after that surgery.  Actually I don't think it was withdrawals from the Oxycontin and all those other things because I've got bottles and bottles.  I hardly took any.  The first time I had the surgery was when I developed the aversion to coffee and food taste, and my skin went cold touch, my skin.  It hurt.  Um, and then the second surgery, five months later, whenever it was, I think it just exacerbated.  I think I've got an, is there such a thing?  I think I'm allergic to anesthesia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, there's definitely people who are, get all sorts of things, including death, from anesthesia.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mentioned it to the doctor, to the, to the surgeon, and, but he just sort of shrugged it off.  The only thing he's interested in is if this leg looks good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they did this x—ray, the six week x—ray and he said, he was jumping up and down saying it's wonderful.  It's beautiful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, how does it feel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It feels a thousand times better than the first one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But then the first one collapsed in my leg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But still I've got pains in my hips and anyway.  It's much, much better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So how's, tell me that the SAMe is, is treating your attention deficient?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's not.  Nothing is treating my attention deficient, doctor.  You know that, nothing.  I'm still like, I'm still a procrastinator.  I'm still like, I'll give you one prime example.  You're supposed to take your medication the same time every day.  So I'll see my medication on the table, and I'll say okay, I've got to take it now, but I don't know what happened.  I'll find myself doing something else and then I go, oh, my medication, and then it happens again.  So this will go on for like three or four hours.  Um, and then finally I go, oh my God.  It's four hours.  I'm four hours late for taking my medicine.  So then I'll take, you know, my high blood pressure medicine and stuff, which is supposed to be taken at the same time every day, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Well, if you remember to take it every day, it's good.  Same time of day would even be better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But with you it's good that you simply take it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You look very nice today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You do.  The shirt is really nice.  Did you get it at Walmart?  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My husband came home with some from Walmart and they were just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fabulous.  On sale.  Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so we went from one subject to another.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  As usual.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guess that's another ADD —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Symptom there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so your leg is better.  Your depression is better.  Your anxiety is better.  You know, they do say, I mean you see that box over there.  This is a, a sun box for those who don't have sun like we do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And for those, who for some reason, don't want to go outside in the sun, um, they, they expose themselves to sun and we know, I mean this is nothing new, that sun is an antidepressant.  So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it definitely is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Especially early morning sun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, uh, I wouldn't be surprised if that's what's doing it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, the early morning sun too, it doesn't burn your skin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can sit into it, in it for quite a while.  I found that it really does makes a big difference, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I mean people could have a, go out on their lanai and have some breakfast and read the paper and sit in the sun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or you could hide behind the bushes so none of the neighbors can see through your yard because I've got a lot of foliage, and take off, take off your top.  So cover your face, so your face doesn't get ugly and the part of your body that can't be seen get ugly from the sun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It doesn't matter where it goes into your skin, does it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  No.  Well, let me, let me back off.  Yeah, you do need to have, uh, if you were wearing sunglasses, it wouldn't work.  You do need to see the sun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I wasn't wearing sunglasses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you should have sun.  No, if the sun is not hitting your face, your eyes.  You need to get, I mean you don't have to look into the sun, but you should have the sun shining on your —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Face.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Because it's actually the brain that's getting the sun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I don't think the, you know, putting your head in a bag.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And frying your body would not work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, anyway, but I guess I do get in the sun because I get out into the, I'm starting to be able to get out in the yard in the sun and do some yard work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't look like you got, oh, because, that's still ultraviolet.  That should get you, even though it's not hot, you get the ultraviolet.  So you're, you would be, you're not as much tan as you, as I thought you'd be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no, because I've been going out early morning and it doesn't tan you early morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It should.  It should burn you.  It's just not as hot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well it doesn't burn me.  I don't stay out there long, doctor.  Ten minutes is all I can [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, there you go.  Okay, that's it.  Just 10 minutes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I can't stand it.  I don't want to get hot.  About 10 minutes, I think it should be okay.  I don't know, but anyway, I feel much, much, and especially it's just the last few days especially I'm just, I feel good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So now tell me, how, how is SAMe, which comes, I guess it's a pill, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How does SAMe pill —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know what you're going to ask.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Make you feel is okay and passes muster, but medication just turns you off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because as my naturopath doctor, he told, my naturopath told me the herbs and stuff that were in it, and it's only, it's just herbs and things.  It's not, it doesn't have chemicals and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you think are in the herbs?  They're all chemicals.  It's the chemicals that are in the herbs that cause any difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'll stop taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] is from a plant, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], which is a blood thinner is from a plant.  Digitalis, which is a heart medicine is from a plant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's fooled around with, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I mean we have made synthetic, you know, I mean, but they originally come from a plant.  There's, Saint John's Wort has about literally 100,000 different chemicals that come from the plant.  They have not figured out which one of them has the chemical that's an antidepressant, but it's, you know, it's going to be very similar to the antidepressants that we give, you know, to people.  It's just that it comes from a plant, and it's naturally occurring and it, you know, but the side effects that come with the Saint John's Wort are just as bad, if not worse, than —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The ones that come from the pills.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  Well, maybe I'll stop taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're not taking Saint John's Wort.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're taking SAMe, which is —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's probably got Saint John's Wort in it.  You said it doesn't show what's in it.  I forget what, what, um, what's his name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it says it's, you know, I'm just making this up, but it says it's alfalfa, clover, and you know, hemlock.  Yeah, I don't know what, but you know, I don't, but just saying those things doesn't tell us what it is that's in those that makes us better.  You know.  We know that some things like gingko, you know, which has been renowned for helping people's memory, but it also causes blood thinning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, you know, cause problems.  So people need to know that even though it's natural, it can cause side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been taking fish oil too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm just happy you're feeling better.  I don't care, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I don't think it's, maybe, I don't even think it's the, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> SAMe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The SAMe.  I think it might be just the sun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and also just getting over everything getting out of my system maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And your leg better.  That's a biggie.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I'm finally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I think the last time you were here, you were, you were hoping.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it still hurts, doctor.  It's not, I'm still in pain.  I don't think I'll ever be out of pain, but it's just the pain is minimal compared to the excruciating pain from before, and now the other leg is going really bad.  The cortisone shot is wearing off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But the doctor said he can't give me another shot, um, until at least three months, and then, and I've got to have another six week checkup from this before they can even talk about doing that, so.  Plus I think I'm finally, I think I was still in depression over my mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, you know, I mean how long has it been now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Three years almost.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Yep.  Time flies, doesn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It does.  I still can't think about her without crying.  Oh boy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you and her were two peas in a pod.  You were very close.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well she was just the best mother in the world, that's all, to all of us.  So, anyway, then I start thinking about mom again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what's going on with your husband?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I worry about him.  He's, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Didn't he have a prostate problem or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no, he had —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What did he have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He had, uh, quadruple is four bypass.  He had five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I thought you said he had some sort of cancer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, he did.  He had, um, bladder cancer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bladder, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But every time he goes, they put that thing up his urethra, the poor thing, poor guy.  Um, even though they did on the outside, when it goes through into the bladder, it's just like there.  He's so brave though, but it, it hasn't come back.  They do it every four months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And that's another thing.  I tell myself don't worry, don't worry about it, but practically all the men in his family die at [AGE] and he's going to be [AGE] in November, but anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As long as his heart's being checked, monitored and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's not smoking, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a biggie.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DATE] was when they did a, they found, they told me he had cancer even at the emergency room they could tell I guess.  It's quite common.  I, I threw away my cigarettes and that was it.  Him too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Yeah, bladder cancer is caused by smoking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Isn't that weird?  It's the chemicals the doctor said, not the smoke.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he said hairdressers and painters, um, or people who work with varnish and stuff get it too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But anyway, what else did I want to ask you?  I forget.  I forget everything.  I just avoid, but I'm just on so many medications.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, nothing from me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but they all, when you read the directions and everything from all of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but those are possible interactions.  Those are not definite.  I mean if, there are things to watch out for, but you know, if they're greater than 1%, it's, it's usually enough to get them pulled off the, you know, by the FDA.  Most of, a lot of them are, uh, just one or two people got it, so they have to report it.  What do you, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take two blood pressure medicines.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take, um, a water pill.  I take, um, of course, my thyroid medicine.  That's not really medicine.  I just have to have that because my thyroid is gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you check that recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I usually ask the doctor if I can have blood tests.  Uh, oh, I take Celebrex.  Otherwise, I can't even walk.  So actually my leg is not that good.  Um, and I take, um, acid reflux medicine, and there's a lot of medicines.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So how is your business and what you doing with your, no business?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, because I was in so much pain, I just let everything go.  Even my salesgirls overseas, everything.  I just, I just couldn't deal with anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You didn't put them on hold?  You just let it go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Couldn't put them on hold.  Doctor, those sort of things, if people in sales, they say they want to work, but unless you're constantly offering them incentive and constantly staying on top of them, and constantly like babies, they just fall by the wayside and I just didn't have the strength to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So now I'm trying to build it up from scratch again, but I really don't have the heart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're keeping busy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, wasting time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, as long as you're happy.  I mean that's the main thing.  I mean that's what, you know, retirement is all about.  It's about doing the stuff that you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not retire.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Felt guilty about doing before, like reading a book —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We can't afford to retire.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or watching your —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can't afford to retire.  I have to work.  I've got to get back on the bandwagon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if you want to work, then do you want to try medicine that helps your ADHD?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you haven't done anything since the last time I saw you.  We'll give you another month or two, or see if you want to do it on your own.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Give me some of those tips you told me to do.  I forget.  You told me to do, choose one thing you're going to do the next day or something and just do it.  What was that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, yeah, prioritize, and, uh, eliminate any distractions because there's always going to be a phone call.  There's always going to be, you know, a television program.  There's always going to be, you know, a grandkid, you know, wanting your time and attention, and you know, the message has to go out that, you know, you're not to be disturbed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But you know what, doctor, as you said, before that first surgery, I,  I took all the awards.  I always won the free travel trips every year, which means I'm in the top 10% of the salespeople and the managers.  The reason, the main, the reason I didn't, my business is gone is not because of my ADHD.  The reason my business is gone is because I was in too much pain to even speak to anybody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we're talking about getting it back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, getting it back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we're also talking about, I mean we gave you the Wellbutrin.  For a long time, you were taking that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Was I?  I don't even remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not, not Wellbutrin.  We started with Wellbutrin.  Then we gave you Strattera.  You were taking the Strattera for a long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but it didn't do anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, it might have.  I mean the last, I mean you were taking it, had you on it a year ago, April '08.  Um, I guess you felt, so April to, you took it up to a year ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it didn't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Took it up to a year ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It didn't really do anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How do you know it didn't do anything?  You were winning all those awards.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I won all those awards for the last 30 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every, right from the beginning.  Every single year I earned the incentive travel trip.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you're saying that you didn't feel it was doing anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well the next, those are non stimulant medicines.  The stimulant medicines, uh, are much more effective, number one.  Number two, they also do a number on your weight.  So, they would help your weight go down.  So you get an added bonus.  You get the weight go down bonus, and you get the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I told you, they sort of make you feel like uppers, right?  And I hate that feeling.  I only took them once.  I was cramming in college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This one here, Vyvanse.  It's for adults.  It does not give you an upper feeling.  It's not addictive or habit forming.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And how long does it take to get off it?  What happens when you try to stop taking it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just stop it.  You could just stop it.  And they even give you $70 off your first prescription.  I'm not going to pressure you.  You can take this and read it if you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, if I take it and read it and then I, or can you call that over the phone to the pharmacy?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  We'd have to give it to you next time you come in.  It's non abusable.  It's non addictive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Seventy dollars off your first prescription.  So, it's not covered by insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is.  It might be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Gee.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have good insurance.  It should be —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It won't be good starting in November, [DATE], my birthday because I turn [AGE] and it goes to that [DEIDENTIFIED] whatever it is —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That my husband has.  It's disgusting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Going to have to buy supplemental insurance or something.  Um, can you, can you give me a prescription so I don't have to wait for next month in case I decide I want to take it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] fidgety, impulsivity, [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, yeah, that's me.  Easily distracted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to give you the lowest dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Poor time management.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The lowest dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, the lowest dose, will that help?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, yeah.  I mean you'll know that we're on the right track.  If you need, it you think you need more, we could always increase it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It gives you more energy.  It gives you more motivation.  It gives you more ability to attend to things, start them, finish them, carry them through.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Look, it says here, if you, if you have or had have high blood pressure, I've got high blood pressure.  It's not controlled with medication because it's 140/90 with the medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's controlled.  They're talking about 210/120.  If you have 210/120, you shouldn't take this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But here they're saying has or has had.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So that we check to make sure it's okay.  You could do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, and [INAUDIBLE] of high symptoms of depression, sadness, worthlessness or hopelessness.  I did have.  I've just, just gotten over that just now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're reading everything that is going, you know, I'm a psychiatrist and we know a little bit about this stuff.  The, the warnings that the company or the pharmacy is giving you is just for those small very few amount of people who can't take it and if your blood pressure is okay, and you know, we will watch for depression.  If you, if you suddenly have a worse depression, we'll stop it, but I, I've had nobody have to stop any of this medicine because of worsening depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It should.  It really would be nice.</p>

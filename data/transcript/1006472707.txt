<p><b>Interview with Katherine Helm</b></p>

<p><b>Carlson: Hi Katherine, can you please describe your approach to therapy for our readers?</b></p>

<p><b>Helm:</b> <i>Like most clinician's my approach to therapy is individualized to the client in which I am seeing. I believe that one set of theories can be used to conceptualize the client and another can be used for treatment. All of this depends on who the client is and what approaches I think would appeal to the client. I also use my knowledge of multicultural issues to inform my work with the client. I take my own cultural background and my client's into account as I am forming the relationship with them.</i></p>

<p><i>In my work with this client I utilized insight, cognitive, and process-based approaches. Self-disclosure was used throughout the work as well.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: Will you provide a brief description of your training and background?</b></p>

<p><b>Helm:</b><i> I am a PhD-level counseling psychologist. I have been actively involved with mental health for about 20 years and have worked in inpatient hospital, community mental health, and college counseling center settings. I am also a full-time professor and teach in a masters level graduate program training mental health professionals. Finally, I also am the Supervisor of Clinical Training and supervise masters, doctoral, and post-doctoral students on their practica and internship. In the past I have served as a mental health consultant for various community mental health agencies.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: Please describe the client and the surrounding issues/challenges for our readers?</b></p>

<p><b>Helm:</b> <i>This client struggles with confidence issues. She grew up in an environment where poverty and substance abuse were the norm. She was the eldest daughter of 3 or 4 girls and ended up having to take care of her sisters as well as several other family members (e.g. grandparents and parents) as they got older and when her parents succumbed to drug addiction. As a result, she never got the chance to pursue her academic goals. Although she is very bright, she feels like she is behind her peers in terms of accomplishing her academic pursuits. Additionally, given the challenges of her early family life, her academic goals were not supported by her family.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: What was your goal or hope for the sessions?</b></p>

<p><b>Helm:</b> <i>My hope for the sessions was to build the client's confidence, help her see the themes in her life (past and present), and support her academic pursuits.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: When do you know if therapy is successful? Are there a typical number of sessions? How did you feel about the sessions?</b></p>

<p><b>Helm</b><i>: This is a good question. The success of therapy is frequently determined by the strength of the relationship between counselor and client as well as by the client's subjective report about their ability to incorporate what they've learned in therapy into their daily lives. This client came back with many positive reports and we continued to work on several thematic issues as they came up in multiple areas in her life. I can generally tell if I will have a good relationship with a client in the 1<sup>st</sup> session. I feel that the sessions went well. This client had a tendency to "idealize" me and my background because we were of similar ages and racial backgrounds. I frequently dismantled this notion by engaging in self-disclosure and telling her about my own academic struggles.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson:</b> Can you point to the successes/breakthroughs, as well as any bumps in the road? </p>

<p><b>Helm:</b> <i>I think we stalled a bit mid-way through the sessions. Not only were there a few breaks in the semester (e.g. spring break, etc.) but the client missed a few sessions here and there due to other things going on in her life (family health issue). This sometimes made it difficult to begin where we left off. Most of our work came together at the end when it became clear that the client had unreasonable expectations about what it means to be smart. She believed that she should be able to memorize everything she's ever learned. In our work she not only began to have more realistic expectations of herself but I also challenged her to enjoy the process of learning. Additionally, since so many other professionals were highly supportive of her (e.g. professors, classmates, etc.) I challenged her to see in herself what everyone else sees - i.e. her talent, drive, motivation, and intelligence.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: Can you provide a context for the therapy? Where did the session take place and how the client was assigned to your care?</b></p>

<p><b>Helm:</b> <i>The therapy took place in my on campus office at a university counseling center. The client called me and initiated starting therapy on the request of one of her professors.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: What do you want to make sure that the readers notice about the interview? Can you highlight the important parts and what you want them to notice?</b></p>

<p><b>Helm:</b> <i>Sometimes new counselors assume that being a good therapist means that you "make sure you sound professional at all times" and neglect to use parts of yourself in the session. I teach my students and supervisees the opposite of this as I believe that who you are as a person is who you are as a therapist. Being a good therapist always means incorporating parts of yourself in the work and using yourself as a clinical instrument because the therapeutic relationship is a real one. In my work with this client, much of the sessions were centered on confidence building or dealing with past trauma. I believe that I did a good job of pulling the themes out this client found most problematic in her life and bringing them together.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: Is there anything else you would like the readers to know about you or these sessions?</b></p>

<p><b>Helm:</b> <i>I really enjoyed my work with this client. This client does not have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Also, these 10 sessions took place over 6 months to complete.</i></p>

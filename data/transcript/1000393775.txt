<p>PATIENT:   (5-minute silence)  I'm feeling (clears throat) quite hesitant to talk about what I've been thinking and (hesitates) I'm not sure why unless it's because I'm sort of sensing is that what underlies it is what I don't want to think about at all.  But, uhm, when I came in, first I was just thinking about, I don't know, sort of a continuation of the feeling I had yesterday, in, in terms of not wanting to do much and just stay in bed and that kind of thing, but I feel better today, so I can't use the excuse that I'm not feeling well so it would be good for me to (clears throat) really in effect stay in bed.  And I don't know if just applies to coming here and (clears throat), or—.  I mean it seems more general because I'd wanted to go to a sale at WKM's, which I did in the end do, but I had to really make myself do it.  My desire was to just stay home.</p>

<p>And, and after I s_, was thinking about that a little, I mean just briefly after I came in, I started thinking about the fact that sometime I, I probably should bring up how long I won't come after the baby's born.  And I know I mentioned it one other time, more in terms of MSCZ had asked me if I'd done anything about that yet, but this is the first time that I've really, I don't know, thought of it on my own, as something I wanted to talk about.</p>

<p>And then, then I just began to think about a feeling I have about the apartment we get, if we do get any of the one's we've seen.  And MSCZ's made it—.  Well, one we've found would still be too expensive, so we couldn't bid on it.  Another one (sniff) we, we've bid on, but at a much lower price than what the owner had said he wanted.  And so I don't know whether we'll get it at that price or not but—.  My feeling is that I don't—, at this point it's almost as if I don't care which of several we get.  Whereas before it used to seem like I cared desperately about each one (clears throat) as they came along, and as I liked them.  And, and now it's almost as if I don't care.  Just, I just want to know.  And I suddenly want to move and before I had been feeling in no hurry to move at.  And I don't know why I suddenly want to move so badly.  (pause)</p>

<p>When I was thinking about that feeling of wanting to move, the, the thought that came to my mind why I might feel this way is, uhm, I guess a feeling of wanting to have everything settled, before the baby's born.  Or, or just in, in—.  I mean not even so much for the apartment, but for things like where I'd shop and where I'd take clothes to be cleaned and (clears throat) where I'd bank and all these things that when you start in a new place you have to find where you want to go.  That isn't that difficult but I think I somehow have a feeling that it will be much more difficult with a baby than if I could do it now without the baby and—.  It's almost as if I anticipate feeling, because of the baby and, uhm, having something new and overwhelming to do in a way, that I'll have the, the same lethargic feeling, that really in effect I was feeling today.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking of (clears throat) somebody that called today, and I don't—, it hadn't occurred to me that this could have anything to do with it, then I don't know (coughs) somebody who lives—, a couple who live in PLHZ near us, but their really friends of FYC and MEIR, and that's how we've met them.  And we've seen very little of them actually since we've met them, but I don't know, there's been some kind of an association because of this tie with FYC and MEIR.  And, uhm, the girl called today to see if we could come over tonight because they're having—, oh, I can't remember, somebody who's running for Assemblyman (sniff), in the district, in for—, well, they're having people in to meet him and so forth and—. Uhm, again my attitude is sort of that I don't want to go.  And I don't know quite why f—, uhm.  And I feel guilty, too, if we go because we refused a dinner invitation.  And I keep thinking what if the people that asked us for dinner were there by some chance.  I mean it's unlikely, but (clears throat)  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know.  I think it—, well, it seemed to me when, for one thing I didn't know for sure if we could go, because, uhm, I never know until I check with MSCZ if he's going to be working late or not.  But basically I think my feeling was I—, that it, it was going to be a new situation, and I just didn't want to handle a new situation, right at this time.  And, and generally I think would sort of make myself do it anyway, but it seems like now I'm indulging in these desires not to face new situations or to go out if I feel like staying in.  That kind of thing and—.  So my feeling is if I don't feel like it then I'm not going to do it.  But I—, I mean it's not the same thing as just deciding I don't want to go.  Somehow it—, I don't—, I don't feel I've made that decision one way or the other.  It's more that—, I don't know has more to do with a fear or thinking of what might be expected of me or something that is completely my own problem.  It has nothing to do with the kind of evening or the kind of situation that we're being asked to.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Of these things you've mentioned, you don't make clear what you had in mind when you said you didn't want to talk about what you were thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Well, it was sort of a combination of—, I mean initially I didn't want to talk about a feeling of not wanting to come here. And, and, and I didn't want to talk about specifically after the baby's born when I won't come here and—.  But then it, it seemed more to it.  It seemed to be I didn't really want to think about this whole feeling of (sniff) I don't know withdrawing and staying not only just at home, but the—, what I really (chuckles) wanted was to stay in bed, not just stay at home. (sniff) (pause)</p>

<p>And then it just seems that this feeling of being tired and lethargic and wanting to stay in bed and all that is something I'm not unfamiliar with but I can't blame it on the fact that I'm teaching and tired, or—.  I mean there's nothing—, or even I can't use the cold anymore that I've had (sniff), because really I'm so much better that (clears throat) I could still be careful and, and have more energy and want to do more than I'm feeling right now and—.  (silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  What I recall it, uhm, I was just thinking the reason I didn't want to bring it up I guess is knowing that without any excuses to fall back on, or any rationalizations, I have to face there's something basically there that I'm afraid of, or that I'm fighting.  And it reminded me of—, it seems fairly recently when I talked about this being so very sure that feeling tired, and this kind of feeling comes from spending my energies in another area.  And, and yet today it didn't—, I wasn't thinking in that way.  I mean it comes almost like it's a new thought to me again right now and—.  And then I start wondering, what is it that is underneath it all.  And that seems to be, the part I don't want to face and that I'm sort of afraid to think about or—.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  What are you afraid's underneath?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (pause)  Well, I keep thinking it must have something to do with sexual feelings, just because of my reaction in the past.  And from what I recall, it seems as if—, and I_ I don't know why I can't remember better than I do, but it seems as if, uhm, this kind of feeling always ends up being tied up with sexual feelings and—.  I don't know, I was just thinking about the fact that I had energy over the weekend when I was home, and then I suddenly lose it when I come back.  And I was wondering if it's connected with having been at home, or if it's just simply having to do with feelings I have about you.  Because I have, both days since I've been back, had feelings about coming here and—.  I don't know, it always—, I was just thinking that (hesitates) well, it's an awfully big generalization, but it seems that the kind of feelings that I find hardest to handle or to think about or—.  I mean it doesn't even seem to matter how many times I talk about them, but the ones that seem to cause me the most trouble are sexual feelings and— (clears throat).  (pause)</p>

<p>Also another thing that I—, sort of comes to my mind and must be more significant than I was thinking it was is that last night I had that same feeling that I remember speaking about before of feeling sort of angry at MSCZ and sort of using an excuse why I'd feel angry, I don't know, maybe the way he was tossing in bed or something, but basically it was just simply I felt angry because at one point he was doing nothing, except lying there sound asleep and I f_, was aware of feeling angry.  So I know it ca—, anything else was just sort of an excuse for directing this feeling of anger and— (sniff).  And the night before that, when I was not—, when I was well, I don't know if I—, caused my feelings.  But in any case I didn't feel well the night before and was having trouble sleeping for various reasons.  And I found that, uhm, I couldn't sleep in bed with MSCZ.  I had to go in the living room and sleep in there.  And at the time I was just thinking, well, it's always been easier for me to s_, if I'm not feeling well, to sleep alone.  Because I don't know, I don't have to think about bothering him and he can't bother me by moving just when I'm about to get to sleep and things like that.  Yet I don't know in terms of last night, too, it seems like it might have had some other reason.  (silence)</p>

<p>And I don't know, the phrase came to mind to describe how I was feeling, but I first thought of it in one way.  Now, I'm thinking of it in another, of I didn't want anybody.  Because just in terms of being asked out places, my—, and my attitude was to say no to, er, all the invitations.  It was part of this, too.  I didn't want anyone to ask anything of me.  To expect anything from me and—.  I mean even just being somewhere being sociable seemed like that was going to be too much.  And yet—, and then, then it occurred to me, it specifically could be applied to MSCZ just in terms of—, I seem to have a mixed feeling of often, I don't know how often, but I mean it did occur to me, every now and then, uhm, that he could want to have sexual relations.  And I think it occurred to me partly because in a way I was thinking I would like it.  And then in another way I kept thinking but he couldn't ask it of me when I have a cold and (clears throat) on top of everything else and—.  And he wasn't doing anything in terms of that, and in one way or another.  In fact sometimes I'd be thinking of it and he wasn't even there.  And so it seems to be really a conflict of my own.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I recalled this question before fairly recently.  And, and it occurs to me again of it just seemed so strange when if I'm in the mood for having sexual relations that then they don't—, if—, I mean if I can sustain that mood then it's a very happy experience, even if I don't have an orgasm.  (clears throat)  Why when I think about it ahead so often, or am feeling close to MSCZ in a way that could lead to that, that I lose the ability to keep feeling close to MSCZ or, or feeling the feelings I am feeling and—.  Or I guess I don't—, I just don't know what it is that—.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  So see where your thoughts have gone in response to, to my asking you what your afraid is underneath, what accounts for your feeling the last 2 days in effect that you didn't want to come here.  You end up saying you're angry at MSCZ and you have trouble feeling close to him, and you suspect it has something to do with me, because over the weekend it was different.  As soon as you could come here it changed.  (pause)  And, uh, what, what's sort of left untouched is the question you wanted to discuss, that you seem reluctant to, which has to do you say with, uhm, being away from me after you have the baby.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (silence)  I don't know whether this is a way of I'm trying to get off the point, but what keeps coming into my mind is, I think a result of just part of what you said when you said, uhm, that things change when I—, er, they were different over the weekend then they changed when I could come here. Ei—, I mean just in terms of my feeling about MSCZ and—.  All I can—, all that comes to my mind then is that not so much the fact that I had energy over the weekend and I remember yesterday saying the weekend went pretty well except for that one instant to do with FYC and MEIR.  But now what I'm thinking of is the feeling of—, that I had all weekend of sort of keep myself at a pitch.  And I didn't sleep well.  And I certainly couldn't sleep long.  I mean I woke up quite early in the morning and (clears throat) I don't know, I—.  The feeling that I have now is remembering sort of a certain tension that I was under the whole time.  And of course MSCZ wasn't there for one night, and then the other night when he was there, it was very much on my mind of sort of don't ask anything of me, because I've got to get up early tomorrow, so I can be ready when people come and—.  It was kind of putting him off, and he even did want to do something and it was really sort of putting him off until we got back home.  (pause)</p>

<p>And then the other thing that comes to my mind is thinking of your mentioning that I haven't touched further on, not wanting to talk about when I won't come after the baby's born.  And what comes to my mind is part—, partly what I said about being settled in a new apartment, before the baby's born, because I have a fear of having this kind of lethargy afterwards and—.  I mean then I have to be able to have the energy to, to at least care for the baby and I'm—, and I guess I'm afraid I won't have any left over and—.  Now what comes to my mind is thinking about that and thinking about, I don't know, it's sort of a two-fold feeling.  On the one hand, it's sort of a relief to think I won't have to come if I am feeling that way, because it'll be one less thing I'm having to make myself do but—.  Also what comes to my mind is that it's almost like being caught mired in something, and that if I'm not coming here I'll stay caught in it.  And it won't—, I sort of won't get out until I can s_, come here again and—.  (pause)</p>

<p>Well, then I was just asking myself what the tie is between you and my reaction to you which all this must be connected with and what I've been saying about feeling toward MSCZ and—.  And then, then all I—, what I feel more than the thought is—, that, well, anyway I would not have these f_, problems in my feelings toward MSCZ or just I wouldn't be feeling this lethargy and so forth, if I felt better about myself.  And s_, I hadn't been thinking about not feeling—, I mean I hadn't thought about it one way or the other not feeling good about myself.  But then it just seems like (hesitates) maybe that's part of what, what I'm trying to avoid thinking about or feeling.  And then that just reminds me of, I guess it was a week ago Friday when I was feeling that I wanted you penis inside me.  And then I went home feeling very badly about myself.  (pause)</p>

<p>And, and when I think about that now I remember that very quickly the next week, even though it did come to my mind, I got off into feelings about my family, but it seems to me right now that was an excuse, a way to not keep thinking about feeling badly about myself, because of these feeling toward you and—.  That however real those other feelings were, they were secondary.   (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know.  It was just seeming to me that thinking about this feeling toward you then, then the immediate reaction of, well, it's, it's probably something else and I take it out on myself by feeling badly about myself but—.  I mean I guess it's kind of how can I be thinking or feeling such a thing.  It seems parallel in a way to, just what happens to me with MSCZ although it gets all mixed up in the fact that he's my husband and so I can't—, it isn't such a clear cut kind of a situation.  But if I'm feeling close to him or if, if, I mean just in thoughts if he's not there, or if he is there it's when I get to thinking about intercourse that I change and—.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know if this does any good or not because what my thoughts immediately go to thinking about how this could have all come about and, uhm, well, in terms of when I was younger and, and having wishes like this and, then well, knowing that not only couldn't they be fulfilled, but they shouldn't be, that it would be wrong and (sniff)—.  So it was—, sort of seems like as a safeguard I worked up a feeling about intercourse being bad, being horrible, and being unpleasant and—.  I mean I remember there was one period that I had very strong feelings that having intercourse would be like having a man urinate in me and—.  So it made it very easy for me to be repulsed by the whole idea (sniff).  But it seems like all those feelings are just trying to save myself, that they aren't really, I mean they're sort of made up feelings or feelings that I've created.  (silence)</p>

<p> I was just recalling that time when, uh, I don—, it seems like it extended over a period, really, but there was a time, because we were traveling that somehow MLWZ and I were sharing a bed or we were in the same room and then he ended up in bed with me and I think I very much had this kind of feeling of wanting—, I don't—, I didn't think of it at the time, but it seems like I must have been wanting sexual relations with him even though he was too little.  And I think I've been supposing I felt this way toward my father, although I'm not recalling it and—.  (silence)</p>

<p>I think I'm trying to impersonalize this feeling, because I find I, if I try to think back to the fact that this all started with my feeling this way about you a week ago Friday, I can't—, I can't do anything with it.  And it's almost as if I know I said it, but otherwise I don't recall the feeling either and (clears throat), and then I always get off as far away from you as I can, like with my father, where I'm not even remembering that and—.  I also find my thoughts keep going to just something theoretical like wondering if this is something that any girl might feel.  And it would probably be with her father first since that's the man most important in her life.  Then just how can a father help to, I don't know, I guess to alleviate the situation so it doesn't develop into a feeling like I have gotten about having intercourse and—.  But yet I realize I'm—, I know it's kind of an intellectual exercise, as opposed to coping with the feelings and, and admitting them and, and letting them exist.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

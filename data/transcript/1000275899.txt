<p>BRIEF THERAPY - DIFFUSING REFLEXIVE ANGER - A NEURO-LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CARLSON: All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus and goal and then strives to reach that goal time limited, efficient and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategists in the area of brief therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people, with real life problems. I'm John Carlson (ph). I'd like to welcome you to another session of Brief Therapy, inside out.</p>

<p>CHOSE: And I'm Diane Chose (ph), and this is our guest, Steve Andreas (ph), whose going to talk to us about brief therapy, using neuro-linguistic programming or NLP. Steve, just how would you define brief therapy?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Brief therapy is any therapy that's quick and effective and thorough and lasting, and quickness depends...on a lot of things. I have a video tape where I cure a phobia in less than seven minutes, from saying, 'hello, how are you', to done.</p>

<p>CARLSON: That's great.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And it's usually not that fast and obviously, some things are going to take a lot longer than that. And I think it kind of depends on the context, on the kind of problem the person has and so on, what you consider brief.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Okay.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, help us understand your approach to brief therapy, just how does it work?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, fundamentally it works by changing people's experience. And one of the things that an LP is sort of based on is the notion that all our experiences are based on visual, kinesthetic and auditory experiences. That if I say to you, "Can you thin of a dog?" You make a picture of a dog. You might smell the dog, you might hear the dog bark and have the feel of the dog licking you or something like that. And then basically all of our experiences, the ones that make us successful and the ones that drive us crazy, are based on these little elements. Now beyond that, there are even smaller elements within this. It's sort of like the DNA code of our experiences, like there are these three basic possibilities. Most of us don't spend a whole lot of time smelling and tasting, I mean it's important for eating and so on but when we're making decisions or relating to another human being, normally it's the visual, auditory, kinesthetic. Now within each of these there are sub pieces or smaller pieces. So an image can be far away or it can be close, it can be bright or dim, it can be large or small and so on, and these are even smaller pieces and by chunking it down this way you can change people's experience in very quick and easy ways. [0:03:26.0]</p>

<p>CARLSON: And so you don't have to send them to Hawaii or somewhere to change an experience, you can actually do it within their senses?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: We can send them in their mind. (all chuckling)</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, how do you do that in therapy? What's the process that you use to get people to actually bring about this kind of change?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Basically you just teach them how to do it. It's a matter of teaching. It's not so much something you do to someone as you do something with someone, and if you know something about the structure of the problem then you can suggest a solution. So, for instance, some people are depressed because they have all their happy memories as small, dim, far away pictures, so they can't enjoy them.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And they have all their terrible experiences as great... </p>

<p>CHOSE: That's right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...huge billboard things right in their face, so they feel terrible all the time. Now it's kind of a simplistic example but it's one that, at least for teaching purposes, is often quite useful. If you teach them to reverse that so the horrible experiences that happened to them recede into the distance and they're little, small postage stamps, that way they still have the information about what harmed them and what to avoid in the future, so it's not like amnesia, but it doesn't bother them. And if they have their rich experiences, their really good ones, up close so they can step into them and have a full kinesthetics, then they can have a happy life. So sometimes it sounds too simplistic, but sometimes it's as easy as that.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Sometimes it's not.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Is a cognitive theory in which you're changing one's thinking?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, primarily.</p>

<p>CARLSON: In which the way they would think about a problem or think about a situation in which, the example you have... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. I'd say that in terms of other modalities, it's closest to the cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>

<p>CHOSE: This reminds me of when I was a child and my mother would put me to bed and she'd say, "Now, just think about the happy things that happened today." (chuckling) And well... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: It's a good idea. I don't know if the way she said it made you do that... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...but that's a good program.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Kind of bringing forward the positive parts.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, why not?</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I mean, it's horrible...some horrible things happen to people sometimes, and I think it's too bad that it had to happen to them once, why should it have to happen to them over and over again?</p>

<p>CARLSON: Does your theory have some explanation for how that happens?</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah?</p>

<p>CARLSON: You know, in terms of how people reverse these images?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, in terms of how they reverse them, it's just a matter of teaching them to do it. And most people... </p>

<p>CARLSON: So they won't spot, see these ugly things rather than the good things?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, see, most of us aren't programmed. I mean the programming comes from the computer model. And when a baby is born in the world, it doesn't come with a manual. What do you call it, the manual that teaches you the access codes... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...and the instructions and so on.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So most of us are programmed randomly or we're programmed by events that simply happen in a kind of a random order. You know, parents do the best can but typically they do exactly the wrong thing. One woman I know had a phobia because the parents would hold her next to a wall and say, "Look, you can see how you could fall." And they installed that phobia. Now they were trying to protect her, they were trying to do a good thing, but the words they said literally programmed her to have a phobia of when she looked over an edge she could see how she could fall and then she felt that. [0:06:38.6]</p>

<p>CARLSON: So then it's essentially, these problems occurred through programming, and all you're doing then is reprogramming?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You can think of, reprogramming has some other meanings. That word has meanings... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...in terms of cults and... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...religions but... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...yeah, basically it's teaching people to do a different sequence.</p>

<p>CHOSE: What are roots or the basis and what influenced you to go in this direction?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I used to be in gestalt therapy, I did that for about eight or ten years with Fritz Pearls (ph), and that was all diving into the feelings and emoting and the two-chair thing... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...and all the rest of it, and I still think that of things that were available at that time it was perhaps one of the better ones, but NLP just works so much faster, with much less fuss and bother. And in terms of the roots of it, the roots are primarily Milton Erickson (ph) and Virginia Satir, who are probably two of the finest therapists that ever lived, and I say that without reservation, they were both marvelous. And I had the pleasure of being with both of them a little bit from time to time and studying their work, and a lot of NLP is derived from their work, a lot of principles. Now in terms of what NLP is, it's really hard to say, again, because it takes kind of a mind set of thinking about things in a different way. If I asked you to define physics, where would you start? There are so many physical principles. There are mass and momentum and energy and the interplay of all those things and all the rest of it. And it's really hard to get across that NLP isn't just kind of a new gimmick or a new thing or a new, slightly different approach. For instance, years ago a very sweet guy named Sid Gerard (ph) wrote a book on transparent personage (ph).</p>

<p>CARLSON: Sure.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And the basic idea was ridiculously simple, it's be honest, be direct, be transparent, so that there's nothing hidden.</p>

<p>CARLSON: What you see is what you get.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, what you see is what you get. Now it's a wonderful idea and I heard he was a real sweet guy. I've never met him but I've heard nothing but good things about him, which is really unusual. NLP is much, much more than that. It's a set of principles and understandings that continues to evolve and develop that we claim, maybe optimistically, can be used to understand any human behavior, including sports, business communication... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Cool.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...relationships - interpersonal, intra-personal, etc. And I could give you a couple of examples. There's, we cure phobias by doing a particular thing. There's a gal back east who does phobias by teaching people to go through them very quickly. So she says, "And then? And then? And then?" And she teaches people to go through the phobia very quickly.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: She doesn't cure the phobia but they go through it so fast that it doesn't hurt very bad.</p>

<p>CARLSON: That's nice. [0:09:28.8]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: There's another guy, I think his name is Brian Wease or Weiss (ph), who does past-lives regressions and he claims to cure phobias. Well, he does it by, at the end of this past-lives regression, people have a sense of this immense series of lives, and here's this little life here and within that is this little phobia... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Thinking it is.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...and it's so small that it doesn't bother them anymore. They still have it, you can watch them and they still kind of twitch a little bit, but it's so small in this large perspective, and we call that a perspective pattern. And so we claim that we can look at any kind of process and analyze it in terms of the kinds of patterns that are involved, the presuppositions that people are using that underlie the work, the kinds of elements that they do. So, it's like physics can be used to build bridges, can be used to build bombs or... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Sure.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...or do...bone replacements and so on, and the principles can be used in lots of different ways.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, how did Steve Andreas, a.k.a. John Stevens, get to be a neuro-linguistic program person? What was your training?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I just worked my buns off. (chuckling)</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah, well, that too, but... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I learned as much as I could and at a certain point in my life, then I started generating new patterns.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And so in education, did you go get a Doctorate in NLP?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh, no, it's not in the universities, not in the universities yet, a few places, yeah. It sometimes sort of sub-rosa... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Sub-rosa?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...sort of... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Alternative methods or alternative approaches?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, and sometimes you don't... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Call it that.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...they don't say what it is... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...but it's the same process, yeah. No, I just went to the two guys who developed it, Richard Bandler and John Grinder, they were the first developers, then there were a bunch of...generations after. And I'm still learning. There's lots to be learned. I mean, we probably know that much about it so far but it's a lot, it can really do a lot.</p>

<p>CHOSE: How does this compare with other brief therapy approaches? Is it, what's it like?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, as I've already mentioned, it's pretty, it's close in a lot of ways to cognitive behavioral. They do a lot of rehearsal. They do...'imagine this and visualize this', but knowing more about the mechanics of it we could do things a lot faster and a lot more effectively, I think, I claim...I mean, who knows. The other particular development is solution focus people. There's a lot of parallels there.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Sure.</p>

<p>CHOSE: I'm sure.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Searching for solutions rather than problems, working out with positive outcomes rather than problems.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay. And talk a little bit about the structure that takes place. When you actually do NLP or NLP therapy, are there stages or are there phases that one goes through?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, yes and no, because all these things are happening at once. I mean as I'm talking to you, I'm gesturing, I'm changing my tone of voice, where I'm making pictures and so on, so really it all happens at once. When we teach people how to do this, we chunk it down into a lot of different processes. One is simply understanding the presuppositions that people use. [0:12:31.9]</p>

<p>CARLSON: So that would be like the first step, trying to understand?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I'd say in working with a client the first step really is finding out what their positive outcome is, and most clients come in with a negative outcome. "I don't want this. I don't want to get angry."</p>

<p>CARLSON: So, okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "I don't want to yell at my wife. I don't." It's all negative.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay, so they've got to get a roadmap, so they know where they're headed to?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: They need a picture to start going for... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...or some kind of an image... </p>

<p>CHOSE: A goal.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...a goal... </p>

<p>CHOSE: A positive goal.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...a positive goal, rather than being immersed in the problem. Then you, "Okay, that's a problem. I understand that hurts. You don't like that. Now, what is it you do want?" And this is again, straight out of Virginia Satir, she would always do that. People would come with problems, she'd say, "Okay, that's what you don't want. What do you want?"</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And notice the hand gestures. You see that's just something totally automatic to me now. "That's what you don't want. What do you want?"</p>

<p>CHOSE: Ah! It's a comfort for them.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And it's saying...you say what you don't want and they put their picture there and you go like this. And you say, "What do you want?" And you make an opportunity for a new picture. Now that's what I mean when I say it's all simultaneous. That in terms of a step-wise process, yes, I can talk about that but it's really everything is happening at once.</p>

<p>CARLSON: So you establish quite early on what that positive goal is, that direction you want to go, then what?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Then we start going toward it, we start trying it out. And that's a key thing, again, out of Virginia Satir. She would repeatedly go, "Well, try it out. You want to say this to your husband, 'blah, blah, blah'. Try it out. How does it work? Find out how that person responds." And I call this road testing it, where you just try it out and find out what doesn't work or what objections there are. Deal with the objections. Find a way that the objections can support the general outcome or adjust the outcome so that their outcome is met.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay, so sort of a behavioral process. You go through what they call success of approximation.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yes.</p>

<p>CARLSON: You keep trying to move... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...toward that... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...eventual goal.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>CARLSON: How does neuro-linguistic programming though do this differently than say behavior modem (ph), which I'd give you an M & M or something that you'd want as you performed well on that...that behavioral change or thought?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, there's some parallels there but M & Ms are kind of clumsy and people get satiate with them, and we use as the M & Ms people's feeling good about reaching their goal or making progress toward it. That's, the M & Ms are built in, you really don't need a extrinsic motivation.</p>

<p>CARLSON: So how do you do that? I mean, how do you...structure those road tests, as you call them?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, we just start out, "How would you like to feel in that situation? How would you like to behave in that situation? Can you see what that would look like?" And sometimes people can't generate that right away, so you say, "Well, do you have a friend who can do this?" "Oh, yeah. I have a friend, Bill, who can do it."</p>

<p>CARLSON: So use a visual thing? [0:15:18.9]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Can you see Bill doing this?" Okay, and then you can do step-wise chunking of visualizations. So you can say, "Now did you like what Bill did there in - let's say - going up to a girl and introducing himself?" Or something like that. "Oh, yeah. He does it great. He's so smooth." "Great. Now take that same movie and now, put yourself in there so you see your body, so you adjust the picture so that it's you doing that. Now how do you like that? Because there might be adjustments that you need to make to fit with your personality and your, who you are." So you keep running movies like that until they like it. And then you can have them get into the movie, so that rather than seeing it out there, they're actually inside it, doing the moves and whatever. And you test again..., "Well, how did that go? Did you have any hesitations or how did it work? How did the girl respond?" And so on and you just literally build experience like that until you find a chunk that works.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And you really stick with the visual? You have to get a visual picture? I mean I would think that you might say, "What does it sound like? Or, what does it feel like?"</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Absolutely. Well, we're interested in the feelings to know how well it works, that's the evaluation part.</p>

<p>CARLSON: That's the kinesthetic modality? I mean... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. And there are two elements, two chunks in the kinesthetic modality. So if you're teaching someone to play golf, for instance, what you're really interested in is the kinesthetics of how the muscles feel to just...as you take that swing.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And literally, all good athletes do this.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: They make a picture of someone, Sam Snead (ph) or whoever, doing golf and then they just step into it and they feel the muscles in their body and they fit right into it... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...and then they bingo (ph).</p>

<p>CARLSON: Actually research shows that those muscles twitch... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...at that subliminal level... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...which they don't even move.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And so you get that image then. So at first you get the positive outcome... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: With the auditory, too.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now... </p>

<p>CHOSE: [inaudible at 0:17:09.3]... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...with golf there wouldn't be a whole lot of auditory, but if... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...you're talking to someone then there would.</p>

<p>CARLSON: That sweet sound of... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: The sweet sound of the ball, I mean, whatever.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Right.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Might be one that you would play on. So really to make the learning complete, you would probably... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: You want to use all systems.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...not only get the picture, get the feeling... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...and also get this... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: I use image in a somewhat sloppy way, as not, sometimes just as a visual image but usually as a visual image with all the rest. And we tend to be a fairly visual culture and one of the things about the visual system is that you can represent a great deal of information simultaneously. And one picture...one picture is worth a thousand words? In the auditory system it's sequential.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So you can't represent a whole lot of information in the auditory system but in the visual system you can get a whole bunch all at once and then add in the auditory, add in the kinesthetics.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah, okay. So that's where you might start?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Typically. Different people have different preferences. Some people have difficulty visualizing and then we have a method called 'the as if frame'. You just say, "Well, pretend you can visualize." And usually that's all it takes.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay. [0:18:15.8]</p>

<p>CHOSE: Because that brings me to another kind of question and that is, are there different kinds of clients that this just doesn't work with? And what I was thinking as you were talking about the visualization, what if somebody doesn't see?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, the hardest of all is psychiatrists... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Oh! (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...and mostly that's because they have such a belief system and that change is slow and that this is the way to do it rather than this or something like that.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Some people have difficulty reporting on their internal experience in sensations and visualizations and so on. So, yeah, there are some people it doesn't work as well with but it's a fairly small percentage, 5 or 10 percent maybe that you have to do a little education about, "Well, what's going on in there?"</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And for most people that's the case. If I ask you to imagine a friend of yours, you can do that, right? Now if I say, "Now, is that a still picture or a movie?" You'd probably have to go inside and check, because it's not a usual thing that people would ask. And yet, when you go in say, "Is it hard to do?"</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah, you just... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: You just go inside, say, "Oh, yeah, it's a still." Or, "It's a movie." And so mostly it's just introducing people to this world, which is for the most part unconscious or preconscious or not fully conscious... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...and it's that level where we can make these really fast changes.</p>

<p>CARLSON: I've seen neuro-linguistic programming work and I've experienced it myself, and yet there's a part of me that wants to know, is there research that supports my observations?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I can satisfy that part instantly. There's no research. (all chuckling) No, actually there's a fair amount of research but most of it is badly done, most of it is done on trivial, inconsequential pieces of NLP and basically, the answer is no. There's no research that I would point to with any kind of sense of certainty or pride or anything or anything and say, "Yeah, this is backed up by research." No.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And is that something that would happen in the future?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I hope so...it takes a lot of money to do these studies and most of us who are involved in NLP are too busy...going out, furthering, extending the frontier... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...to want to hang around and do research. But it needs to be done. It's certainly, I mean I come from a hard science background. I've got a Bachelors in Chemistry from Cal. Tech. and I know a little bit about research design from grad school and psychology and so on. It needs to be done. It hasn't really been done yet.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Well, I think that in a few minutes we're going to be watching this video of you working with a woman who comes in, really with anger as the issue.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: And I'm curios as to what, how do you prepare and what do you think about, prior to working with a client?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, that's easy. I think about, try to think about as little as possible because, I mean, I didn't have any information on her, about her, before she sat down. I say, "Well, what would you like?" Or just a little bit about how I work. And I want to be as open as possible to her, so if anything, I do a little Zen meditation or something like that, just to kind of clear any clutter out of my mind and just really be open to that person and what they want to do and so on. [0:21:30.6]</p>

<p>CARLSON: As our viewers are watching this segment in your work with Melissa, are there things that you could think of you'd like them to pay particular attention to, in terms of how your working with her?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, it's a nice tape, I'm very pleased with it. I'd like you to watch, I guess I'd want people to watch her responses, because that's really where the answer is.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I can try a wonderful intervention and if it falls flat, it falls flat. And there are times in there where I suggest a new way of looking at things or a different way of thinking about things and she's pretty responsive for the most part, and for the most part she goes, "Oh!" Or she, you can see the change happening in her. So back to your initial question, how fast is brief therapy? Instantaneous.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: But it may be a little, tiny piece, it isn't the whole piece that they want. So I see changes, lots of little changes, lots of little pieces, but then eventually, it's like building a house, you put a brick on top of a brick and you put some cement on it and you build, and eventually you've got the whole house, but the little pieces are very fast.</p>

<p>CARLSON: So as a viewer I'm going to watch the client, I'm going to watch Melissa. Help me a little bit to know what to look for. I mean, what are you looking at? Because I think we often say, "Watch her."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Sure.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And I think everybody's going to watch a different part. They're going to... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Sure.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...maybe they'll pay attention to the content or maybe somebody will watch the process. What are you watching?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I'm watching as much as I can... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, that's... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...but particularly facial shifts, breathing shifts... </p>

<p>CARLSON: So facial shifts?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...expressiveness.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Express, breathing. What is breathing? How do you tell that?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You just watch people breath. When people are feeling, it's part of the whole para sympathetic relaxation that when people are moving toward an outcome and away from a problem, in a problem state they're going to be tense: their breathing typically is shallow; there'll be more tension, there'll be more tension in the face. As you go through a para sympathetic response, which is more the relaxation, 'all things are okay', you get a broadening: the shoulders come down; the chest relaxes; breathing is typically deeper, more belly breathing rather than high chest breathing. People breathe up here in stress and more rapidly and so on.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I mean, I could go on for hours.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And so you can see that by watching the clothes move?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. Sure.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And then we'll watch the face, the expressions, because the muscle tension... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Because see, that's what I'm watching to know whether something has worked or not.</p>

<p>CHOSE: The change in color in the face, I would say.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: The change in color and movement and activity and so on and... </p>

<p>CARLSON: So we're not going to pay so much attention to the actual content as we are to these changes?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, it's kind of nice to know a little bit about content to know what's inducing the changes or what's leading to the changes.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: But, it's more process than content and in particular, notice her when, well, at one point I'm asking her to visualize two people in two different spaces, and how she behaves in one and how she does in the other and so on. And when shifts are suggested by me or I say, "Try out this." Or, "Try saying this to your so and so." Notice any shifts that go on there because that's really where the answer is. I can be brilliant and do wonderful stuff and if that person doesn't respond, then it ain't brilliant and it ain't wonderful. (chuckling) [0:24:56.0]</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, let's watch now and see the process of neuro-linguistic programming take place.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Which is an awful mouthful and I apologize for the name but it's great stuff. (chuckling)</p>

<p>CARLSON: Thanks.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Thanks Steve.</p>

<p>[Video begins at 0:25:12.0]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay, Melissa, we just sat down here and got wired up. And you just told me you had tons of therapy and I said, "That's too bad." Because what I do is a little different in some ways. And what I'd like you to do is think about the question, what changes you'd like to make today? And as you're thinking about that I'll talk a little bit about how I work with people. Number one, I don't think that therapy is something that you do to somebody else, I think of it more as education. And so I think about it mostly as teaching people how to use their brains, because some people's brains drive them nuts and other people, it makes them creative and happy and so on. And another difference between what I do and a lot of therapy is that I don't really care how, why things got the way they are, I'm more interested in how people have their problems or whatever's going on with them, and if I know enough about how things work then we can make some little adjustments, with your permission, and do things. And that brings up another thing, it's perhaps the most important part of my little preamble here. That if anytime during the session, we have about 45 minutes, anything happens that you don't like or you have any concerns about, you just tell me and we stop. And I might encourage you to continue but under no circumstances am I interested in pushing you to do something you don't want to do.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: In fact, I'm only interested in making changes that every part of you feels good about. It's really important because otherwise the changes won't last. So what kind of changes would you like to make today?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I'm very angry.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Angry?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I have a lot of anger that, I tend to explode at people.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I mean over stupid things. I can never slow myself down... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...before I explode. I mean... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Great.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...this is a rage of anger.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now, how do you get angry?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (sigh) Just over what, stupid things like, I got angry yesterday because they wouldn't let me register for school.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And I was yelling at this woman across the counter and she's like, "Ma'am, I can't help you?"</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now, before you got to the yelling, what did you do inside your brain?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I was thinking of how angry I was and how this was so unfair and how can they do this to me?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. And when did it, how did it start? So, what happened? You came up with some papers or something?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I came up with some papers and they told me, "You cannot register because you have to take a prerequisite." And then I'm like, "But this prerequisite I've tested out of."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: "I'm in the class above that. And even though I haven't taken that class, I still should be able to take this class."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And they're like, "Well, you have to go see a counselor."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And I'm like, "I'm not going to waste my time."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. But you're willing to waste your time being angry?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right. (both chuckling) It's a habit. [0:28:12.7]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay, good. Well, see things that are habitual are wonderful because, if something rolls off in a particular sequence, then if we change that the whole thing will be habitual throughout your life in other ways, too. Now, you said something in there about, 'it's unfair'.</p>

<p>MELISSA: It's like I was mad because, it was like they were doing this purposely to me.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. So you were a targeted victim?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: But I know that's not true. But when I'm angry... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, but how do you think about it? I mean, when you, go back to that moment where you go, 'They're doing this intentionally. They're out to get me.' Or whatever it was going on in there. How do you do that? How do you represent? What kind of pictures do you make? What kind of voices do you have? Or... </p>

<p>MELISSA: I don't know. It was just something inside me going, "I can't believe this is happening."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You can't believe this is happening. And just before that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I was, I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Well, this is the key, is to find out. Close your eyes. Go back to this thing where you hand in the papers and they tell you about how you need to have this prerequisite and you don't have it and so on. When does it first start? See, it's really important to get things right at the beginning, because then you can send your brain in a whole different direction.</p>

<p>MELISSA: As soon as the words came out of his mouth.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So he said?</p>

<p>MELISSA: "You don't have this class. Let me go check with my boss..."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: "...to see if he can override it." And then when he... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: And then?</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...walked away... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...I'm thinking... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah?</p>

<p>MELISSA: ..."I can do this class. Don't tell me I can't do this class." And I was like, and then it just kind of snowballed and I was just like... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. And we want to catch the first little piece of the snowball.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So where does it start? Right after he tells you that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right after he said, "You can't do that."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. So what is the first thing that goes on in your mind?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yes, I can.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yes, I can?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Take the class?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yes. And then it was how...I can't believe this, that's... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: It's never happened to you before?</p>

<p>MELISSA: What, that I couldn't take a class or?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: That you couldn't believe that, I mean... </p>

<p>MELISSA: No, it happens to me all the time. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Exactly. So you could believe it, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: But you said you couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I just get frustrated and get... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah?</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...oh, I get tense.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right now I'm getting angry because I don't know what to even, how to explain it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. [silence from 0:30:56.1 to 0:31:03.8] Can you tell me a little more about what's going on there? If we can really get the, that really beginning of the snowball, that's where it will be most useful. I mean there are several things I can do, even knowing what I already know. Because there are certain presuppositions around anger, one of which you mentioned as, 'their doing this intentionally'. [0:31:21.0]</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right? Did you say something like that to yourself?</p>

<p>MELISSA: No. I just, I was like... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Was that a little later?</p>

<p>MELISSA: It was later.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: That was after I walked away and I was like, "I can't believe they're doing this to me."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: "How could they do this?"</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. So you definitely had the sense of them doing it to you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right, it was... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: It wasn't just the bureaucracy and this was the rule and you have to just find your way through the rules, right? You didn't see it that way?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'no']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So how did you see it?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (big sigh) That I worked really hard to get out of high school early. I was a straight 'A' student and I took pre calculus, that's the class I need to take, pre calculus... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...and I took it in high school.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: The class I want to take is physics. I took it in high school.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I can do these classes.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I've passed these classes.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And now that I want to take them at a college level, all I want to do is go look in my transcripts, look at the classes I've taken here before.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I'm a good student.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Bend the rules.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And it was like, "No, you have to go see a counselor." And I'm like... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: But you know bureaucracies are like that don't you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah, but I can't stand that! (both chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, see you have a choice though. Given that bureaucracies are like that, and you're probably going to find this, this is going to happen again and it's happened before. You mentioned that this happens a lot of times, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: It's like the inherent stupidity of the world suddenly puts itself in your face. Right? (both chuckling)</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So the question is, how would you like to respond to this?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I don't want to blow up at people.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. So... </p>

<p>MELISSA: I don't like to do it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now, if I got on a bus here and I said, "I don't want to go to Milwaukee and I don't want to go to New Orleans and I don't want to go to San Francisco." How would the bus driver know where to take me?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Unless you tell him?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. So where would you like to go? What would you like to do different, rather than blow up?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Tell people what the problem is. Tell them... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Would you like to feel calm about it?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And realize...there's a lot of stupidity in the world, there's a lot of rules. Right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I hate stupid people.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I don't find them as pleasant as others myself, (both chuckling) but they do exist.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And the question is, would you rather get up...blow up and make a big mess of things or would you like to find your way through the system?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Find my way through the system.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. So how would you like to feel about this? What could you say to yourself or how could you think about this, so that when confronted with the bureaucracy and, "Oh, you can't do that." And so on and so on and so on, so you just go, "Oh, tell me more?" Or something like that? "Tell me what I need to do?" You feel calm and so on and find your way through the system.</p>

<p>MELISSA: But that's going to be hard.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Would that be okay?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah, but... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: You think it's going to be harder than blowing up and getting angry?</p>

<p>MELISSA: No. It's going to be hard to stop myself from blowing up and... [0:34:24.5]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. And what would make it hard?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Because it's this habit, it's this form.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, what we can do here is build you a new habit.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And it'll run off just the way you want it, just as repetitively and just as 100 percent as the habit you've already got. Would that be all right with you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Interested in doing that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. How would you like to be able to respond in this situation? Think about it a little bit. Go back to this particular one. It's always good to have a particular thing that we deal with. And then we can always generalize to other examples of the same kind of thing.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I think I would've liked to have said, "Okay. I understand. I will go talk to the counselor. Thank you very much."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Instead of saying, "I can believe..." You know? (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, getting outraged. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. I mean because it wasn't the person's fault. I mean I... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. It's not them. They're just part of the system.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right? So, they're in fact...you're acting like you're individually being targeted, right? And here's this poor guy and you're targeting him.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I know. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And he's just part of the system.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I know.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I can't believe you'd be that kind of person.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I am. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now, close your mind. Oh, excuse me, close your eyes.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And go back to, so imagine, re-roll the same movie again, only this time when you hand over the papers, or whatever it was, and he tells you, "Well, you can't register." And so on. Just, you don't have to tell me anything about it, just tell me how it goes as you imagine doing that, being calm and just saying, "Okay, who do I need to talk to about this?" Or however, whatever is satisfying for you.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: How's that work?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I say, "Okay. Thank you." And then...I walk away.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I could see that... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...but I don't think I could ever do that. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now let's do another piece of that. But that would be satisfying for you, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: If you could do that you'd be happy? Is that right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now let's double check. Close your eyes and ask inside, "Is there any part of me that would have any objection to dealing with this kind of situation in this way?" And just be sensitive to any feeling or any voice or any picture that might come up, of any part of you might object, have any objection to this.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay?</p>

<p>MELISSA: There's a part.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: What's the objection?</p>

<p>MELISSA: That it's their fault and since they're the one to blame... [0:37:28.7]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh, you want to blame somebody?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I want to yell at somebody. I want to scream.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: What does blaming do for you? Blaming somebody else?</p>

<p>MELISSA: It makes people see what they did wrong.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, they're just following the rules. What did they do wrong?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I don't want to talk about just that situation, I'm talking about everything, like other instances.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now, you'd like them to understand that there could be a different way of doing things that would be more respectful of you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Is that right? It's a good way of putting it?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Do you think they're going to listen to you better if you blow up and get outraged out them or if you were calm?</p>

<p>MELISSA: If I was calm.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I think so. So if you really want to change the bureaucracy or if you want to change some other situation, where say somebody else is disrespectful of you, wouldn't it actually be easier if you could just be calm and centered and self composed? You say, "Look, I didn't like what you did. That doesn't fit for me. I want you to change it."</p>

<p>MELISSA: But they don't listen. They never listen.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Sometimes they won't listen. Do you think they're going to listen better if you're angry or if you're calm?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Well, how would, if I start off calm but then I can get angry if they don't listen?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You can always get angry, you're good at that and you know how to do that.</p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling) I know.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right? (both chuckling) We're not into taking away choices here.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You can always get angry later, and sometimes anger gets people to notice you. But...there are other times where people just say, "Oh, well, they're just angry." And so they're just blowing it off and they just say, "Well, it's just because she's so emotional. You know how women are."</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: When you get that stuff.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You've probably gotten that once in a while. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. So, now check again. Ask if that part, given that part wants to be able to get angry if it wants to, some time later. Do you have any objection to having this as a general new program or a general new pattern to deal with such situations?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'no']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Because...I have a hunch, I know it's true for me, that if I were in one of those officials' positions and someone starts yelling at me, it will tend to harden my position. I will go, "You know, well, it's in the rule book here and everything. Can't do anything, sorry." Because I want to get rid of you as soon as I can. But if you were calm with me and said, "You know, well, this is the situation, and I took this in high school." And so and so on. "And I took..." Said...lay out whatever the reasons are, I'd be much more inclined, I think, I know I would be and I think most people would be, much more inclined to bend the rules or to try and find a way around the rules or something like that.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Did that make sense to you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I think it's true. I mean, but check for yourself. Close your eyes again. And think about running through one of those situations. And... </p>

<p>MELISSA: Same situation or any situation? [0:40:30.5]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, take the same one and then take another one. [silence from 0:40:32.8 to 0:40:48.0] Okay? There is one.</p>

<p>MELISSA: (big sigh) Yeah. (sigh)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Good, what is it? See, the only way we can make a change that will stick is if all parts of you are happy. And if there's any part of you that says, "Oh, I don't like that." Or it's, "It will mess up with something that I want to have happen." Then it won't last. So we really need to get all the objections and satisfy them all. So what's this one?</p>

<p>MELISSA: The other situation?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: The other objection. Now you don't have to tell me the situation. In fact, that's another thing I should have mentioned about this is, usually we can work more or mostly without content.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So we don't need details and names and places and deeds and... </p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...stuff like that. So you tried it in another situation and there was some objection there or something?</p>

<p>MELISSA: No, there was no objection. I could clearly see how I would've gotten a benefit or... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Gotten more?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. Gotten more out of it... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh, good.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...if I would've... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I misinterpreted your expression. You had this kind of... </p>

<p>MELISSA: ...if I would've calmed down.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You had this kind of wry look on your face and I thought, "Oh, another objection." Great. Well, try another one. Think of another one. [silence from 0:41:48.9 to 0:41:54.7] Would it work better there, too?</p>

<p>MELISSA: In all of them.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: In all of them?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I can, all of these situations from the past that I've...gotten so angry... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Blown up?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I could've, I guess it's like I want them to understand, you know? "Don't you understand what I'm going through? Don't you understand I'm having problems?" Understand...and the only way I can... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: And you thought by yelling at them... </p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...you could make them understand.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. "This is how I feel. This is..."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>MELISSA: "... how angry I feel. Okay, understand."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. I think it works better the other way around.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. I'm starting to see that, too. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay, great. Now, let's do a little think that will help sort of program this into your mind and make it really easy for you.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay? Think about what you would see the first time, well, take these three examples that you just did. So was it see or hear? Actually you said 'you can't do that', is that a key thing? Someone saying, "You can't do that." Or?</p>

<p>MELISSA: No.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Just the context.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: What's common to all of those three?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Somebody's preventing me from doing something.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Someone's preventing you from doing something? Someone's blocking you in some way?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay, great. And how do you think about a block like that? Someone's preventing you. Do you have any kind of image or words or anything? [silence from 0:43:16.7 to 0:43:27.3]</p>

<p>MELISSA: The thing that comes to mind right off the bat is, too bad, deal with it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Tough?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Live with it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Tough luck.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And this kind of shrug and dismissal.</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Is that part of it? Because when you did it just now, there was this kind of, little toss of the hair... </p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...just like, tough luck.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Too bad.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Tough luck. Tough luck, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay, good. Okay. [silence from 0:43:46.6 to 0:43:51.9] I may shift gears here. I was going to do one thing and I might do something else. Then we'll have more time to do some other things. Let's think of a future situation in which this might happen. Can you imagine a future possibility? Maybe with somebody whose bugged you in the past or something like that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Run through a future possibility. Close your eyes. Just imagine somebody blocks you in that way. And says, "Tough luck." Or whatever. [silence from 0:44:19.9 to 0:44:23.6] This is a road test.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I'm angry.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You're angry?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I'm angry.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. And what does the angry part want for you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: It wants me to hurt that person like they hurt me.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. So there's hurt underneath this?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: They're blocking you? What's the root of that? [silence from 0:44:45.5 to 0:44:50.3] Does this come from a long time ago? Being hurt in this way?</p>

<p>MELISSA: About a month.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: [non verbal questioning]</p>

<p>MELISSA: About a month ago.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: A month ago? So is there a particular person who hurt you in this way?</p>

<p>MELISSA: My ex.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Your ex? Great. Let's do a different thing then. Would you be interested in reaching forgiveness with this person?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I didn't do anything wrong.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: No. I know. I believe you. And forgiveness isn't for the other person. It's for you. So that you wouldn't have to be, have the feelings of hurt or anger or resentment, wish revenge.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Is that anything that would be of interest to you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I want to let it go.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You'd like to let it go?</p>

<p>MELISSA: It's bugging me every day. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Yeah, that's the problem with it and that's why forgiveness is particularly useful in situations like this. Okay. I need a little more information then. When you think of this person, where is the image located? How far away and so on, tell me more about this image? And I don't mean content, I mean like, how far away is it? Is it big or small?</p>

<p>MELISSA: It's about right there. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. I saw you looking about here?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. So about this far away?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And how tall, how big? Life size, smaller?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Life size.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Life size? So he's, like he's standing right here? Okay. And is there any voices to it?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. And I don't want to, I don't need the content, but is it like strident, angry, calm, peaceful, what kind of... [0:46:32.1]</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yelling, screaming.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yelling and screaming? All good stuff like that, okay. Now, can you think of someone who harmed you in the past but you've forgiven them?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: How do you represent that person? [silence from 0:46:45.2 to 0:46:52.1]</p>

<p>MELISSA: My mom.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. And where is, when you think of your mom, whom you've forgiven, where is she? Is she in the same location? In somewhere different in your personal space?</p>

<p>MELISSA: She's closer.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: She's closer? Okay. Where? [silence from 0:47:10.6 to 0:47:18.9]</p>

<p>MELISSA: (big sigh) I don't know, I'd say maybe right next to me.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Right here?</p>

<p>MELISSA: There.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Close to you? And is, and I hear your voice change, so there's a softness there, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So I believe you, you have forgiven her. Some people, they've sort of forgiven but not. But I hear in your voice that you really have forgiven her. There's a softness and a warmth there, right? Okay, great. Now, here's the hard part. This is the easy part.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: We lead into the hard part with lots of warning. If you want to forgive this person here, one way to do it is to represent him over here, close and so on, in the same way that you represent your mom. Now I'm sure you're unwilling to do that right now. Most people are, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (big sigh) Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now, what are your objections? Play the objections game.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I hate him.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: For what he did? Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I hate him for lying.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I hate the way I was treated.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And, yeah, that's about it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now, this may be, take a little while to get this understanding across, but the first thing I want to mention is, I see where you had some warm feelings for this person as well? Okay. But he violated some of your values in ways that are very important for you to maintain, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now you've, how long have you known, did you know this person?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Eight months.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Eight months. So you know him pretty well?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I thought I did.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, now you know him better.</p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Not in the way you wanted, but... </p>

<p>MELISSA: No.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...but now you know him better. Usually in blame there's the presupposition that he could've done differently.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now, I think maybe with some therapy or with a knock along side of the head or something like that, he could probably do differently.</p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling) Probably.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: But at this time, he was who he was, he did what he did, and you needed to maintain your values. Whatever went on violated your values, right? And you needed to say, (making noise) "This is it." Can you understand that he couldn't have done any different than he did? [0:49:41.3]</p>

<p>MELISSA: No.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Let me try some, another one. Can you think of some time in the past when you harmed someone else?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Maybe totally unintentionally or whatever. And now looking back on it I assume you have some regret. Is that right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now at the moment that you harmed them, could you have done anything different?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I don't think so. This is part of self forgiveness. I have the idea, crazy or not, that everybody always the best they can, given their knowledge, given their background, given their habits, their economics, and so on and so and so. People make the best choices they can at the time. And I think that you made the best choice you could at that time, given what you knew, at that moment, even though it resulted in harming someone.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Is that true? Does that make sense to you? That at that moment in time, maybe ten seconds later you go, "Oh, I could've done different." But at that moment you made the best choice you could. Now I don't know what kind of fears this person had or what kind of insecurities or what led this person to lie to you, but I would believe that if he were in the room here we could find out, what was it that led him to think that that was the best choice that he could make in that situation.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I already know what it is. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Do you? Okay, so you have some understanding? Some compassion?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Some compassion.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>MELISSA: But I still hate him.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, he still did something that hurt you. The question is whether you're willing to let go of that and what we could do or say to make that possible for you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Honestly, one part of me doesn't want to let it go... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...for fear that if I ever see him again... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: That you'd be susceptible again?</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...I would...no, that I just want to be, "You know what? I don't forgive you. I hate you. I can't believe you did this." (big sigh) There's that revenge thing.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: But then there's part of me that wants to let it go.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now what would revenge do for you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Make me feel better. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: It'd make you feel better. I'd like you to feel better. I don't think revenge is the best way to do it. It's a way. Now tell me this. Close your eyes and go into wild revenge fantasies. What would you do if you had, you were totally omnipotent and you had all the power in the world and you could take revenge on this guy, beat him to a bloody pulp or whatever, how would that make you feel? [0:52:41.0]</p>

<p>MELISSA: Like I won.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. So I, but do you feel stronger?</p>

<p>MELISSA: No, I'd say I feel equal.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Equal. So you feel unequal now?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I want him to feel the hurt that I felt.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. And that would make you feel equal?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Is there any other way that you could feel equal to him or even superior? Because you know, forgiveness is something that not many people can accomplish. It takes a good deal of strength of character and compassion and a lot of human qualities. [silence from 0:53:23.8 to 0:53:32.3] No sale?</p>

<p>MELISSA: What?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: No sale?</p>

<p>MELISSA: No sale. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, you might have to go on feeling...grumpy and angry at the rest of the world, which isn't quite fair to them even. I mean he wasn't fair to you. I guess fairness is a big thing for you, right? It is for me, too. Now, I want to tell you a story about Milton Erickson. Have you heard of him? He was a great medical hypnotist and great therapist.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Probably in Psych 101 I have. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: He was a doctor in a mental hospital and he was doing regular physical exams of the various staff and the patients and also the candy stripers, the assistants, the young women who were helping out. And he examined this 75-year-old alcoholic, who'd been a trouble to the world for most of his years and probably would live another 20 years. The guy was in good health and he examined him and sent him out, and then he examined a candy striper and the candy striper was, oh, 16. And he looked into her eyes with...the little gadgets and so on, and he found unmistakable signs of a fatal disease and then she would only live six months. And, he had to leave the room to get his composure. And he says it, he said he went out and he says, "Get this through your head Erickson, life is not fair." Before he could come in and he had to tell this young woman that she had six months to live. Now, that doesn't stop us from trying to be as fair as we can and, do the best we can in our relationships, to be fair and to be honest. But life is fundamentally not fair. Look around you, some people are in wheelchairs, some people aren't here. Does that make any difference in your understanding of this person over here? Probably life wasn't fair to him either. [0:55:52.8]</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Close your eyes. [silence from 0:56:01.7 to 0:56:10.0] Stay with that feeling for a little while. Now, there's one other piece that I'm sure would be very important here before you would be willing to forgive him. You would need to be protected, because if you forgave him you might be tempted to go back with him, on the same basis that you were before, and then you would be vulnerable to the same kind of treatment again. Does that make sense to you? So you would need to feel assured in yourself that if you forgave him, you would need to have some kind of resolution about..., "I'm sorry this happened and I'm sorry he had to be who he was and so on, but that's not what I want in my life." Or something like that, so that you would be safe. Because sometimes...this happens all the time in battered women and stuff. They forgive their husbands, they go right back in, they get beat up again. You don't want that, right? Now, do you have a sense, if you closed your eyes and imagine going into the future, and imagine that you felt the same toward him as you do toward your mother. Do you feel safe? Is there any danger?</p>

<p>MELISSA: There's that danger that (big sigh) I would go back.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. And what could you, what could we do here that would make that no longer a danger? That you might recognize? For instance, I'm just going to talk on a little while and you do whatever you want to. That if you have in your mind clearly, "Here's a person who had many qualities that I liked. We had many good times together. But lying is just, that's a no-no, I don't like that. I don't want that to be a part of my life, unless I was totally assured that that absolutely would not happen in the future. I just don't want to have, I just, I could talk to this person, I can say hello, but I just don't want to be in a relationship with this person." Is there any kind of arrangements like that, that you could make inside yourself, so that if you go into the future and you think about being with this person, without hate and without anger, that you would still be safe from any kind of future repetitions of that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Close your eyes, go into the future, and imagine that you'd done that. And you meet him on campus or wherever you feel like we can meet him, and just road test what we've done here. [silence from 0:58:55.6 to 0:59:03.3] What is it like being with him? And is it easy for you to maintain whatever distance is important to you or whatever protection?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. I can do it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: But? I hear a 'but' in your voice.</p>

<p>MELISSA: But it's like I put on this front...of being happy and... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. No, that, I don't recommend this. Can you do it another way? Can you, in here you've expressed some compassion for him, right? What if you talked to him like that? What if you told him about how badly he hurt you, but in a voice that was not angry and blaming but just talking about yourself? Just to let him know, because that's important to you, isn't it? To let him know that? But in such a way that you are telling him about yourself, not blaming him. Saying, "Look, when you lied to me..." Or whatever it was, blah, blah, blah. "Boy, that was like a knife in my heart." Or however you would describe it. So that he could know what an impact he's having on the world. My guess is you'd like to protect somebody else from this, wouldn't you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (sniffing) Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: In the future, if he's with somebody else, would you want them to go through the same thing you went through?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'no']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So you'd like to have an impact on him, right? Even if you never see him again, wouldn't it be nice if you could say, "Hey, that didn't work for me. That hurt like hell." Or whatever your words would be. Make him understand that what he did, didn't fit for you. [silence from 1:00:54.2 to 1:01:03.7]</p>

<p>MELISSA: I think I can do it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Imagine in your mind, close your eyes. Imagine doing that with him, and notice how he responds. Notice where the conversation goes. But you be clear that your central focus is on letting him know your experience. Because if you start blaming him, he'll probably just get uptight and turn away or disappear. But if you're just there telling him how you feel, there's a chance that he'd listen. I can't guarantee it. [silence from 1:01:38.9 to 1:01:54.6] How does that go when you try that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (sniffing) [silence from 1:01:56.2 to 1:02:01.2] He's, blames me. That the reason he was the way he was, was because of a thing that I did.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Is there even a kernel of truth in there? Okay. Can you tell him that? "There's a kernel of truth in there." Tell him how, whatever your understanding is of your part in this, and just see how that goes. Your imaginary conversation with him. [silence from 1:02:33.8 to 1:02:47.9] How does that go?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (sniffing) I explain to him, "I realize that I did some horrible things."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: "But that, that does not justify the way that I was treated in the end."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. That's clear.</p>

<p>MELISSA: "That I deserved better than what..."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>MELISSA: "...was given to me."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Sure. Now given what we've done so far, are you willing to consider representing him in the same way that you represent your mother, so that you could have those feelings of forgiveness? I think there might be a piece or two missing but this is how we find out.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I think I could forgive him.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And then he could be like my mom, the way I view her.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. With faults, with limitations? Like all of us doing the best we can? You're doing the best you can, aren't you? He is, too. Sometimes it stinks. You understand the distinction?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You know there are people all over the world who are doing the best they can and sometimes it's just terrible, but they're trying hard. And some people come into the world with great limitations. And some people become limited by experiences that happen to them. Try it out, because anything we can, we can always shift back. But imagine that you take that image of him and move it over here, into the same position as your mother. The same size and if there's any special lighting or anything like that, like make it the same. [silence from 1:04:45.2 to 1:04:55.2]</p>

<p>MELISSA: (big sigh)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: It will be a little weird at first probably. And if you have objections, send him back out here again and we'll deal with objections.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I'm scared.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Scared? Good, of what? Some vulnerability? Can you say a little bit about it?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I'm scared that he would say... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Special things to you that would get you back into it?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: What could protect you from that, from that vulnerability?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Remembering how I felt before.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Remembering the good times and the good feelings. Well, there is another possibility and that is that, if you are very clear with him, what is totally out of your world that you simply will not permit, that you might try getting back together again. But you would need to be very careful, you need to be able to protect yourself from a repetition.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I don't want to... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: You don't want that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: No.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Then what can, what arrangements could you make inside your own mind, so that you're totally safe of that? That you can see this person that you had very special times with and treasure those good feelings, those good times, but it's not enough for you, you deserve better.</p>

<p>MELISSA: What can I do?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Internally. You've made a lot of internal shifts already and they're very lovely. What could you say to yourself or how could you think about him? How could you be very clear? It's more a matter of congruence, of being very congruent in yourself. That despite the good times you had with this person and that this particular element of his personality or behavior, you don't want that to be a part of this kind of relationship, you deserve better. So that you can be very clear with him and not be vulnerable to falling back in and being mistreated again.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I would just, (sighing) I know that he's never going to change. Because I... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, you can't really know that. You don't have a fortune teller license, do you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: No. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I don't. (chuckling)</p>

<p>MELISSA: I just... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: You don't, at this moment you don't think he will change?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right. There's just certain qualities... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Great. And you may have very good reasons to be correct.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I tried for eight months.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. So, knowing that, can you be very clear that if you see this person in the future and you're with him, you can treasure the good times and know very, very clearly, (making noise) "No, no further." [1:08:01.1]</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Can you do that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Take it for a test drive. Close your eyes. Imagine being with this person. [silence from 1:08:11.6 to 1:08:24.2] It work?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now let's try again. Let's bring him in again. So you need that protection before you do forgiveness. But forgiveness is very, very healing. It can take away all that anger and the resentment and hurt and so on. If you can represent him the way you do your mom and be safe, protect yourself and protect your values. It looks good to me.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. (big sigh)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You look relaxed. There's a nice, soft smile now.</p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling) I just, I realize that my mom had her faults.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And that my mom's always going to have certain faults.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: They might change.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: There might be different ones. (chuckling)</p>

<p>MELISSA: But I'm going to, I accept her for who she is.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And that's what I could see myself doing with him.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And I have faults and you have faults. We're all human. Our time is almost up. Do you have any comments you'd like to make or any questions?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I want to try it out... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Sure.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...in reality. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: That's the place to really test drive it, absolutely. Try it out.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah, I... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: And can you imagine trying it out in a way where you are safe? Such as, you're with other people or something, so you can always grab somebody else by the arm and say, "Get me out of here."</p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay, or something like that so you have a sort of a second layer of protection? Now if you go back to the original thing, the thing at the... </p>

<p>MELISSA: School?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: The school thing?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: What's it like if you go back and do that? Because that's where we started. [silence from 1:10:17.5 to 1:10:27.7]</p>

<p>MELISSA: It's just calm.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: No problem?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Just stating, "Okay, is there any way around this?" "No, there's not. You have to do this." "Okay, thank you very much. Have a nice day."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: All right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. (big sigh - chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Looks like, it looks good. I mean looking at your body and your breathing and everything, it looks, it looks comfortable, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now try one of, you had tried to or two others, you had imagined two or three other incidents where you'd gotten angry in the past.</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Go back to them now. Just run them without any particular intention. Just see how they unfold by themselves. [silence from 1:10:58.6 to 1:11:08.8]</p>

<p>MELISSA: I can see myself with my father, yelling, him yelling and screaming at me. And in the past I would yell and scream back, you know.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right back, yeah.</p>

<p>MELISSA: But I... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Which gives him a great excuse to yell more at you, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah, I know. (chuckling) But I could see myself actually saying, "Okay...all right, I understand." Or...not getting tense.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Great.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I was just calm.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Great. Is that good?</p>

<p>MELISSA: It's a weird feeling though. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, it's unfamiliar, isn't it?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now I want to check on one thing. You said you could see yourself being calm. Were you like looking at yourself on TV or were you actually back in there with your father facing him?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I was back in there facing him.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. I thought you were probably doing that, the way, by your behavior, but I wanted to check, because sometimes if people see it over there, it doesn't work.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: In reality you have to get in.</p>

<p>MELISSA: No, I could actually be standing... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Great.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I could see a for instance, be standing there... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Great.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...and just calm, cool, relaxed.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: All right.</p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling) Thank you. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Thank you. This is delightful. Do you have any other questions? We've got about a minute left maybe.</p>

<p>MELISSA: No.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well... </p>

<p>MELISSA: Is it, what do I do if it doesn't work?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Call me up.</p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling) Okay, in Colorado?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I'm serious, yeah. I'll give you my phone number.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay. (laughing)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I'm serious. Sometimes there's a little piece missing. This looks really good to me. And I don't know if you were tracking what we were doing, but repeatedly I would ask for objections and problems and we'd try something out. Well, it didn't quite do it. And you tried the one thing out and you were being nicey-nice on the outside but (making growling noise) on the inside, so... </p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You know, we kept working it over and kept improving what we were doing. So my guess is it will work just fine. But it's always possible that some part of you is kind of hiding out and kind of thinking, "Well, I think that will work." And then when it comes to the situation you go, "Huh-uh."</p>

<p>MELISSA: So I should get that comfort feeling? I should play it over in my head before?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You shouldn't need to do anything.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I should just go in there and wing it?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Just go in there and wing it.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay. I can do it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, I think you can. Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Thank you. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I think we're done.</p>

<p>[Video ends at 1:13:21.7]</p>

<p>CARLSON: Let's look carefully now at some selected clips from this very productive interview. The first one we're going to look at is where you really work with Melissa and get her to loosen up her thinking.</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>MELISSA: "...though I haven't taken that class, I still should be able to take this class."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And they're like, "Well, you have to go see a counselor."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And I'm like, "I'm not going to waste my time."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. But you're willing to waste your time being angry?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right. (both chuckling) It's a habit.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay, good. Well, see things that are habitual are wonderful because, if something rolls off in a particular sequence, then if we change that the whole thing will be habitual throughout your life in other ways, too. </p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: In this piece, Steve, just what are you hoping to accomplish?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I'm doing two things here. One is building motivation by showing that, she's complaining about, 'this guy's wasting my time' so that's an excuse to get angry. And I'm saying, "Look, you're willing to waste your time getting angry." So I'm applying the criterion to her response to make her a little more likely to want to let go of it. And the other is, when she mentions that it's a habitual response, she's seeing it as an objection or a problem, and I want to see her, her to see it as a solution. That when we change the response, it will be just as dependable as the old habit.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>CHOSE: So having the habit of getting angry, then you change that to the habit of not getting angry?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So it's great that it's habitual.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Ah, okay.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Let's move onto the next clip. In the next clip you really help her to focus more on how she would eventually like to respond.</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...rules.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And it was like, "No, you have to go see a counselor." And I'm like... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: But you know bureaucracies are like that don't you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah, but I can't stand that! (both chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, see you have a choice though. Given that bureaucracies are like that, and you're probably going to find this, this is going to happen again and it's happened before. You mentioned that this happens a lot of times, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: It's like the inherent stupidity of the world suddenly puts itself in your face. Right? (both chuckling)</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So the question is, how would you like to respond to this?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I don't want to blow up at people.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. So... </p>

<p>MELISSA: I don't like to do it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now, if I got on a bus here and I said, "I don't want to go to Milwaukee and I don't want to go to New Orleans and I don't want to go to San Francisco." How would the bus driver know where to take me?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Unless you tell him?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. So where would you like to go? What would you like to do different...</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: In that piece you really tried to get her not to look so much at what the problem was and what she didn't want to do, but it looks like you're trying to get her to look at what the future would look like if she was doing it right? [1:16:12.2]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. This is a key piece of NLP. Most people are problem oriented and they know what they don't want, they know what the problem is, but they don't know really what they do want. And it's really like the bus driver. If you don't know what you do want, you can't really get there. And so I'm asking her to focus on a positive outcome, which is a key part of NLP.</p>

<p>CARLSON: So she's really having to change the way she thinks?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: It's turning things around. This is a piece that Virginia Satir did a great deal. She would say..., "Okay, that's what you don't want. What do you want?"</p>

<p>CHOSE: What do you want?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, in this next clip you really even take it further in getting her to switch positions. Let's watch that.</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>MELISSA: Instead of saying, "I can believe..." You know? (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, getting outraged. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. I mean because it wasn't the person's fault. I mean I... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. It's not them. They're just part of the system.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right? So, they're in fact...you're acting like you're individually being targeted, right? And here's this poor guy and you're targeting him.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I know. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And he's just part of the system.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I know.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I can't believe you'd be that kind of person.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I am. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: This was really an eye opener for her. That she seemed to be doing the very thing that she was having done to her or was up against.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. Well, again, it's utilizing her criteria to motivate or to change. To show her that, in fact, this thing that she's complaining about so heavily in the world, is actually what she's doing when she gets angry.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Is that a pretty common phenomenon that people really... (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Do what they complain about?</p>

<p>CARLSON: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh, yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CARLSON: That they do unto others, not what they want done unto them.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, it's a common thing.</p>

<p>CHOSE: One of the things that fascinated me here is your...you're really early into the interview and you've got a real good give and take going with her. You've established a nice, working relationship where you can point out her faults and she'll say, "Yeah! That's exactly what I do."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I'm being playful with her and I'm not looking down on her or criticizing her. I'm saying, "Hey, look what you're dong here."</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And that kind of attitude of, just being a friend and being kind of along for the ride, goes a long way I think. You know, there's later parts of the tape where she gets very serious and I'm very serious. At this point, humor is a great thing. Humor solves a lot of problems.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah, it does. I think it's so.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, in this next piece we're going to watch you talking about objections. Okay. And can you talk about that a little bit?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Before we watch the clip?</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah. Better to set that up.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, there are two basic processes as I see it in therapy. One is making the change, whatever the change is, to changing a habit or changing a response, from a feeling response and so on. And the other is making sure that that change really fits with all parts of the person. And that, we need to know all the objections, because if there are any objections they'll end up sabotaging, they'll end up being what people often call resistance (ph). And we look at objections as simply that there's some part of the person that has a concern that needs to be validated, needs to be addressed and dealt with in some way before you actually make the change. [1:19:18.4]</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, what happens once you get rid of these objections that the person has?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, it's not so much that we get rid of them, it's that we find a way so that the objection is satisfied within the change.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: The change is structured in such a way that any objections are satisfied.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Oh.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And then change is easy.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And then the behavior is congruent... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yes.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...to the, with the person.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: All parts of the person.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Then it's more than likely to be permanent?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, unless something else gets in the way and then you have to deal with that.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah. [overlapping at 1:19:48.7]... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Nothing is, luckily nothing is permanent. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to do this kind of change work.</p>

<p>CHOSE: (chuckling) It wouldn't do this, yeah. </p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay. Well, let's watch this next clip.</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And go back to, so imagine, re-roll the same movie again, only this time when you hand over the papers, or whatever it was, and he tells you, "Well, you can't register." And so on. Just, you don't have to tell me anything about it, just tell me how it goes as you imagine doing that, being calm and just saying, "Okay, who do I need to talk to about this?" Or however, whatever is satisfying for you.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: How's that work?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I say, "Okay. Thank you." And then...I walk away.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I could see that... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...but I don't think I could ever do that. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now let's do another piece of that. But that would be satisfying for you, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: If you could do that you'd be happy? Is that right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now let's double check. Close your eyes and ask inside, "Is there any part of me that would have any objection to dealing with this kind of situation in this way?" And just be sensitive to any feeling or any voice or any picture that might come up, of any part of you might object, have any objection to this.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay?</p>

<p>MELISSA: There's a part.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: What's the objection?</p>

<p>MELISSA: That it's their fault and since they're the one to blame... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh, you want to blame somebody?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh.</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: In this section, Steve, you seem to use logic. Is that a big part of NLP work?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, it's using the client's own logic.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Oh.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And it may not be logical in the sense that a teacher of symbolic logic might think about it, but it's their criterion, their way of thinking. And if you can use their way of thinking to support the outcome that they're going for, then they'll be totally happy with it.</p>

<p>CHOSE: So somebody's to blame and?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right now she needs to blame somebody.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And that needs to be honored. And blame isn't useful ultimately, at the end of the tape she's not blaming, but at this point I need to honor that objection as it's presented to me, and then find a way that that objection can be satisfied by going through and proceeding with reaching forgiveness. [1:22:19.7]</p>

<p>CARLSON: And in this whole process she seems to be more empowered.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Sure.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And she's able to take more responsibility for her own life.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And you do that so subtly or maybe it isn't so subtly.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, it's basically teaching...I think of this as teaching rather than therapy. It's kind of teaching people how to use their brains. People's brains tend to run off with them and take them places they don't want to go. And here, this is the first step in rehearsing a possible solution, possible positive outcome, that she would prefer better than getting angry. And we're only on the first step of it and she has an objection, and we'll keep doing this over and over again.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, this next clip we're going to watch, you do some important teaching to her, for her. Let's watch it. </p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So we really need to get all the objections and satisfy them all. So what's this one?</p>

<p>MELISSA: The other situation?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: The other objection. Now you don't have to tell me the situation. In fact, that's another thing I should have mentioned about this is, usually we can work more or mostly without content.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So we don't need details and names and places and deeds and... </p>

<p>MELISSA: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...stuff like that. So you tried it in another situation and there was some objection there or something?</p>

<p>MELISSA: No, there was no objection. I could clearly see how I would've gotten a benefit or... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Gotten more?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. Gotten more out of it... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh, good.</p>

<p>MELISSA: ...if I would've... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I misinterpreted your expression. You had this kind of... </p>

<p>MELISSA: ...if I would've calmed down.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You had this kind of wry look on your face and I thought, "Oh, another objection."</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: What do you mean in this piece here that we don't need content? That you can work without content, facts, dates? That's really important in most therapies.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, all I need to know here is that somebody mistreated her. That somebody violated her values.</p>

<p>CARLSON: You don't need to know who?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I don't really need to know the details. I don't need to know who. I don't need to know... </p>

<p>CARLSON: How or when?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...the gory details or when it happened and how it happened and all the horrible things that were said, that's pretty relevant (ph) really.</p>

<p>CHOSE: But does that help her somewhat, too? To say, "Well, if it works for this it might work for that and work for that?" Or?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, I'm letting her do that.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I'm having her select other examples of situations like this. And...in a hundred years she couldn't tell me enough about it for me to really understand her experience.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: But by her rehearsing it in her mind she can have the full experience of, what is it like to be with this specific person and hearing what that person had said to her and all the rest of it. She needs the content. I don't need the content, as long as I know enough about the kind of thing that she's dealing with.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Oh, I see. Okay. Well, in this next clip we're going to watch you have her go into a future situation. [1:25:02.4]</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...of a future situation in which this might happen. Can you imagine a future possibility? Maybe with somebody whose bugged you in the past or something like that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Run through a future possibility. Close your eyes. Just imagine somebody blocks you in that way. And says, "Tough luck." Or whatever. [ - silence - ] This is a road test.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I'm angry.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You're angry?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I'm angry.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. And what does the angry part want for you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: It wants me to hurt that person like they hurt me.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. So there's hurt underneath this?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: They're blocking you? What's the root of that? [ - silence - ] Does this come from a long time ago? Being hurt in this way?</p>

<p>MELISSA: About a month.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: [non verbal questioning]</p>

<p>MELISSA: About a month ago.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: A month ago? So is there a particular person who hurt you in this way?</p>

<p>MELISSA: My ex.</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: In this piece you talked with her about a road test. What does a road test mean?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, the technical term is 'future pace', it's a rehearsal into the future. To try out a new set of behaviors, to find out how well they work in her mind, with her best information about the situation that she has dealt with in the past by getting angry.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Oh.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Let's try out the new, being calm and so on.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And what did you see in this particular interview?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, in this particular piece, she... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Piece of interview.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...gets angry again. So it doesn't work yet. There's something else we need to do. So I ask...what's the function of the anger? What does the anger want for you? What is its positive outcome? We look at any part of a person that resists or gets in the way of a possible solution as another resource. This is a part that has another concern. There's something else that needs to happen to further develop the behavioral response that we want to put in there to make it really work. And so I need more information about this, what is the anger about? And, oh, there's hurt there, okay. And something about the way she, her face changed... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...and she got more emotional there... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...suggested to me that this was much more than just the registrar and the hassle with the classes.</p>

<p>CHOSE: There's something?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: This had some other roots, that there's some other things in here. So I asked, is there some other root...to this?</p>

<p>CARLSON: And she seemed to know what you were talking about.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Popped right out. Came right out.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah, came out right away.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. And it wouldn't necessarily, but for her it did very easily.</p>

<p>CARLSON: In this next piece you're going to talk to her about forgiveness. And she seemed to have some misunderstandings about what forgiveness was and who it was for.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, a lot of people have misunderstandings about forgiveness. Some people think they should do it for other people.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And...there are a lot of spiritual teachings about forgiveness and there's a lot of misconceptions about forgiveness, so this is again, part of the educational process is, how could this be useful to you in reaching the outcome that she wants, which is to be calm and not to blow up in these situations. [1:28:05.9]</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, let's watch this clarification and especially her response to your words.</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Let's do a different thing then. Would you be interested in reaching forgiveness with this person?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I didn't do anything wrong.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: No. I know. I believe you. And forgiveness isn't for the other person. It's for you. So that you wouldn't have to be, have the feelings of hurt or anger or resentment, wish revenge.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Is that anything that would be of interest to you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I want to let it go.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You'd like to let it go?</p>

<p>MELISSA: It's bugging me every day. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Yeah, that's the problem with it and that's why forgiveness is particularly useful in situations like this.</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: It also looked like, when I watched this, that you were proposing an outcome for her, having her to rethink this?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right. Yeah. There's nothing wrong in proposing an outcome as long as I do it gently and just offering it as a possibility. For the most part we ask for the person's outcome, but here it's clear that she's angry, she's resentful against somebody. I know what the solution is. The solution is forgiveness. And it's a question of offering it to her in such a way that she can maybe find it appealing or at least that it's something to consider.</p>

<p>CHOSE: And she picked up very quickly that, 'I want to let it go', kind of piece, that said this is how I'm going to have to do it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And that's actually the Middle English root of forgiveness, is to let go.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Oh.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: It's the actual root of the word, so.</p>

<p>CARLSON: In this next piece you do some very interesting work with forgiveness, in which you have her look at where she feels about her boyfriend and then where she feels about her mom, someone whom she had some resolution and forgiveness with. Let's watch as you talk about these different positions. [1:30:02.8]</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...then. When you think of this person, where is the image located? How far away and so on, tell me more about this image? And I don't mean content, I mean like, how far away is it? Is it big or small?</p>

<p>MELISSA: It's about right there. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. I saw you looking about here?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. So about this far away?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And how tall, how big? Life size, smaller?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Life size.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Life size? So he's, like he's standing right here? Okay. And is there any voices to it?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. And I don't want to, I don't need the content, but is it like strident, angry, calm, peaceful, what kind of... </p>

<p>MELISSA: Yelling, screaming.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yelling and screaming? All good stuff like that, okay. Now, can you think of someone who harmed you in the past but you've forgiven them?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'yes']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: How do you represent that person? [ - silence - ]</p>

<p>MELISSA: My mom.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. And where is, when you think of your mom, whom you've forgiven, where is she? Is she in the same location? In somewhere different in your personal space?</p>

<p>MELISSA: She's closer.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: She's closer? Okay. Where? [ - silence - ]</p>

<p>MELISSA: (big sigh) I don't know, I'd say maybe right next to me.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Right here?</p>

<p>MELISSA: There.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Close to you? And is, and I hear your voice change, so there's a softness there, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So I believe you, you have forgiven her. Some people, they've sort of forgiven but not. But I hear in your voice that you really have forgiven her. There's a softness and a warmth there, right? Okay, great. Now, here's the hard part. This is the easy part.</p>

<p>MELISSA: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: We lead into the hard part with lots of warning. If you want to forgive this person here, one way to do it is to represent him over here, close and so on, in the same way that you represent your mom. Now I'm sure you're unwilling to do that right now. Most people are, right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (big sigh) Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now, what are your objections?</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: What is the significance of the different location of the mom and the boyfriend? I mean is this really that important?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, it's vitally important, and people have been doing various kinds of visualizations for years without realizing the importance of where you visualize things. As a very simple example, if you say, "I could go to New York." Notice where your picture is? And then if you say, "I will go to New York." The picture shifts. It becomes in a different location. So things that you will do and actually will happen, literally occupy a different position in your mind than something that you could do, which is just simply a possibility but you're not committed to it. And when a person resents somebody, they'll be literally located in a different space than someone that they have forgiven. And we use this in many, many applications of this, so we find a counter example to the person. They're of one person, well, forgiveness is the counter example. Here's someone who did something bad to you but you've forgiven them. Where are they located? And that tells you actually the perceptual shift that the person needs to make in their mind. That's the easy part, actually. [1:33:35.5]</p>

<p>CARLSON: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now if I had if I had her shift though now, she would be very unhappy with it, she would be in some kind of danger from forgiving this guy.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So we need to deal, that's why I lead right into 'what's the objection'.</p>

<p>CHOSE: You have to.</p>

<p>CARLSON: But this is really powerful, because you've already let her know that she's been successful before, that she's had a solution to a similar problem.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, absolutely.</p>

<p>CHOSE: The other thing that I noticed about when you set this up was, you asked about how it sounded, his voice or the sound, and she... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right. Well, for us a representation is a full, it's image, the visual, the auditory and the kinesthetic. The image includes all of that and so I want to amplify that and bring that all out, too. If I'd asked about the sound with her mother, I'm sure it would've been much more calm and peaceful. I know that from her response.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So I didn't. I could've done that, too, though.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, in this next piece we're going to watch you bring out something else. You bring out some emotions. Let's watch what happens in the interview when these emotions come forth from Melissa. And I'd like to hear, after the clip, why you responded in the way you did?</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now, what are your objections? Play the objections game.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I hate him.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: For what he did? Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I hate him for lying.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I hate the way I was treated.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: And, yeah, that's about it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Now, this may be, take a little while to get this understanding across, but the first thing I want to mention is, I see where you had some warm feelings for this person as well? Okay.</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: Steve, you just seemed to almost ignore this very emotional moment for her. What was going on inside you and why did you choose your response?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: This is probably the hardest question I'm going to have to answer today and it's hard to answer it because it takes a whole different mind set to understand the answer.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Feelings are responses to her memories in this case. It's not real life because her ex-boyfriend is not in the room. So it's in her mind. She makes a certain set of pictures. She makes a certain set of sounds or she hears him speaking or whatever. She remembers the horrible things he did and then she has these really unpleasant feelings. Now if I were to dwell on those feelings, that would be essentially problem oriented. She's went into the situation, it didn't work, she's feeling bad. But what I'm only interested always in is solutions. I need to respect her feelings. Right now she's feeling bad, she's remembering those hard times. But what my job is, is to find out a solution for her so that she doesn't have to have those feelings, and that's why I don't dwell on them. [1:36:35.6]</p>

<p>CARLSON: But so much of psychotherapy is get those feelings out. Aren't you afraid that if you don't tend to them they're going to stay there and fester?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, see that presupposes that feelings are like puss in a boil or something. You used the word 'fester'. And these kinds of metaphors are, metaphors are wonderfully useful and they also can be misleading. And a lot of psychotherapy is based on Freud's plumbing metaphor, that there are fluids in the body. And by the way, he got this from Dacarte (ph), Dacarte thought the brain worked on little pumps... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Little pumps, yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...pumping fluids around.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, what metaphor do you have?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: That was a good first approximation. But the plumbing metaphor is, if you push something down here, it pops up something else and... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: You got to drain it off.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...genoff (ph) and the primal pirelli (ph), they had to drain the primal pool of pain.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: It's a nice alliteration there but it didn't really work. And we think of it more as a computer metaphor or a CD metaphor. That if you don't play the CD there's no music. It's not like there's music in a CD bursting and trying to get out or festering to get out. And so if you don't put the laser light on the CD, if you don't play the memory, it doesn't happen.</p>

<p>CARLSON: This is kind of like a jukebox theory or something that you can... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, I often call it the jukebox, although a lot of people don't know what a jukebox is anymore, so. (chuckling)</p>

<p>CARLSON: Oh, well, we have dictionaries...people can look that one up.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Look that one up.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: But don't you think she might feel that you didn't really care about her? Because you just let her cry and ignored it...and... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, she's having these feelings and you see, what I'm doing is I'm supporting her values, which are the crucial thing.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Oh, sure, yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Her values were violated and then she had the bad feelings. So rather than support the bad feelings... </p>

<p>CHOSE: You supported her.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...I want to go back to the values that were violated and say, "Look, we want to find a way so that you can be safe. So that your values aren't violated. So you're not subjected to lying or deceit or whatever it was that was going on."</p>

<p>CARLSON: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And in that way I think I'm fully supporting her, but in a positive way, to access her positive values, what she wants to have happen rather than what she doesn't want to have happen. And this is one of the very, the parallels between this whole solution-oriented field in general in NLP.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, let's watch the next piece too, which is similar in that you're continuing to build this positive outcome. [1:39:00.0]</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now, there's one other piece that I'm sure would be very important here before you would be willing to forgive him. You would need to be protected, because if you forgave him you might be tempted to go back with him, on the same basis that you were before, and then you would be vulnerable to the same kind of treatment again. Does that make sense to you? So you would need to feel assured in yourself that if you forgave him, you would need to have some kind of resolution about..., "I'm sorry this happened and I'm sorry he had to be who he was and so on, but that's not what I want in my life." Or something like that, so that you would be safe. Because sometimes...this happens all the time in battered women and stuff. They forgive their husbands, they go right back in, they get beat up again. You don't want that, right? Now, do you have a sense, if you closed your eyes and imagine going into the future, and imagine that you felt the same toward him as you do toward your mother. Do you feel safe? Is there any danger?</p>

<p>MELISSA: There's that danger that (big sigh) I would go back.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. And what could you, what could we do here that would make that no longer a danger? That you might recognize? For instance, I'm just going to talk on a little while and you do whatever you want to. That if you have in your mind clearly, "Here's a person who had many qualities that I liked. We had many good times together. But lying is just, that's a no-no, I don't like that. I don't want that to be a part of my life, unless I was totally assured that that absolutely would not happen in the future. I just don't want to have, I just, I could talk to this person, I can say hello, but I just don't want to be in a relationship with this person." Is there any kind of arrangements like that, that you could make inside yourself, so that if you go into the future and you think about being with this person, without hate and without anger, that you would still be safe from any kind of future repetitions of that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Close your eyes, go into the future, and imagine that you'd done that. And you meet him on campus or wherever you feel like we can meet him, and just road test what we've done here. [ -silence - ] What is it like being with him? And is it easy for you to maintain whatever distance is important to you or whatever protection?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. I can do it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: But? I hear a 'but' in your voice.</p>

<p>MELISSA: But it's like I put on this front...of being happy and... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. No, that, I don't recommend this. [1:42:20.9]</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: (chuckling) Here we see some more road testing. Can you talk a little bit about what you were doing in this piece?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, we're continuing to refine the outcome. I mean the general outcome is, starts out being not angry and then it becomes to be calm and to be functional and so on. And we're gradually working up to it piece by piece. Earlier she didn't want to have anything to do with this guy. And now at this point she's willing to, she can, in her mind she can have a talk with him but she puts on this nicey-nice and that's going to take too much effort. That's going to be hard for her. It's going to be a conflict. She's incongruent about it.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah, the danger.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So we just keep testing our outcome in imagination and when we finally get it right it will work in the real world, if there are not further objections that we haven't met.</p>

<p>CARLSON: The 'buts'?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: The 'buts', yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I mean this isn't, this is partway there, we just keep refining it and keep moving.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Getting a little closer.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: You know it's a little like going to the moon. You know, they shoot off the rocket and then they find out how much their off course and then they change it and they find out they're off course the other way... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Oh.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...and then they keep changing back and forth and gradually they get there.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Early in that segment you did something that was kind of incongruent, I guess, to me and that was where you said, 'I'm going to talk on for a while, you can do what you want to.' In other words, 'Don't listen to me'. And it... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, it's called permissiveness. (chuckling)</p>

<p>CHOSE: (chuckling) Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I was, I probably wouldn't say that again if I could reedit the world... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Oh, okay... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...I probably would leave that out.</p>

<p>CHOSE: ...wouldn't have done that again?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, I'd probably just say, 'I'd like to talk for a little while, you can just listen.' Or something like that.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, in this next segment you're going to do some more rocket corrections, I guess if we want to use your previous analogy.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And there's going to be more rehearsal that Melissa is going to have of being with her ex. [1:44:06.1]</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: My guess is you'd like to protect somebody else from this, wouldn't you?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (sniffing) Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: In the future, if he's with somebody else, would you want them to go through the same thing you went through?</p>

<p>MELISSA: [non verbal 'no']</p>

<p>ANDREAS: So you'd like to have an impact on him, right? Even if you never see him again, wouldn't it be nice if you could say, "Hey, that didn't work for me. That hurt like hell." Or whatever your words would be. Make him understand that what he did, didn't fit for you. [ - silence - ]</p>

<p>MELISSA: I think I can do it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay. Imagine in your mind, close your eyes. Imagine doing that with him, and notice how he responds. Notice where the conversation goes. But you be clear that your central focus is on letting him know your experience. Because if you start blaming him, he'll probably just get uptight and turn away or disappear. But if you're just there telling him how you feel, there's a chance that he'd listen. I can't guarantee it. [ - silence - ] How does that go when you try that?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (sniffing) [ - silence - ] He's, blames me. That the reason he was the way he was, was because of a thing that I did.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Is there even a kernel of truth in there? Okay. Can you tell him that? "There's a kernel of truth in there." Tell him how, whatever your understanding is of your part in this, and just see how that goes. Your imaginary conversation with him. [ - silence - ] How does that go?</p>

<p>MELISSA: (sniffing) I explain to him, "I realize that I did some horrible things."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Okay.</p>

<p>MELISSA: "But that, that does not justify the way that I was treated in the end."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. That's clear.</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: It seems like there's really a major shift here on her part, in perception and subsequent responsibility?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. She starts out blaming him, it's all his fault and she did nothing wrong. In fact earlier she says, "I did nothing wrong."</p>

<p>CHOSE: "I did nothing wrong." [1:47:06.9]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And I paced that, I just said, 'Right, I'm sure I agree with you.' Or something like that. I don't really believe it's true at that point but I want to maintain rapport with her at that point.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: It would be ridiculous for me to challenge that at that point. But at this point...she says, 'Well, he says I did a lot of things.' And I say, 'Well, is there even a kernel of truth?'</p>

<p>CARLSON: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And she takes that and amplifies. She says, 'I did a lot of horrible things.' Now, that's a general way, I just lead into it and see where she goes with it. And she's coming to balance. She's coming to realize more the notion of not fitting that I use, and that's straight out of Satir. Most people, if there's a problem between people in a relationship, they're going, 'You're wrong.' The other one says..., 'You're wrong.' And it's all blaming and it's all, 'You should change rather than me.' And she's coming to balance here.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And you did that, you really suggested a shift from those 'blaming you' messages to those more responsible... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...'I' messages... </p>

<p>CHOSE: 'I' messages.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...which was really... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: It's more of... </p>

<p>CARLSON: ...essentially communication training.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And basically it is. Now it's parts of the person, because she's communicating with part of her brain that represents her ex-boyfriend or whatever. And it communication training like, intra-cerebrally... (chuckling)</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...if you will.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Sure.</p>

<p>CHOSE: And there's a great deal of emotion going on with her, if you watch her face and eyes.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah, she's a very feeling person. She's very... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And it's almost within her.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah, yeah. And that seems to be part of how she's changing her thinking, the emotional component of it.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I would say the emotional comes after the perceptual.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: That if you, when I suggest different ways of communicating, of saying...'I' messages verses 'you' messages, that that will change her ex's response in her mind to something a little more productive that allows her to be a little more reasonable and the result of that is the feeling change.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Okay.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I would say. I don't know.</p>

<p>CHOSE: All right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Who knows?</p>

<p>CHOSE: That sequence, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: In this next clip we're going to see my favorite part of this video, and that's where you actually ask her to change the representation.... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...from where her boyfriend was to where her mother is.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Right. And this is something we do only after we've dealt with all these objections and she's satisfied. 'Oh, yeah, this would be a good thing. I'll be safe. I'll be protected. I don't need anger to get my point across. I don't need anger to get peoples' attention.' And all the rest of it.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Right.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: But this is actually, this is the crucial piece. The rest is just making the path so that that will work, because otherwise it won't work.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And if it works it's the therapist's desert. It's the part that you've earned the last as it all comes together. Let's watch.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, it's always nice to see people get happy. [1:49:50.7]</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Try it out, because anything we can, we can always shift back. But imagine that you take that image of him and move it over here, into the same position as your mother. The same size and if there's any special lighting or anything like that, like make it the same. [ - silence - ]</p>

<p>MELISSA: (big sigh)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: It will be a little weird at first probably. And if you have objections, send him back out here again and we'll deal with objections.</p>

<p>MELISSA: I'm scared.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Scared? Good, of what? Some vulnerability? Can you say a little bit about it?</p>

<p>MELISSA: I'm scared that he would say... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Special things to you that would get you back into it?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: What was going on with you when she said she was still scared?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Well, it's not really going on with me, but often you lay all the groundwork, you think you've dealt with all the objections... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...and then when you actually make the change, (making noise) up comes another objection that wasn't dealt with.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And this is why we do all this road testing, we do all of the testing. And by the way, this is a page straight out of Virginia Satir. To watch her film, she's continually suggesting ways to communicate within the family and saying, "Now try this out. And what does he say back? And now switch positions." And she's doing all this stuff. It's basically the same thing, only here I'm just doing it in her mind.</p>

<p>CARLSON: So you didn't feel a sense of failure, like, 'I haven't done my job.'?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh, no. It's just part of my job to deal with objections. And see, I respect objections. I believe that at this point, if I had forced her to change that position and she went out in the world, the next time she encountered this guy she'd be scared and she'd feel vulnerable and probably would be vulnerable. I don't want to do that. I want to send her out into the world bulletproof. I want to send her out to it, so when she sees her ex she feels good and solid and she can talk to him and she can use eye language and she can, if he yells at her, she can just let it wash off like water off a duck's back.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I want her to be bulletproof.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And so I, when an objection comes up it's like, "Oh, good, here's another one."</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah, let's clean this one out.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Because that's part of the solution.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, what we're going to do in our final clip is, we're going to watch the closing segment, and we'll get an idea in this piece, just how bulletproof she really is. [1:52:25.2]</p>

<p>[Video]</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...layer of protection? Now if you go back to the original thing, the thing at the... </p>

<p>MELISSA: School?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: The school thing?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: What's it like if you go back and do that? Because that's where we started. [ - silence - ]</p>

<p>MELISSA: It's just calm.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: No problem?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Just stating, "Okay, is there any way around this?" "No, there's not. You have to do this." "Okay, thank you very much. Have a nice day."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: All right?</p>

<p>MELISSA: Yeah. (big sigh - chuckling)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Looks like, it looks good. I mean looking at your body and your breathing and everything, it looks, it looks comfortable, right?</p>

<p>[Discussion]</p>

<p>CARLSON: Wow! What a dramatic change. If we took that first piece... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yes!</p>

<p>CARLSON: ...when she came in and was so riled and here at the end it's... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Well, and that sigh of relief... </p>

<p>CARLSON: ...no big deal.</p>

<p>CHOSE: ...it's like whoa!</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: She looks good to me.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: I mean ultimately, the real test is in reality.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah, clearly.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: And you don't, you never know for sure. Some other part could pop up. There could be some other objection. People don't always think of all the different aspects of things. You're doing your best with the person who is here and ultimately, the real road test is out in reality.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Is it pretty common that the person comes in with one issue or one problem and then there's something underneath? Because...she start out with this... </p>

<p>CARLSON: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CHOSE: ...very minor kind of registration thing and all of the sudden there is this boyfriend then.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Yeah. Well... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Is that a pretty common thing?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...sure, often that's the case.</p>

<p>CARLSON: And mother, too.</p>

<p>CHOSE: And mother, too.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Sure. Now you call it a minor thing. She's, but she responding. I guess she yelled and screamed, and I don't know what she did, but she saw it as a real problem. And she's probably got other problems. There are probably plenty of other pieces of work she could do. But this is, when I asked her..., "What change would you like to make today?" That's what she came up with, so.</p>

<p>CHOSE: And do you think that making some peace with the boyfriend would then affect other types of, I would guess they would, other types of... </p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh, sure.</p>

<p>CHOSE: ...encounters that she, too?</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Oh, yeah. And she had a whole list of them. It wasn't just the registrar... </p>

<p>CHOSE: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: ...there were other people in her life where she'd been blowing up and getting angry, and it should generalize to all of those.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Okay.</p>

<p>CARLSON: Well, thanks for giving us some insight into some processes that we can use as we encounter the clients in our future. Thank you Steve.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Thank you.</p>

<p>CHOSE: Thank you, it was great.</p>

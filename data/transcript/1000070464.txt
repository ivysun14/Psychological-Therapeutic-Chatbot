<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client 1923, client 1923-018, session number 2, session number 2, January 26, 1971. Client 1923-018, session number 2, January 23rd.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she goes right to bed, and she gets up, next day the same thing. I don't see how someone can stand that. Well, she was a student for a while, she just couldn't take it anymore. And she was pharmacology, (inaudible at 0:00:38.3) she was supposed to work at. And so she - and see, she could have had a couple of different (inaudible at 0:00:46.7). So she just took this one, was just selling chemicals to the drugstores type things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she's doing pretty well. She had never (inaudible at 0:00:57.7), she was slowing becoming really good at selling, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she's taking more time off, she's not knocking herself out like she was in the beginning. But they didn't give her hardly any training or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was sort of (inaudible at 0:01:12.2)?</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, (inaudible at 0:01:14.3) sink or swim. Do you have the Kleenex?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I spent the last ones mopping up the (inaudible at 0:01:18.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll just - you know...0:01:25.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you're going to need some I could get something next door maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's all right. (Inaudible at 0:01:33.0) quietly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something weird happened this weekend. Discussing my - I was talking to my father. And my father and I often times have discussions. And I'll say something - he'll be listening and I'll say something. And he takes what I've said out of context. And he'll start on his own little train of thought. And we're talking about two, just different things. Like, he can't understand that he switched subjects on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we were talking about the fact that boy - boyfriend - my boyfriend, the guy I'm dating right now. It's very frustrating because you knock yourself out to do something for him, or look, you know, especially nice some night or something. And even if he's around and you get compliments from other people (inaudible at 0:02:29.6), you know, he just doesn't give compliments. Some people are like that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No matter how much time you spend standing in front of the mirror adjusting yourself, and here everything looks just perfect. (Inaudible at 0:02:40.5) [bold slap from him] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's - you don't know whether he just doesn't notice or whether he just doesn't say anything, you know. But - and I was discussing this, how frustrating this is for my parents. 0:02:54.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my father got off on this other tangent about how it doesn't matter how you look, it's your personality that counts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is true, basically, but that's not what I was talking (inaudible at 0:03:06.8). It's - that's true - true though it may be, it was not in the line of thought that I was using. (Inaudible at 0:03:13.7) is how frustrating it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and he missed the point.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your point.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But what was frustrating to me was the fact that I think I (inaudible at 0:03:24.9) cry. I know this has been something very frustrating me, I've had several times in my life when I really wanted to (inaudible at 0:03:30.7). Recently, I started crying for no reason, which is a complete about face. Usually if my dad and I are going down these separate paths, and I can't get him to come to my side, and I (inaudible at 0:03:44.5) to see that, you know, I agree with him but that's not what I'm talking about. I'll just shut up or get mad, one or the other. But I never get upset.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm standing there and all of a sudden I felt these tears coming out my eyes. (Inaudible at 0:03:59.5) I'm going to cry. No, can't do that. But the same thing happened not too long ago at work. So, I've done something stupid. My boss was very understanding. I think I'd probably have been better if he's yelled at me. It was something really dumb, a stupid mistake. 0:04:19.7</p>

<p>I wasn't thinking when I did it. Did he yell at me? No, he says, "Well, you know, we can all make mistakes," and very nice, you know, and oh, I almost cried there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was something about his being so kind to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah. It was kind of like, you know, if I'd had to defend myself, I could have, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I felt bad, you know, and so he didn't want to make me feel any worse because he knew I felt bad, you know, so he was going to be on my side. And that really made me feel like, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like crying. But - and it all started when I met Jay, basically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've also never realized (inaudible at 0:04:56.0) I've never cried in front of a guy. I've been with him - three times I've been with him, I started crying. And one time I just - I wasn't even realizing I was going to cry. I was talking to him and all of a sudden he says, "Are you going to cry?" I said, "I think so." I hadn't realized it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it was that much of a - like, you didn't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I had no idea (inaudible at 0:05:22.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't know what started it. You weren't feeling sad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't, well, I was feel - I wasn't super happy with the situation. I was trying - I was going to tell Jay - I was trying to think of how to tell him. But it wasn't a situation that would really upset one in (inaudible at 0:05:40.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wasn't that big a deal?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, uh-uh, it wasn't that big a deal. But I don't know (inaudible at 0:05:51.6). So, you know, I think I'm going through a second adolescence (inaudible at 0:05:54.4).</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which I don't usually have. But I don't know, it's not like - the only time I've ever really cried in my life for no reason - been able to cry about myself and then I didn't (inaudible at 0:06:12.2) why, was, like, during my periods.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I'm more emotionally unstable, you know. Like, not that time. None of these times that I've been upset have been during my period, though. So that's something that's really - I'm trying - why is this that I'm doing (inaudible at 0:06:35.6)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, it doesn't fit and it doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, and there's nothing - I thought it was just - when I was around Jay I thought maybe I was growing up or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's happened when I wasn't in that (inaudible at 0:06:53.2). One time I was discussing him, but I had the feeling that what was upsetting me was my father and not Jay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Do you remember what part of the discussion upset you? 0:07:08.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was frustration. I'm trying to get him to understand that that's not what I was talking about. Not going to say, yes, daddy, you're very right but I'm not talking about personality, I'm talking about - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, you were talking about how frustrated you feel, and he was off on another track. And you - just couldn't make him see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was talking - well, it was, you know - I was talking about how frustrated one feels when you knock yourself out to look nice or to do something for somebody, and they don't acknowledge it, you know. I don't want it sky written, you know, thank you very much barber shop for doing this. I just want, you know, a nod or thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, we appreciate it or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To show that you exist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something that shows that they are aware that, you know, something has been done for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they appreciate it, you know. And daddy kept saying that, "You don't really have - it doesn't matter how - you know, how you look as long as you look clean" or something like that. "It doesn't matter if you're ugly or beautiful, you know, as long as you got that bubble and that sparkling personality." You know, just bubble. And I was saying, "Yeah, dad, you're right." You know, so he says, "Don't worry that much about how you look," you know, if what he's trying to tell me, you know. And he was trying to be helpful. 0:08:40.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, this is what - it's so hard not - get you mad at him because he's trying to be helpful, you know, he's trying to help you. He's not criticizing, you know. I notice when I - about the third or fourth time I explained it to him, then all of a sudden I feel my - the face is kind of puckering up. So I - made a hasty exit to my bedroom, excuse me please. I didn't cry but I thought I was going to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Had to take off so you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like, this is something strange. This is something, like I said, this bothered me all my life that I didn't cry very much. I wasn't subject highs and lows.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then all of a sudden, I'm subject (inaudible at 0:09:27.0) lows every once in a while. Not really lows, I mean, I've never felt that depressed when I started to cry, just snuck up on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As though your mind was somewhere else and you were just going along, and then all of a sudden...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From somewhere else the tears come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, very strange. (Inaudible at 0:10:00.5). But Jay and I played my mom and dad cards this weekend. I always use the cards. My mom always wins. My mom and I were partners and we slaughtered them. 0:10:23.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very satisfying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, very satisfying. I really enjoyed it tremendously. I'm afraid I wasn't - I didn't flaunt our victories or anything, but I'm afraid I wasn't a very good winner. I didn't just sit there and - well, I'm glad we won, smiling. You know, I was, yay. But I didn't bother my mom and my dad. I don't know whether it bothered Jay or not. I don't think so because Jay and I have played cards on several occasions. He's always just slaughtered me.</p>

<p>So I really don't think, you know, doesn't even bother him that much. He is really frustrating, though. I don't know. I've never been - I've never had that many boyfriends, and I've never been very good at handling men. And I really like Jay and I was going to try. If I really knew the mistakes [where I've made] (ph) with other men, I would try not to make them with him, I think I told you last time that I'm anxious. My brother told me that I was too anxious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But - so I was very calm and cool Saturday night. Well, I wasn't very calm when we were playing cards, I was having a good time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And you had a really (inaudible at 0:11:42.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, part of the fun was the fact that I'm not very good at playing cards, and I did - I did a couple of really good moves when I was playing, you know. And I was - hmmm - almost broke my arm. But I don't know, he's very frustrating because he just - I'm supposed - I'm going to see him tonight because I'm going to help him sell raffle tickets.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm seeing him tomorrow night because we've got a date tomorrow night. And he left Saturday night and he said, "Well, bye." Didn't say he had a nice time, didn't say, "I'll see you Tuesday or I'll see you Wednesday." He knows I'm going to see him both days. Didn't say, "Well, listen, I'll call you," didn't say anything. Just said, "Well, goodbye," this is the way he always leaves.</p>

<p>And it's so frustrating because I know I'm (audio gap). He says, "Well, bye," (inaudible at 0:12:55.7) there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wondering if he's ever planning to come around again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah, right. It's so funny because most of the other guys I've gone with, I can tell. I mean, it's kind of a feeling, a sixth sense when, you know, I'm not going to see him anymore. I kind of have that feeling. I haven't had that feeling about Jay. And yet, at the same time, you know, it's just - if I called him up, you know, and ask him if he wanted to come over, he'd either say yes if he wanted to or no, he wouldn't or didn't, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:13:28.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: He wouldn't come over if he didn't want to. But I just - you know, I really like for him to, like, call me. But it just - you know, I wait about a week. If I don't hear from him after a week, I - I give in, you know. I'm strong for about a week (inaudible at 0:13:52.4) so frustrating. I've never known a guy that, you know, that - that - most guys, you know, are more than anxious to get out conflicts, you know. And he - you know, I give a pretty good backrub because I - my grandmother taught me when I was a little kid. And I used to do it during finals when I was in college. Kids would come and knock at my door and want a backrub three o'clock in the morning the night before a final, you know. So I'd charge them a dollar and give them a backrub. 0:14:22.1</p>

<p>I often made my train fare home from college that way. And I give pretty good backrubs, you know. And (inaudible at 0:14:31.0) was giving Jay a backrub one night, you know. And, oh, about a week later we were up skiing and his back was hurting him after skiing, you know. And so I was giving him a backrub and his roommate was sitting there, you know. He was laying on the bed, now (inaudible at 0:14:50.7), said, "What are you doing?" I said, "I'm giving him a backrub." I said, "I give pretty good backrubs, don't I, Jay?" And he said, "Well, they're not bad."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's like this, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's something I've done well, you know, he'll say, "Well, she's not bad" or "It wasn't bad," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He just will not give a compliment. He won't even go so far as to say, "It was nice, wasn't it?" He would even go so far as to say, "Yes," you know, "It wasn't bad." And I don't know how to - I don't know if I'm looking for compliments or anymore than most people do. More than just knowing that what I - especially if I've knocked myself out, was appreciated or even noticed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, (inaudible at 0:15:37.0) this is something I don't know how to cope with because I (inaudible at 0:15:39.7) before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's very frustrating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he just won't give up with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know, but if he's - he's shy in some respects, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this could be part of it. I mean, like, if you don't know him, he won't say much of anything, you know, he doesn't talk very much or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless you know him. And I - and I wanted - I don't know. Ever since I met him, he told me he was shy, you know. But the first day I met him we were at dinner and we were talking, we just sat there and talked, you know. We were talking back and forth. We were talking to some of the other kids around (inaudible at 0:16:22.8), a, dinner with the ski crowd. And ever since then I've had, you know - I never - he keeps telling me he's shy and he's quiet. And I don't see it, I mean, as far as - when I think someone who's shy, I think of someone who's shy and quiet, sits there in a corner and doesn't say anything. And Jay doesn't do that. 0:16:43.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's never done that around me, you know. And - but other tell me he is shy and quiet, you know. But I think this is probably where the shyness and the quietness does come in, you know, is it's not....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anywhere of himself, you know, he's just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Stay behind this - I think part of it is two different approaches, I guess, to about the same problem because his personality and mine are a lot alike, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're kind of loners without wanting to be loners, but kind of liking it sometimes but not really. Does that make any sense? But - and I think his answer to it has been his reaction to it, you know, coping with it. But he gets really depressed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just like I do. We have a lot of similar problems. But - and I think that's partly just, you know, not wanting to give any of himself out, you know. I don't know if it's for fear of getting hurt, from shyness or, you know, if you extend yourself out very far (inaudible at 0:18:02.4), put your hand out to help somebody, they'll step on it or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and maybe that's what's happening with him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it still leaves you - I'm not quite sure but missing something or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And frustrated, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you get to the point you want to ask him, "Did you notice that I did this?" "Yes, I did." "Did you appreciate it?" "Yes, I did." "Well, thank you," you know, or "No, I didn't" or something, just to pin him down and ask him if he noticed, you know. But I don't do that. I just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what's frustrating, not to know that - whether or not it even registered.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's part of it, you know. I don't know if it's just I want someone to pat me on the back or blow some horns or something, you know. I don't think so, though. I think it's just that - I just - well, everybody wants to be appreciated I think. 0:19:11.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just that I want to be appreciated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:19:16.2) [sleeping again] (ph). Excuse me, I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:19:42.3) are frustrating [all the way] (ph). I think I'm (inaudible at 0:19:50.3) bully. I'm (inaudible at 0:19:52.8) idea because Jay is what is known as bowling net. He's in four leagues a week. He bowls three hours on Monday night, three hours on Thursday night, and he's on two leagues on Friday night, one of them is early and one of them is late. It's a bowling night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it just so happens that I started in my campaign to get me - to get me out of the house that I started at the beginning of this year. I decided I wasn't going to sit around anymore. My boss is in a bowling league. He wanted to know if I wanted to join a bowling league, and I said, "Well, sure," you know, as long as you don't have to be good because I'm certainly not good. 0:20:42.7</p>

<p>And so this has been a kind of a close (inaudible at0:20:47.6) between Jay and I. You know, he wants to go bowling and practice bowling, but doesn't really want to go by himself. He knows he can always - I'll always go, you know, because I like to bowl. And I do like to bowl, it's just that I get so frustrated when I bowl. I get up there and I'll concentrate. And I really care, I'll concentrate. And for a while I was getting slowly better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then when Jay has helped me on a couple of really good games, you know. But lately I just cannot - a goal aspect. We go with Monday after a whole weekend of skiing, and I couldn't have lifted that ball (inaudible at 0:21:21.1) so I didn't go. Before that I went. And I get up there and I do exactly what I think I'm supposed to do, and it doesn't work. It's the same thing that a week before when I was bowling with Jay worked beautifully.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Little things, you know, and I keep doing it wrong and I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I get so frustrated, you know, when I see sitting there, is this game ever going to end? I want to go home I'm bored with this game.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's something that, you're doing it exactly right and it's going wrong and you can't find out why, and there's nothing you can do that will change it. You just want to get out of there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's so frustrating, you know. And - because, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make sure that (inaudible at 0:22:11.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, it's just like, I feel so stupid. I mean, these little kids can bowl. It's like when you go out - you're out on the slopes and you're doing your snow plow down the hill trying not to kill yourself, and trying to go slow. And there's these little kids, you know, starting from three and four all the way up who are just whipping down the slopes like pros, you know. Like, Jean Claude Killy looked like an amateur or something like that and you're sitting there. 0:22:32.5</p>

<p>No, not there, but bowling - my average is 110. I've been bowling for - since December and it's now almost February. And I started my average was 90. Now, I should have - and it just makes me so mad. You know, if I was bowling - if I had an average of maybe 120, 130, something around there or 140 and I bowled my average one night, I wouldn't feel bad about that. Bowling 140 is a good game. When you're bowling your average, and your average is 110 and you're trying, you know, it's about the time you want to give up the whole thing. And I'd give up the whole thing, then I'd think I'm a quitter. Going gets too rough and you quit. So I don't know what to do, I've been thinking about quitting. But then I don't really want to because that's the chicken's way out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just - it's just so embarrassing. Nobody else on the team really minds, and nobody said anything to me. It's so embarrassing for me personally to get up there and really be trying hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not like I was goofing off. It's not like I didn't care. It's not like I wasn't concentrating. I'm standing up there and I'm thinking about all these things I have to do. But I have so many things that I do wrong, that I have to think of about five things at once, you know. And all I got to do is forget one of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then the ball just, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Goes down the gutter.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it seems like the thing that really is frustrating - every week I develop something new that I have to correct, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not that I've gotten rid of some of the things from the other week. I'm just adding on, you know, replacing it. I'm adding it on. Like, last night something I've never done before. I forgot to let go of the ball about three times, you know, and the ball is up here before it finally go - it just goes flying down the alley, you know. And everybody...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Every week you discover a new mistake you've got to worry about not doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, and it's frustrating. If I was curing - you know, if I, like - (inaudible at 0:24:52.4) new and next week and two weeks later I've cured it, and go on to bigger and better mistakes, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's improving, you know, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you can't get anywhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, quote that because it's, like - what, the other girl on the team was saying something about, it's like being in Alice in Wonderland, hurry up and run - she going nowhere, you know, run as fast as you can and going nowhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:25:16.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I think she feels the same way I do because she's a better bowler, but she averages about 125 or something like that. She hasn't been doing that hot either. She isn't (inaudible at 0:25:30.9). She's going on vacation. She and her husband (inaudible at 0:25:41.3) going to Hawaii. I told her to bring back some sunshine (inaudible at 0:25:48.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:25:51.4). I don't really have to go out tonight (inaudible at 0:26:12.7) to help him. And I was talking to Meg (inaudible at 0:26:20.2). And she said that I shouldn't go and see if he says anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm trying to decide whether or not to go or not. I really should stay home and wash my hair. And I really should stay home and wash the kitchen floor. And I don't know, it's just - I want to see him. I know I'm going to see him tomorrow. But he hates people who say they're going to do something and don't do it. He's always mad at this other girlfriend of ours who's in the club and everything. She's always late and it makes him mad.</p>

<p>Now, I didn't - I just ask him if he needs any help, and (inaudible at 0:27:10.9) any help he could get would be appreciated. And if nobody comes in tonight, there's going to be too many people there. There's a lot of people coming tonight from the club. He's going to need some help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:27:29.8) kind of like to see him, so I'll probably get him and go. Come home early and mop the floor or something (inaudible at 0:27:35.1) awake. You wouldn't want to buy a ticket for a free ski trip, would you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:27:41.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Don't you ski?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do a little.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a free entire weekend free for a dollar. (Inaudible at 0:27:53.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:27:59.8) attempt to try and see what - will it have any effect on him if I don't go? You know, will - you know, then will he notice? If he doesn't notice when I do things, will he notice when I don't do things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what the hell do I have to do to have an effect on him anyway?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's so funny because my mom mentioned something to me. Sunday afternoon she says, "Don't hang any hopes on Jay." And I said, "Why?" She said - first of all she said she didn't think that Jay was my type, you know. And I found out later she was just covering up because Jay is a nice guy, but he's not that emotional, you know. And she just didn't think that he really liked me that much, you know. And I said, "Well, first of all, I haven't got, you know, any long term future hopes." I just am enjoying and being frustrated, but enjoying having the male companionship for a while because I haven't had any for a while. I just enjoy it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:29:06.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's fun to, you know, go to a show or go bowling or something with someone other than the girls. And she said, you know, he just doesn't show much, you know, outward enthusiasm. But I really - in something like this you really don't know because - it's because he isn't going to say anything. I don't think he's say anything if I didn't show up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless I was supposed to, unless I was absolutely supposed to show up there. He might say, "Where were you?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But since I just offered, he might not say anything at all, which again is frustrating. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But he might think something. He may have thoughts on all of this. It - you know, I don't think that he's so impersonal that just all of it goes around him. I'm pretty sure it isn't because he doesn't miss much, actually. But he just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You aren't going to hear about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I'm not used to that, I'm really not. Always been around people, you know, that have something to say be it good or bad, but they say something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, not this sort of blank wall.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Especially because with me, you know, because I need some reinforcement all the time, you know. Not fanfares but just a little, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, a little compliment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah, a little reinforcement from whoever I, you know, working for. Like, you know, if I was just going out somewhere and look nice, I don't expect anybody to tell me, you know, but - unless Jay - the only thing is that, like, as far as looking nice, you know, mom said, well, maybe he just - you know, if you looked bad he'd tell you about it. Maybe he just expects his women to look nice or something, and he wouldn't say any - you know, it's just something his women do. (Inaudible at 0:31:40.4) or something, I don't know. 0:31:41.2</p>

<p>The only compliment he ever gave me was the fact that he finds that I'm so easy to talk to. He's never known anybody that was so easy - as easy to talk to as I am. He finds himself telling me things that he wouldn't tell (inaudible at 0:32:07.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Talking - basically, talking about things. He, like, opens up about things that he wants to talk about that he's never been able to open up to anybody else before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He did say that once, that made me feel good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but this is - you know, something's on his mind and he wants to talk about it. So if he was ever really mad at me, and cared enough about met to tell me that he was mad, I think I'd hear about it because he says he can't talk. And any problems he has anywhere else, problems that were (inaudible at 0:32:50.9) I hear about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Frustrations at work and stuff like that. I probably know a lot more about him than most people do because he does talk about himself, you know. Still won't commit himself on anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's like, as a person, like, he is very open to (inaudible at 0:33:16.2), maybe it's as a woman he isn't so open?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:33:21.1). I don't know. I don't think this is something he's just started recently. I think it's probably the way he's done it, you know. But I can't help but wondering if part of it - because I'm sure he'd have to be awful well trained to sit there and say - want to say to himself, "Gee, you look nice tonight" and not say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's something - it's not something he's just doing recently. It's something he's always done, but he just - he was going with a girl who had a young daughter. She's been married, like, [two sixty or something like that] (ph). I think she was a year older than he was. And (inaudible at 0:34:08.3) he was supposed to get married in December. And he really liked the little kid, but they didn't get along well at all.</p>

<p>You know, I mean, like, he - all she wanted to do was sit at home. He doesn't like to sit at home, he likes to go out, you know. If he wants to sit home, he can stay home with his parents, you know. And but he liked - he didn't - she just wanted to sit at home. She wouldn't go dancing. He doesn't even ask me to go dancing. I could go dancing (inaudible at 0:34:36.9).</p>

<p>But she wouldn't go dancing with him. And she - I don't know, she wouldn't, you know - she wouldn't go skiing, you know. She got on skis once and almost fell down, said, "No, that's it," got off of them, you know. Jay took the little girl skiing all the time. And I guess he laid down some laws to her, you know, like, "The kid and I are going skiing, if you want to come and watch, you can. If you want to come and ski, you can," you know, but, "Don't cry when we're gone because we're going," you know, "And you could have come if you wanted to." (Inaudible at 0:35:14.4).</p>

<p>She went out and ran up a bunch of bills and (inaudible at 0:35:18.7) the bank had a lien on all of her checks or something because she had a bunch of bills. And so he called it off, which is, you know - I would think if they'd already had the date set and everything, he will - he would know things like that or something, or she must have been really rotten or something. (Inaudible at 0:35:41.4) sort of had the feeling, you know, that she - I don't know why he did it. You can't really push Jay into that much I don't think.</p>

<p>Like, I said - I could call him, you know, and take the initiative to call him and ask if he wants to do things, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if he doesn't want to do them, he won't do them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if he does, he will, you know. It's like, he doesn't mind - a lot of guys don't want girls to call them I've heard, but Jay, like, doesn't mind, you know. And - but I don't know if you could push him into anything he really didn't want to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but I don't know he ever got - I always wanted to ask him that, but I didn't think I'd better. But they had the date set and everything. It was so funny, the first time - the first time I was really with him at any time by ourselves, we were - he picked me up off the slopes. I was skiing, the first date we went on I ski - first day of our first ski trip. And I had fallen, which was not uncommon for me. And I was getting up. And he stopped and he said, "Can I help you?" And I said, "Well, I'm having a little trouble with this maneuver here." And he said, "Well, listen, let me help you," you know, I said, "Great," you know. 0:36:58.0</p>

<p>And he just kind of took me in tow and we went up and down the hill a couple of times, and I was - I had spent probably the whole entire week before the ski trip thinking, now, what kind of a devious - and I got together with a couple of my girlfriends who real good at laying these plots. And I said, "Now, how are we going to trap this Jay?" And they - we thought - they come up with ideas, "No, I don't like that one." "No, I don't like that one," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought I'm just going to give up, you know, and just - just - this lost cause. And it just happened accidentally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and he took me to lunch, you know, and he just said [what he raised] (ph). You know, he kept saying, "Well, are you ready, you know, to go back now?" "Are you ready to (inaudible at 0:37:43.2)?" "Do you want to ride back on my bus with me?" Things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just happened that was so nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's so funny, the more I know the Jay, the more I like him, and the less he turns me on physically. That's weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:38:06.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's really weird because it should go, you know, the more you like him, the more he turns you on, right? No, it doesn't happen that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For some reason he doesn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's - like, I have all kinds of weird defense mechanisms, and I think that's one of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something you do too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a defense mechanism against getting in trouble. It's, the more I like a guy, you know, I just kind of mentally, the less he turns me on. This is the other thing that I figured out that could be right or wrong because I don't know for sure. But this is - you know, I really think it's like a defense mechanism against doing anything that I would regret or getting pregnant or something, you know. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something in you that sort of damps down on sexual feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah, and it really is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get in over your head.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yes. It's the same thing if I'm - I'm making out with a guy in a car. I can't get really turned on, you know, if I was sitting on somebody's couch or something. You know, with all my clothes on I can get really turned on. But in bed I am a total bust. I cannot - can't do anything. I can't even get excited.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's a mental thing, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think my mind is what got this little thing, you know, as long as you don't climax, you haven't done anything and you're still a virgin, and you haven't done anything wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is, you know, this is stupid. As long as you're going to do it you might as well enjoy it. 0:39:59.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, when you have all your clothes on and stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:40:02.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just - yeah, no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Say, you know, I don't have to worry about anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it can be exciting and stuff?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of get a little stiffer when (inaudible at 0:40:13.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's really (inaudible at 0:40:18.6), you know, sit there and talking to myself (inaudible at 0:40:25.0), calm down, relax and no. This is something else that's frustrating too, you know, because this - it's like a - I don't know, I think it's a hangover from the fact that I'm a Catholic. You know, and it's just something you don't do and all this stuff. And it's very frustrating. But I really think, like, my mind is mentally locked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was reading - I read (inaudible at 0:41:01.6) an except in a woman's magazine, like, Dr. Rubin and, you know, things - 101 or a thousand questions, or all the questions you always wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask your doctor. (Inaudible at 0:41:15.2) about frigidity in there, you know. And he said most women - frigidity as they, like - not just told (inaudible at 0:41:26.7), but, like, just don't touch me. But - which - well, I thought frigid women were, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's not that, it's just people who can't climax, who can't - and he said a lot of it is a sub-conscious mental thing. He says it's very common in Catholics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh. So you saw that and thought, "Well, that sounds like me."</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that sounded like a good idea. But it was an idea - excuse me, it was a hunch that I'd had before that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just, you know, I just - all these hang-ups that I've got, mental hang-ups. (Inaudible at 0:42:13.5). Things that I (inaudible at 0:42:25.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Under the sex thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, before that, I was talking about...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Talking about Jay and, like, the more you know him, the more you like him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, yeah, my built in defense mechanism. It's like crying (inaudible at 0:43:01.7) an ability to cry is a built in defense mechanism (inaudible at 0:43:06.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, um-hmm. 0:43:06.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's disintegrating now. That's something else that's frustrating, not being able to do it is - not being able to cry is, like, I - just - it's a defense mechanism that I built up. And it's not that - I mean, it's not that un-understandable, you know. It's like, the reason why you don't cry is just won't let yourself, you know. On the other hand, the more frustrating idea is, I'm crying, now why am I crying?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is what I recently got. Oh, I was telling you last week that nobody ever calls me. And somebody called me this weekend. And now, I'm figuring out - I'm trying to figure out why. My girlfriend, Alicia called on Saturday night when (inaudible at 0:43:55.4), but which, like, Jay was coming over so I (inaudible at 0:43:59.9). But I hadn't heard from her in about - I've seen her once in about three weeks. And I know she goes up there all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she doesn't - she doesn't mind going up there by herself because she knows, you know, ninety percent of the people that go - the regular customers. So she can go up there and she'll always have somebody to talk to. Whereas, if I go up there, you know, I'm supposed to meet her there at ten o'clock, you know, so I won't get until 10:30 because I know she won't be there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And hoping she's early, and she won't get there until 11:30. I just kind of sit there knowing maybe half the guys than are more people in the bar. But not really wanting to - you know, once I say hello, how are you, I have nothing to say, you know. And if they're together, two or three of them in a conversation, I could probably join them. I've done this before, but I just, you know - I don't really feel like I've got anything to contribute, or if I do have anything to contribute, I'm always afraid I'll get big-mouthed about it like I have a tendency to do. And so I just kind of sit there (inaudible at 0:45:06.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:45:10.2) I don't know, (inaudible at 0:45:13.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's safer.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, so she's got all these people she can talk to, you know. And why she called, you know, I don't know, unless she was - I don't know. She wanted to talk to me I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh, yeah. She called, she didn't need you or she can do it by herself. But she did call.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm wondering if she wanted to maybe talk about something, (inaudible at 0:45:46.0) the club or she could be having trouble with her boyfriend or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To talk about it. I guess (inaudible at 0:45:55.1), you know, we used to have a good time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did it make you feel good that she...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, good and then I started wondering, you know, I wonder what she wanted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because she could have - you know, wanted to talk about something. She didn't sound upset, though. I'll find out (inaudible at 0:46:25.3). I still don't know whether to go up there tonight. I'm tempted not to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:46:38.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm tempted not to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a mischief in that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's kind of like, you know, I'm tempted not to, but if I don't go, am I going to make him mad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then do I want to make him mad?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's so funny, he doesn't, you know, plan future dates, you know, like, "Listen, let's go do something next Saturday night," you know, ahead of time. He doesn't do that at all, you know. Like, we probably wouldn't have been together Saturday night if I hadn't asked him, "Do you want to play cards?" But he plans - every once in a while he'll make future - he'll make statements that - you know, like, he's not going to drop me and (inaudible at 0:47:34.7) future, like - we play cribbage. My dad's got this little cribbage board you can take on travels with you. And he gave it to me, you know, so I'd have a cribbage board in my apartment if Jay came over. And Jay saw it and says, "That's great," he says, "We can take that on all of our future trips." You know, future trips we won't have to do without a cribbage board again, and will I forget one, you know. Things like - little things like this, you know, like - you know, and he said something about, you know, like, water skiing in the summer and stuff like that, you know. He makes reference to future events. 0:48:15.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, he's thinking about staying around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know, but - and I don't want any - I don't want any commitments, though, you know, I don't want any because I'm not ready for anything like that, you know. But, and yet, I don't know if I'm going to be - if I had - you know, it's like if I hadn't said something, I wouldn't have gone out there. I wouldn't have been with him Saturday night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Spend the night playing cards with my parents or something, by myself. Oh, as things stood, the other calls - I probably would have been up there. But I don't know, it just - I don't know if it's because he has really - he's got - he's saving money for several different things. He bowls well and he (inaudible at 0:49:09.1) games - with the money games when he's bowling. And saves the money from the money games and that's what pays for his ski trips.</p>

<p>And then he's going to go in the tournament in April or May in Portland where he wants to (inaudible at 0:49:32.5) some time with (inaudible at 0:49:33.4). And he wants to practice bowling, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he's practice on the bowling (inaudible at 0:49:38.6) and he knows I like to bowl, you know. Why he doesn't ask me to go bowling, I don't know. I've got - you know, I've got my own equipment (inaudible at 0:49:46.2) renting bowling equipment isn't as expensive as, like, renting ski equipment. But I just - from what I've heard about other things that he's done on dates, you know, he does ask girls to go on regular dates.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, to go to the movies or something like that. And he does - he's made a couple of comments to real nice places he's gone to eat and stuff like that. He's never asked me to go (inaudible at 0:50:18.2). Now I don't know if it's because he's broke. He's saving his money for the tournament and for skiing. And, you know, I know not too many people have too much money anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:50:31.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Christmas bills and insurance is coming due right now, and everybody's saving their pay in case they have to pay more on their income tax and stuff. So - well, like, he also said that some weekend - he told me that as soon as he can save enough weekend, some weekend the two of us just were going to go skiing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I thought, "That would be great." But he hasn't said anything about it since then. It's been about a month since he came up with the idea, and he hasn't said anything since. Now, I a couple of times wanted to bring it up, but I haven't because there's two reasons, either he's forgotten, if he's forgotten I don't want to remind him. (Inaudible at 0:51:11.6), but I think he meant it when he said it. He probably remembers or two, he just hasn't got the money right now.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know he hasn't got very much money. I don't want to bring it up, you know, because I don't want to push it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:51:24.1) and, like, if it was just that he didn't have money that would be all right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess you're partly - you're asking, like, is it something else that he doesn't want to take me out to a nice place for dinner?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah. This is nothing - (inaudible at 0:51:47.5). That's another thing, I've decided I want to lose some weight, you know. I always thought, you know, if I had a good reason, like, Jay is a very good reason. I can con (inaudible at 0:51:56.1), even if I didn't think he was a good reason, I'd be conning myself into thinking he was a good reason, you know. But I just cannot get started on a diet. I am the world's greatest procrastinator in the first place.</p>

<p>And (inaudible at 0:52:12.1) get on the scale and very - (inaudible at 0:52:14.0) why I don't lose weight, but I haven't really started and it's so hard to get into it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And again, I think this is another one of my defense mechanisms. I always telling you before that I thought, you know, that - in the back of my mind, if I do lose weight and it doesn't do any good, you know, then what am I going to be, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Am I going to essentially unworthy instead of, you know, just I'm worthy for this little thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: External.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know if I've got this idea in my mind, and this is the reason I just can't get going on a diet or what. This is something else, I really would like to lose weight. I think it would be a lot more comfortable and everything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For some reason you just - there's sort of an inertia or a hump or you just don't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Inertia I guess, yeah. I just don't, you know. I have all these books and I plan. And I'll periodically go out about every three weeks and buy all the food that I need, you know, the right type of food. You know, I went out about two weeks ago and bought the right kind of vegetables, you know, fresh vegetables instead of canned vegetables and some fresh fruit. And - because, you know, so I'd get balanced diet, you know, all the things you need, so I didn't buy any potatoes or anything like that. 0:53:42.1</p>

<p>And I don't - I've never had a potato in my house. I don't ever buy potato chips or Fritos or cookies or cakes or candy or pie or anything like that. I've never had any of that stuff in my house. The only thing that I do buy that's got starch in it is bread, you know. And I don't eat that much food. I'll have one sandwich for lunch. I'll have a piece of toast for breakfast with some coffee or something. And for dinner, I'll have some meat or something like that, you know. I really don't eat that much.</p>

<p>I bet in one day I don't even consume that many calories, you know. And I don't lose weight. And part of it is what I eat, the way I eat, not getting the proper vegetables and stuff like that, you know. But I'm not unhealthy. It just gets frustrating, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know, it's, like, I never have time to cook anymore. I used to be a good cook. I don't eat that large a quantities of food either. It's just very frustrating. I've got to try to get it straight in my mind, you know, why I want to lose the weight and everything, you know, just to make me feel better. That's difficult (inaudible at 0:55:04.1). But all these ingrained hang-ups, you know, that I've got well planted in my subconscious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: These ingrained hang-ups like not wanting to lose the weight do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah - you know, that was - oh yeah, there are two others that I told you about that I - you know, if I lose the weight it won't do any good, so I might as well, you know, not lose the weight or something like that. Or at least if I keep the weight on, then I've got an excuse that I can - a tangible excuse. The other - you know, things about, you know, the more I like somebody, the less they turn me on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the best (inaudible at 0:55:56.7). I think there are defense mechanisms, I don't know. I mean, this is what I have decided that they are, ingrained defense mechanisms.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have made several decisions as to this is this, and this is this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right, yeah.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. The way you describe the various things, like the weight and the more you like guys, it's not like there's these little blocks in your life or something, and blockages or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I should lose weight, but, you know, it doesn't happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, not only I should lose weight, I'd like to. I really - you know, I really want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if you want to bad enough, you ought to be able to do it. That's the theory, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But hearing you want to and it doesn't carry over into doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. I think if it wasn't so expensive, I'd do something like go on Metrical for two weeks or something like that. (Inaudible at 0:57:22.2), you know, but this is so expensive. (Inaudible at 0:57:29.4) when you figure the price of whatever you eat for a full day, it's not that much more expensive. I might try that for a week to get me started (inaudible at 0:57:40.5). They've got more Metrical than just the soup (inaudible at 0:57:46.3), you know, just the stuff they had five years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But every time I started on a diet, like, there's this one diet where you just eat meat, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I am basically a meat eater. I'd much rather eat meat than anything else. And so I thought this is the greatest diet in the world for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, this is no problem at all, you know. And I like cottage cheese, you know. (Inaudible at 0:58:14.0) meat and cottage cheese and fish, a protein diet. Well, this ought to be the easiest diet in the world for me, you know. No problem at all, right? Well, I stuck to the diet religiously. And about the fifth or sixth day I get these horrible pains in my stomach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:58:31.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I went off the diet for about two days, and I had some vegetables and some salad, you know, with my meat. And then I went back on the diet again, you know. And then I got the pains about the second or third day, you know. And I kind of decided, these are psychological pains too, you know, because the diet started working, you know. So they could be psychological pains that I couldn't stay on the diet. You know, so I wouldn't stay on the diet, I don't know, it's weird.</p>

<p>And I don't know if it was some of the physiological or psychological. I don't really know because I've heard of people staying on that diet and having no problems at all. But I really like the idea of it because I would much rather eat meat than anything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the idea of just eating straight meat, you know, no protein, meat, fish, eggs, cottage cheese. It was a good idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I should quit for now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. [Trying to find my purse] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to come in at five, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If we're going to do it this week, it has to be tomorrow or else something like eight o'clock Thursday morning. But I can't come in at five on Thursday or Friday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then I'm going to be gone for a week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, Wednesday is fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got a date Wednesday night, but it won't be until eight o'clock.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I'll be gone at six, that's no problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. (Inaudible at 1:00:49.1) 4:45 maybe?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure, that's fine. (Inaudible at 1:00:57.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 1:01:00.2), you know, I would almost even say 4:30, you know. But that's when I - because usually I'm - like, last night, yesterday I was through at 4:30.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 1:01:11.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: But usually I'm through earlier than that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I really can't say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ahead of time, yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 1:01:24.7) cold outside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How cold was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it wasn't so much cold as the wind really got to me. You know, I'm walking out with no socks on, no shoes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah, right.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah, your ankles must have been freezing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not my ankles so much as the bottoms of my feet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My ankles don't have any nerves in them I don't think. I don't have any muscles in them, I know that. I got the weakest ankles in the world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're ice skating?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't ice skate, I really can't. That's another problem (inaudible at 1:02:16.0) problem with skis, in fact, you're supposed to set your inside edges when you're snow plowing or something. And my ankles, you know, I turn my feet and my ankles just kind of...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: My legs will be going right and my ankles will bend. And I have my feet out where they're supposed to be, you know, and my legs in and my ankles are out, skiing flat. Tomorrow at 4:45?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know the (inaudible at 1:02:50.1)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, bye-bye.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See you tomorrow.</p>

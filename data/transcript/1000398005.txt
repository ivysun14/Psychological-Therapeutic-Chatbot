<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) Well, I was thinking when I came in that I was uhm, aware of feeling nervous (sniff) and I think I have been well, the latter part of the day.  Uhm, and, and I was thinking of it in terms of the fact that there are a lot of things that were kind of connected with Halloween that I wanted to do at school.  And now that that's over, uhm, I just kind of felt nervous about school too, as if well, there's nothing I can do now, or that I felt unsure of uhm, being able to plan things to do, or something.  I don't know, I mean, it's kind of crazy, because it's really not true.  But yet, that's the feeling I have right now. </p>

<p>And then, I realize that when I was on my way here, and it must have been what I was thinking right before I just started thinking about feeling nervous, was again, this whole thing that I was talking about yesterday, and uhm, just uhm, wondering exactly what I wanted to do about it.  And also, well, when I got in here, I realize I didn't, re—, I don't think I uh, am sure of what I had been talking about that might have been part of the whole situation.  Uhm, (sniff) but I w—, well, MSCZ spoke to MW yesterday, and they had asked earlier in the evening before the things occurred that made me feel so unhappy, uhm, if we could join them to do something on Friday night.  And they're doing this with another couple who are coming into the city from uh, PAIO.  And we've met them before.</p>

<p>Uh, we had said we weren't sure, and so MSCZ had told MW we could join them for part of it.  But not u—, s—, they're eating dinner first, and then they're going to a, quite a late show.  And uh, we have to go out of town on Saturday, so we didn't think we'd want to go to the show.  Uhm, and MSCZ told MW, I don't know what, I mean, they didn't discuss anything else.  And then, today I spoke to FNI, in part because there's a job opening at LKC, and I didn't know whether she'd be interested.  And then uhm, I just wanted an excuse to call her and I ha—, I still hadn't decided about calling specifically to apologize, or not.  So this seemed to make a good reason.  And then I just said I enjoyed the dinner, which was true, because it was very good.</p>

<p>And uhm, but she asked if we were going to join them on Friday, and I said that I guess MW hadn't told her, but that we had talked about it and felt we could join them for the dinner, we'd like to.  But that uh, since we had to leave early the next morning, we could not, we didn't want to go on to the theater.  And she seemed to be kind of cool on that, but might be — I always assume, or FNI's cool when we don't do exactly as she's planned, and so maybe I'm just imagining it.  But it was almost getting to be reminiscent of my saying I had to leave early on Saturday, because of the dentist appointment Sunday.  That was one of the things that got kind of blown up when they wouldn't accept our leaving. </p>

<p>And uhm, (sniff) so I don't know, on the way here I think I was just thinking about it again in imagining meeting them and wondering whether it would be uncomfortable or not, and whether anything more should be said, or a joke made about it.  Or uhm, (sniff) I don't know, I think, I think I was feeling that as long as nothing's said, it kind of remains very much in everybody's mind.  Uhm, and yet yesterday, I think I was feeling for me to apologize certainly the way I was thinking of apologizing yesterday, would make it worse.  So — (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   The other possibility is, that there's more here than just the surface facts of what happened and the way you feel.  And that it occupies you because it has some other meanings.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh) Yeah, I think, I think it must, because, well, I don't even think it would have happened, if it didn't.  And uhm, I think I'd probably have some feeling of what to do about it, if it didn't, too.  So that, or, that it just wouldn't seem so difficult to handle.  But uhm, I don't know, I just can't seem to get at what else I'm seeing in it.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>Or, well, I mean, I think of it this way, I guess.  That I'm aware of feeling very much on the defensive, and I'm not quite sure what I'm thinking I'm defending myself against.  (Sniff, 3-minute silence, Sigh)</p>

<p>Well, I'm thinking about FDO cooking, and, and uhm, I just don't quite see the connection.  Except I'm feeling uncertain, because this is the first time, well, she's cooking something that she and FSO will eat, and then MSCZ and I will eat.  I mean, it's just a roast.  But uhm, she could leave it in and really cook it too much, and uh, or I don't know, I just — and then I was thinking of the fact that I hadn't suggested other things for their meal.  And, so I'm hoping she'll, (cough) I ha—, I had said before that she's welcome to use whatever she sees that we have.  But then I'm thinking, well, I didn't mention anything about vegetables, or fruit, or anything.  And so, I hope she'll use her initiative in that respect, which I'm quite sure she will.  But yet on the other hand, I'm feeling uncertain.  And uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well I think before I thought of that, I thought of just uhm, FSO and, and the way my feeling has changed toward her recently.  In that uhm, well I'm, I handle better times when she's a problem, and then, so I don't get so impatient with her and so upset, and feel she's so intrusive, or whatever it was I was feeling before.  And uhm, and then as a result, we both enjoy each other more.  And uhm, well and then I was thinking about tonight she didn't want me to go.  But I think it is due in part to the fact she really is quite sick right now, and uhm, it's not unusual for her to find this time hard for me to come. </p>

<p>But then uhm, I think I had mixed feelings over trying to help the situation so she'd turn easily to FDO.  I mean, I wanted her to, and yet I didn't want her to.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was just thinking about the fact that I have this feeling of thinking of things at home, I mean I'm doing now, what sometimes I do with school.  That (clears throat) even though FDO's fairly new with us, I really don't feel uhm, very tense about the whole thing.  Or, I don't know, I just, things are going well and so there's really, I mean there are some things I don't know about yet, and I have to wait and see.  But uhm, I, I just feel as if I'm looking for things to think about there, so I don't think about something else.  And it must be connected with why I'm feeling the way I am about that incident on Saturday. </p>

<p>And I just uhm, (sigh) I don't know, it even seems like I can only think about that whole thing in 1 way, which keeps me at thinking about how I felt then, and uhm, how I can undo, how it seems to me I can undo what I did.  Uhm, which I've already talked about.  And I, I, it seems like I can't seem to get at what might be behind it, or uhm, (Pause) or at least that I know yesterday when you said that maybe it had s—, to do with uhm, things we'd been talking about the end of la—, or, during last week.  I couldn't remember, or I can't now remember what we were talking about, and yet I know I did, over the weekend.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>Well, and then I remember uhm, one of the major things, which was thinking about uhm, being a psychiatrist, and whether or not that was an attempt — while I was thinking about possibly stopping someday — to not stop seeing you, or not stop having to do with you in some form or other.  And uhm, (sniff) well, this was on my mind this weekend, too, and I don't know, I don't think we talked about it last week, i—, I mean, in itself.  Might have been implied, but uhm, I think of it now again, and I know I was this weekend. </p>

<p>That one time when I was talking about being unable to respond to MSCZ, or this sort of responding — after that first time when we came back from vacation when it was more of an emotional response — now being more of a physical one, and not being able to have again that emotional feeling.  And or, or I don't know, maybe it wasn't in context with that, but uhm, in any case, I think you suggested that I was still letting you get in the way between MSCZ and me, or my feelings for MSCZ. </p>

<p>And uhm, well, it just seems, that it's, takes me back to a time when I just, well, especially like that spring after FSO was born.  I, I don't have that feeling now so strongly, but, of uhm, I mean, now it just seems like more, well, you do come between us.  But then it was more really turning to you and turning away from MSCZ.  (5-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm thinking about the school, the school, and I mean, thinking about the children in the class.  And it seems like 1 angle of it is thinking about that I have conferences coming up, and so I have to uhm, know certain things about them because of the reports I have to write for the prospective schools they might be applying to, that I don't feel in some cases that I know that much about them.  And so I'm wondering how in the next week or, I mean, in some ways I have to know immediately, because of these things I have to fill in by Friday.  But uhm, that isn't quite as important as the final reports.  And so I have a little time, but what is the most effective way to, for me to find out, uhm, what I need to know. </p>

<p>And, and then just thinking about 1 or 2 children in particular, like one who's uhm, well she's the daughter of the, one of the ministers there.  And uhm, she's clearly immature and so forth, but for awhile she was kind of getting involved in the class program.  And now, as the others are becoming really quite involved, she's getting more and more uninvolved.  Or at least she stands out more. </p>

<p>And uhm, the last day or two she just constantly asked when school was going to be over, and when she can go home.  And I don't know, it just seems like she's regressing right now, so I was thinking about that.  And uh, I don't know, maybe feeling I am, by having such trouble thinking about what, yesterday it seems like I was saying I really wanted to think about.  (Pause)</p>

<p>In fact, it seems like maybe I've, I don't know quite why it would be, but, that uhm, I mean, I still want to find some way to resolve what I still feel is a problem, but yesterday, I think I was feeling much more that I want to know why I had reacted the way I did.  And today, it almost seems like I've turned away from that.  (5-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uh, I was thinking some more about how I can approach the conferences and all the written stuff I have to do, and some things for the different individual children, and I don't know, things I can do in the classroom that uhm, all these things I know it's silly for me to think about now.  And then it, and then I was just thinking that uh, in thinking about having thought of that one child who seems to be regressing to me.  And then, I don't know, that, then it occurred to me well, maybe I'm feeling I am.  And then just now, I was thinking of that again. </p>

<p>And then it occurred to me that uhm, I don't, I don't quite know what the thought is, but it has something to do with the fact FSO's birthday's coming up.  And my recalling the feeling I had the spring of her first year.  And uhm, I don't know exactly what it is, unless I, I guess the thought was, I was wondering if somehow, I'm kind of reliving it again, or uhm, afraid to, or afraid I might, because of her birthday coming.  Or uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, and I guess I was thinking of this in connection with this.  It made me wonder uhm, because I, I've felt as if there has been a connection before.  That I've been having hemorrhoids again, and it sort of, lately, instead of clearing up they just seem to be sort of continuous.  And not nearly as bad as right after FSO was born.  But uhm, enough of a problem, so that it sort of makes me wonder why do I keep having them, and is everything all right. </p>

<p>And uhm, then also along with this, or maybe even before it, I've had a rash that would get worse whenever I had my period, and it started — I've never had this, well maybe once or twice I had just a teeny bit of a rash like this, and it would go away soon as my period was over — uhm, but since this summer it seems like I've continuously has this rash, and it would get worse with my period and then almost disappear.  And then get worse again.  And uh, I've been due for a checkup with Dr BBB, so this is something that I wanted him to check.  And I did try to make an appointment with him, but he can't have appointments until middle of November, so I have to try again.  But it's one of those things that's very much on my mind. </p>

<p>And then, uhm, I don't know, at some point it just seemed to me that something about the way the whole thing felt — having the hemorrhoids and the rash — or something about it either reminded me about when I was pregnant.  I knew at the time, I can't remember now just what I was thinking.  And this thought occurred to me not too long ago, maybe a week or 2 ago.  But uh, either right, while I was pregnant, or shortly after FSO was born — but I think it was while I was pregnant, and I can't think now what uhm, I don't know, but — just somehow, th—, something, I'm reacting to something about, because of what time of year it is, or uhm — (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, this keeps coming to my mind, too, and uh, i, it, well anyway, it is right now, and I think it did earlier, and it was on and off my mind during the day, uhm, because this morning I left before FSO woke up.  And it really bothered me, partly because s, she was sick, so that I w—, I don't know, it just concerned me that I hadn't seen her to see how she was.  Uhm, but I didn't want to wake her up, because she didn't have a good night last night.  So I thought it was more important that she sleep. </p>

<p>But then today when I was home with her, it seemed like, v—, it was very much on her mind the whole thing of s,s, saying good-by, and coming back, and everything.  And she's done this a lot since I've been working, of playing out saying good-by to me, and then coming back.  But today in particular, she was really doing a lot of it, and uhm, and then she got upset when I did leave. </p>

<p>So I was thinking, well maybe — partly because it's FDO's still new to her — it was, it would have been better for me to wake her, even though sleep would have been good for her.  Just so that uhm, because she can accept in the morning my turning her over to well, FMC, before, and then yesterday she accepted FDO very well.  So that I don't know, I, I guess I'm just wondering if maybe it really upset her that when she woke up, it was FDO who came in and not me at all. (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm planning what I want to do here, because I was just thinking about whether or not FDO's cooking the roast well now, and uhm, which is about the only thing I can possibly work up into something to w—, and it's not even exactly worry about, but think about.  Because I really do feel quite confident in her.  And uh, and if I don't think about little things at home, then I, I find that what I want to do is think about little things at school.  And it's uhm, (sigh) well, and then I feel I'm wasting, I don't know whose time, whether I'm feeling really more yours or mine, or both.  But uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well I guess I feel that about wasting time, mainly.  Because I'm remembering having really cared about why the thing had happened on Saturday, th—, as it did.  And uhm, and it's not so much feeling that now, as remembering that I had felt that it, that it was important to me to understand it, that makes me feel I'm wasting my time.  But on the other hand, then I feel as if well, I really want to not think about it, and uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Oh I guess what then it comes down to is, I want you to do something so I don't feel this conflict.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, just w, when I was saying that, I had the feeling that uhm, for the first time today I was really getting at something, that at least I'm feeling right now here.  And uhm, and then as soon as I said it, and I was somewhat hesitant to say it, I think, uhm, then it's as if I couldn't continue to think about anything, because then I sort of stopped and waited. </p>

<p>And uhm, at first I wasn't thinking now I'll wait, directly, but it's almost as if that's exactly what happened.  And uhm, (sigh) almost like well, I don't know whether it's turning it over to you any responsibility for getting anywhere with this, or if it's uhm, just something I've, in effect, asked you to do something.  So then I'd wait and see if you would, or, or just what.  But somehow, it was as if I blanked my mind out right after I said that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.

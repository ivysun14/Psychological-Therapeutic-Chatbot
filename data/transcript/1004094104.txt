<p><b>8 Family Sessions</b></p>

<p><b>First Session with mom before starting family work (first 30 minutes)</b></p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>What are three adjectives, or any three descriptive phrases that you might use to describe Heather?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Precocious...funny...stubborn.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>And if you could just tell me a story or anything to sort of illustrate these qualities?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Well, it was so funny, over the weekend we were with my mother-in-law, and my brother-in-law, who is very close to Heather, was talking about one time when she was two years old, and they had gone for a walk.  So they were walking down the street, and she was still in a diaper and everything, and she just sits down and says "Well, shit!" for no reason, just because, and he was like, "OK!" and they went on.  So she just sort of comes out of the blue with things that you never would expect for her to do.  And if she sets her mind that she isn't going to do anything, she won't, like clean her room.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>OK, so what are some of her favorite activities or hobbies?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> She likes to bike ride, roller blade, skateboard.  She loves to play with little kids.  She's really good with little kids, and she's really patient and considering that she's an only child, that's really good because she wasn't really brought up around any small siblings, which might be why she likes them because she never really had to fight with them. She likes to read too, and watch horror movies. She's addicted to Smallville, Superman, and comic books and stuff.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>So what activities is she involved with in school and the community?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> At school, she participates in drama, and also in track.  She had participated in the YMCA soccer but just when it got to the point when all the kids were a little bit faster and it became a little more competitive it just wasn't her thing.  She's much better at running and kind of competing with herself as opposed to others on a team.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>What are some specific things you want people to know about her?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Mainly that she's a very auditory person.  She does well if you explain things to her as opposed to just handing her a sheet and say "Here, do it".  She's not afraid to ask questions which is really good, if she doesn't understand she will clarify so you need to keep in mind that she's not going to be the one going "Yeah, yeah" or not doing her work because she doesn't get it.  She will come and ask you what to do.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>OK, talk about a time when Heather has done well at school. How did she react to her success?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> She got accepted into this program where they look for academics, or children who are academic who can possibly go on to bigger and better things, and they give opportunities to children to do things and she was very excited about that. She took a lot of pride in being chosen for that.  And even though there were a lot of other students who were in the program, she still felt very individualized by it.  She didn't feel like "oh other people got it" and "this isn't special for me" she took it like this is really good for her that she did it.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>OK, on the flip side, talk about a time when your daughter had a difficult time with school.  How did she react to this difficulty?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Before we determined that she had dyslexia she had such a hard time with spelling and reading and she would get very frustrated and she almost gave up on learning because she did get so frustrated.  It was the "I can't do it" and "I'm not smart enough" and that type of response which we really had to try and overcome.  She did do a lot of self-correction with that because we didn't determine that she was dyslexic until she was in the sixth grade.  So there was a lot of learning time where she had to do self-coping and deal with it.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>So would you say that the most difficult time she has had with school was before she was diagnosed?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Yes, before she was diagnosed with that and we were able to implement some modifications.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>How would describe Heather's overall attitude to school and school activities?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Oh, she loves it.  She loves it.  Well, she wants to be a teacher when she grows up so she hates to have to miss school.  She really likes it and hates missing school and if she's not feeling good then she'll try and get one of us to come back and get her later so she can be here.  And I don't think that it's just for the social aspect of it, she enjoys learning things.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>Talk about a time when you, as a parent, have had a difficult time with your daughter's school?  How did you handle this? </i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> I guess the time when I was trying to figure out how to help her be less frustrated before the dyslexia was diagnosed.  We really didn't have many...I mean I guess we've had a lot of good things.  The only time it wasn't an academic frustration but when Heather was in kindergarten the principal put her on the wrong bus and they lost her.  They couldn't tell us what bus she was on, she didn't get off at my mom's and it was the first time that she had ever ridden the bus so it was a big treat.  It was terrible and it was all we could do not to go up there, go up there, and get angry, I mean worse than we did.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>What do you feel they should have done or said differently?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Well, besides put her on the right bus, well the bus driver was pretty much telling her that she had to get off of his bus even though she said that it wasn't where she was supposed to get off so she stuck to her guns and it made me feel good that she knew what she should and should not do if the adults around her failed in that respect.  The principal could have been a lot more empathetic with us and how we were feeling with having her lost and with it being the first time on the bus and things like that.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>What do you feel are Heather's main support networks and talk about those networks.</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Of course, the first one is immediate family.  Anytime that she has a problem with homework she will holler at her father or myself.  Usually she comes to me first only because I am still taking classes myself and work at the school and I have had exposure to the various curriculum that she is taking.  But if I'm not there her dad helps, except for math, he hates math so they have to wait for me.  She also has her teachers that she can call in the evenings, or she will stay after school for extra help.  She's doing that today actually to get some help on some things and her friends are very good.  She's got two or three friends that they will routinely talk if they are having homework problems which makes it really nice.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>And what about emotionally and socially, what do you feel are her biggest support networks?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> She and I are very close, being an only, well she's not an only child but she has an older brother, so she's the only one there at home and I'm an only child so we can relate to each other on certain levels in that respect.  She also is very close to her uncle and she can talk to him about a lot of very delicate subjects.  He is...has an alternative lifestyle I'll say, and we've never sheltered her from that so she gets a full range of people that she comes in contact with which I think helps with creating an understanding that people are different and tolerance needs to be there.</p>

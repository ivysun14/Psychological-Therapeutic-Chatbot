<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence, Sniff) I was thinking about, uhm (Sniff), uh, well sort of feeling just generally nervous today, and particularly nervous about FSO, and the fact she's not getting, I don't think she's getting much worse, but it doesn't seem to me she's getting better.  She got better for a while, I think I said, and then the last 2 days it's been worse again.  And (Sniff) I think it's tied up with the fact that uh, MSCZ told me last night he has to go on a trip and will be gone tonight.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>And for some reason, being — and I don't, I mean I think ordinari—, well, I don't know about ordinarily.  It's not quite right.  But I mean, I, I'm thinking, well I don't want him to be gone, because I'll be lonely , or I w—, or if, what if something happens to FSO.  But I don't know, I think it's somehow connected with being left alone with her.  And it's not that he could do anything or that it will really matter, but (Sniff) — (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I w—, uh, I was just thinking about the fact that uhm, that this actually didn't make me late, because MYJ was late getting there.  But it would have made me late if he hadn't been. She had a bowel movement right before I w_ well, right when I had finished feeding her and was putting her down.  And it was right around the time when he usually comes, MYJ usually comes.  So I wouldn't have been able to — I was in the middle of cleaning her up. </p>

<p>But uh, I, I keep, I m—, I me—, right at the time it happened, I was feeling very distressed, because it seemed to be very liquidy and uh, I don't know, I guess I've always been afraid of diarrhea, or maybe (Sigh) because she's had this cold and all, I'm afraid of any new sign to indicate she's getting worse.  (Sniff) And so my immediate thought was, oh, so it's diarrhea.  Something horrible's happening.  And I got her cleaned up.  And then when I looked again to make sure, because I didn't want to get all upset if it wasn't — it was more liquidy than she's been having lately, but it didn't look as bad as I had thought.  And I don't know, I was just thinking about that right now.  And it's almost as if I'm looking for all sorts of little signs constantly, to indicate there's something wrong with her, so I won't kill her.  Because I, I'm afraid that otherwise I'll s—, miss them, and I'll kill her by inattention. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   I guess it really is very much as though you're afraid of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause, Sniff) And the other thing that's been, I don't know, I've been back and forth on it for 3 days, is calling her pediatrician again.  I, I actually called him once and couldn't get him.  And then I never made the call again when I knew he'd be there.  Because there are times when I just think things are really serious, and I have to call him.  And they're other times when I think that she's really not that bad, and, and I can't understand why I can't be more casual. </p>

<p>But I think what I really want, because uhm, one time when I think I, after I called him about the fact she had this cold and he told me what to do, then I had forgotten to ask him about things like taking her out.  So I called him the next day, and I'd been feeling really upset, and just by his saying don't worry, made me feel better.  And it's almost as if that's what I want to do again.  Call him, so he'll tell me not to worry, that I'm not killing her. </p>

<p>And I think that's why I'm so upset that MSCZ's not going to be there tonight, or that he — I mean, because he's not there during the day and I don't feel quite this way during the day, but it must be because I know he's within reach.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, well I, I, I do think about this, so I, it must have something to do with it all, that I'm denying.  Even though I know what I feel about wanting, wishing I'd had a boy.  But uh, I was just thinking that a girl I know who lives nearby, stopped today, and she has, well she's had 3 boys.  One, the middle child was, I'm no—, I don't know exactly what the trouble was, but I think there was damage at birth, and uhm, so I don't think he's living at home.  But anyway, she has a boy around 4, and then she has a boy a few months older than FSO.  And that one was with her today when she stopped by. </p>

<p>And among other things, she talked at one point about having had feeding problems with him, and how he, he had had diarrhea, which might have been what gave me, made me think about diarrhea today, more than I do usually.  And uhm, and she described it, and FSO's not anywhere near what she was describing.  And she also said she didn't think FSO looked that sick or sounded that sick, which at the time I found reassuring. </p>

<p>But I'm just not sure whether having her there with her son, has something to do with my feeling.  And I was very aware the whole time he was there, too, of thinking FSO's more pre—, appealing to me, more attractive to me, than the boy was.  (Sniff) And yet we both noticed how, I had thought this, and then she said it, that in a way, they look very much alike.  And I think it's more their coloring and the shape of their head and, heads and so forth.  But, I don't know, it was almost like I was constantly telling myself, I'm really glad I have FSO, she's much more attractive.  (Sigh, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And another thing I was doing, uhm, in connection with this woman, was, on the one hand — I mean, I, I feel this way when I see any child who's enough older than FSO so they're in a different stage, and yet, not so much older that I just don't even think of them in the same way — uhm, but, this boy was quite alert, looking around and able to sort of play and do some things when he was awake.  And FSO actually, is beginning to, but not really very much yet.  So on the one hand I was thinking, that I can hardly wait till she's older and can do more, as this boy.  And then on the other hand, I kept thinking, I'm so glad she's little and small, and the way she is right now, as opposed to him, because he was quite a bit bigger.  I mean, j_ just as any child would be quite a bit bigger at several months more.  (Sigh)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, what does that mean to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, just somehow I feel as if I'm d—, I was trying to deny something about this boy, that I convinced myself that everything about FSO is so much better.  And it mainly must be that she's a girl and he was boy, and I don't know, I think I must be feeling, I really — again, I m—, it was just making me feel again that I really would have preferred to have had a boy, or I want her to be one.  So then I spend that — all my thoughts, or convincing myself that I like her the way she is.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about something else, too, uhm, I remember just, I mean it was just yesterday I was talking about how I thought FSO's name was, I mean, I felt funny about it because it was, in my eyes, something that was sort of foreign to my family.  And uhm, today I got a little note from my father's sister who's very much of uhm, I me—, I must have mentioned her here, I d—, I don't remember, but my father supports her, but other than that, I think he'd like to have absolutely nothing to do with her.  And, because uh, she's got different interests.  She doesn't really have very many interests.  I haven't seen her for a number of years.  But, uhm, she always was different in my eyes, anyway.  And, uh, I don't know, just, her taste is quite different, and she had an illegitimate child, which is what made my father so upset.  And then, just the fact she's different anyway, makes it impossible for things to ever be forgotten, I think. </p>

<p>And, in this note she was acknowledging FSO's birth, and then said something about the name, that she liked it.  And then went on to say that — I didn't know that she'd ever hoped to go on the stage, but apparently that was one of her dreams that she'd had when she was little — and she said that was the name she would have chosen for a stage name.  And I don't, I don't know, I don't know if my father knows this.  At first it struck me funny, because eh, it wouldn't be an association I'd want to have with FSO's name, anymore than I think my father would.  But I don't know, then I just began wondering if my father knew, and that if he had any reaction against the name we chose.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How did you happen to, how did it come about that you chose it?  You mentioned yesterday one of the ideas, but was it yours or MSCZ's?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it was sort of both, uhm, I can't remember where I came across it first.  It was a book FRU GNA, and in it there was a character by the name of FSO and she was called FSOZ.  And I always thought that was sort of a nice nickname.  And then, it was a movie that had been made of that book, I think the book was BGJ, and the movie was "MGM", or I think that was the way it was.  And MSCZ had seen or read one, and I had seen or read the other.  Or else I know I'd read the book and I'd seen the movie, but I don't remember which came first. </p>

<p>And I think we were both talking about whichever we had experienced, and just we both were saying we liked the name.  And then we just never agreed on a name both of us liked as much after that.  But I don't know, I was just wondering right now if I were trying to, maybe I was just, by liking the name, which I felt I sincerely did, establish something, sort of assert myself in my family in some way.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>Because, because as her birth came closer, MSCZ and I both sort felt sort of (Sigh), I don't know, we both still liked the name, but we wondered if it would be, I don't know what word to use, but just sort of too much of a name.  Or — (Silence)</p>

<p>And I, I think I was, well I wasn't feeling this way so much until after we had named her FSO, and the thing was done.  But then, plainer names became much more attractive to me.  Or, or maybe it was just names that were more familiar to me.  Because, I don't know, even something like FYH, which is the name of the BFM's daughter was, I was beginning to think, well maybe that's better. </p>

<p>And that certainly isn't plain, but it's a name I've known people having.  And, but, I don't know, it seems like I — maybe MSCZ, too — but that I was trying to put, make the name carry something that it couldn't carry, uh, what I mean, I think, is if we had a girl, then I'd want to have a name that would be so attractive, anyway, in my eyes at the time, that it would carry the fact that here we had a girl that was inferior to having a boy.  So the name would sort of make up for this deficiency, in some way.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) You mean, this exterior sign would make up for the lack of the other exterior sign.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   A fancy one would be better, is what you seem to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.  (Silence) </p>

<p>The next thing I think is something that I just, I don't know, I sort of go around in circles on it.  Uh, because I mean, I start thinking, but why do I s—, think it would be so wonderful to have a boy, over a having a girl.  And, I know I've come across lots of things that would indicate why I would, but I suppose it's because then I'm thinking, oh (Sniff), I don't know, it's like I'm 2 people looking at it.  In one way, it is something that I feel would be better, and on the other hand, I'm sort of looking at it as if well, a boy's just another baby, and, another person.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I'm thinking about just imagining seeing a little baby lying there, and, and the only difference from FSO would be that it had a penis, and then I'd feel differently about it, or thinking that from all my other feelings, it would suggest I would.  And it made me think again about my reaction to intercourse with MSCZ since we've started again.  And, one thing that's happened, I don't re—, I mean, I think it might have happened to a very slight degree, before or especially right after we were first married. </p>

<p>But it's been happening a lot, I mean every single time we've had intercourse since we started again, it's happened.  And it's been very marked.  Is, I get, I don't know how to describe it exactly, some kind of a sensation of aching or something, in my vagina.  I think it's in my vagina, afterwards.  I mean, really quite strong, and I, I don't know, I haven't been able to understand it.  It hasn't made sense to me, and I've been assuming that I must be putting it on in some way.  Maybe there's some aching, but (Sniff) MSCZ keeps saying, well, you're using muscles you weren't used to using. </p>

<p>But I, I don't know, it just, after having had a baby, it just, I don't know, I just couldn't understand it that way.  Just now, I was just wondering if it has anything to do with, I don't know, thinking about first the baby having a penis, then of having intercourse with MSCZ, assuming he can feel something I can't feel, because he has a penis, or he has something more to be feeling things with, than I do.  And I, I don't know, it's almost as if I'm trying to feel something that's not there, or something like that. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Is that your idea, that uhm, the penis makes it possible to feel something that you can't feel if you don't have it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it is.  I n_ never talked about it.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm just thinking about how, uh, I, I just sort of thought about FSO again.  I don't know if in any special way, except just in, being the way she exists.  And it just occurred to me, I wonder if this antagonistic feeling I have towards MSCZ, I mean, I'm sure it's connected with the fact he has a penis, and I am jealous, or angry at him for that.  Uhm, and then it's almost as if, I mean, this is just another aspect, of how I'll see FSO then, because then it's just sort of the two of us against him.  We're both deprived, and then he has it.  And (Sigh, Silence)</p>

<p>And I suppose that's another part of wanting a boy, in that, if I produced a boy, even though MSCZ's the one that determines the sex, I would still feel that at least, even if I couldn't be a boy, I could create a boy. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   What did you say, even though MSCZ's the one who determines the sex?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhum.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What did you mean by that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I've always understood that the male, the sperm of the male determines the sex, not the female egg.  (Sniff, Pause) Or, that, uh, I mean more specifically, that I guess it's the chromosomes that — the female only has 1 kind, and the male has the 2. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   So then, it's MSCZ's fault that you have a girl?</p>

<p>PATIENT: W—, this is strange, because I kept expecting myself to really feel it was.  And maybe, and I don't know why I'd be suppressing it so much, unless it's all part of suppressing that I wanted a boy.  And my feelings toward FSO.  But other than that, I express other antagonistic s—, antagonistic feelings toward MSCZ, so I kept being surprised I didn't feel it more strongly. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   But you are angry at him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   You just don't know what about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know, it just seems because he's a man, he has a penis.   
ANALYST:   So he could have at least given you one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.  And I suppose that would be part of this thought I just had of FSO and myself being in a, sort of on one side against MSCZ on the other.  And I used the word, we're the two that are "deprived".  Well, he's the one that deprived her, and then deprived me by depriving her.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>But I think even if I do blame MSCZ, which must be part of it, but I still, but yet I still, uhm, I don't know, feel as if I had something to do with it too, more than just being the other half.  I mean that, as if I had something to do with the sex, too.  And that it shows a failure on my part that I didn't have a boy.  And (Sigh) or, or, I don't kn—, I, I — this seems more the way I feel — that somehow I feel more responsible than it would imply, if I'm blaming MSCZ for the fact that FSO was a girl.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

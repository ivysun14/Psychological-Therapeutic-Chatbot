<p><b>DR:</b> Which is good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's just out of the Air Force.  He's making, uh, 20,000 more than he did in the Air Force.  He's, he's doing wonderfully.  He's working 16 hour days, but he loves it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They, they, what they do is they weed out in the first year their people that are not committed to the company.  They work them to the bone and the ones that stay are the one s that stay.  He's staying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He does tracking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Don't you know what tracking is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I don't know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's where you, where you go down hudnreds of feet underground.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you drive sand in and you have little explosives and the thing explodes and it, it fractures -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then it, and then they leave it for a while and they go back down and they put in some lubricant or something whatever -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then they draw the oil out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, is this like the, um, not the shale.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's in shale.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All, it's like oil sands in the shale.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  All that stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In Colorado or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, he can do it anywhere.  There's, there's shale all over the place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, there is?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  As a matter of fact, there's a place in Maryland where they're doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he's helping, he's, he's got, he's got a girl he's seeing, he's been seeing for like, for 4 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they've been on and off, on and off, and she, her, her father has now given her, uh, 3 months to decide whether she's going to marry [NAME OTHER] or not, knock it off.  Her father has, uh, that's it.  You can't do this to [NAME OTHER] anymore, on and off, on and off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it's been on and off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Her father.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Her father said, "You're not going to do this to this boy anymore."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, well that seems -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She lives at home.  She's 30 years old.  She lives at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's very codependent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I was going to say, that, the, why should her father do that?  That's such a nice thing for -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very, very codependent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For him to, I don't know what -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's a good thing that he's done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I don't know what [NAME OTHER] would feel like if -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If she doesn't, he'll be unhappy, but he's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Working 16 hour days -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He doesn't have very much time to think about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he's doing great.  [NAME OTHER] is in the Air Force.  [NAME OTHER], uh, we are convinced, we are pretty much convinced that his wife is borderline, [NAME OTHER], seriously borderline, unmedicated and it's really a hard, a hard thing for, for [NAME OTHER].  But I'll tell you something, [NAME OTHER] is thinking about becoming a pastor.  He's in the Air Force now.  He's thinking about going after it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And this is going to happen?  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This will help him a great deal.  He's also been thinking about going in, getting his Master's in counseling like his dad did.  And I'll tell you something, he committed to the right person if he wants to learn about that stuff.  He und, totally understands her and he totally stands up to her now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what does she do?  Like she confronts him?  I mean, she, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She confronts him.  She's mean to him in public.  She's mean to him.  She talks down to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's like abusive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's very abusive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, but does she like, I mean, they can be, you know, they can, I mean, they do these testing all the time, like, knock on wood, she doesn't push too much.  Ha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She pushes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, the big -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's very contr, controlling to the Nth degree.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And nothing's good enough and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you can suck the life out of you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, it depends.  I mean, sometimes they can, you know, they can do well with it.  Actually, I have a very good friend who, um, as it turns out, I didn't know her until after she was through most of this, she had some kind of incredible psychiatrist, because, he, she, I mean, you know, at 1 point, she said, "Listen, if we're going to, you know, we're going to be friends."  She lived across the street.  Um, "You probably, you may not want to be friends with me.  You should know that I've been hospitalized at [DEIDENTIFIED]."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, choo, choo, choo everywhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, this is already in early 30s and I said, "Yeah, so."  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, this is what, I mean, that's, you know, what effect does that have?  And, you know, I mean, she was great.  She was this incredible artist, and 1 of her friends, you know, we had her do some, um, murals.  They're amazing.  Like, sports players in the kid's bedroom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, you know, and 1 of her, she said, at some point, "I got to ask you.  My friend says, you know, that, uh, you know, you're doing this because you feel sorry for me."  It's like, it's like, hey, it's like, I don't know if I feel for you.  You went through hell, but, uh, you know, I mean, I'm not friends, I don't, I'm not friends with people because I feel sorry for them.  And I'm not hiring you to do this because I feel sorry for you.  It's because I, you know, nobody else could do this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, you know, it's uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it was, it was strange.  I haven't seen her for a while, but, I e-mail her periodically, you know.  She's a very nice person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, [NAME OTHER] can be a very nice person too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, and she's very creative.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's a crea, extremely creative.  But, um, she just, she just out there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well she -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she's so self centered it's, you can't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She had, this 1 was a doctor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so abused.  I mean, her mother, she was like a piece of crap to her mother.  Um, and, and then it turns out, I don't know, she had been sexually abused by like, uh, adult neighbor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it was like, and then with the, the teenage years with the drugs and the this and that and crazy stuff.  Um, but she, she also was, you know, loved, um, I don't know folk music, Irish music -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which I happen to share that interest.  God knows where I got this from, but maybe my parents.  I don't know.  Not Irish music, but folk music.  So, who knows.  But anyway, she, when she was better enough, I don't know, she had a kid who was my kid's age.  She once said, "You know, the first day I met you."  We met at somebody else across the street's birthday party.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One of their kids.  She said, "You know, I'm, I'm, here I am, the first day I met you and you let me like."  I went to get something.  I said I was going to meet her at her house and she loved, I don't remember which kid, it was probably my middle 1.  And she said, "You just let me have them and take them to my house."  And I'm like, "Well, I don't know."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  I was, I was going to be there in 2 minutes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, it's not like, you know, I don't know where you live.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sounds like she was very damaged.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but she got, she was healed.  She's married to someone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're kidding me.  She was healed?  How do you get healed from that?  Is it medical?  Is it chemical?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, well with her, she had been on all sorts of drugs, but she, but it was literally, she saw a psychiatrist, sev, uh, several times a week, and I don't know what, she would tell me, like, she'd have no money at times and they bartered for doing clean, I don't know, whatever they did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But something, um, but, you know, they basically, he, you know, he stuck with her.  He was, you know, consistent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, I mean, that's 1 of the, you know, 1 of the ways of learning, relearning or learning what object of permanency is, you know, somebody who's there, who's stable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and um, you, I think she was hospitalized once after I met her, but, uh, you know, after a while, she, she treated herself.  She had all this skin removed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And now it just has 1 scar like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like this.  I think they just removed it and stretched it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She has to have like, I mean, literally -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All those cut marks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, yeah, but her older daughter is doing well.  And then she has her husband, who's actually quite a, he was a pretty well known, um, banjo player.  Gotten a couple Grammy nominations.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thanks.  Got some kind of this [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think, I don't know.  But anyway, they ended up, they moved way out to [DEIDENTIFIED] and then further out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Somewhere where they could afford a place.  And his wife died, um, of cancer, I think.  But, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so they have his daughter, and they just seem to be, you know, doing well.  Of course, then she had -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She had fibromyalgia and was like, God almighty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And needed, you know, no insurance for that, and was like oh my God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anyway, just a wonderful person.  Um, so there's, there are ways to treat this, and 1 of the things they're doing now is, is they're teaching, it's kind of like a Buddhist meditation type, it's mindfulness.  It's sort of removing yourself, you know, it's not like being aware of everything around you and experiencing it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's removing yourself and just being, experiencing, becoming the air you're breathing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's detaching yourself from the past and future, you know, and learning how to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like living in the now.  It's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's not even, it's not even in this, it's living in the now, but not even, sep, separate from some of the things going on now, but, sep, definitely separating yourself from, you know, the past experience of, you know, being disappointed because everything disappoints you.  Um, anyway, uh, you know, it just, it kind of depends on how severe and, these people, some of them are so needy.  They just literally suck the life out of you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's what [NAME OTHER]'s doing now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's really frustrating because [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He doesn't know what to do at this point because she won't get help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um, I mean he loves her.  He must.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He does.  Well he, you see, his thing is, is that he feels like God meant for him to be with her, and, uh, he can't, he could mix up that God made a mistake.  You see, here is the problem.  When they met -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] recognized there was a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I recognized there was a problem.  His brother and his 2 sisters recognized there was a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like she was, she was -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All his friends recognized there was a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Attached to him within a day and half and the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.  And everybody said don't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm getting, you know, fam, like, was she getting you guys fighting with each other?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Not at all.  We just all agreed that she was not a good idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's good.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he said, "But I think God means for me to marry her."  So, he did.  So it could be that, that what God meant was that he was to be the, the consistency in her life so that she could get better.  But, it's hard for him.  It's very hard for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  My daughter [NAME OTHER]'s is no better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.  No.  She's, um, [NAME OTHER] says she's borderline personality disorder.  And she has no, no, um, conscience about anything.  She has, she has no ability to think beyond herself.  Um, she won't acknowledge her mistakes.  She won't acknowledge that there are problems, her, problems with getting along with people.  So, it's always everyone else's fault.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's, yeah, but it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or it's, it's ridiculous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, I suppose it's possible.  Generally, there's no, you know, the parents, there's no, you know, there's no consistency, you know, so, uh, it doesn't sound like she'd be a good candidate.  It sounds like some of the, the behaviors, you know, are similar -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To somebody who might be borderline, but, but, um, you know, generally people that have some consistency growing up and they learn, something else is going on, you know.  I mean, perhaps she's, has a mood disorder that's, uh, you know, and, and, has just become rageful, and, and entitled.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she's going through a divorce and she feels like it's all his fault.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's awful.  She got the kids taken away from her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  The kids were sent both to him.  The, the judge said, uh, had a report done by [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she said that the kids need to be with their dad in the house and that [NAME OTHER] needs to move to the apartment where he was and they swapped houses, and she felt like she failed, which she had.  She's a terrible parent.  She's, I didn't raise this girl to be a terrible parent.  She, she won't bathe them at night.  She won't make them go to bed.  She won't feed them anything but Wendy's.  She won't insist that they brush their teeth.  All she wants to do is be their friend and make excuses for everything they haven't gotten.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, she's a kid.  She's a child.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's a child, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's, yeah.  That's tough.  I mean, that really is.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So anyway -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm not, but she call me and complains to me all the time, and now I've gotten to the point where I can say, "[NAME OTHER], I really don't want to hear it."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "You know what you need to do.  You need to get yourself in order."  You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And she won't, do anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's okay, you know.  But I've just got to say, you know, good luck.  I love her to death, but she's just really a mess and she won't get help.  She, I do not know.  She lies all the time.  I don't know what coming out of her mouth is true anymore, so, it's tough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you're doing the, well, the script is for 200 Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the 150 Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right and for the Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm just about out of the Klonopin and I don't have another um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We did the 3 month because I could order them from them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Oh, for the Klonopin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You gave me a 3 month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's not good anymore anyway.  All right.  Um, all right.  So we'll give you, we'll give you, the Lamictal, I think, it's, you know, through August of '09.  Klonopin wafers, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A 0.25 mg.  That should be only, they don't come in a 0.25 except the wafers anyway, so, [INAUDIBLE].  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I think I'm okay for Wellbutrin, aren't I?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think not.  I mean, I think, I haven't writ, I wrote the Wellbutrin in February.  The Lamictal I wrote again because we did something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We changed it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Changed it.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You made it so that I could, I could -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Cut them in half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, but that's fine.  But, I mean, just the, with the Wellbutrin -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We didn't rewrite since February.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you, you don't need it immediately but you will soon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll send in the company and they just put it on file.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  [DATE].  Lamictal 1 p.r.q.  I mean, Wellbutrin number 93.  And they're sending you the generic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guess that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Generic.  Can you believe it?  Isn't that great?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: So ... I was mugged on Monday. On 22nd and Broad going to visit a client, and I got into the elevator and a man got in after me and he got off at the second floor and he came right back on, right before the door was closing and he had like an ice pick or something and he said, "Give me all your money or I'll kill you." And so I was like, "Okay, don't kill me just give him the money!" (laughs) So I got out my wallet and I was starting to get the money out and he just grabbed the whole thing. He took the whole thing, he pressed the sixth floor and he said, "Get off the elevator and I'll kill you" or "Get off the elevator OR I'll kill you," he said something like that. So I got off on the fourth floor where I was supposed to meet with the client and I had never been there before so I didn't ... and some of the apartments weren't marked. So I was running around the floor looking for 43B. Bang, bang, bang on the door. She wasn't home. I was, like, so upset! "Damn you!" you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At that moment, I was feeling really nervous and afraid because he had just gotten down, had gotten off two floors below me. There was like ... this was just such a deserted building. It was just really, really deserted. And so these people ended up bringing me into their apartment and I called the police ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: One of their neighbors.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They heard you banging?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I had actually banged on their door too, because I wasn't sure which apartment, so I ended up banging on their door and I said, "Where's 43G?" And I was just like, "Bleah!" you know, "I'm just a little shaken up because I was just robbed in the elevator." And so this man said, "Well that's 43G." So he closed the door and then I was like banging and banging and then he came again and he's like, "Come and talk to my wife," because he didn't really want to deal with whatever, but his wife was very nice. And so they called the police for me and so that was that. [0:02:27]</p>

<p>And then yesterday I went to a demonstration in Pratt institute (ph) (inaudible) for the program being AIDS (ph) (inaudible) national program and the day-treatment program, which isn't the Medicare, funded one going on the Governor's proposed budgets. And so we went for a demonstration. And I got back a little bit later than I expected - 9:30 - I walked through the door and my mother's like, "Oh my God! I've been so worried! I've been calling all these people." She called the work beeper number and she talked to one of my co-workers. She was trying to get the number of the executive director.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that in reaction to you having just been mugged the day before?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How'd you feel towards her when she was like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of felt angry because it was like 9:30. I was like, "Mom, you know, I'm 27 years old. I walk through the door at 9:30 and you're like fit to be tied?" I mean she was like a wreck. And I ... Jason had called me and then she was telling him, "Oh my God, you know, la-la-la!" And then she tried to call Jason back because she thought he might know Steve's last name because I've talked about Steve and then she was going to call Steve. And I'm like, oh my God!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little over-involved.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's been ... it's [Ryder Cup] (ph) today, I mean that's quite a street fair! Today was okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Today was okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So far, so good. Okay. Okay. So how are you ... I mean, that's quite a couple days. [0:04:14]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Today I definitely felt like ... a little stressed out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that ... so you guys ... you do visit in some pretty rough neighborhoods. I mean, you do it up in Queens you go 22nd and Broad. I haven't been to 22nd and Broad, but I can imagine that it's not the nicest part of the city.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That particular area is just really not cool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you ever nervous going there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never been to that exact building but I've been to other buildings that are not good, and I've never ... probably in the beginning I was like, you know, a little bit nervous. And then for the last two or three years I've been doing it, I haven't felt really threatened. I mean, I've walked down blocks where I'm so sorely out of place as a white woman walking down the block. I remember this one man was talking to this woman hanging out of a window. And he stopped his conversation and he just looked at me and laughed. You know, he was just like, "You are so sorely out of place!" He was just like ... thought that this was so funny and I just kind of looked at him and I was like ... you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean, I've never had a problem. And tomorrow I go away to (inaudible). People think I'm weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To go away alone? Which people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was telling Steve that I was going away, and he was like, "Whom are you going with? A friend or a bunch of friends?" I was just, "No, actually I'm going alone." Then he was like, "Oh. Do you know someone there?" I think I probably talked about a friend in South America. I chose not to live (ph) with him. And I said, "No, I'm just going alone." He thought that was kind of interesting. And then we were talking yesterday when we were having lunch before Jen Tinsley and my co-worker Luke who went to Pratt yesterday and (inaudible) going, "Wow, two weeks!" I'm just like, "It's just one week." He's like, "Aren't you going to get lonely?" It's just like, "No." And Luke was telling us, you know, people think I'm weird, you know, for going alone. But I'm you know, I'm (inaudible) spend time by myself, whatever. And Luke was like, "Well, I think it's just really courageous." I was like, "All right. Thank you." I didn't say it like that. I was like, "Well he considers that, you know, positive, whatever." [0:07:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, see my sense is you ... that you're ... I'm not quite sure how YOU feel about going alone. You spoke about it and ....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm not quite sure either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not quite sure either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I feel like I want to go away alone. I mean like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think you're ... does a part of you think that you're weird for wanting to go away alone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you in contact with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, is it like ... is it dysfunctional of me? Do I ... I probably don't spend enough time with people. I mean I DO feel lonely a lot of times. My good friends aren't/are (ph) in here but ... so is that like a weird thing for me to do maybe? Going away alone? For a whole week?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what's your ... that almost sounds like you're kind of talking to yourself from the outside. What's it feel like on the inside? Do you know what I mean by talking to yourself on the outside? Like ... do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I'm telling myself that? [0:08:06]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. You tell me if this is what's going on for you on the inside. It's sort of like you're saying ... like you're looking at yourself and saying, "Huh. I'm this kind of person. Is it dysfunctional for me to want to be alone?" It's almost like you're kind of like you're LOOKING at yourself. And I'm curious, like, what's ... like; do you have fears about being alone? I mean when you're there. You spoke a bit about ... last week ... about feeling like, you know, you don't want to be sitting there feeling really lonely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I guess part of me is just scared that I'm going to feel really lonely. But ... I don't know. I think part of me feels like I shouldn't be going there alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe one of my problems is loneliness and I shouldn't be going away by myself. But the other option ... I needed to take a vacation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you need to get away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And the other option is not attractive to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems like it's your best option.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, partly because the other option (inaudible) people ... you know, there's like one friend and then one ... and then a bunch of people that I don't really know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell me about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I might feel uncomfortable with or whatever. I mean it is kind of weird. [And I didn't want] (ph) to go to Scotland. Could have gone to Scotland with my friend Tricia. She's getting married. But it's not like ... I mean, that was the thing too, I was like, "She's getting married. Should I go?" Like when she said she was getting married, I was like, "Go. Go. There's going to be a wedding, whatever." And then they went through a period where they thought like if they ... they just want to do it alone and she would meet his family there and whatever. And then he ended up inviting people and so some of his friends are ... were first his friends and now her friends as well ... are going, and she was kind of upset about that in the beginning, so I kind of felt like, you know, she wanted to do this alone. And then there would be ... I don't know. And she's going to be busy and it's not like ... I would have gone if it was like a marriage-marriage, but it's not ... I mean, it's a marriage, but she will say, "This is just to get him in the country, [we just don't want him here] (ph). You know, she wasn't even sure if she wanted to live with him after when they got here, so it's not like a thing like ... (inaudible) And that was going to be in a couple months anyway [and I need a vacation now] (ph). And then [interested in] (ph) law school (inaudible) it was really kind of like, "Eew," like people from Beverley Hills. I can be critical sometimes. I just didn't feel that comfortable with these people. (laughs) [0:11:04]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why are you laughing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that was really a snobbish thing to say!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, it felt snobbish to ... you felt judgmental. Critical.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Critical, judgmental.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you exaggerate that? Or can you be REALLY judgmental ever?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You want me to be really judgmental?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe as judgmental as you can stand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Shallow, bitchy, Beverley Hills girl ... I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what's that feel like to say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not real cool. I mean I should just be open to it. I don't know them personally, but that was my impression of ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who's the one you hate the most?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Sit there] (ph)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, who's the one you hate the most?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Out of who?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Out of the shallow, bitchy, Beverley Hills girls?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who's the one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's just one person that was just the epitome of shallow, bitchy, Beverley Hills girl. I mean she was probably very nice. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So imagine she's sitting there. What would you want to say to her if you ... not ... just if you could say what you think of her on the inside? [0:12:13]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I can't really say what I think of her. This is just like ... a distant (ph) opinion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So shallow, bitchy, Beverley Hills girl.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't want to even THINK that in front of her. (Chuckles) I mean ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So go over here, and ... what's that voice inside you that says you shouldn't think of that inside about her? [0:12:41]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, I shouldn't even think like ... I mean, she's probably nice. Part of me thinks she's probably very nice, but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you shouldn't even think that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, if she was sitting there, I wouldn't ... I can't even ... in the situation obviously I wouldn't say anything like that to her. But I can't even picture just like in therapy just sitting in front of an empty chair thing. That's a hard ... you know. (inaudible) No. I just ... I don't know, I just felt like I couldn't relate to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you at all in contact with the voice that sort of like says you can't ... you can't even THINK ... it seems to me like you're saying you can't ... why don't you go back over here and I'll be [me again] (ph) ... that you can't even THINK about calling ... it seems to me like you're saying, "I wouldn't really say that." And I have no doubt that you ... it's not like you would go up to someone and say, "You know, I think you're shallow, bitchy, and some snotty Beverley Hills bitch." But ... but you could THINK that, right? In your own private world?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's hard for you to think that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel like, you know, I should be open to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should be open to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I shouldn't just put a label on her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't know her. [0:14:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's a part of you that kind of feels that you SHOULD be open to people, but there's another part of you that doesn't. Another part of you feels uncomfortable and reacts to feeling uncomfortable by saying, "Well, she's a shallow bitch from Beverley Hills" It's funny when I say it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's it like when I say it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it just sounds funny. (Laughing) Like, I don't know. I mean I don't know this person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm not so interested in the PERSON, I'm interested in the fact that it's hard for you to be aggressive. It's hard for you to feel ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have a right to make enemies (ph) or [opinions about a] (ph) person?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Even if you know they're not rational. I mean they obviously make you uncomfortable, right? What are you thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Yeah. They make me uncomfortable] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why not ... okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you think it is about ... what's the voice like that stifles the part of you that wants to kind of just like be aggressive toward them (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) (laughing) Someone that wants to be judgmental?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What if it is judgmental?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there a voice that's judgmental in you? [0:16:10]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Definitely. I peg people (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then it seems to me like there's another voice that's judgmental of you for pegging people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, you know, you shouldn't close the door. Not everyone else out there is a perfect human being. (laughs) I shouldn't close doors. But when I get to know people, I can [accept parts of them] (ph) like Jason. I never would have thought I would even ... would have THOUGHT about being with Jason at all. I mean, not WITH with Jason, but part of me thinks about BEING with Jason sometimes. And that's ... Jason's just someone that I wouldn't have even have considered that I could really be close to because he's just so chauvinistic and ... there are just parts of him that I just really don't like. But I can ... but I [feel like] (ph) close friends (inaudible). And aren't I wonderful! (laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm just making my point and you're like, "You see I have this friend Jason that's completely not what I would have thought." Jason's someone that I would have pegged and just kind of been judgmental about, but like I ....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel like you're kind of making a case for yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughing) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of. I'm saying, well, you know, that I can be, you know ... I can let those barriers melt (ph), you know. (silence) What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you imagine I'm thinking? [0:18:06]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know! (laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I don't know either, but that was an odd moment to me. Did it feel like an odd moment to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just thought you were thinking something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's interesting. I was sort of imagining ... I was sort of wondering why it's hard for you to be aggressive and I was imagining you being more aggressive with those people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How would I be more aggressive?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I mean, I'm just sort of like ... playing with it in my mind. You know, calling him ... like, what would it be like for you to kind of say to someone, "You know, I think you're a bitch. You make me uncomfortable."</p>

<p>PATIENT: To someone's face?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't say that to someone (laughing) unless they did something to me. I mean, not just someone that I don't know. I mean, not this woman who's like a friend of a friend that I don't even know. But, definitely not. But I tell Jason he's chauvinistic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [So you show him some of that anger] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Once I know people, I can tell them that they're bitches. (laughs) No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, you're saying once I know someone, I can tell them they're a bitch, and you went, "No, no. That's out."</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't actually tell them they're a bitch, but I will point out where we differ. (laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about between us? Have you ever felt like ... any anger towards me? [0:20:25]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think so. Why, have you ever felt any anger towards you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Towards ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Towards you. Have you ever felt that ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, like there was anger coming towards me. Are you worried that there was?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm just wondering, because you were asking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think I have, actually. But I'm sort of like wondering if that's a ... you say, "Once I get to know someone I can call them a bitch." I'm wondering if you knew me well enough to call me a bitch.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or a bastard.</p>

<p>(Long silence)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is funny in space. Where are you at with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughing) I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't ... can you locate anything? I mean, like, what is a (inaudible)? I feel like I'm being a little ... maybe I'm kind of a little tired, and I'm being a little more ... how do you perceive me? Am I ... does it feel like I'm different tonight?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe, like ... maybe ... yeah ... are you tired?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am a little tired. [0:22:10]</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Like I didn't really think that you were tired and like I just thought that there were ... like you have ... like you're looking at me like, "I know what you're thinking," kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, tell me what you think I'm thinking!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So it feels like I'm sort of saying, "I know what you're really thinking."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it feels like you're looking for something specific that you think I'm thinking. And I'm just like ... I was just wondering.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what's that like for you, when you're sitting there and you're feeling like I'm ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like, "All right, stop looking at me and just tell me like what ...what you're thinking!" (laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, "What's it about?" Yeah. Yeah. I'm not really thinking anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if ... well, what's the feeling like right now, for you?</p>

<p>(long silence)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) I'm sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you're doing something wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel like I should be ... I don't know ... like I shouldn't ... just sitting here ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what I'm supposed to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. It's like you're trying to do it right, or something. But you're not sure what you're supposed to say. [0:24:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't know what to say. And then I giggle and I feel like an ass.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. But it sounds like you're saying you're getting from me that you think ... that it feels like there's a right thing you SHOULD be saying. Like I think I know what you're REALLY thinking. Like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it's ... like when you'd ask certain questions, I thought you were thinking something was there that you wanted, that you were questioning. And you wanted me to say it first. And then you were going to say, "Well, maybe it could be this."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know. I can't tell, you know, I think I was sort of thinking ... I was moving in the direction of having you explore why it was difficult to be angry. But I don't know if I was imposing that or not. I can't really tell. But your feeling was like I was continually sort of wanting you to say something ... like a certain thing and then I would sort of, like ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I felt like you would ask something and I didn't have an answer and we'd just kind of sit here and not say anything and then I thought that you were waiting ... looking at me like, all right, like you have something like, "What are you thinking of me?" And there wasn't anything there and so then I'd feel uncomfortable and giggle and I felt like an ass!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt like an ass. What's the feeling like an ass?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just sitting here, like, "Hee hee hee," you know, because I don't know what to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm trying to figure out what goes on between us, you know? How would you talk about what goes on there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I mean sometimes it's just not something that's so important that I have to say in response. And then I don't know what to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's sort of ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's like you're waiting for ... waiting for an answer. [0:26:40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. So sometimes it feels like you're supposed to be giving me something that you can't give?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not quite. Not quite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it was just kind ... it's just the pauses are uncomfortable maybe, I think. Slightly. And that's when I start to giggle. (long pause) What are you thinking?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See right now I was sort of imagining that ... see, it feels to me like in those moments, that somehow you're trying to do it right by sort of following my lead. I don't know, I mean, I'm feeling kind of on shaky ground here, but ... [0:28:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it doesn't really ring with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I sometimes ... there's just an absence of something to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Blank (ph) and if there's an absence ... suppose there's an absence.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's uncomfortable for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's just sort of like unfiltered contact? Like that? Is it because I'm just kind of sitting here looking at each other and there's not words to kind of help smooth it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And what's that feel like for you? You're uncomfortable. It's like ... how else can you describe it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it like being exposed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little bit. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if this is ... I don't know if this is how I really feel, but like it could be something ... but it's almost like, "All right, let's fill this with therapy like I can't stand looking at you and not ... I don't know, like ... just ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's fill this up with something. I just can't stand this contact.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (long silence) What are you thinking now? [0:30:28]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it makes sense to me, actually. I think that I sort of relate to some of those feelings. It's hard to kind of sit and look at someone. So it seems ... like I can identify with it and I'm also curious if ... I'm curious about it, like, what it is ... what it relates to in you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it's just ... it probably relates with the whole attraction thing. And so it's uncomfortable when there's nothing to say and there's a pause and like, "All right," you know? I just need every second to be defined.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so the ambiguity is kind of hard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm kind of like, "All right."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I understand that. Can you say a little more about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I guess it's just like ... part of ... part of it is, I guess, a desire to know you as a person, not just as a therapist. So it's like when there's no, like, concrete therapy going on for a few seconds when there's nothing to say, I'm like, "Oh God, I can't deal with this." I don't know. [0:32:11]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something to that, that this may be a little uncomfortable. I mean I didn't quite get it. So you want to know me as a person and then when we're not doing therapy, here I am as this person and then ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Then you become just a person and I'm like, "Oh God."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the "Oh God"? What's the "Oh God"?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Oh God, I can't deal with this because this is," you know ... I can't ... like for a second, you're just a person, you know ... for a second I don't have anything to say and for a second you don't have anything to say so it's just like for a second, we're just like two ... not really, but we're just like two ordinary people sitting here and that's uncomfortable. It's like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What might happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, "Oh damn, what do I say now?" We just have to fill it with therapy because I know I can't know this person as a person, you know. He's my therapist and, you know, whatever. So I don't want to have to deal with, like, a pause.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And what would you ask if we were just sitting here as people. What would you say in that uncomfortable silence?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it feels like you can't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can't say anything?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, yeah, I could say anything about ... almost anything about me, I guess. But I'd probably want to know about you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you'd ask me questions about me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, just like ... like [you would want] (ph) with anyone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) [feel sad to be now] (ph). [0:34:07]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) Changed the ring finger. I wanted to see if ... if it had an effect or something, I don't know. It was like completion, "All right, I'm not married to Zack. Let's just put it over here."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. Right. When you said that, I thought to myself, "Oh, you're available." I don't know what that means.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. I'm free from Zack.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what's the sad ... you said, "I'm feeling sad" and then you said I switched rings. What's the sadness and what's the sadness of the rings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think part of the ... I mean, I just didn't want to talk about the sadness when I looked down and saw the ring, "Oh, (inaudible) the ring," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to get into the sadness?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why I should be sad. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something ... we're talking ... I'm going to just put it out, but I'm not quite sure. We're talking about feeling connected and how it can be really uncomfortable to have a moment of just sort of unfiltered connection. Then somehow it comes to sadness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it was sadness just like ... yeah, I don't know, that like it's just ... not being able to, like, just consider you a person. I'd rather ... not rather ... but like ... I don't know. It was just sad talking about how that was uncomfortable because I wanted to fill it with therapy and you're not a person I can know on a personal level, and you know, whatever, and that's just sad, I guess. I don't know why that should be. It's just weird to me that I can feel that way. [0:36:29]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's weird that you can feel ... which way? That it feels sad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That it feels sad to not have a personal connection with my therapist!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what's the weird part, because it doesn't feel weird to me. So what's the weird part?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess I should just ... I shouldn't ... I shouldn't feel sad by that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like that somehow it's weird to feel sad about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know (inaudible) [saying about me] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) other people I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In terms of just like taking [that little piece] (ph) and then applying it to ... my relationships. [0:38:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it easier to talk about it in terms of other ... is it easier to kind of talk about it as a kind of pattern than to kind of talk about it [in the room] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I feel like it ... you know ... I don't know, it's just again, it feels uncomfortable and unacceptable to talk about it within the room and just with you. You know, it sounds like I should relate it to something else. I should relate it to my relationships with people because I'm probably acting out in a therapeutic relationship or something, you know and this is ... I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we should, like, USE this ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's not something in itself. We should use it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For something else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't actually exist in itself because I'm just acting out, you know, and we should just apply it to something else out there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That just kind of reminds me a little bit of wanting to be in the spotlight ... that if we can kind of give it an explanation, then it's a little more acceptable. You know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it's just in ITSELF, then it's somehow unacceptable. Well I'll tell you ... see, I think it's both. I think therapy is an odd thing. As a therapist, I can say it's a very odd thing because ... I think it's very valuable to give things explanations, and there are explanations. Maybe this really is a core pattern for you and the fact that it's being played out here is a great opportunity for us to ... on the other hand, they're your feelings, you know? And ... I guess I want to sort of let them be your feelings and wonder with you if you can accept who you are in this moment ... because you can ... the fact is that maybe you ... it's because your brother got all the attention that sometimes you want to be in the spotlight, if that's what you want. But it's that you want to be in the spotlight and it may be that sometimes you feel sad in the world because you're not getting the connection that you want. [0:40:58]</p>

<p>But right now with me, you're feeling sad because you ... I don't know ... because you want something more or ... I did say that I just gave a long-winded explanation (inaudible) moment. What's it feel like just to have that be your feeling right here, right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's okay; it's just a little uncomfortable. (Inaudible), you know? This is therapy, it isn't (inaudible). Life isn't going on right here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. See it's a very ... it's a very odd thing because in a way it isn't, you're right, and in a way it is. [0:42:06]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I should say this. You're uncomfortable. So where should we go with that feeling? Well let's tie it to something. Oh. [We only have] (ph) a couple minutes. Let's ... we started a couple minutes late, so we have a couple more minutes. Well, is there a part of you that's really longing, you know? Is there a part of you that really wants contact and is afraid of it at the same time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's why I ... want the man I can't have because I'm longing for it but it's so scary to me I guess ... it's not really scary to me. It's not scary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's scary on some level. On some level, it might not be, but ... when you said, "It's not really scary," what was that ... I mean ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I want it so bad. It can't be scary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, how could something you want so badly be so scary?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just for a minute it didn't feel like, "Now hold it. What's so scary?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you ... I wonder what the scary part is, if there's a scary part there, I wonder what it is? Are you afraid of being smothered like your mother smothers you? [0:44:13]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think so, because I don't want people that would smother me. I think Mark would ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything but.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. (inaudible) ... I don't know, [it could be so good] (ph) you know. He's so rational, I'm so emotional, and it's going to be excellent. We're going to learn so much from each other. Like ... "He's not giving me what I need, but ..." I mean, I separated myself from that situation. I mean I could have let it gone on, like if I didn't say, "I'm leaving," he wouldn't have said, "Leave."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there was a part of you that felt like you weren't getting what you needed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He could be rational and you could learn a lot, but he wasn't feeding you. He wasn't filling you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I mean it's like, I have fears ... I have fears ... I remember one night [telling him] (ph) "I have fears that this is GOING to work out and I have fears that this ISN'T going to work out." And he's like, "Don't think about it," you know? I mean ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And part of me seems ... part of me thought that was, like, Zen and his self talking because I was so entranced by him, or something. You know, he's so simple and he's so right. Like, don't worry about it until it happens. You know, just don't think about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was like a Zen koan.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, "Oh gosh, this is like ... terrific. I would have wanted to talk about it but he's just so simple and in touch and just not going to worry about it. He's not going to attach himself to his fears. And he's suggesting that I don't either because life is simpler when you're not attached to your fears. [0:46:11]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's not the way it felt on the inside. Inside ... you felt, "Maybe I shouldn't be thinking about it," but the inside was this kind of conflict.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want it, and I don't want it. The thing I want I'm really afraid of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I really wanted our relationship to work out, then part of me ... I was scared that it WAS going to work out because that would have been like ... I mean, he was in Columbia, and then I was scared that it wasn't going to work out. And so when it started not working out, I was like (inaudible). You know, he agreed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have to wrap up ... with a nice neat ending. Any closing feelings? I'll see you in two weeks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yup, and I'll know by then if (inaudible) to go away alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You will know in two weeks whether (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) relationships to explore in terms of fears and ... I mean in terms of wanting it to work out and not wanting it to work out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye bye.</p>

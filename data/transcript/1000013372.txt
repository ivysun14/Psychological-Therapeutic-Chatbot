<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fine and you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Short week at work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All of the above.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I saw my mom this weekend, and everything was okay except when we went to the airport she was sitting with me alone and she told me that she... she said that after I got married, you know I told you that my Dad stopped speaking to my Mom when she got married, which is like four months after my wedding, she told me that she felt like the life had been sucked out of her and that she told her husband that she's sick but she thinks - remember I told you she was sick? - But she said it's just that she is completely depressed. Like when he's not around she can't even get out of bed. But she was just saying that to the rest of us that, you know, she's just really sick and she's just really tired. Now I know she had mono so I don't believe that she wasn't sick. So she said she's going to increase her dosage of anti-depressant and once I left she felt like, you know, I felt really bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt really bad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I felt bad that she was feeling so bad. So I wrote her letter today. I think it would just be better not calling her. And then she feels that when I'm upset or unhappy, she's like, I don't know if we made a mistake, I don't know if we rushed into this. But she's like, I hate when you're unhappy, and I said I think a lot of this stuff is temporary. I'm not as unhappy as I was before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's concerned about your marriage and how things are going.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I can relate. I mean when I hear that she's unhappy I feel bad. Like when I hear that she and Harold aren't getting along I feel like she's got so many good qualities why should anybody treat her bad? Though he's not treating her bad. It's like if they get in an argument or if she feels like she's not getting enough attention because he has three children, one who doesn't like my mom at all. Yeah, she was really rude to my mom. So then I can understand where she's coming from. I wrote her a letter I hope she feels better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem concerned about her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just haven't heard her act that way since when she was really depressed before and I thought that, you know, her work is going well, she's married and she has this house, and I thought that feeling settled would make her feel better. I hope she gets better and increasing her anti-depressant helps. And Tony couldn't go with me this weekend, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were hoping he would go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but our tenant was moving out so he stayed to change the locks. But over the weekend when I called him he said that he was waiting for the lawyer and he didn't know if he was going to change the locks, and I felt king of upset. Like did he just make it up so he didn't have to go? If he didn't want to go he could have just told me. And then last night when I got home the front door was open. There are two doors, you know the main door and then doors into the two apartments and that door was open. And he was asleep so I couldn't tell if he'd changed the locks or not, but I found out this morning that one of the locks was changed; so then I didn't feel so upset.</p>

<p>But he was really nice, you know, I said, do you want to talk to anybody? Usually he's not a big talker on the phone, and he talked to everybody, my grandparents were there, my aunts, my cousins, and my mom, Harold. [03:3]</p>

<p>And my mom said she talked to my mother-in-law, and she said the reason Tony doesn't bring anything up about my sister it's because he doesn't want to make me upset that I've got over it with him. And he still hasn't mentioned anything. The 3rd is when her accident, Thursday will be the day that she passed away and I thought at least maybe he'll be nicer this week, you know. But I couldn't get him up until like midnight he woke up. He was nice, but like you know the house was kind of messy. He'd done the dishes, but I told him to just relax, he's had a rough day at work. I was thinking maybe I expect too much from him but I don't want to lower my standards to accept something that I'm not happy with. You know, like in terms of our relationship, or the communication or what I expect from him in regards to the relationship. So last night I was trying to see what part I could change and what part he really needs to change. We're going to New Zealand over the holidays. My Dad is going there and he said that we could come. And I know that Tony probably won't want him pay for a lot of the things once we're there, but my Dad said just pay for you airfare and I'll take care of the rest. They'll be there a week. We'll join them for a week and then we'll stay a week after because his vacation in China is different from ours, he gets off a week earlier. And Tony had said - we were at his parent's house - and he kept brushing off the subject and I said, do you not want to go to New Zealand? And he really wouldn't answer. And then he mentioned that he's really just worried about money because we are redoing this house and we're probably going to he to take a loan out on the house because Tony left his job but he doesn't get the rest of his pay out until I think summer of next year. And neither of us can live in that house for another eight months the way it is. So then today I wrote him an e-mail and outlined three options, like we could go to Price Line (ph), I could tell my Dad that we're not going, or we could ask my Dad if he could help us out with the ticket. So he said that he doesn't want to [inaudible at 05:58]. That was good. I don't know, I wish he were nicer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wish...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tony, like you know, our communicating. Like last night I was like, did you change the locks? Did the tenant leave her key? And he just wouldn't answer; he just kept on avoiding the questions. But he did and there are extra keys there so I'm assuming that she dropped them off but I don't know why he's so evasive about answering things in general. Like over the weekend when I asked him on the phone, did you change locks? Are you going to call the locksmith? He's like; I'll take care of it. I don't want to get in an argument or get upset while I was on vacation so I just let it slide.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He was very short with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But he wasn't short with like, my mom or everybody he talked to. When I talked to his parents last night just to tell then I got in, they said they thought the locks had been changed and I couldn't figure it out because there was like eight keys and the front door had been open. And he had just left the front door open so I went and locked up.</p>

<p>I told my mom I'm not going to say anything, you know but it would be just courteous if somebody could be just nicer. I just come here to cry about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 07:29]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It feels good; when I leave I always feel better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it that feels bad about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't think that I'm that unhappy that every time I come here I cry. It's like I wonder if I am. But I'm a person who's never dealt with depression. I don't know what it entails and how somebody feels.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't feel [inaudible at 07:58] Is that what you're struggling with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit. On Friday there was like a big ordeal with work and I was really angry about... I was on vacation on Friday; I had gone through all the proper procedures. I was letting somebody go and hiring a new person and then on Friday morning when I was on vacation I just happened to call my boss to let her know I was going to do it and she said you can't. And I had to call three people and make the change and it made me look bad because I'm already young and then I made a decision and then it just screwed up everything for everybody. So I talked to Tony and I was just venting about how upset I was. He said, I don't think you should tell them that. And I said, I won't but I just need to get it off my chest so tonight when I have my meeting I was calm and could express what I was thinking about my concerns were.</p>

<p>I figured out that I work, like the actual meetings and the phone calls I record is like 15 hours a week so I can't figure out where the rest of my time is going. I think it's all going to commuting, like phones and client-to-client. I spend like one day a week in the office just doing administrative and payroll and things. I'm wondering if I shouldn't add a couple more cases. When I've had more cases I was busier but I was more motivated. I think now I'm getting lazy because everything is so flexible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder... I'm just aware of now as you're talking from what you're saying you were kind of concerned about how you've been feeling. You come here you cry, you start feeling like maybe you're more down than you realize and then you moved on to talking about work and how maybe if you gave yourself more work that would kind of improve things for you as far as motivation. Are you aware of this kind of... it seem to me like you're giving yourself more to do, I'm wondering if that's going to take care of what's going on for you, or if there's something that you're struggling with that's really legitimate and just needs to be attended to. It seems like you went away from the depression stuff pretty quickly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think the work thing has been really on my mind. I see what you're saying. I think I'm a little torn. I don't think I need to have more clients, but like, one, I don't get paid more if I have more clients which is something. And then I just remember when I first got the job, maybe because I was more interested in the job that I was working better. I mean now it's just like, you know, when the phone rings I'm just dreading what it's going to be on the other line when people call me and just listening because I really have no idea how I'm supposed to handle it. A lot of the phone calls are really unnecessary though in the beginning everything was super serious and I had to deal with it right away. [10:59]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So part of it might be that you're feeling differently about the work itself, looking at it in a different way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean we can go back to the things I was talking about earlier about the crying and if I really am upset. I tend to block things out in general.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well before we do that I don't want you to feel... I guess I just brought it up as something just to kind of put out there for us both to be aware of. Not necessarily meaning that you need to go back to it, just kind of to check in with you about how that is for you to kind of touch on it and then go to something different. Because it seems like it's something that is very sensitive and so I just sort of wanted to touch base with you about that and how you're doing with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How I'm doing with the feelings that I might be more upset than I realize?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, or just having visited with your mom. It sounds like that was kind of a really intense experience for you and in some ways kind of unexpected and how that makes you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When my sister passed away my parents were getting divorced and I just kind of threw myself into my activities and I didn't think about it. Maybe that's what I'm trying to do now, you know, just keep busy so that I don't have to think about all these issues that I have been thinking about because I have more time. More time [inaudible at 12:38], more time at home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's helped in the past to actually get yourself very much involved in things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know when we talked last week it just made me realize that I don't think that it... it was good for me at the time, but I don't think it's the healthiest approach to just ignore things you know. I actually ignored what was going on at my house because, like I said, the lights were always off, it was dark, either somebody was crying or they were fighting and it was better just not to be there and not to think about it. And then my parents were divorced and I didn't have to be there through all of it. But I don't think that I still deal with all these things now instead of... I don't know if I could have dealt with them then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's kind of scary thinking about dealing with them now too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Definitely. When I leave here I don't think about anything for the next couple of days, and then - well, I fill out my questionnaire but I don't think about it - and then it starts creeping back in my head, you know, whatever we talk about in our sessions. [13:54]</p>

<p>I don't know, when my mom said that, you know, did we make a mistake I told her that the only time I felt like that was earlier this year when I was really upset. I don't think that, but it's just extremely frustrating. With my mom, because we're so open, I just have a tendency to say whatever is on my mind. And this weekend she just pointed out that all of us, you know, my cousins included, that we just have a tendency to correct our parents in public or openly argue with them. And she just said a lot of those cupboards can just wait until you're alone because in Indian culture, or any culture, correcting your parents... You know, she said your parents can look bad but it makes you look worse if you correct them in front of others and it makes the people around you uncomfortable. She was giving this entire lecture.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And she was giving a lecture because?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because we had been in their car. It was me, my mom, Harold, my grandfather, my aunt. And my mom, I love her to death, but she, I think partly because she's lonely and partly because she's really smart, she has a tendency to go on and on about everything. Like if my cousin said, my mom asked her how she got so skinny and she said I do a workout video every night. My mom said, which ones and she named them, and she said, well do you use this one? And she said, no. And then my mom said, my video has a minute thing that you can see how long the minutes that you've been doing the exercise. And then my cousin said, no mine doesn't have that. And then my mom goes on about... I don't think she means it, but it just comes across like the one she has is better. She tends to do that. If somebody says something she'll be like, well why don't you do this? And that means that the person is doing something wrong, but like a whole day of that it's just too much. And most of us realize that she's not doing it that way but still I guess my patience is not what it used to be because I'm just like, okay we get it. And so I told her that yesterday before she was telling me what was bothering her. I know she and Tony get into... he doesn't argue with her but he gets really frustrated with her. And sometimes her family does too but they don't say anything to her I think partly because of everything she's been through and partly because she's family. And Harold has a way of... he does this time-out thing and they both laugh because he puts her on a time-out, like okay I get your point. But like he kept putting us on a time-out because when we kept bickering back and forth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He put you and your mother on a time out? [16:37]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he'd be like, time out for you guys, you know. It's just like a nice friendly way to get his point across. But I kept finding myself snapping at her. I don't know, I don't remember where I was going with this. Anyway, so I was really short with her and I explained to her why it was bothering me because she doesn't recollect and she forgets the story she tells so every story I'd hear like four times. Especially when I'm with her then I hear them like, a lot. When I'm not with her, at least on the phone she can, every time we talk on the phone she'll tell me a couple of the same stories or it'll pop in her head and she'll just have to say it or she interrupts incessantly because she wants to say... I think she just wants to share that she knows what you're talking about. And I used to do this a lot until it was pointed out to me. Like you get so excited about when someone's talking to you, you just interrupt and go in. So like if I tell my mom a story it's like four times I have to be, if you want to hear my story you cannot interrupt and give me advice because you didn't hear the whole story so your advice doesn't make any sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're able to say that to her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I felt bad telling her the whole lecture thing but I had examples to explain that I knew she wasn't doing it on purpose but how it comes across. Like to my cousin who is 18, that whole workout thing just came across so, not how my mom meant it. I think that my mom just meant to say, oh I do a workout video too and it's really handy to have a minute thing on the video because you can see how long you're working out. But she's so afraid I think that people are not getting her point that he just repeats herself. I was getting a little short-tempered and felt bad. I'm thinking maybe my patience isn't what it used to be, and then I'm thinking because Tony's family is so critical I'm beginning to get critical, neither of which I want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel the way that you responded to her was because you're being more critical maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm always a little bit short with my mom only because I know that I can be short and she's not going to be upset with me or she's not going to fight with me which I don't think is nice. I've done it. I won't yell at her but just a little snappy like; yeah I heard that already let's move on. And yeah, because she knows she doesn't remember everything very well she doesn't mind if you tell her. She would rather have me tell her than... like Tony will never tell her and then he'll hear the story eight times. And then he'll get really frustrated with her and then he won't want to talk to her at all. [19:20]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if this is the thread that connects it but you were talking about, the commenting on your marriage whether it was a mistake or not and moved into talking about how...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I've just been thinking about how I've changed and I've been thinking if I'm happy with who I am. Like, if I - because I'm not generally like that - am I a snappy person and short-tempered all he time and I'm just not realizing it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is this something about yourself that's coming out now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because especially when she came to visit and Tony was around I was really mean to her. I think it was... I know it was just because I knew Tony was aggravated with her and so trying to sense what would aggravate Tony I was just being meaner to her. Like not really mean but just like, being short with her. And then I apologized to her and I made a conscious effort not to do that. I mean this visit was just like our usual; we're like sisters, and this was just our viewpoint and then we'll just laugh and it won't be anything. Nobody's feelings will be hurt, you know. But when she came to visit [inaudible at 20:44]. And I also talked to Tony. I felt the fist few times when we were living together and people came to visit, I would be super sensitive to how he was behaving and if he was happy and I'd consistently be asking him, are you okay? Is everything bla, bla, bla. And he told me once, he said, you assume that things are not okay and it's hard to have somebody ask you like ten times if everything's okay because they just get aggravated that you keep asking. And after that, when people come to visit I've noticed that since I stopped being so sensitive the visits are fine. That he's not actually doing anything or being crabby or uncomfortable with something. So that was a good insight, and I thought that I was just doing it to make sure that everything was okay, but when he explained to me what it was, that I would probably be upset if I was Tony, but I probably wouldn't be but, like if somebody was, are you okay, assuming that something was not okay when everything was fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's helpful to get that feedback from him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But then maybe I'm just... maybe I am short-tempered. She didn't say that but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to be more tolerant than you are? Only to your mother or everybody?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how it affects the other people in my life. I'm trying to pay more attention about how Tony and I interact. He's just been difficult to reach lately, or not lately, but in the last couple of months. If he's in the mood we have like a great day and a lot of communication, and if he's not it's like trying to pry something off of somebody. I can't get anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just wondering, just in terms of, you know, the relationship with your mom, the relationship with Tony, it just occurred to me that there might be some sort of accountability with... let me backtrack. What is it like for you to ask for things for yourself from people that are very important to you? Like to actually be able to have them attend to you when you really needed to have your mom hold back on whatever she needs to say until you're finished your story. You know, whatever requests you're making.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With my mom it's fine. I don't hesitate to say anything. The only time I hesitated was after she told me how depressed she was then I felt really bad that I had said those things to her about her behavior. And she takes them very well. I'm super sensitive to criticism and I probably wouldn't. She said, okay and listened to it and we changed the subject, no hard feelings. Like if I'm in the middle of a story I'll say, can I finish this story already? And we'll kind of joke about it and she'll say, yeah you're right. [23:10]</p>

<p>With Tony, because I've learned with him that the more I... okay, we used to drive together to and from work and I like to talk. So I would just start all these conversations and ask him this and ask him that, and if he wasn't in the mood to talk and I kept asking then he would get really angry and he said, sometimes I'm just not in the mood to talk and if you stop asking me repeatedly the same questions - because I'd ask him and he never answered, maybe he didn't hear me, maybe he was just thinking, maybe I didn't hear him - he said if you don't keep asking so repeatedly I'll definitely talk. Because I can say whatever is on my mind but he's one of those people who thinks about everything before they say it, like most of the time at least. I think he wants to get his thoughts in order. Like if we're arguing he won't talk to me but I've found it's because he would rather not say anything rather than say something he regrets. Of course I just like to blab. I don't say anything mean but I just keep talking about whatever I'm feeling and I respect him for thinking at least if he wants to get his thoughts in order. Sometimes he'll be upset and he won't say anything and later he'll be fine and it'll turn out that whatever he was upset about he thought about it and realized that he shouldn't really be angry about it. But then I'm worried that if I want to ask him for conversation or whatever and he's not in the mood to talk, that then he's going to get angry because I know that he doesn't like to be pushed. But I think it's pretty obvious that I like to talk so I guess we make compromises.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel he does compromise with you? [26:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes. I don't know, I think it depends on the day. Like today with the e-mail, like, getting back right away and saying, you know, I was so afraid he was just going to say, I don't want to go to New Zealand. Like I said, I totally understand money wise we couldn't afford it but one, it's a chance of a lifetime and my dad's offered to pay accommodation for two or whatever. He said, I don't feel comfortable taking money from your father. Why don't we try this and we'll try the Price Line thing and see what can work? When we were dating I told him how important traveling was for me and I've found since we've been together, because he travels so much at work that traveling is really lost it's appeal to him. So I think this New Zealand trip is like him trying to see how we can fit it in as a compromise. He hasn't really said that he doesn't want to go but I know that he doesn't love traveling. But we booked that honeymoon, we went to Europe and it was like pulling teeth to get him to say we could go, and then even until the last minute there were things going at work. It was like, I don't know if I can go. And I said, well if you can't go I'm taking somebody else so, my girlfriend. And then he went and he really enjoyed himself.</p>

<p>I told my mom. I said, you know I think it's really easy when you know Tony because he tries to present himself so much older. He's only 22. He tries to pretend that he's such a grown-up, it's like whiskey on the rocks an he wears his suit every day and manages all these people, but I think it's only fair for me to sit back and say sometimes he tries to act like he knows everything. And he makes it very clear to everybody that he knows everything, but in actuality he doesn't. Like he's really impulsive. He's really responsible when he's willing to shop he'll spend money without even thinking. Like when we were traveling in Europe he was buying his mom some jewelry and I had to go to the airport and stand in line. It was like the last thing, he hadn't bought his mom anything. And there was a bracelet there he knew I liked and he bought it. It was like $2000. He could have done without it. His mom loves jewelry so it's like in his blood, the jewelry thing. My mom and me are fake jewelry buffs. But he bought it and my mom was just saying that those are things that we're worried about saving money and he can just go and pick up. I can't do that because I don't have enough money in my bank account. But we bought a painting and I let him and pick it out and I don't know how much it cost, maybe $4,000. He was so excited because originally it was much more, which I'm sure it wasn't. They just had it really marked up to see what they could get. And we bought a mirror but it was only $600 dollars, it was a really good deal. We just had it shipped. But that trip cost us so then much more because he likes fine things but then sometimes he doesn't realize. He's sitting there saying we don't have any money, we can't do this, and then if we go to the store to look at bathroom fixtures, he'll want a really expensive sink. So it's a contradiction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you make of that? [29:21]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it just shows that he's not... he always tries to act so grown up and he's not. I think he tries to act like his dad, and his dad would never do that. His dad thinks out everything about everything. My mom was telling a story about how when Tony and I were dating she had met Tony and she really wanted to meet Tony's parents. And her sister-in-law, my aunt, was visiting her from Ft. Lauderdale. So they made up this story about how they were going to go to the Catskills and said it to Tony. So Tony said, oh my parents are right there and they'd love to see you. So they went there and my mom, you know, she's really book smart but not so street smart. So they were talking and they went the wrong way for about an hour and a half. They were going to Montreal instead of [inaudible at 30:08]. And Tony called and they finally got there and they were just giggling and telling their story. And she was saying that Tony's dad is so analytical, like he would have thought that whole story out. Like first of all why did you change at that gas station and then he would think, you know... they had trouble at the border and his question would be why was your aunt driving and not you? Like why hadn't you guys prepared. Not critical, but he thinks about everything. He planned our engagement party and the napkins had to match the carpet on the floor. I don't know, he just does. And Tony isn't like that, and I think he likes to think that he is. Or maybe he thinks he should be that way.</p>

<p>Like this house was such an impulse buy. I know because, first of all, I told you, everything I had picked out in the house was wrong and by the time [inaudible at 30:58] I was like, fine, I don't care because I just want to live somewhere. I'm not that picky about where I'm living, if I should have been pickier. It had been a year, we finally found something that we could afford and less than we were expecting to spend, and he just bought it. Now, Tony said, make sure you get a structural engineer there. I think we definitely could have spent more time looking at how much everything was going to cost because we're facing that now and he's so stubborn that his dad's like, I think you should just sell the house and buy a new one, like rent it out or something and just don't live here because you're going to put a lot of work for a place that's just not worth it. And his parents lectured me for like two days about it because Tony was working. And then I was like, you know, that's fine, a lot of what you're saying makes sense, but you guys are going to have to get Tony to change his mind. And Tony, because he had bought it, was adamant about not selling it because he didn't want to admit that he had made a mistake.</p>

<p>And I think it's different too because a lot of our friends, the friends that Tony was in business with still live in Chicago, so they have a lot of money from their business and they have huge houses and new cars and this and that. And you know, that would be like a drop in the ocean in Chicago. But I think he wants some of that stuff just like I do, but if I say that he's like, you know you take good care of yourself. But I'm sure he does and I think that's why he does some of the impulse buying or why he had to buy a house, which is so much more work than...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 32:35]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, now I can't stop imagining [inaudible at 32:37]. Maybe Tony needs counseling. You know, he doesn't have... he works. A lot of his friends have left the company or don't live in Chicago. He doesn't have a lot of good friends here. He likes to spend time alone but when I'm not at work I'm always around. I try to give him a break by doing things with my friends after work because I know by now that he's not going to join me. I'll just tell him where I'll be and go out. But it must be hard for him too. And then to have that pressure, you know, he puts pressure on himself like the house and money. [33:20]</p>

<p>I begged him for joint bank accounts and we finally had them because his parents were coming in. I said, look they're coming in. If they find out that we don't have joint bank accounts yet, you're not going to hear the end of it because I was already bugging him, like a joking threat. So he did it, but now my checks are the only things that go into that account. I'm like, Tony, how can we have a joint bank account when I'm the only one who puts money in it and you can write your checks out. He was just laughing, it was like, it works out well doesn't it? I'm like, how can you possibly expect me to understand the value of money if I have no idea how much money we have? If we don't have any money and we buy, like for my birthday, I like to collect snow globes so we... there were these snow globes [inaudible at 34:06], and last year I got an IOU I was going to get one; we were saving money. So then I got the set. So I was like, okay we're not spending any money but yet you're buying this stuff. The only money I know is what we have in my bank account and I've never had a savings account. It's always like, okay as long as my bills are paid off with the money I have my balance can go back to a couple of hundred bucks and back up and back down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds very frustrating.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I save all my receipts; I'm like let's make a spreadsheet of where the money's going. I didn't even know how much the mortgage was until he told me. Then I don't know what the other expenses are. I'm like, can I at least have your credit card statement so we can see where the money is going there. I don't know how much money he spends a week. I mean he's not that aggressive about knowing where my money goes either. He knows that I put all the utilities on my credit card bill and I have a Visa card that we share that I try to put on shared expenses and just leave my personal stuff on my credit, but then it's like, I don't hide anything but now it's just easier because then I get to take care of my own stuff. And he told me he just wanted to wait a little bit. I don't know what he's waiting for. Maybe he's scared that I'll spend all the money in there, but I doubt it. And that's what happens, I just guess what he's thinking and I could be so far off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you started out talking about how sessions make you feel after you leave here. You get things off your chest and you end up leaving, you have a couple of days where you're feeling good, and then it all comes back again. [36:08]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't all come back. Like, I'll just not think about anything we talked about in the session, like when I go home. And maybe for the next day I won't think about it, you know, I'll just feel good. And then I'll start thinking about the things we said, and start reflecting on what we talked about or what I said and what I think about what I said. You know, do a summary of dialogue and try and apply it to my life. Maybe if I was more... maybe I used to be, when we first started dating, more open and less timid. And that worked better. And now I'm becoming more submissive and that's why it's easy for him to get away with a lot of the stuff, because I'm not... I really think working for him had a huge part of it. Before, I was like; I loved being with Tony because he just made me feel like I was on top of the world. And then I started working with him and he started speaking to me more curtly and just being harder on me. Like I said that's why I had to point that out. And then our relationship just ended up that way. I can't take that back. I mean, there's a lot of good things; now I understand what he does. He can talk about work and it makes sense. Before I didn't even know [inaudible at 37:33] And I told him that, it's just he doesn't really see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How has it been today to be here and to talk about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just had a thought about how some of the stuff you shared, if you're okay with me sharing it. I really feel for you in the experience that you have with your mom. You were looking forward to it, you went to see her, and it sounds like some of it was really very good. And I guess I'm feeling a kind of a let down for you in the sense that you were hoping that you could get some support from her and she's really struggling with stuff still. I think that was kind of hard for you, to go there and feel like, oh maybe you need to take care of her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, when I wrote her that letter I think that I have relied on her pretty heavily during everything. And I know her reaction is always like, oh yeah, you know, assumes that things are just like they are with my father. But I felt like I've been relying on her so heavily that maybe I haven't given her a chance to rely on me. If she's been feeling this way for a year I think that maybe I should have known. No, I was just hoping that she was better. I think that's more disappointing than anything. I mean, at least if she had used anything else besides like... I mean she pretty much said she felt like she was dead. She felt like the life was sucked out of her, she felt like her eyes didn't have any life in them. She said she goes to work in a way that she would never even gone to check her mail outside. You know, just so whatever, and I feel bad for her. [39:38]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can imagine you do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wrote in the letter, like she's been through so much that I was hoping that it would finally be time for her not to go through anything. She said that she was really disappointed that my dad doesn't speak to her but I'm tired of him making her unhappy when they're not together anymore. So how he can still have that control over her, you know, they haven't spoken in a year. It's just, I feel bad. I think maybe I should have noticed or even if I did notice I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I know it will be her, herself that will make herself better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're doing what you can do which is being supportive of her; let her know you care about her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's just like she always told me that she could imagine her life without me, that I couldn't imagine my life without her, and just that all the experiences that we're going to share in the future, how am I going to do those without her. And I said, maybe if we weren't so far away these things wouldn't come up. She got better when I was around. Maybe it's a little bit of emptiness, like even when I was at college I was still close, and she has to deal with a lot of those things now.</p>

<p>It doesn't help that I'm not happy here either you know. I would move back in a second.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't want to move to Chicago you know. I got into grad school there and my mom had just built her house and it would have just saved a lot of money for me to finally move with her. She'd been in her apartment since she got divorced. And the program was good. All the programs I got into were better than the one here. Tony's like, I can't be in a long-term relationship, or a long-distance relationship, and I probably wouldn't have either. And by then the [inaudible at 41:55] thing had already happened by the time I heard from my grad schools so. Being in Chicago is exciting but it's still only Chicago. It's hard to think that I will start a family and my mom will be so far. I joked with her and Harold this weekend that when my house is finished my mom will have to retire and spend a month with me and when I have kids my mom will have to come and spend some time with me. [43:19]</p>

<p>[session interrupted by phone call 43:24]</p>

<p>[session resumes 44:33]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A lot of stuff you are dealing with. A lot of stuff; being here, not being close to your mom, feeling like you'd like to be closer to her, struggling with being in your marriage, you know, all this stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess a little bit of me is scared that when the house is one and I'm unpacked... I guess now the house is such an excuse but what if all these excuses... I'm so counting on that to make me feel at least a little bit more settled in Chicago, give me some peace of mind. I went home yesterday and I'm like, oh, I hate this place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel like home yet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's messy and I'm not super clean, but I'm not messy and it just aggravates me that even if I wanted to clean there's nowhere to put anything. And I want to throw stuff out but I didn't get to any of my boxes to throw anything out. And it's like on top of everything I've got upstairs the wardrobe just keeps getting smaller. There's just like too much stuff; I don't even know what to do with it. I got an exercise machine and I started working out last night. Maybe I'll get into some of those clothes I haven't been getting into. 46:17]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're doing some stuff that's moving you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I saw my cousins and they're like size twos. I was like, mom was I ever a size two? It's like you were never thin. I was never thin? She said that I just went from like a nothing to... I was like, that wasn't very nice. But I was never... I always had a stomach.</p>

<p>She had a facelift for my wedding. I was like, mom you're only 47, why are you getting a facelift? And she said, I just feel old. Both my parents looked a lot older after my sister passed away. My dad looked so old, my mom was saying to my aunt, because my aunt really likes my father. When she came to this country my dad took her in and taught her how to drive and helped her with all her stuff. The rest of my mom's relatives don't really like him but my aunt does and they were talking. And he doesn't dye his hair anymore so he's pretty gray.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's time for us to end but I guess I'm thinking ahead to the anniversary of your sister's death and I'm hoping that you get what you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hope so. This job doesn't help. Having to worry about everybody else and being totally responsible for that stuff. It's not like I want a job where I don't have to be responsible but like, it's just too much pressure for me to be that responsible for people's lives.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, one of the things that I've wanted to say and I've kind of been a little hesitant to say it but you're probably more aware of it than I realized it that you seem to be the sort of person that is there for other people and that you're at a point in your life where you're asking people to be there for you. And it seems like they're more interested in you being there for them. That sounds like the same thing with your job.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was telling my boss that I felt guilty about cases and she was like, you have to knock those thoughts out of your head. And I said, it's easier for you. You've been doing this for like 50 years. You ran the company. It's not that easy for me to be like, well, okay I know you have no money and I have to charge you an arm and a leg for everything and, you know, it's just hard. Sometimes [inaudible at 49:06]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem like you're strong too, but it seems like all this stuff that's happening around you, you're not quite sure what to make of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, when I told you in the beginning that I got frustrated that I'm like this because it's not me. When I look back at who I was in high school and college, you know, my friend told me, he's like, I thought that you would be 25, businesswoman, not even thinking about getting married. And not so much that it was the marriage part, but he was right. Like I was always extremely independent and extremely outspoken and I'm nothing really right now. And I think that's really bothering me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who you'd like to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know why I keep letting Tony treat me that way, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've got a lot on your plate. There's a lot that you're trying to sort out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible at 50:11] All right. Thank you. Next week it'll be the same time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's okay with you that time is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this is perfect.</p>

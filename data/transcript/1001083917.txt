<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, tell me how are things going?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> When was I here last? Just before Christmas.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes. Uh-huh</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I was supposed to talk to a college representative.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that didn’t happen. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because I spent my whole time trying to get my grandson into school because they require complete records before they even let you in.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh my goodness.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Like, you have to have immunization records, birth certificate, social security number, school records to see what kind of person you are, when you come from another state. So it took us a week to get him into school. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Isn’t he at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So , so and then uh, I have been looking at a lot of brochures so because [NAME OTHER] is going away to college so she’s got lots of stuff laying around the house.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And so, I found out [DEIDENTIFIED] is starting, started the sixteenth, so I missed that and then [DEIDENTIFIED] is starting the sixteenth and they’re, I’m, they’re starting the twenty ninth but.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is [NAME OTHER], she’s not going this semester is she?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, she’s a senior. But you’ve got to do your applications…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah next year.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Right, and so you’ve got to uh, do all this stuff, so I’ve been looking at all her stuff and having a hard time focusing um, because the last time we talked, um, I had decided that I really didn’t want to live with my alcoholic husband. And uh, I don’t know why I can’t stay focused. I’m disappointed that everything didn’t turn out the way it should. You know, be happily married and retire and travel, blah, blah, blah, you know all that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Instead I’m weighed down with daughters that have problems and um, so I was brainstorming the other day and I thought that I could go to, go away to college in [DEIDENTIFIED] and live on my own and just go to school. So, and I thought that was a really good idea and got inspired and everything. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But I don’t, I can’t seem to follow through. I keep not taking my Meds lately.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because you’re forgetting or?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I just forget and I get consumed in all my problems so I don’t know if that’s a problem. I get really depressed but I know it’s not like it used to be because it doesn’t last for days it just lasts for probably just like normal people. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You get really depressed because we have so many problems. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know, I just, I guess I’m here because I can’t stay focused, I can’t, I don’t know, I think every thing’s okay and I could live in the house with my alcoholic husband and blah, blah, blah, and , and then something bad happens.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Like?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Same old stuff. Okay, here’s an example again, my stupid husband, he was drinking Saturday night, and [NAME OTHER]’s boyfriend left his car in the driveway forgetting that my husband had to go get his mom at Bingo, well, he’d been drinking and so he comes in the living room and said that, his name is [NAME OTHER], you left the car in the driveway on purpose to make him mad. I said use my car and then he gets in my car and by the weirdest fluke, both my headlights went out. So he goes in the car and I’m like, oh my gosh, it’s going to make him worse, you know, because he’s drinking. He can’t get the headlights on so he leaves, calls form his cell phone says honey where’s the headlights? I said well they both went out. So he hung up on me and went to a bar.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> After he picked up his mom. And hung out there for a hour and a half. Usually I don’t care what he does, but he’s drunk, he’s in my car and he could get fired because it’s [DEIDENTIFIED]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, the next morning intentionally, doesn’t go to, goes to work late. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He intentionally goes to work late?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He’s never done that before, to me that’s like a step toward being, yeah, intentionally…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you know why?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I, when he came home for lunch I said, did you get in trouble for being late? And he said no because I never have and I said did you do it on purpose and he said yeah. I said, why did you do that? And he said, in other words, because the headlights weren’t on the car, didn’t go on, and [NAME OTHER] parked in the driveway, he got mad and went to a bar. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It would be, would he not go to work if he was hung over?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh he wouldn’t. I think he was I think hung over and really tired because he had to get up at five o’clock in the morning.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s when he turned off the alarm. And I felt like this is like a step, another step towards, because one of his coworkers, he says he’s a true alcoholic because he drinks hard liquor and he calls into work late all the time and got fired. Went to rehab, got his job back and then showed up late twice and got fired again. So…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, you think someone’s trying to get fired?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know I thought that, I though maybe one day he might get mad and say you know I’m tired of paying money for all you people so I think I’m going to quit working, but I doubt it because…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He’s retiring in, he’s [AGE] and he’s retiring at [AGE] so, there’s no way he’s going to give that up.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Unless the alcoholism is really, I mean, we can see it, his personality is changing quickly. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, you think he can hang in there for two more years?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I hope so, but I was thinking maybe I, I uh, don’t want to wait around and see. And my grandson, he said, he’ll do whatever I do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Meaning if you leave…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> If I have to leave and have to sell the house, if I were to move to [DEIDENTIFIED] where my mom is, away to college, whatever, because he doesn’t like these circumstances either.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He doesn’t want to go back to [DEIDENTIFIED]. So, I can’t, I, I live for the evenings when everybody is in bed, or, or, it’s quiet, or no, you know what it is basically, my husband’s in bed, asleep. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because if anybody came and talked to me or anything I wouldn’t care. And uh, I remember doing that as a teenager, just realized that. I, you know, my father was mentally abusive.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I couldn’t wait ‘til night came, so it was quiet and everybody was sleeping and no one would be hassling me or anything. And I feel like I’m right back where I started. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It does sound like a re-creation.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then when you’re a kid, you like have an out, you know, like okay, I’m going to get married and have kids or get a job or go to college and you feel like you could get away from the situation. Sometimes I feel really trapped thinking that well, I really screwed up and married the wrong person, three of my four daughters are stupid, and it starts feeling really hopeless. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But, but then I, I’ll get inspired it’s like I said, I’d be like, why couldn’t I apply for college and pick a major and go live in someplace like [DEIDENTIFIED] and I pick that because its halfway between [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And uh, I think I mean really, if I had the funds, and the gumption and that I think I would, if somebody said hey you know what here, I’ll, you can do this, and I’d be like oh, I, I’m going. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME] when would you do that? After [NAME OTHER]’s out in college?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Before?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I would go next year. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I wouldn’t wait four years. When you put it to me like that, like wait ‘til my grandson graduates or wait ‘til [NAME OTHER]’s through college. No, I couldn’t. I don’t want, I don’t want to wait, I don’t want anybody except, somebody’s always going to come along. Actually I’ve always wanted to be a stay at home mom, whose kids have kids and I watched their kids. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But it’s not working out that way. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s working out, everybody’s creating their own problems and the person who doesn’t have problems usually is the one everybody throws their problems on.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And [NAME OTHER] she’s a good kid, I mean, she is, I cant help it, she just does everything right, going away to college, following through. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And she actually texted [NAME OTHER] and said I hate you, you need to get out of our life because you’re ruining everything. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I said, okay, I understand you’re angry, but that’s really, that’s way too harsh. Fortunately, [NAME OTHER]’s been working on her anger issues and it didn’t trigger her.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And they didn’t fight or anything. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But, the stress level I think, in the house, is just, you know I just, I’ve been one day, I faked being sick because everybody was in the house so I didn’t want to deal with everyone so I faked being sick and went in my bedroom and shut the door and went to bed. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I never lie or fake anything, but it was just like, it was easier than telling her, telling everybody off or whatever.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, I just, and everybody thought I was really sick. And then later [NAME OTHER] was like, so are you physically sick or mentally sick? So, she understood what was going on.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So [PATIENT NAME], it sounds like at times you feel kind of hopeless, overwhelmed like you just want to withdraw but at other times you said get inspired and start thinking about what you could do to make your life better?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And when you do that, mostly you think about going away or moving away to college?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Or just getting out or basically, being by myself, so that I’m in control of my money, myself, my body, you know what I mean?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then, I can just think about work and myself, and, and I don’t think a vacation would do it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, just go away, no because when you come home to the same thing…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Then [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] what do you feel like your options are? I mean, going away only to go to college is one, do you see any others?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The other option was make my husband go away and then the house would be, turn into Grand Central Station, and I’m like, okay, would I really, would I really like that? Is he the cause, not of everybody’s problems, but the stress level when people do have problems? Because we know we can’t turn to him.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We can’t, we can’t confide in him because he’ll say something stupid. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He’s, he’s mean and sarcastic, like [NAME OTHER] wasn’t feeling well yesterday, yesterday, he says oh he’s just playing you that he doesn’t want to go to school. So, that’s how he approaches things.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know? He’s going to [DEIDENTIFIED] again, he, he’s, it’s like he became one person for me, and he’s uh, very straight laced, now its all coming out and he’s going to [DEIDENTIFIED] again and that’s all he thinks about is gambling, drinking, playing golf, travel, and those are none of my goals in life. And I can’t wait for him to leave. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’m not happy when he comes back and then he, and the he thinks about vacation all the time and he’s like okay we’re going to [DEIDENTIFIED] next January. You have, you have to tell me right now, right now. You know because he gets discounts and stuff and oh, a couple of years ago when he was harping on my about a vacation I said well maybe I won’t be with you. And that just set the stage for harassment.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because then he will harass me and be snotty to me um, so, I just said fine I’m going. And I’m not, you know. I don’t want to travel with him. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He’s like the ugly American?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know when he travels?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know what I mean by that?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ll worry that he’ll be stupid or embarrass me or. But then let’s say, my youngest daughter and her boyfriend for some fluke or something they could go somewhere. And they said I could go. I would jump at the chance because I enjoy their company. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And they don’t suffocate me, they don’t, we’re our own people, like it’s like, staying in a room and my husband has control over the whole room, whereas if he’s not in the room, and there’s a room full of people, we’re just, we’re just there, do you know what I mean? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like he is not participating with you, he’s not [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, or he’s jealous if we’re not including him or, I mean it’s almost like, like high school. Well, how come you guys aren’t talking to me? Or why aren’t you? You know what I think [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So [PATIENT NAME] your options is something you’re thinking about or either making him go away, as uh, or you go away…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Some, somebody needs to go away. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Well you could go to [DEIDENTIFIED] or you could…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And, and then whenever I told him in the past when he twice, has suggested that he visit hookers, so he could get all the sex he wanted, you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So I was devastated and crying, I was oh my God, he’s so mean to me and stuff. Well the other day I said you know why don’t you do that? And he’s says, oh, does that mean you want a divorce? And so I cut the conversation off really fast. So, basically it’s, no discussions because they don’t get anywhere. I’m very careful, everybody’s very careful. So, I don’t, I’m, I think I’m being very, okay, I’m being very patient because [NAME OTHER]’s is trying to get through her senior year, she’s a kid who loves school. And goes to the basketball games, football games and has school spirit and everything and I’m just so worried that if we start this, [NAME OTHER] won’t go away quietly, or he’ll you know, if you side with your mom, I’ll take away all your ballet classes. I mean that sounds bad.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But you’re afraid he’ll use her as a pawn to get back at you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well he does. Well, no, I don’t, you know, I wouldn’t no. I wouldn’t care what he did to get back at me, he would just take stuff away from her that she loves, kind of that cliché where the kids a bad environment goes away to ballet class and that’s where they escape and that’s…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And that’s what she has for her.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you think that will be different once she gets out of high school? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, because they’re going, [NAME OTHER]’s going away to college together, her boyfriend, they’re going where there are music majors. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. I mean do you think [NAME OTHER] will still try to take things away from her once she goes?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, even when shes gone, see that’s what I worry about is college…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is he going to pay for her college?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He said he would. He, he’s going to pay for it, but he’s the type that would expect something back.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Like what?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Just respect and stuff, I mean, or be able to be rude because he’s paying for stuff, you know what I mean?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm. So, do you think if you and he separated after she’s in college would he pull the rug out from underneath her [INAUDIBLE]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, what I would do, what I would do is once she’s in, and she’s committed to the four years and there’s the money and, and everything I would warn her, okay this is what might happen. I think what we’re doing is we’re preparing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We’re preparing for the worst, if I suddenly say, you know what? I’m done, will he just go away quietly or will he be angry and take it out on everyone? Will he take care of everyone um, or will he just say, you know what? I’m real, you know, you all hate me anyways so I don’t care. That all it sounds like I’m sticking around for money? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, not just money I hear that for some safety or security too. That’s just, just, I hear you saying you don’t want him to pull the rug out from underneath her for the things that are important to her.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Or the dance lessons, or college.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I have seen kids where divorce happens, they end up with nothing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Now see, if my husband was hitting us and stuff, you know, well I would have been out a long time ago I think, I think because you know, he’s pushed me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, we’re playing games or you know, three times in a twenty five year marriage.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Has he pushed you again?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> See, I have a feeling he knows there is a time a stage is set at home where, make sure you don’t trigger anyone, him, and be out of the room when he walks in the door and uh, even my grandson who loves his grandpa or he’s seen the episodes I was telling you about, and I said, and when you see me upset, or if I tell you to be quiet, you have to listen. [INAUDIBLE] so I have to set up the stage for him.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, you try to teach him not to get…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not to get involved, if he’s drinking because it won’t do nothing, nothing. You can’t talk to someone who’s already been drinking. And it doesn’t do any good. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I can’t remember, have you been to [DEIDENTIFIED]? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I haven’t done anything.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Have you thought about it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I’m…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Or, do you know what it is?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s a support for folks that have family member who drink. Do you think something like that might be helpful?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know I think I should because, at first I thought, oh no, be around all these horrible people? You know, that’s my horrible though, but then I get, but then, I know a lot of really nice people who have alcoholism and alcoholics in their family.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Almost every…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Body.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s a huge disease.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Knows someone.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And I really, I really should. I remember looking up the web site and there’s nothing on a web site they just say go to a meeting. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But, and just so you know, if you decide to go to, there are meetings all over and you don’t have to say anything, you can just go and listen in the first, you know, if you want to.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just to get a sense of it, what you’ll probably find is, you’ll probably know some people at some of the meetings, you might know some of the people depending on where you go.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And it’s very confidential, nobody uses other peoples names outside of [DEIDENTIFIED], but it’s a support group where people can talk about what they are going through and sometimes it really helps to get that other people are going through similar things and have been in similar places and found ways to get through it. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I should, because I’m doing this all by myself.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t bother my mother with it because you know, she’s far away. His mom, worthless. I don’t want to burden my friends, they don’t, they know what’s going on but once you know what’s going on, I mean, we do sit and complain about it and they, they don’t listen anymore because its just, you know, its ongoing. So really, you’re the only person that I talk to.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> At all. The daughters and I, we talk about it ourselves, but that’s like how do you say, the sick cherries and [INAUDIBLE], no way we, they’re sick of it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> How are they going to, going to help? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, [PATIENT NAME] it might be worth thinking about just going to a meeting sometime just to see how you feel about it, it might be a really great source of support for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, because you can always, I, see that’s what I tell my kids, at least talk to other people because somebody always has some suggestion or thought or something that you never would have thought of yourself. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly because there’ll be other people who’ve been through this, and have ideas and maybe things you haven’t thought of or some suggestions about pitfalls to watch out for. I’m just trying to think of how you can get some more support because it, it does feel like you’re pretty isolated. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And afraid, I understand your fear. I’m just wanting to help you find some solutions so you don’t stay stuck on a situation that isn’t good for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Right. I just need to, I guess stay focused on a goal.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then just try to obtain it and I guess sticking it out is still a good thing right now, but you know I don’t have that much longer to go.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And [NAME OTHER] graduates in May?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In May.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Four months.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. And then uh, so basically the goal is changing the environment that I’m in.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I need to decide and the reason I want to go to school is because I, I didn’t have any schooling at all when I was married and I think I really need some kind of education or some training or something.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> To get a job. And so, I have to, I need to quit hoping that things will change. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I don’t think they’re going to change on their own.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No because what he’s, just off the cuff, I said you’ll, your, you haven’t changed and you never will. And he just kind of just left, he, it’s almost like he, I guess, you know what I think because I’ve put up with it for so long he probably thinks oh, I’ll be around forever. No big deal. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, people tend to expect things not to change.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. And he probably thinks I won’t, I won’t get out. And then I have to watch what I’m spending because I use spending as a weapon. And…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> In what way?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He controls the finances and so, I was using money as an escape because it’s almost like, you know what? You can’t tell me what to do I’m tired of you telling me so I went and got my own credit card and ran it up to six thousand dollars.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh my goodness.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But, but that’s because I was also if [NAME OTHER] needs something, I would just buy it so she wouldn’t have to be hassled or lectured, she could just you know, she needs point shoes, I just get them. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And not tell her to go ask her dad. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Which I have feeling is kind of a bad thing so I’m kind of changing that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because if I’m going to be self sufficient, I will have nothing for them and uh, they’re going to have to learn that they need something to go to their dad.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Or they just don’t need it that bad. And try to get everybody to take care of themselves. Which I think I’ve mentioned, everybody knows the situation, they’re old enough to understand it and I said if I walk out, you, you, I can help you mentally, but financially stuff, you guys got to take care of yourselves. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you think they’re able to do that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, my daughters, my daughters, there’s many problems that they have, two of them, [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER]? They work, they’ve always been workers. [NAME OTHER] is assistant manager of [DEIDENTIFIED] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She’s worked every day since she graduated form high school. So they can take care of themselves.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s just that they married men, or with men who can’t take care of themselves and they’re dependent on them. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Emotionally you mean?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Financially.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Financially and emotionally and that’s why they’re, they uh, it boils down to being with the wrong guys. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’m thinking, did I do that? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, they learn probably to tolerate things.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That aren’t necessarily healthy.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, like because [NAME OTHER] boyfriend is like borderline criminal.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You can see all the ear markings of him uh, but she doesn’t care. And that drives me up the wall, that I used to get really upset about that, the bad boy syndrome I guess, I have to not let that bother me if anything happens. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it’s hard not to have that bother you but I think in, by you saying in your life you’re not going to tolerate that type of behavior anymore, you’re also teaching them they don’t have to tolerate it either. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. You know they’ve also been waiting for me to leave their dad and then they’ll fix their situation?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, they might or might not. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, it’s going to be up to them to make their own choices. But at least you’re showing them that a possibility, an option, to make changes if things aren’t working in your life.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Also, maybe they’re, it’s funny, they’re all like, they’ll watch re-runs of the Brady Bunch and they’re like, you know that’s how I want to live, it’s silly. I said well really, it is, but its not basically no one’s breaking the law, and you’re going by the basic rules and what’s wrong with that? But I guess I have to break, cut off all the apron strings I guess is what you’re, what I’m trying to say.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, [PATIENT NAME] I think it’s also important to realize that when you make decisions that are good for you, there’s a good chance they are going to be good for your daughters too. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> There, you know there’ll be some struggles. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That Means that you, by role modeling for them taking control of your life and not tolerating bad behaviors is showing them that in their life they can make different choices and…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> They’ll make their lives better too. And that’s true whether, whether you were to get out of your marriage or whether you stay in it to make changes, but I think you know you’ve tried making changes and it hasn’t worked. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, the tiniest thing is, remember a couple visits ago I told you that [NAME OTHER] would always trigger anger in me?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And we end up having these horrendous fights?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then you said, you don’t need to see her, you just need for me, that worked fantastically I don’t know, it was so simple because in the next month, she’d do something right away, I could feel her anger but I didn’t follow through I kept my mouth shut, and I am shocked and amazed at how it worked.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good, that’s good…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Just, just a couple of times of holding back, and then we haven’t fought for like, oh, like three months?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Great job. See that’s, you taking responsibility for your feelings and plotting a different way to react. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then I noticed that she is watching her temper too so except well, when she told [NAME OTHER] that she hated her.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, but nobody reacted in rage and they just kind of left it alone. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And [NAME OTHER] worked it out and let her, let it go. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s progress.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, what do I do? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, what you’re doing is you’re making changes already. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, but…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How you react with your daughters.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And as you keep making changes during life and keep getting better.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Now, seems, okay right now, I really can’t change but if I like, set a goal and said this is what’s exactly what’s happening, and it’s going to happen unless your dad miraculously goes into [DEIDENTIFIED] and, you know, that the only, that’s the only way I can see anything happening and when I follow through and it’s, it’s a definite thing um. Another option I can do is I was thinking about when I uh, take [NAME OTHER] to college?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, you drive them there and the campus and everything? I just keep on going and just tell my mom I’m going to stay with you for a while. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s another option.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, so then I guess I have a lot of options I can go away to school, I could stay in town and go to school, I can sell everything, get a divorce, well a divorce, there’s nothing I can think about, you know, actually go through the divorce or just trial separation where you just, just separate and see what happens from there. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, [PATIENT NAME] with these things your thoughts are to wait ‘til [NAME OTHER] gets out of high school and then maybe exercise one of these options in terms of trying to change environment at home whether it’s you leaving and going somewhere whether it’s you going back to school, or whether asking or telling [NAME OTHER] to leave, to try to find some way to change it at home so it’s not the constant…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Battling. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, I have four months.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, it would be wise to kind of look into your options and this, during this time. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If you’re planing to make some changes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> After she gets out of high school.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Have you looked into any of the schools, even in town, in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I just have brochures, I haven’t talked to anyone and I’ve kind of done it through [NAME OTHER] because she’s looking.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She’s looking at [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED]. .</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She hasn’t decided yet?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think they decided on [DEIDENTIFIED] because it’s not as expensive, its has music majors, they love the outdoors. It’s advertised as uh, one of the great outdoors schools? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And there’s cowboys there, I don’t think she cares about that, obviously. And uh, so, through her, I’ve been looking at the brochures and inspiring me even though I’m you know, and old lady, I would enjoy being around young people. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, that would be no problem.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you going to try to go to the same school as she does or not necessarily?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not on purpose.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It just happened, it just dawned on me that would be a great place to go. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Cause its uh, near everything its not as expensive and, and uh, you know because I don’t think I’d want to go to school in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I might want to get out of town and not be in [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And actually want to be in another town so it’s just coincidence, she might freak out. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME] have you thought about how you’d pay for school yet?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, see that, I can get a hold of any money I want as a loan. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know if he would, my husband would actually, like it I actually got a divorce, then I would have the lawyer say oh I have to pay for college because I stayed home, didn’t go to school, and took care of the everything.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I want to go to school, so I’d see if I could get him to pay for it and then there’s scholarships, grants, I’m thinking, if I got a divorce and have a grandson living with me and I want to go to school, I think that would open doors.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, I guess I don’t really worry about the money because after being in all the meetings and seminars and [NAME OTHER] has at least once a month talked about college, I think if you want to, you can do it. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Even if I had to pay for it like get grants and pay for it later, as long as I don’t go get a fifty thousand dollar college education. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, I guess I’m not really worried about the money part. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s just uh, just doing it. And it made me feel very happy to think about actually going away to school. So, I’d work, go to school, live on my own, that I’d have something to live for, and everybody else will just have to take care of themselves. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Um, so it sounds like the big decisions you’re facing are where do you go? What do you do? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And do you get a divorce or a trial separation?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Or you stay home and [NAME OTHER] move out?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, it sounds like you have a lot of options.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And it’s just a matter, like you said, focusing on the goal and setting what you want to do.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. And the time frame does look like it might, it would be [NAME OTHER] last…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So are you thinking you would start school next fall also then?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think so.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] application deadlines for colleges too then.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you know what the deadline is for [DEIDENTIFIED]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, oh, yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Or if they have a deadline?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, you know what, I’m not thinking because I’m so busy concentrating on [NAME OTHER] that, that would set me back another year which I, that’s right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It could potentially, or you might still be able to apply for the fall if that’s what you want to do.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. That’s right. Oh, you know, my, yeah, that might set me back a year. Then I can always go to community college or something. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But that’s right, it would because I’m not thinking, every things going on right now for, for, the next…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> For this fall.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> For fall. Right, of course. Because like [DEIDENTIFIED] wanted, would like it if by December uh, then the next deadline is like February is the absolute deadline is like March fifteenth. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And, I’m not ready, that’s right, I was thinking I’d be a year behind her, so that does set me back, and as far as when, if my grandson went back to [DEIDENTIFIED] and my daughter went away to college, the thought of living in the house alone with my husband just freaks me out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is [NAME OTHER] going back to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, he doesn’t want to.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But, you never know. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, because he still might still be just like, you know what? I, I need to go home. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But if. And, it’s because my husband wants a girl’s gone wild, you know what that it? You ever see those horrible infomercials for girls flashing everything? That’s what my husband wants. That’s the kind of…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He wants the…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Of person he wants me to be. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And if I lived alone with him, I’d say it would, would require things like walking around the house naked, I mean it would be required it would be like his fantasy or something and I don’t want to be his little fantasy wife.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And it makes me feel, because it’s a demand. It’s like, all right you said when all the kids moved out we could walk around the house naked and stuff and I’m not saying its bad, but I’m just saying it’s, it feels like this is what I want, you have to do it, you have no choices or I’ll make you miserable. So basically I think that’s why I want out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, yeah I need, I need to stay focused and not keep thinking that every things okay because you get too comfortable with yourself in your house. I’ve lived in that house as long as I ever lived anywhere in my whole life.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How long?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> About fifteen years. I’ve never lived anywhere that long.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you and [NAME OTHER] been married how many years now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Twenty six. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, you’ve gotten used to a certain way of living?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And it could be easy to continue that same, [INAUDIBLE] you would if you didn’t make some changes?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. I have to make changes and just forget that everything didn’t turn out the way I wanted. So oh well. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME] sometimes, that happens in life, things don’t go the way we expect, the key then it to make adjustments. And we make changes or do we just let things keep going the way they’re going. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That will be pretty bad. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What I hear over and over again from you it’s not making you happy.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re not content, you’re not satisfied with your life, it’s not what you want. And I hear that you, when you talk about going back to school, you actually get excited and you feel enthusiastic about it. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. And I used to blame it, thinking I’m Bipolar, but then I realized, it wasn’t my Bipolar, I mean bipolar accentuated it. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The marriage and everything I went through and how I felt, I just realized, oh, I always thought it was me and it was him triggering me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I think it was both, and yes you have Bipolar disorder and that’s an issue but since you’ve got it pretty well stabilized, now you’re looking at the other issues in your life too. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> His alcoholism and how he affects you. That’s important. Because yeah, if you just blame yourself and say it’s all my Bipolar, you’re never going to be able to make changes when they need to be made.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Gotcha.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, a couple things I’ve heard you say to me that I think are critical, one is you know, pick a goal, settle on a goal and focus on it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s a big one. And, and do some planning ahead because things are going to take some time, whatever you decide...</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> To do now. Also you know, I’d encourage you to think about [DEIDENTIFIED]. Because I think it might be not only a real good support system but also, it’s a way of getting other ideas and also, people may have other suggestions for you, I mean, if a woman left her husband and went to college she may say, hey, here’s some things you can do that will make it easier for you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I suspect there are a lot people who have been in the same situation you’re in right now that have been through it that might be able to give you some advice or help. And, again, just going and listening you may hear things that are helpful. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What, you just look it up in the phone book or?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I believe you just look it up in the phone book, if you have any trouble finding a number let me know and I’ll get one for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m sure.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME], another thing that’s important is medication, it is important to do your best to stick with it because if you start forgetting it, you start having more mood swings it will make it even harder to achieve your goals.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Right, I have to stick with my medication.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Does that sound…?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah I…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Like a good plan?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Basically just stay focused of my goal… </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And just give up the idea that anything, things are not going to change.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME], remember that you have choices here, you don’t have to tolerate things the way they are.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you come up with a lot of different options which I think is wonderful. And they’re all, you know, reasonable, viable options it sounds like. It’s just a matter of deciding what’s going to work best for you and going for it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And also, have you had the conversation with [NAME OTHER] where you may not do this when [NAME OTHER]’s still there, but where you basically tell him how you feel, if he needs to drink, then you don’t want to be married anymore.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not, I think it’s, it’s a given. And it, well, it was brought up before, now I’m just being quiet because it doesn’t do any good to have a conversation. Uh, it will just turn into a fight so…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m not going to have that conversation until I’m, everything’s all set in place and I’m ready for what, whatever reaction.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I understand. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He does.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. I understand and I think it’s wise to have options in place.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, escape, whatever or just be completely ready and to say okay…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did that include you think, talking to an attorney about your options? Do you think that would be helpful?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That, that would, that would be if I actually was going to get a divorce.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay or a legal separation?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because, he has told me in the past, okay let’s not get a divorce, I got to figure out what his ulterior motive is. And we’ll just be separated and we don’t need a divorce I said well, okay what if a woman comes along in your life, she’s like you know what, hey, uh, your wife is blah, blah, blah, and uh, you need to stop giving her money and you need to you know, oh why are you thinking that way, that far in the future [INAUDIBLE] you know?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You do want to think about protecting yourself.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It has to all be legal. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and again, [PATIENT NAME] do you know people that have been legally separated for years because that’s what the wife in this one case, the wife wanted that because it allowed her to maintain her insurance benefits and certain things that were important, even though, she and her husband lived apart for years, that’s why I wondered would it be useful to talk to an attorney just to find out what your legal options are. And I don’t know who to recommend but I know there are attorneys who do like free consultations the first time. You don’t have to pay them hundreds of dollars just to ask some questions. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Well, I know someone who is a lawyer.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So I can ask her for a recommendation. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah it might be worth one of the things to consider in your list off options. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But why, what’s the point of being legally separated and why would you actually?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because what it does if you decide uh, at least as I understand it, for this lady, she didn’t want to live with her husband anymore, she was unhappy being married to him but there were certain legal protection that she wanted and if she divorced him she would lose some of those.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And she wanted to keep those benefits, like health insurance, and I can’t remember what the other benefits were, that she would maintain if she was still married but separated, but she would lose them if she was divorced. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So for her, she thought it made more legal sense to be legally separated. And again, that’s where you would really need an attorney to try to help you understand how to best protect yourself.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right because I kind of have a fear of all this hard work and all of a sudden I’m out on the curb with nothing at my age. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s why you want to be careful and protect yourself because if there’s, I’ve seen some devastating things happen to women when they went through a divorce. Who didn’t get good legal advice and the husbands just manipulated the heck out of them.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And they were really left with nothing. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it’s funny when you’re in your thirties, you could just walk out start from zero, but when you’re older, you worry more…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it’s harder.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I guess. Your mind really changes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah well. It’s a different situation, so. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well [PATIENT NAME] we’re going to have to stop, is there anything else before we stop today that you want to talk about?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-uh, no.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, and you’re doing okay with refills?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]</P>

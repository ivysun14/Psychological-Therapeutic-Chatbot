<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here we go. Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. First things first, you know I need some recommendations for prescribers [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . what I've done here, I still don't [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. Yeah, think I have not gotten those to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Let me make myself a note.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you'll [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I will e-mail you like by tonight.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I appreciate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Any preferences? I mean, honestly, like it's hard to find somebody. Well, okay, first question — nah, that's really irrelevant. I mean do you have any particular, [apart from what you want to generate] (ph) or anything that [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right, I will, yeah, sorry, I will get back to you [overlapping voices] [00:01:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . today, all right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Big sigh) Well I don't know whether to start with work stuff that I've been tripping over myself over or stuff my parents and my sister or my interview yesterday or I don't even know, so (both chuckling). I don't remember what we talked about last Thursday, so I'm not sure if there is a starting to be picked up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would like to start with whatever seems like forefront in your mind at the moment. [00:02:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well so I had this hour, luncheon hour, a day-long interview yesterday, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . for, again, five-hour long slots [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and I thought they all went horribly badly, and I felt like I failed and did not really answer the technical questions well, and did not really present myself as someone who knows this material. There were several times when someone asked me a question and I was like "I know I should know that but I'm blanking on the answer right now". I just, I don't know (sounding upset). But I described the whole interview in detail to Dave afterwards and it took me an hour to go through the whole [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . postmortem. And he was like "that actually sounds like a pretty good interview". I was like "well, okay". So clearly, I don't know if this is a difference between our fields or if this is just a case of I tend to underrate myself or, uh, yeah, I don't know, but. [00:03:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm confident about the second one being true. I don't know about the first one (both chuckling). [00:03:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, um, so the hiring manager, who did not do any of my interviews, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . came to talk to me after I was done with all five interviews.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know I asked, kind of casually, partway through the conversation, well like when he asked me how I thought it went and I said, "Oh, I think it went pretty well. Have any of your people gotten back to you yet?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was like "I haven't had a chance to talk to any of them, except Joel, but he thought that interview went fairly well." So like and that's [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . the one that I thought I'd failed the most miserably on, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he thought you good and did he say anything (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or maybe not, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . or maybe he was just like throwing up a smokescreen, didn't want to give away the results yet until they have a chance to talk to HR, I don't know, yeah (ph), so there's that. And I keep dwelling over questions that I answered wrong. I actually spent quite some time last night looking up in my textbooks the answers to some of the questions that I didn't know instantly, which Dave told me was a giant waste of time. [00:04:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Fine, okay] (ph). Was it helpful?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean if I ever get asked those exact same questions it could be extremely helpful (both chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that why you looked them up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Probably not, (long pause), I mean that's certainly why I told myself I was looking them up, instead of doing something more useful or you know more fun. But you know if I'm honest with myself, it was mostly a way to say, you idiot, this answer is totally obvious in hindsight, why didn't you know this? [00:05:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm (other sighing)! Which, I guess, begs the question of why you'd want to do something that would make you feel that way? (Other sighing) Which is the sort of thing people do [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . sometimes, but [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's certainly the sort of thing I do a lot [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . of the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Certainly (both chuckling). Well what comes to mind about wanting to put yourself in that sort of position?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I don't know. [Silence from [00:05:56] to 00:06:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what else comes into your mind, in general?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Long pause) I was talking to Dave last night over dinner and he mentioned that you know he reads this blog that's written by a lawyer, and this lawyer went back to his alma mater and asked for employment statistics. And it turns out that you know in that state there were like five open jobs for every hundred graduates this law school was graduating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know he was saying "you know I wonder if your sister" — my sister is in her last year of school, is graduating in May, so he said, "I wonder if your sister knows about this?" And I was like "if she didn't before, I'm sure she's figured it out by now since she's job hunting". [00:07:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just led to us talking about my sister, um, and Dave asked me if my sister you know had the same kind of crazy expectations put on her, as a kid, as I did. And I was like, "Well I was expected to be surgeon general and my sister was expected to be a CEO of a Fortune 500 Company, so you know not the same but (other chuckling) the same level of crazy maybe (chuckling)."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we were talking about that and, (pause) there was this huge thing at Christmas. I don't know if I told you about Christmas and my youngest sister calling and telling us all we were selfish bitches, and drama over moving her new TV into her new apartment, and my sisters getting into a fistfight over some makeup in the parking lot of my other sister's apartment building?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something about makeup is ringing a bell (other chuckling). [00:08:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was a lot of crazy (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) the, what night was that? I think it was Christmas night or maybe it was Boxing Day, I can't remember, but it was the night, it was Christmas night and my younger sister was in Missouri; she was working a 12 to midnight shift that night and the rest of the family was found at my parent's house having Christmas dinner, and there was massive drama. It would probably take too long to describe all of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: True.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it completely distracted, the dinnertime and post dinnertime drama, and then Dave fleeing and me fleeing and needing to calm each other down, completely distracted from some earlier drama that day, which Dave was not aware of until we talked about it last night, in which while my mom and my sister and I were preparing Christmas dinner and Dave and my dad and my sister Heidi like were all in the living room playing with their various computers and being antisocial, as they all have a tendency to do. [00:09:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, m-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My dad is just antisocial, Jeremy and Dave are both very introverted. So they were all off in their own little world and my mom started yelling at my sister about how, "You know before you married Jeremy you were so ambitious and you wanted to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 Company. And Jeremy has killed all of your ambitions and you're going to get a crappy job and you're going to be a professional failure because you're not ambitious anymore. And I wish you could see what Jeremy is doing to you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my sister's response, um, of course, my mom's frothing and anger was much more coherent than that; that's the executive summary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the executive summary of my sister's response is, "You know when I was little you and Dad made it sound like if you weren't earning seven figures you were practically in the poorhouse and so, of course, I wanted to be a CEO, so it's the only job you can have where you easily earn seven figures. And now that I'm living on my husband's income, and you know spending half our money on school tuition, I realize you actually can live on like (other chuckling) 60 or 70 thousand dollars a year and it's not that bad." [00:10:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "And I want to have a family, and I was a secretary for a CEO at a large Fortune-500-size company and being the CEO is a really shitty job, it's really stressful and my boss never saw their family, and I want something different for my life." And like my mom just kept saying, "You know Jeremy has ruined you; he's made you less smart, he's made you less ambitious, he has no ambitions himself. What's wrong with you?"</p>

<p>And I mean I don't like Jeremy and I could give you a laundry list of things that are wrong (chuckling) with him, but I don't think my sister was wrong about this but they just kept arguing over this until they were both screaming. And like my mom's face was red and like her eyes were bugging out and the vein in her forehead was throbbing, and my sister was sobbing and like snot was pouring down her face and they were both screaming. And apparently, Dave completely missed this. He did not realize this was my [chronic home] (ph), [overlapping voices] [00:11:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . until I told him about it last night. I was like "you were right there".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where was he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was right in the living room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the layout of my parent's house, there's a kitchen breakfast nook that opens up into the family room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My parents are very much a fan of like open-layout houses. I know they're not a fan of doors of walls much, to my misfortune as a teenager (slight chuckle). So like Dave was like 15 feet away, like but he was off in his own world. And I guess it just goes to show how crazy my family is, that he could just ignore someone, two people screaming and crying (whispering) 15 feet away from you, good God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, so remembering that and talking about it was upsetting. And then we got home from dinner and opened the mail, and my parents had sent me a birthday card a week and a half late, of course, even though they throw a hissy fit I acknowledge their birthdays late or even you know after 7:00 p.m., he thinks, "My God, what kind of monster are you?" [00:12:08]</p>

<p>And they sent me a check for my birthday, which you know was all well and good, but the amount of the check was the same amount as the traditional amount my grandparents would send us for our birthdays before they died. And throughout high school and even college and maybe before that, I don't remember, maybe, but anyway, whatever the timeline was, you know when I was in high school I definitely remember this was the amount that we always got for birthdays and Christmas from Granny and Papa because they decided it was entirely too hard to actually pick out gifts for teenagers so they would just send a check instead and that would be easier, which was always disappointing to me but that's another story. But my parents would constantly bitch that you know, "How could they send so little money?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:13:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: "You know they're retired, their house is paid for, they don't have any expenses"; "they're getting free money from Social Security" and "they are so stingy" and "how could they", and it was just this whole rant about how. I was like my grandmother worked for a phone company, my grandfather was in the military, until he retired, and then he drove a fucking bus, it's not like they were rolling in dough when they were working, and once they retired were on a fixed income.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't understand any of this when I was in high school but yet, on hindsight, I'm like Social Security (whispering) doesn't give you that much. And even if your mortgage is paid for there's still you know doctor's bills and co-pays for prescriptions and food, and it's just like here's her son talking hypocritical, that they bitched about how little my grandparents sent to them and they give me the same amount when they're both still working and between them usually earning like 300 thousand dollars a year, which is far more than Social Security, okay. [00:14:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not even that the amount of the check matters to me, but [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right but like hypocrisy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's not even that I want them to give me a bigger gift, but I want to (pause), I know this was impossible, but what I really want is for them to never have maligned my grandparents for being stingy, which you know obviously is impossible because time doesn't work that way, but [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . it just makes me feel like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everybody's talking about what you want, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (both chuckling). (Pause) So, yeah, there's that (whispering) [stuff about your] (ph) parents. And when there's work stuff from my advisor, which is just (sighing) for the last week I've been stuck on this one task, which is I have this offer Q-3-D (ph), and I have three different designs in Q-3-D of the three different circuits. [00:15:00]</p>

<p>And I realized working on Circuit A, a week and a half ago, that I had all of the material properties for the silicon wrong, so I edited the materials library. And so I recalculated silicon's rectoscopy (ph) conductivity, edited the materials library and said, "Okay, instead of having silicon have a rectoscopy of 10 thousand, it's actually 7,500, etc., etc." And then I tried to edit the library for circuits B and C because they're using the same materials, just a different shape essentially.</p>

<p>And I couldn't find any way to just copy the whole materials library file because the software sucks and I probably burned like four hours trying to find a way to copy the material library. Because I shouldn't have to do this by hand, because and to think things by hand in more than one place is a great way to produce errors and mistakes and inconsistencies, but I couldn't figure it out. And so really to get started on the next piece of work I need to do, I need to just open up the other two materials libraries and edit them by hand, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . which would take you know 15 minutes at most. [00:16:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I keep sitting there, because I've already calculated the numbers and I have them written down in my notes, so it's just a matter of opening the file and erasing a typo, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then type them both in, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . like three numbers per file. And I haven't done it yet because it just burns me that there's no way to do this automatically. And it's like I can't count the number of times I've sat down an looked at the computer and opened the software and just couldn't bring myself to open the materials library editor and just do it and get it done with and move on with my life. And it has been a week (chuckling) stuck with this 15-minute task and I'm just, I don't know how to just — I don't know, I'm angry and frustrated with myself. Because when I'm saying it out loud it sounds really stupid, but like (pause) I feel really stupid saying this here but (sighing) [overlapping voices] [00:17:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I suppose if I can't tell my shrink I can't really help that, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . right, and then I remember [well us] (ph) saying you can't tell people how dumb I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, hmm. [Silence from [00:17:19] to 00:17:41] You know I'm not sure what to say or to make of this yet, except that this all involves you being really pissed off (chuckling). I mean mostly at yourself [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . but at your parents, at the software.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. [Silence from [00:17:57] to 00:18:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're not just being pissed off, I guess it's being pissed off at something that seems unreasonably wretched, like pissed off about things that seem unnecessarily problematic. I guess that that makes me think of what you said at first about going to look up the answers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm a little [upset at] (ph) like, kind of silly that you could feel stupid, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . so you could sort of make the story about how you obviously should've known [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . once you'd seen the answers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's just inconsistent with the rest of it, although I'm not sure yet what else to say about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [Silence from [00:19:03] to 00:19:15] What other thoughts do you have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Silence from [00:19:16] to 00:19:23] I don't know. I think (pause), despite the evidence of you know me being reasonably smart and able to read instructions and search the instruction manuals and having spent four hours looking for a way to automate this, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . there is still a part of me that thinks of the notion that it doesn't make sense for their not to be a way to automate this. So clearly there is, I just haven't found it yet because I'm too stupid to figure it out. Like there's got to be a magic knob somewhere or you know put this file in the search where you know it will get repeated (ph); there's got to be something but (sighing). And it's demoralizing that I can't figure out how to automate it [overlapping voices] [00:20:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . (pause) because it should be obvious. And because it should be obvious and I haven't figured it out, clearly the problem is with me and not with the software. Because it should be obvious, right, which means it is obvious; I just can't see it because I'm dumb.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I realize, in reality that logic was torturous but [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's offering (ph) my logic is more interesting (chuckling). Do you know what I mean? Like in this kind of setting, like doing things don't make sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's something, in a way, more interesting going on. [Silence from [00:20:58] to 00:21:47] Well what else? [Silence from [00:21:48] to 00:22:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so there's this (sighing), almost religious in its intensity, divide between two different counts the computer needs (ph). There's the camp who thinks you know the right way to do something is just the way that (pause) gets it done in a sustainable way; so you know you write a script that is comprehensible, in case someone else needs to pick up your work, and you use tools that are commonly used that everyone knows how to use. And then there's the camp of you know 'fucking weenie ninjas' I call them, who want to use the most obscure tools possible; and you know why write a script that takes ten lines and is comprehensible to other people, when you can write a line of god-awful clock (ph) code that no one is ever going to be able to figure out, not even yourself ten minutes after you write it. [00:23:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (sighing) I actually got into this argument with one of interviewers yesterday, which is why it's on the top of my head. He asked me what programming languages I knew and I said, "Python, maybe a little bit of Pearl." And he was like, "Well what about SED (ph) and AUC (ph), they're so powerful?" And I was like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was the first one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: SED.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: SED.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "They might be powerful but you know one out of a thousand people have even heard of them, much less knows how to use the damn thing (both chuckling). And I actually got into this argument with him, but I realized that this thing I'm trying to do with my Q-3-D, I am trying to find the clever, elegant solution, instead of just the solution that gets it done and allows me to move on. And that's frustrating because I don't like to think of myself as you know those fucking weenies who really you know can't just live in the real world with the rest of us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. What did you call it, ninja attack weenies? [00:24:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Weenie ninjas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Weenie ninjas.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like they like to think of themselves as ninjas but they're really not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [Silence from [00:24:14] to 00:24:28] It doesn't seem the same to me but maybe there's something I'm misunderstanding. Because it seems like part of what's going on with the weenie ninjas is that they're like haughty. I mean there's a sense of superiority about doing it in the most obscure way possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not the sense I'm getting from you about, and maybe I'm [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . mishearing it, but it just doesn't sound like you want to do it that way because it's better. It just sounds like you feel like that's something you should be able to do. [00:25:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you're mad at it because it's not working the way it's supposed to. Like your car's not, your car is stuck and won't start and you're getting out and like kicking it because — it's just more like that to me (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I don't know, maybe there's more, and maybe it must feel more similar to you in some way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [Silence from [00:25:32] to 00:26:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder what you would feel, if you didn't feel so frustrated and mad, mostly at yourself, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . and I wonder what you'd feel if you didn't feel so much of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Long pause) That's a good question, I don't know. [Silence from [00:26:52] to 00:27:05] So I even think of my history as broken up into personal eras. There is the era of living in Indiana; so there is the era of Alabama; and there is middle school; and then there was the juggling, both Debate and Science Olympiad era; and then there is senior year, which was just Science Olympiad; and then there is college, and Japan and post Japan. And for most of them, if I try to think about you know what was the — what were some of the defining factors of each of those periods, there was always something I was angry at.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Long pause) And I know I've certainly read this in a bunch of books. I read lots of books. I read a ton of them when I was a kid. [00:28:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't have very many friends and I would like blast through you know 10 or 15 library books a week. I read [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . really fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I was in middle school and high school I just had nothing else to do with my time. That rate has dropped quite a bit since college and working and actually having friends and a life [inaudible at 00:28:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But in a lot of (pause) books, especially the kind of books I read, there's this whole notion that you know anger drives the hero forward. Like anger at some great injustice causes him to go on the hero's journey and you know become the hero. And you know my dad also now was a very angry (breathless chuckle) person, unsurprisingly, and you know he would explicitly say that anger was what got him out of the refugee camps and into his career. [00:28:59]</p>

<p>And he tells these stories about you know times he got angry and you know kind of tells them with a sense of pride, the fact that he got angry and lost his temper. And it's really (long pause) so I don't know, I'm thinking maybe I internalize this notion that anger is kind of the motivating force behind human behavior. But it's not as if I have you know a great, overwhelming, oppressive force to be angry at, I mean apart from my parents, but you know for the longest time I wasn't able to actually be angry at them without feeling guilty. So I don't know what I thought I was driving myself with but there's, I mean it's not like I grew up in a refugee camp and can't (ph) you know, anger at the injustice of the universe to drive me out of the situation. I've had a reasonably well off middleclass lifestyle my whole life, most of my life. [00:30:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would certainly describe things materially.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. [Silence from [00:30:06] to 00:30:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kinds of stories does your father tell about his anger that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When he was first in the US, before he became a citizen he had this work visa of some type but I can't remember what kind it was, but he had a supervisor who was a total jerk to him. You know my dad was a resident and doctors were assholes to residents by and large.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my dad got fed up and like told his boss off and said, "I'm quitting because you're an asshole and I'm going to find someone else to do my residency with." And the guy was like, "You can't do that. We hold your work visa." [00:30:58]</p>

<p>And my dad yelled at him and said, "You know I'll go right to the immigration officer and tell them everything you've done to me, and tell them you know they can take my visa but I am not going to work under these circumstances." And apparently, like he actually did (slight chuckle), got into a shouting match with both his boss and his immigration officer, and somehow it worked out and he got to keep his visa and transferred his residency to someone else. But like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . he'll talk about how he you know got so angry he started shouting, and that's what changed people's minds because they saw his fiery passion. That's not something to be proud of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like I imagine this may be true for a lot of those stories, it certainly seems true, but I think you've said that the only like possible like dignified thing to do was to be incredibly pissed off. [00:32:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I can always, it makes me think of like he always feels so incredibly insulted and belittled — [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I think (whispering).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . yeah — that the only way to maintain any shred of dignity and self-respect is to be incredibly angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) You know he hasn't talk to his brother for like 12 years and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . he cut off both his sisters (long pause). I hardly ever talk to him even and he's just — and my youngest sister doesn't talk to him, unless she wants money from him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't blame her. He's done — he's been far more horrible to her than he has to me or our middle sister. He routinely tells her he wishes they'd had an abortion instead of having her. [00:33:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's pretty — that's really horrible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is really horrible. [Silence from [00:33:20] to 00:33:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was about to say, the thing that kills me is that people, no one has called him on it and told him that's horrible, but I haven't called him on it either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know why, other than (pause), well I do know why. If I said you know, "Dad that's really horrible. I can't believe you said that. That's you know absolutely like unacceptable." He would scream and yell about how I had no respect for him. [00:34:01]</p>

<p>And then Mom and my middle sister would start saying that you know, "Can't we all just get along. We just want to have one nice family visit." And, "He's your father and he's done so much for you and you should respect him." And it's just (pause) — and my, I've never gotten along with either of my sisters very well, so then defending my sister isn't as important to me as not having the weight of all of that drama fall on me, which is really horrible and selfish but I mean she's my sister and she's essentially defenseless and (sighing) I don't know. I hate my family. I really hate them all. They're all horrible people. [00:34:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think you know [like our deal] (ph) is not for our therapy of him, but I do imagine that like one way that hatred works is, it's like I mean that's your family and the only way to deal with how, [he might] (ph) think, like humiliating that feels to you and how bad you feel about so many things that have happened [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . [or you see] (ph). [Silence from [00:35:22] to 00:35:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or doesn't that seem like part of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. [Silence from [00:35:35] to 00:35:47] Yeah, I don't (long pause), I'm not sure how much of my feelings right now are reaction about the way they've treated me personally and how much is that I actually find their value systems morally repulsive, um, [that it's false] (ph), but I'm not sure in what proportion. [Silence from [00:36:10] to 00:36:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And can you say more about that? [Silence from [00:36:37] to 00:36:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, (long pause) this whole attitude my parents have of "wealth is the only thing that matters, it's the only indicator of success that matters and, furthermore, politically we don't care what else a candidate might say or do, we only care about what's going to lower our taxes and you know we want all of these benefits".</p>

<p>Like they will get incredibly aggrieved and angry and call and write angry letters, if you know a pothole isn't repaired quickly enough; or you know the schools aren't providing enough opportunities for the kids; or you know, god forbid, they be asked to you know pay for renting the bus if we have a weekend tournament to go to and the school provides the bus; but they'll vote against tax increases for the schools; they'll vote against tax increases for infrastructure. [00:37:53]</p>

<p>They'll vote for you know slashing budgets to save money on taxes, and it's just it's so fucking hypocritical and (sighing), and the fact that they just don't care about anything except their money. And you know (pause) my dad actually voted for someone who is running for a local election who wanted to make it illegal to build mosques in the county.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my god (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Then what the fuck, you are voting against your self-interest in a really blatantly obvious way here and you're just — and because that person was in favor of lower taxes."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just un-fucking believable and just (sighing), I don't know, I find it completely and totally morally bankrupt. And, especially the way you know they don't care whether my sisters and I are happy, they only care whether we're successful, and by successful they mean rich. [00:39:06]</p>

<p>And (pause) then my dad has the nerve to complain about his brother, who you know his brother's kids all have arranged marriages, and his brother you know cozied up to families that were wealthier than he was in order to marry his kids off to wealthy partners. And you know my dad complained about how you know his brother would snub him at parties because he was too busy kissing up to the rich people and he you know sold his daughters to the highest bidder. But they have the same fucking values. It's just that you know my dad [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . pursues people of having rich kids by pushing us to earn it ourselves instead of marrying us off to rich partners. But like the end goal of you know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . having lots of money is the same. And how (pausing and sighing), yeah, just (long pause) [overlapping voices] [00:40:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess it's not the sort of thing that makes you okay about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or like important as a human being, I would think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) I told you about this fit of rage I had at one point in high school, where I took away all my trophies and medals and threw them in a box in the basement?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was another incident, where you know, for the one and only time, I actually brought home a report card that was all A+s and yet there was no room for my parents to say "straight As, where are the pluses?" because they actually were (both chuckling) all A+s. [00:41:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they were like "we didn't expect anything less" and I was just furious and I tore it up into little pieces and said — I don't remember what I said but I remember tearing it up into little pieces and just like running to my room and slamming the door and flinging myself on the bed and sobbing uncontrollably for quite a while. I was just (sighing — long pause) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it that you felt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Huffing sigh) Unloved [silence from [00:41:36] to 00:41:47] and angry. I felt like there is this implicit contract that if I gave them what they wanted they would show me affection, and they didn't and that was you now they reneged on the contract, and that was not okay. [00:42:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess, for you, it wasn't bout the A+s, per se; it was about the contract and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . the affection you wanted from them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They told me they were disappointed that I only graduated seventh in my class out of 600, instead of valedictorian. [Silence from [00:42:36] to 00:42:50] I felt awful about that (pause) for years afterwards, before I finally realized that it truly doesn't matter. [00:43:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm. [Silence from [00:43:00] to 00:43:17] Did you pretty much always feel unloved?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Long pause) I think so (questioningly) but I'm not sure. If there was a time when I felt sure that my parents loved me, I'm not remembering it right now, but that doesn't mean that it (sighing) didn't [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We got to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About [inaudible at 00:43:45] [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . by tonight about prescribers [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . and then we'll talk more tomorrow [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . [about that] (ph). [00:43:59]</p>

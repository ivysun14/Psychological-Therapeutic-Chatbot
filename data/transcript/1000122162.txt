<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Testing testing. Testing testing. Interview 17.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I decided I'm going to let you talk this time. That's why we had those preparatory cabinets (ph). Yeah I had mentioned earlier already that when I was home this weekend, well I thought mostly about the sexual problems since I've seen you last. But exclusively, as far as we're concerned, I've sort of past the other part of our work. And all the grandma and aunts and everyone was there and it was all apple pie and motherhood and the flag. Fourth of July of all, you know. It was very back home-ish.</p>

<p>And, I really felt comfortable. You know there are times when it's good to go back home. And I realized then that there's no way in the world I could behave ostensibly, anyway but normally sexually. There's just no way. [0:01:05.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At home you're talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anywhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I say ostensibly I mean for anyone else. In other words I couldn't become a member of the gay allele (ph) or things like that. There's just no way because I would ruin all that. And that's a big part of my life. I mean I was growing up with...I grew up with a relatively tight family. And despite the fact that they're people in that family that I just didn't, you know. There are features about them that I just despise. Like I have aunts that are the most blatant bigots you've ever seen.</p>

<p>But nevertheless I love them all, and that's part of my life and I really had a good time and there's no way in the world that I would disappoint them. So therefore I've got to resolve...I have now established the fact that ultimately my behavior will be normal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you would lose that whole part of your life with your family and so you decided, "Well I will not become homosexual."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or bisexual. Because there's always been an attraction to females. I don't think any homosexual would be. [0:02:18.0]</p>

<p>But anyhow, so with that in mind then I've got to look at everything else that has transpired. And besides if... well I don't know what it's..."if that's what I've got to live with" is not a good way to word it because then you act like you're putting up with something. Whereas I don't really know if I'm putting up with something. Maybe I'm solving something.</p>

<p>But at any rate, the major conclusion of the weekend is that I'm going to have to live with it. Then the question is whether one suppresses or whether one just lives with fantasies and doesn't let it go beyond that, and that's where I'm at right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you do with those feelings, even though your behavior is...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Is it more healthy and more content for me to live with them or try to suppress them and try to [get them far away] (ph). I don't know. And another strange thing is (inaudible at 0:03:15.5) came to this conclusion, is the fact that I think once I've, if I get into a love relationship with a girl that also involves sex, then I don't think...I really think the problem will not be...I just think that I'll overcome it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It will pretty much just drop out of existence.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. And one other observation I made is that when I make observations it takes me a long time to make and I might come here and tell them to you in 5 minutes and that's it. (chuckle) But that's, those are the observations that I've made.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Period.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. That's it. See you next week. No, so now I just got to work it out. What do I want to do with it? And I think the best thing that could possibly happen to me now is...well it's hard to...see I'm leaving the country like in a year so I don't want to get serious with anyone. So any relationship that I'm entering into now is flavored with the idea that this is temporary. So that's not going to help.</p>

<p>But, another thing that I'm...as the society changes so am I, pretty much. In many instances, sort of the disenchantment with marriage has certainly gotten to me and most of my friends. Most of my unmarried friends. And I don't see that as a viable alternative in the near future. In the next five years or so.</p>

<p>So all these things are sort of tearing at me, and I'm trying to settle down now and they don't quite fit together. Well no they don't fit together at all. I finish (ph) constructing the thesis. That's what it boils down to. [0:05:11.0]</p>

<p>We might explore the two alternatives — that is suppression or tolerance. It's so hard to come up with a word like tolerance. Well it's so bad to come up with a word like tolerance because tolerance implies something that you don't want. That's not the word what I...if that's what's right for me is to live with something like this then fine. To live with it, not necessarily to tolerate it or put up with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tolerate sounds negative.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I want to do what is...what will make me feel comfortable with myself. And I know from this weekend that comfortable with myself would be comfortable ostensibly with these people. That is to say there will be no outward change in what people know about my sexual behavior. If there is any change at all.</p>

<p>So, I have to think about what living that way entails and what suppressing entails. Suppressing anything would be unhealthy. And I think I'll have a major problem. See one of the reasons I think it may have occurred is the fact that I haven't had a meaningful relationship lately and I've been alone somewhat lately. I lived alone in the dorm and now I've got roommates that are away a lot. And I'm afraid that that circumstance will continue for a little while in France, just because of the fact that it's going to take me several months to polish off my language. So I think the climate will be ripe for continuation over there, especially since the fact that I will not have...there's no way in the world I can develop a sphere of friends fast with number one — absolutely no one that I know and number two — initial problems communicating which I realize will exist. [0:07:14.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what you're doing is trying to prepare for a period of kind of being alone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I'm wondering what that's going to do to me sexually. I could always, what I generally come up with or what I could come up with is just get lost in my work, which is not hard. You know I could just put in 14 hour days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is possibly not too hard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right now...I did that last week a couple days. It's no problem. You just decide to work evenings and that's it. But, yeah it's going to be an unusual time in the next couple of years. And it will be interesting what happens.</p>

<p>I think...I don't really think we can resolve what will happen. I think we can decide that....decide what guidelines I will follow, at different junctions. And the major one I come up with of course is the fact that...well (inaudible at 0:08:25.9) I will behave in public heterosexually. There's just no way that I would behave any other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's the private part that you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well public and private is not a good way to word it. See I consider now my behavior is somewhat abnormal. Again as societies (inaudible at 0:08:48.1) mine change. I'm pretty much a victim of society anyhow.</p>

<p>So, as it gets more and more...as you don't consider different sexual behaviors abnormal, too much anymore. They're considered less and less sicknesses and more and more different manifestations of the way a human behaves. I'm sort of feeling that way too. But when I say publicly and privately, I don't mean that...I don't mean to go quite as far as to say publicly and privately. What I mean is publicly and privately may be in head, whether I...with myself thinking these things or with myself not. I'm almost completely resolved of the, or come to the conclusion that any acts will be heterosexual or left out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I want you to be sincere (ph) to your own feelings about it. [0:09:49.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's what [comes to ground] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And are you saying too you're feeling a little less abnormal about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Frankly I think about quote issues. I think very little for myself. Well again nobody has ever come up with original ideas. But when I hear different views, if they make sense, you know I'll read something, "Oh that make sense." I might follow that for a while. And the things that make sense to me that better minds think of are the things that I generally end up with. And I don't think that's a major [parent of less people] (ph). Fewer people thought they were original thinkers [were in a lot better place] (ph).</p>

<p>And right now I'm sort of agreeing with a trend of thought. I have agreed with a trend of thought that it is healthy for a person to behave this way. And it's certainly not a crime. And it may not even be abnormal. It's just another [further little along] (ph). [0:11:01.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Another kind of sexual expression that you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But then balanced against that...and all you see, all the time I'm confronted with political versus personal decisions. I mean you know, the politically proper and all argued for (inaudible at 0:11:21.3) I should have been a conscientious objector. But it turned out was I could use it [with paperwork] (ph). So I got out of it that way.</p>

<p>And that's the same sort of thing I'm toying with now. You see I know politically I can argue 100 percent why I should be bisexual. If that's the way I have feelings right now, and it's completely normal, why not behave that way? But then on the personal level I come up with the conclusion that, well how could you possibly explain this to an 87 year old aunt or your parents? It just doesn't...it sort of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have these two conflicting values which are express how you feel no matter how it strikes other people and act within the boundaries of how the people you care about can accept.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And it's just basically, well it's cowardice is what it boils down to. I will understand why something should be done but I will never have the guts to do it myself really. But I'm just going to have to live with that I guess. [0:12:36.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it feels like not standing up for your own beliefs.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a poor way to word it because you see...well let's not talk about...we'll talk about values. Do I value an honest personal sexual behavior? Or do I value, the relationships I have with family and friends now? And I value them both sort of but balance against the two, if I have...if I can't have a satisfying sexual heterosexual life and a family and friends that would not consider me quote abnormal. But I'll take two rather than the one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that still leaves you feeling like a coward to make that choice?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let me think. It's hard to say that I feel like a coward about it because coward is such a bad connotation and I realize I made it that way just riding (ph) on the line, you know? Whenever, like with this conscientious objector thing and...oh it's all sorts of time when you're talking to...like their always...I don't know how to go into it. It's not having trouble saying it, I'm having trouble thinking of an example.</p>

<p>I can lie through my teeth to people. Well wait a minute. Now we're right back to problem number one aren't we? Yeah, I can lie through my teeth to people just to sort of agree with them and it's a coward's way out. But it leaves for better meshing socially. Things work better socially. And that's what we spent the first 15 sessions on. [0:14:27.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that part doesn't seem negative to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't seem to be...I guess I shouldn't have used cowardice but no, it doesn't seem to be a coward's way of behaving. It's funny how everything fits together because we went in a big circle there. Yeah that is interesting. My gosh, doing (ph) the same thing. Behaving...why did you do that? That's really cool! Sure it's the same thing. You see what I'm doing is the same thing, or not?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well we essentially talked about two things here but they're tied together quite strongly. We've talked at length previously about behaving not as the way I want to behave but the way people want me to behave. And to please them and this is the way I live and achieving (inaudible at 0:15:33.6) and things like that.</p>

<p>Well it's the same sort of thing though. People expect normal factual behavior. And I'm resolved behaving that way. Because, you know, I behave the way other people want me to behave. And that's what I'm living with.</p>

<p>Well now all we have to do is review the conclusions we came up with about problem number one and then apply them to problem number two. And it should all fall out, shouldn't it? I know it won't but let's try it.</p>

<p>I realize that I'm very much oriented towards achieving something substantial and other people can have well defined in their minds. And not necessarily that that definition marks any accomplishment whatsoever, but that's where society has defined something. Like again passing the test, (inaudible at 0:16:45.0) things like that.</p>

<p>Alright fine, so I realize that that's what I'm going to have to live with. I'm going to have to try and...either I'm going to have to try and be more honest in personal relationships and not...well I'm going to have to live with that and in addition try to be more honest and in the realization of that on a personal level. And try not to take that down to my personal level. Well yeah, that's about what I concluded about sex. That I will, to all outward appearances, behave normally, quote normally and maybe on a personal level in my own mind and my own fantasies, different behaviors may exist. And there's nothing really wrong with this, as long as I realize that effectively I'm being dishonest on a public level. [0:17:54.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems to fit together in the same way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm just trying to think what magnifications this is now. I guess it's not going to change my behavior much. No, I guess it would. You know the funny thing about what we do here is the fact that I can come up with conclusions and I can sort of solve problems but they're all dynamic solutions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, they're solutions that I sort of have to wait for the play of my life to see...and change and alter them as we go along. You can't go up and say, "Starting tomorrow at 3 pm this is the way I'm going to behave."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because at 3 pm that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, so you got to wait and see what happens and then once you have made a decision and tried to get (ph) your life on what we decided here, or tried to alter or maybe rewrite (ph) the same, then you got to see what happens with that and sort of work that out. [0:19:25.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to wait till that occurs and then try it out and reevaluate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah. The work we're doing here is strictly unattended (ph) time and that's always been, at least in my mind, I mean I realize now this is 17, there's four more to go. Well three more to go, excuse me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there's four in previously, three and a half.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So anytime...well actually it's only come to my mind in the last four or so. Then I realized that I've got certain problems that I'm going to talk about. Now when I say solve I don't mean solve for all kind but I know my plan of attack. When other people or other types of approaches are used what happens? Do people just keep talking and talking and talking until they are satisfied or what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you're really asking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I'm saying is this has been, in my mind, a very important part of our work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It has been.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The time. And now we've just been talking about dynamic solutions. And I would think that in the best possible world of all worlds what would happen would be is I would see you continually during all these dynamic changes in my life and all these decisions. And until I was at the point where all the decisions had been made and all the cross roads had been met. And I made all...and my life had sort of been settled down. [0:21:29.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So are you saying the time limited us. It doesn't give you time enough?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it doesn't give me time enough. It certainly changes the way you approach a problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it change it for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you see, if what say the word termination...well (inaudible at 0:21:56.6) termination, it might be today. I might decide everything's fine today and walk out, and that's fine. Or it might be ten years from now. If that were the case, then in each session I would be worried only about getting through to the next session. It would be much easier because then after...if I got to the point where after three sessions I realized it was easy to get through to each session, then maybe we might stretch them out to a couple months. I'll see you in a couple months. We'll get together. Not necessarily a...you know. Not necessarily a weekly thing. As I said before, there are times where I wanted to see you the next day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see. There were times where you wanted to spread it out more and times when you wanted to talk more quickly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's not so much that, spreading it out and talking about it quickly. As it is, realizing that now I must start to tie things together. And now, even if they're not tie-able together, I must. And I must decide, well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like that's a little, makes you a little uneasy to have to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just don't think that's going to help. I don't see that I can foresee all possible...well it's like a chess game. For the first couple moves you can put it into a computer but after about four it just gets hopeless. [0:23:28.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't tie things together because you haven't tried out enough yet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's not a fault of mine for not getting out and trying out things. It's just the things are going to try out by themselves in a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just the way that time in the 20 sessions fit together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, one of the things someone said to me before I met you was the fact that well we found that if we let is go more than 20 it just drags out anyhow. And we can really accomplish it in 20.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somebody here said that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know when I questioned them about the 20. But you see, I would think anyhow that what you're doing would be considered a dynamic - well when I say dynamic I mean dynamic as opposed to static - a dynamic process. What we're going to do is find some point where we're going to say, "Well let's see what might happen, and let's try and consider all possible ways you're going to behave and ways you're going to react and things that are going to happen and let's try and straighten..."</p>

<p>Well for instance something catastrophic could happen to me. Would just tremendously affect my psyche, and we haven't taken care of that really. [0:24:59.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like thinking, "Well I'm going to be through with this and then I might run into something I'm not at all prepared for."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and not necessarily...and that's not necessarily anyone's fault other than the fact that there's a time limit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I understand what you're saying. It's not your fault and I don't know whether you're kind of angry that you have a time limit...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if anger is the right word. I just, I'm interested in why someone would set it up that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was set up that way from the research, and that's why it was set up that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, which is effectively terminated, isn't it? Or it will be. This is the last of the research.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you've been here (ph) the last of the research.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean the center. Oh no, the center's just moving isn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a new center but the research is continuing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's...I don't know. It's sort of puts a....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I understand what you're saying. It's really a kind of a constraint on you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do most therapists have definite, well-defined (ph) times or do they wait until a person really has a minor crisis or wants to talk? So that initially it might be like everyday and after a while it might drop off to more and more and his problems are worked out and it might be...well just like you might see a dentist if you have a bad tooth problem. The first couple of times a lot of work and then just checkups. I think that would make a heck of a lot more sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, some people do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well then why should the mind be any different than the teeth? It's just another part of the body. [0:26:57.4]</p>

<p>Well, I don't know why we're talking about this because we've got certain things to live with, and one of the things is the fact that this is session number 17 of 20. But I just, nothing...we might settle a few things out between now and 20 but I don't think anything behaviorally will major.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing will happen to you in the next couple of weeks that really needs settling out or that are important things that need straightening out. When are those things going to happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well next week Tuesday at 4 pm. I don't know when those things are going to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckle)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And normally we're going to sit around waiting and say, "Well, let's see, it going to happen today?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, so I wondered if you had some...like you don't have an idea like the next couple of months are going to be sort of non-happening. More unpredictability.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Look at the statistics of it. I mentioned earlier about I think one of the things that would really freak me out is if I fell in love with somebody. I really found somebody that I could develop first a love relationship with and then maybe a sex relationship. And then I think this would maybe help me settle out all my problems. Well if I look at the statistics of how often a physicist falls in love, I've got...maybe there's a chance in the next ten years so therefore if you spread that out there's no greater probability of any one instance during the next ten years so sure enough, tomorrow maybe. But also maybe 1981 (ph). [0:28:36.7]</p>

<p>So why, with that kind of way to look at things there's no sense in waiting around saying, "Well this is the day," and also anticipating or forcing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying it's hard to know how to use these remaining sessions so they'll be most valuable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because see this at the point now where we should be saying, "Well, let's tie it all up and let's wrap it up in a nice neat package so that you will be ready for every decision. You will be prepared..." You know just program it, this tremendous chess game into your mind. So that in 1995 when I say, "Well let's see, first I behaved this way then that happened and then that was a plan B so I went into plan B and there was some plan D." You know, position 1 and section 4. That's the way I thought. And I thought wow, that's just kind of like a hoagie way to do it. Because why if I have plan B...if you're going to follow plan B why have plan A? Why not wait until the time comes to choose plan A or plan B? Let your plan B be a chosen...spend your time thinking about it. [0:29:59.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there's nothing to stop you from getting into therapy some day again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. You know what's a shame, I think, as long as we are talking about therapy? Is the fact that therapists need exist. I mean, it's really sad. Not that necessarily there shouldn't be problems. Because certainly, just because man the way...he is the way he is there's going to be problems. But it's a shame that people can't...that I couldn't find you amongst my friends, someone that I could be completely open with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that you could be completely what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Open with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying if I were a friend you could be more open with me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or that it would just be nice to have a friend...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be nice if people would not have to...I think the most important thing about what's happened here is the fact that I've been open with you. And it's a shame that I couldn't just walk off to some friend and say, "Look, I'm having some problems and I think the most important thing is for me to talk about them so let's talk about them." There's just no one I would really do that with now. [0:31:14.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's nobody in your life who could serve any kind of purpose like that. And you feel you could be open with them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's why you wonder about things like divorces or separations. How can they really not happen...how can they happen un-amicably, if people are honest? The minute you have this little crack, you know, in the way you feel about someone, you should mention it if they're your spouse. There should be complete communication. And then, it would grow maybe and people certainly wouldn't be...they couldn't be mad at the initial level, if it were just a small thing. But if things build up, rather than not mentioning them and then finally it just breaks out into a tremendous rage and then off you go into a [home with another mother] (ph) or whatever.</p>

<p>Then certainly they might exist. Certainly separations and fallings out would exist but they certainly would not be as...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They wouldn't be as painful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If they growth of them were discussed. And we know that that doesn't happen, or very infrequently happens. And that's the same thing that I'm talking about now. I just don't really talk. For some people I talk with...for some people you talk about some things about, some people you talk about with...you know what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I know what you mean. [0:32:47.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, but I don't think there's really anyone I'm completely honest with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's somehow, there's a lack you said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but I don't think that's something that makes me much different from anyone else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you think this when I was [a fine] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's how so many people...there just isn't anyone that they can talk to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah so there shouldn't really be a need for you. Nothing personal at all or nothing. (chuckle)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I know what you mean. (chuckle)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe that's what...you're one of the people that I try to...what are the other jobs that...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I was trying to think, there's some job that they're advertising the fact that it's trying to put itself out of business.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well therapy, I guess, is like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess anyone...because you realize that there's just no way you're going to be out of business anyhow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughter) Yeah right, you're not really in danger.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughter) No. That's a nice thing to say! Well, that's alright.</p>

<p>Let's see, where to go from here. I didn't have much to come with this time. But yeah, so what is going to happen in the next three sessions? That's a good question. Am I going to try to tie things together or am I going to try to, give up? [0:34:17.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give up tying them together?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Give up trying to develop a life plan, the greater life plan.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you sound kind of snickle (ph) about whether that would be helpful or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well how long have we been seeing each other, six months or something? Maybe not that long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well whatever it is, I certainly can see that if this were to continue that things would really sound a lot nicely, everything would be much better. But that isn't the case. So, I also think I could...well let me think about that a little bit. Well I'll say it. I think it might be possible...it's possible for me to visualize now, our working together until I have come to a point where I could handle it myself, and really not have to consider therapy again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That means that...is that something new that you haven't felt that way before?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I hadn't thought about thinking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you can see that happening where we could work to a point and then you can see yourself kind of emerging from that and being to handle everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I mean I'm close to that with the first problem now. Realization of why I behave, or how I behave — not necessarily why — realization of how I behave and different ways to handle it. And different ways I don't want to handle it, and ways I do want to handle it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel pretty much on top of that problem?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not necessarily on top of it but I think I am in a better position to watch myself in the context of that problem and to realize what I'm doing in the context of that problem and perhaps to therefore change and handle it. [0:36:10.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're more aware of yourself in that problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To handle it in a sense of knowing what's happening but maybe not necessarily to handle it to change it to the best of all possible ways because there's certain things that I buckle (ph) that are deep in me.</p>

<p>So yeah I think that I can visualize a circumstance happening where I would pretty much be able to handle most things. But I don't think it's going to help...well I don't think it's going to be made any easier by stopping it for a certain time. It seems so inefficient.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really bothers you to have it just cut off that like just because it's 20.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. See there were times before I really thought about bringing up sex again, there were times where 20 seemed too many.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't know what to fill them up with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right around 11 or 12 things started to settle down and I kind of realized where I was going and it was a matter of reasoning and just becoming satisfied with it. But now in light of that maybe things will...things will come up again and again.</p>

<p>It's like a family doctor. Can you imagine a family doctor saying, "Well you have 20 sessions. If you develop leukemia on the 21st that's just too bad."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too bad, yeah. It must feel somehow like you're not being cared for very much. [0:37:42.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think not being cared for is the right...quite what it is. I think it's, being treated more as...being honest helped and being honestly talked to. But more so as part of a...more so as a specimen. To help you in the long run or to help the center in the long run or your research in the long run and saying, "Well I had one that behaved this way." And maybe having a big bull (ph) session and talking about how this one behaved and what this one did here.</p>

<p>That sounds bad. I don't think it's bad. I don't want to make it sound too bad because you see, that's alright. If along with that you're being...you're behaving...well you are behaving. You're here with me, just sincerely helping me out on a personal level and listening on a personal level and in addition to that also, getting together, "Oh, case number 17 has this problem."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess using...you understand how being a scientist is like research is good or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, when it's you, it some how more bothers you personally to be just thought of as a research case.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know that it makes me bad. The only manifestations that I'm getting, the only possibly consequence that I'm seeing is the 20 session limit. There's certainly nothing in here to indicate it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, no that's what I meant. At least part of what I meant. Because it's like being put into this limit, like you can have 20 interviews and that's all. [0:40:06.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean...I hate to argue my analogy but I might as well. Like if, a (inaudible at 0:40:16.3) with a Rhesus monkey...maybe that's not too good of an example because usually they make them sick, pumping the cancer into them.</p>

<p>But let's say one came in with cancer, naturally occurring cancer in a monkey. And you sincerely tried to help him during all this work. But the experimentation in the laboratory was such that you could only see him 20 times to cure him. Well that, you know, the monkey's happy. He really is, because he's getting help. But he kind of gets this thought, "Well wait a minute! 20? That's it?" What if it only takes 21?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the thought though? I don't quite understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, why don't you tell me, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Disgust or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think it's disgust. I think it's a little bit disappointment, upholding the bulk of the science, the scientific investigation the above the one Rhesus.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even though I realize, and again with the analogy, I realize that there may be...there is, let's assume that there is a very valid and a very helpful reason as far as a long run is concerned for having only 20 sessions. That we could really only get good statistics about monkeys and cancer with 20 sessions. And that if we do this with 20 sessions we'll become better cancer experts and we're going to find the cure and then if when four years from now another one comes along, we'll be able to cure them, because we've done this for 20 sessions. We have good statistics for 20 sessions of work. [0:41:57.2]</p>

<p>Well, I realize that. It was kind of a hokey analogy but nevertheless, fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I understand all of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I get sort of the thought of sacrificing by virtue of the fact that I'm here now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now wait a minute. I'm trying to get at what's going on here. It sounds like...do you think that if you said, "I really don't like it. It really bugs me that I can only have 20 sessions." What do you imagine that would do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: First of all, don't put only in there. Just say that there is a well defined number of sessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because there were times when I would have stopped at like 13 or 12.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well I'm trying to get to your feeling about it, which I'm having trouble. I have a feeling like you're kind of saying, like you're sort of saying it over and over and over but hardly saying it, and I'm not sure what it is yet. [0:43:01.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, let me just come up with another little thing that I just thought about that might help. That is, sure this monkey that has a 20 session limit may very well be hurt by that. But, if we look back 20 years and we look forward 20 years, there was a monkey 20 years ago that did something, that is making what's happening to you now work. And the fact that you're going 20 sessions may help a monkey 20 years from now. You see?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I get that [part of it] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: As far as the science is concerned, I can see 100 percent why it's done this way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I understand. But as far as the person who is in it right now, are you feeling hurt and harmed by it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think it's just a realization of the fact that two...I think it's just a very selfish realization on my part. That now I'm realizing that for my own personal reasons that it would be better if there weren't a well defined limit, but that it's certainly not going to help your work. When I say your, I don't necessarily mean your...I mean your, the field your, the plural your. [0:44:28.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like what you're having is kind of feeling of, "It would really help me more if I could have as many sessions as I want." But trying to balance that out with how you feel about science and how it would help people in the long run. But both of those parts are really lying inside of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are really what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are really lying, I mean like you really feeling how it would be for science and so forth, but then you're also feeling how it is for you just to have 20, to be cut off like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that's pretty understandable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do other people have as many problems about the limit? Do many people talk about it? Does it bother them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it varies with people. I'm sure some of them do. Were you thinking you were the only one or only a few people did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just wondered, yeah. The only feeling that I have on occasion and I don't mean...well as much as a preface anything about how I mean something I might as well just say it. I have had the feeling at times after we have gotten somewhere, I sort of sit back and say, "What the hell? That's no big deal. I could have done that sitting at home alone." [0:46:12.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I didn't need her."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There just have been so many times...not so many, there've been a few times when that's been the case and I kind of wonder, you know? Why worry about next Tuesday at nine o' clock.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, "I don't really need this. What do I need this for?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not necessarily...yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I could do this on my own."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, that's it. I could do it...it's needed, but I could it on my own. But then I go...it's balanced against that is the fact that for years I didn't. So you know, where are you? Where am I?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, do you feel like you could say, "Sit down now," and do it on your own?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's hard. That's a very good question. Because you see I never thought about that because I always had another session to come to. I've always had next week Tuesday. So there's never been a thought about, "Well can I sit down and figure this out for myself?"</p>

<p>Another thing is that there's just so much credence that goes into slowly (ph) spoken words, in my head anyhow, if I sit around thinking and I call this a preclusion, fine. That's a nice conclusion. But unless it's spoken to another person or to a tape recorder, or when it's spoken to another person and everybody, it suddenly takes out a tremendous amount of import.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that? What is that? Is it just sharing with somebody or is it somehow it makes it...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it's just sort of a...officiating something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Makes it official?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's helpful. Just to have another person or a tape recorder to say it to. [0:47:57.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well I just said tape recorder just because I saw it spinning there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I said everybody we mentioned...that it's down for someone else to hear perhaps, that it's down...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's it's published. It's said out loud to someone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But as far as doing it myself I hadn't, so that I mentioned just goes right out the window. If I say, "Why spend time here?" I'm entirely capable. Capable, fine, sure I was capable. Looking back on anything, anyone is entirely capable. It's just like any course material that you learn. You don't necessarily have to go to the course. You can grab a book and go home. But you don't. By sitting on the courses and knowing there's a test and doing the homework, you do it.</p>

<p>And I don't think there's anything...well I don't think you've ever pulled a Rod Steiger on me. I don't think we've ever sat here and talked for a few hours and then you talked for a few hours and said, "Wow! Is that cool! That's really great! You really hit that one on the head." And that just hasn't happened. [0:49:16.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I didn't give you that, which you really would have liked.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I would have liked it. I'm just saying you didn't do it. Well you see the thing is...is much done that way, by the way? Do people ever do that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess. I'm sure some people tell other people interpretations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, do you listen for hours and hours, weeks and weeks and weeks and then just sort of sit down and go through all your books and settle it all around and come up and say, "Well, here it is."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think I could do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it could...it has...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't...I don't think it could be done like that. That neatly, no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Alright well I guess I'm just the guy that's so blind to...it doesn't matter. It's about having you here, nor will it. It's strange, the preconceived notions one has about what's going to happen here and what does happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's strange what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About the preconceived notions about what will happen here and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the difference between that and what does happen here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:50:30.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now what was that difference like for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: For me? Well, when I first came in I expected to say about two words. Oh no, when I first heard your name I said, "How am I going to talk about any sexual talk at all? Wow, there's just no way."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To a woman.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then, when I came in I expected to say about three words. And then just probe and probe and probe and probe and probe. And no I didn't expect a couch. I expected something like this. But I expected a third person probing rather than a first person probing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like how does he feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No excuse me, second person probing. You.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, then I realized right after...I hadn't even said that it was, that ain't so. Then, did we talk...I just mentioned. Did I really talk about my sexual state that first couple of times or not? I don't remember. [0:51:47.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I believe you talked about it once earlier. I just don't remember how early.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well at any rate...then I realized that most of the work would be done because...not necessarily by me but because of the fact that I would expose myself to you and that exposure then would help me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see. You realized that it was in you talking about it and looking at yourself rather than you giving it to me and me giving it back to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then there was a time of course when I came up with the major conclusions and everything was all these sort of neat little twists and even with notes and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just a ["how I felt"] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I saw things working out. Then past that stage into the little more realizing that I wasn't going to [tell all] (ph) my life that much. And then finally getting through the point where it's getting near the end and I realize that the sexual hang up is much more important than I'd made it out to be. [0:53:05.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now you feel like you don't have time to settle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yeah. Now I'm in the final stages of just...well 20 sessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're worried. "How will I ever get that solved in just a few sessions?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So...those are my most major feelings at different stages. Yeah it'll be interesting to see what happens in the last few coming up.</p>

<p>Do you ever finish with a person and realize that you haven't really - I mean maybe he's gone somewhere and he's changed — that you haven't really helped anything? That he's mixed up as to what his conclusions are about everything. Well, that you would come to a different conclusion. That's a better way to word it. Like, a person comes in with a problem, a very real problem. And he talks about it, talks about it, talks about it and finally says, "Ah, look! This is the way I'm going to have to handle this problem." And he comes up with this and you realize that there's just no way he's going to handle it that way. That it just cannot be done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It can't be done that way, yeah. Is that what you're afraid will happen? [0:54:37.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know...well, anytime I do that to a third person it does seem like that is one of my fears. But does that happen? Do you see that happening at times?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't think of it in those terms, you see? If you come up with a conclusion of what you're going to try and do when something happens, I don't sort of sit here and think, "Well, that will never work. I think he should've decided to do X instead." Because I guess my aim isn't to have you come up with certain conclusions of how to deal with things. My aim is to help you to become more emotionally free or something so that you can come up with whatever conclusions you want. So I'm not thinking along those lines.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughter) That's what I thought, the way you answered.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, not much at all. It just doesn't...I cannot see, being in your position, the case not arising where you would really get to know someone because he's poured his heart out, and then he comes up with something. Some really dip shit solution to this, just no way it's going to make any sense. That'll never work out! But it's session 20 and off he goes and you realize that this is just the beginning. That he's just going to be that much more messed up. I mean, I don't see how...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow I would let somebody go off like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if...yeah. I don't know. Would you...I personally would think you'd be compromising your profession if you didn't — not necessarily 20 sessions — but if you didn't say, "I personally don't think that's the right solution. Now you may, but I don't think..." [0:56:47.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, ok. I'd rather talk about it concretely. For example, I'd rather wait until...rather than try and go into this theoretically, let's wait until you come up with some conclusion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then if you don't think of it, that's perfectly fine. Then I feel more...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I sort of came up with the conclusion on the first part of everything. I mean, and you haven't said anything about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you haven't asked me either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, alright. What do you think?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the conclusion I'm supposed to give an opinion about here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I pretty much realized...now we're talking about what we talked about. I pretty much realized that I'm very, very achievement oriented and that I look for well defined goals. And this I just something that's going to be a part of me. And it's something that can't really be avoided or gotten around. It's something I'm going to have to live with.</p>

<p>And on the basis of that, the problem I came in here with was a personal problem on a personal level and I've got to watch that this attitude, this approach, doesn't get into my personal life and that I can be a little more honest on a personal level. And that I can behave not necessarily the way other people want to see me behave. And not worry about accomplishments, and not worry about behaving in a way that will please them. And behaving in an honest way because that's what I want to have to live with is myself on a personal level. But on the macro level, that's the way I am, fine. And therefore I will not be able to define my life at a certain point but I won't be drawn into. That is as I was drawn into getting my degree. As I was drawn into.... [0:58:28.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, stop, stop, stop. Okay, alright now my feeling about that is that what you've come to is an attempt to, it sounds to me like, try to get more honest at a certain level that you feel is more honest. And what you're also saying that right now I feel like being what would seem to you more honest at a deeper level or at the macro level is impossible.</p>

<p>Okay, now I don't know. My feeling about that is it's probably...my personal feeling is that's probably not impossible but that it makes sense right now to have worked out a part of that and say, "I'll leave another part of that until sometime later because I can't deal with that right now."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you think it's deal-able with? I mean, do you think that...well, [just deal] (ph). That I could extend it past the micro to the macro?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a hard question because we haven't gone into it enough so that I really know what it means to you but I hesitate to say yes and no. My off hand guess would be yes, it could.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think though that, regardless of yes or no, that I think that the micro comes first clearly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, that's what I said. See it sounds sensible to me, personally since you asked me. It sounds like you know, a way of dealing with it one part of it at a time, which makes a lot of sense too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have we ever had a more...have we ever talked about more things in a session? I thought this was unbelievable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We hit a lot of things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, we just went around circle after circle after circle. (chuckle)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how does that seem to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it seemed to be the freest session. It was interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I found myself very involved in this. We have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I kind of thought it was going to be that soon. You were going to show me your Braille watch, did I see it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, sure! All it does is that you open it up and then you can just read it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I see! I thought that the crystal turned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I was wondering. (chuckle)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It has a little box for the numbers.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that's nice. Well, when do you want to see me again? [1:00:54.6]</p>

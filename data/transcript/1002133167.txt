<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well—known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.</p>

<p>The therapist featured in this transcript is Dr. Russell J. Becker, a noted pastoral counselor. Dr. Becker graduated from Kalamazoo College in Michigan in 1944 and received a B.D. degree from the Colgate Rochester Divinity School in 1946.  He received his PhD. Degree in theology from the University of Chicago in 1950 and while there, he studied with noted therapist Carl Rogers at the Counseling Center. During the time of his studies there, he collaborated with Dr. Rogers on an article on basic counseling which appeared in the first issue of the new journal, <i>Pastoral Psychology</i>.  Dr. Becker would go on to contribute many articles and book chapters in the area of pastoral psychology and the interaction between religion and mental health. He authored books entitled <i>Family Pastoral Care</i> (Prentice—Hall, 1965) and <i>When Marriage Ends</i> (Fortress Press, 1971).</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:00:02.0)</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: What? No. No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think that the three of you do have a problem—a very good (ph) problem. But I'd like you to—I'd like to try to give a picture to the three of you of each other—of yourselves and each other. And, ask (inaudible at 0:00:39.0) speaking to me trying to tell me what is going on.</p>

<p>I think Suzanne feels that most basically that she has to deal with two parents who are unfair to her. And the unfairness is perhaps in two different directions. There are probably two ways that are mostly unfair. One is by being easier on Bill, more preferential and (inaudible at 0:01:29.9) of him so that kind of she feels he can do no wrong in mom's eyes or in daddy's eyes. [0:01:41.2]</p>

<p>And that the other level of unfairness is the—how would you put it Suzanne—making rules that kind of they are different from time to time or not being consistent or the same in what's expected of her.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, this would be all right except that she feels that there's the same fundament problem that she has to deal with in school. And that a teacher I think she has this year is, in her point of view, has it in for her. Kind of (inaudible at 0:02:36.6) was gotten to, was spoken to by the teacher last year that this girl hadn't been a good girl. And this teacher is, in Suzanne's eyes, being unfair to her. That she gets blamed and disciplined for the consequences of something that somebody else does. And this is what she means when she's speaking of unfairness (inaudible at 0:03:10.4) [0:03:10.5]</p>

<p>Her real feeling then comes down to take those two together, I guess is what Suzanne is saying gosh, what can you do? If you can't really rely upon your own parent to be fair to you and can't rely on a teacher to be fair with you then you're just stuck until they change their minds or come around. She puts it this way. You're really out of a family until they change their minds.</p>

<p>Now there's one additional thing that is a part of unfairness, from her perspective. And that is that she's accused of not trying.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:04:16.6) [0:04:17.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trying is an internal state of mind. Trying something within a person and she's very quickly judged both by her parents and by her teacher as not trying when this is just not the case. And she has been trying. And that leads her to feel it's a pretty (inaudible at 0:04:45.5) proposition—pretty useless to try if it's not even appreciated. This kind of unfairness in terms of trying as seen in terms of high expectations that you hold and she doesn't (inaudible at 0:05:06.3) to the level you want. Then it's not that she's trying at her level. She hasn't tried is the report—play back she gets. [0:05:17.8]</p>

<p>Then how Suzanne sees the two of you in terms of what you're trying to do is kind of blurry. So, I'm sure she has a real picture. I think I can come back to that in a moment. I don't want take the picture that the two of you have of Suzanne because this is her picture of you and her teacher. I think the two of you are saying you see her as asking for attention and approval, perfection over and over and over. And you've got this in many ways—so many ways that you finally just feel exasperated—just warn out by it that (inaudible at 0:06:59.5) Suzanne asking you for approval and attention and love far beyond what could possibly ever be met. There's no—it's just too much that she's asking for. [0:07:21.2]</p>

<p>Then I guess you feel that Suzanne is not reasonable on things. That she doesn't her part in things enough. She doesn't introduce enough (inaudible at 0:08:15.5) in things like (inaudible at 0:08:19.4) speaking about that having the fire in the fireplace that she has a good idea for her little brother to suggest but it's not a good idea for an older sister to let happen. So reasonable in the sense that she would be hurt by her little brother's touching her and not realizing she could really be hurting him by (inaudible at 0:08:51.3) him back. You see that there's some like of aspect in fault.</p>

<p>Well this is an amazing picture that I see the two of you holding about her and her holding about you. There is some sense on your part that she must look upon you as unfair. As in her picture of you is the same one as what she feels about you. [0:09:41.0]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She's helping (inaudible at 0:09:41.3)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, so that this is getting through. The thing that isn't there on her part is the picture of maybe what you two are up to. And, what you're trying to do. Or what you're up against in relationship with her. So up to some sense that you have—and her—in clear appreciation of what (inaudible at 0:10:24.4) what you're doing other than that you've kind of excluded her. And, kind of made it awfully difficult and impossible for her to measure up to whatever you want her to be.</p>

<p>Now, so the perhaps the first thing I asked today is that the consequence of this is that—I mean there isn't an understanding on the part of each of you, an understanding over against the other of what the other person is fully experiencing. Meaning what your parents are feeling for instance. What they're trying to do. Now, on Suzanne's part there's not this picture. I think maybe there is some parts of this picture on your part feeling about her. [0:11:38.2]</p>

<p>Let me come back to what I think Suzanne is doing in the picture that she holds of herself. And this lack of any picture of maybe you people are doing living your own life and asking to be good parents. I get a real sense that Suzanne is feeling that the cards are all stacked against her. That if she tries, she isn't going to be good enough to please. And, but she's going to be criticized for what she accomplishes. If she doesn't try, she's going to be criticized for not having tried. And so, she can't win either way. [0:12:48.2]</p>

<p>So I kind of think that she's decided that she's lost so it doesn't matter what she does. How kind of I guess—and the only thing you're going to get is disapproval or rejection or criticism of—by them. And it does make a difference what you do. I get the feeling that maybe this is something that she has come to think of as the way to handle herself both at home and at school. Like kind of what's the use (inaudible at 0:13:37.3) [0:13:38.1]</p>

<p>Does it look that way to you Suzanne? I think you're kind of waiting Suzanne—waiting to see if they will change, if they will appreciate something you do or if they will appreciate your trying Suzanne. And you see yourself as making lots of effort in trying. And then the additional—the difficulty that's there is that if you're waiting for them to change and you're expecting them not to change, just be the same old people, it's kind of hard to get the situation any better under that basis. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>Now I guess the thing that—the most serious—this idea is the most serious dynamic, fundamental operating factor for Suzanne in her relationship with you. If she expects you to be wrong all the time and if she has no sense—nothing to do except not wrong, I mean to be harsh on her and maybe find her wrong all the time. And she has no other position to take than wait until you change and she's waiting for you to change while expecting you to never change. So she's really expecting you to—two things of you—both just being the same all of the time and some day something will be different. And I—[0:15:48.5]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: I wake up. I find everything different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And so this just could perpetuate it (inaudible at 0:15:55.9) for her—for you.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: May I say something here? I think Bill and I try in many ways to please Sue. And yet we have the feeling that we are not pleasing Sue. If we give her something or Bill brings home something or we go some place sort of special, it's nice but, it's pretty but. And, I have gotten to the place is when I give Suzanne something as a gift, I'm wandering what's going to be the but this time. It's nice but it should have been a different color or it should have had a little something here. And, Bill and I almost fall to see it before we start. We want to give her something that we know will please her. And yet we know that for some reason or other, it's not going to completely please her. And so this—[0:17:07.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're trying to—what you're saying is that you withhold within your own selves the same attitude?</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: That she has. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the sense that she has.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you want to please her but you don't think anything will please her.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. There's always going to be this it's nice but.</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:17:24.1)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: It was a good movie but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something wrong with it.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. So you see she's the ultimate—she's waiting for us to change. And yet, she knows we won't. And we are trying to do for her and yet we know she's not going to be satisfied.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're both caught in the same—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bind of trying to make a clean start.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or do something differently for the good.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. Trying (inaudible at 0:17:59.6)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's making it, this isn't going to work either.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Very dubious. Yes. (Inaudible at 0:18:05.3) why will this? [0:18:07.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Is there some—?</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: What I wanted Suzanne to realize is that this is not a punitive thing here. Anything about is that we're trying to get our minds together so that we can understand this thing better. This is not disciplinary. This is not anything of that nature. It's that we're trying to get an understanding here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think that's what we've been talking about is that we're really worlds apart in understanding the other person and knowing what's going on in their mind. And I think that's true of each of us to hand over to the other one. I think there is another factor that I'd like to see if I can get a hold of in terms of what maybe the two of you may be doing that perpetuates a difficulty with Suzanne. I think you have some appreciation of the kind of thing I've just been saying about what Suzanne encounters mainly is that she's kind of given up. [0:19:58.8]</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:20:01.6)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Her best efforts are not seen as good enough. And, her efforts aren't even appreciated for whatever they are. And so, there's no winning from—if she doesn't try at all, she's—because she hasn't tried. So she's being (inaudible at 0:20:23.3) either way. She's kind of given up but I think she said she's kind of given up. By her—by your feeling that she feels as though she can't—perhaps can't please or can't do, can't come up to expectations. [0:20:46.3]</p>

<p>I think this points directly then to what kind of expectation levels you are holding within yourselves. If you realize that a pretty realistic or strong level of feelings within Suzanne that I can't or what's the use and you still go on expecting you can and you better then this isn't taking account of Suzanne where she really is. And it's going only help to keep her in the position of feeling I can't. And there is (inaudible at 0:21:30.3) so that you know something that should lead you to feel considerably differently about every situation with her than you actually do. And out of concerns that you put in terms of that you know she's got more ability or objectively, it could be different. Out of those concerns that you find external and objective and you keeping the pressure high—[0:22:03.7]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But out of an appreciation of where she is, within herself, you know this is wrong.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: But we know that she can do better because we've seen her do it. That's what we have to base our standard by.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's quite—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:22:20.5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Far from her though.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. Yes. But I say; that's one of the reasons we hold the standards high.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Because we've seen past performance and know that she is capable although she does not feel that she is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That there's much important to you—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Than whether she actually believes she can or she can't. She feels she can't by it doesn't matter if she has the ability of Michael Angelo (inaudible at 0:22:43.4) feeling and so she thought she couldn't. So the only place that you can really effectively meet her is where she is in her own feelings not in terms of where she should be or where she could be. [0:23:06.7]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well the only other plan is the fact that we just had (inaudible at 0:23:12.6) high levels of expectations for Sue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: It wasn't (inaudible at 0:23:16.7)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:23:16.9) level.</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:23:18.1) This is like the level she is and this is our (inaudible at 0:23:24.1)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yeah. And I thought we could arrive at this level just out of our own thoughts.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: We arrived at it from past experience.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And that's why we have set it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The goals.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: The goals high.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But somehow or the other (inaudible at 0:23:41.3)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Has been wrong. [0:23:43.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has been—just you've made it impossible now for (inaudible at 0:23:45.7) So that, I think each of you has your own fundamental problem of the other where in some ways Suzanne feels that she's trying and wants to be good. But she also feels that it's useless. And in this sense, she's given up trying. You know what I mean by saying that, Suzanne? (Inaudible at 0:24:22.7) you're trying and yet you feel as though what's the use of trying? And that's a tough spot to be in.</p>

<p>But, for your parents, I sense them saying they know you feel as though you're having a tough time trying—pleasing them. And yet they still want you to (Laughter) be a perfect little girl. And that's hard for them to realize that there's even two different things they're expecting. Just as it's hard for you to realize you both are trying and have given up trying. Feel it's useless to try. [0:25:11.1]</p>

<p>So I think this is probably the level that you have to help each other. It's the deepest inner struggle each of you are having within yourselves that the trouble inside yourselves which relates to the other so it's a struggle inside yourself.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: The question I would (inaudible at 0:25:45.3) is, we have a family of four and we have tried to be fair. But, in effect what you're saying is that this is the level that we should understand Suzanne and come down to this level. But what happens (inaudible at 0:26:20.5) and just give in. [0:26:25.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it isn't as much giving in as acknowledging that in addition to pure ability, there is her accumulated appraisal of that ability within herself that just come out in a highly I can't—in this negative form. So that any time you are looking to Suzanne for doing this or doing that, you have to look at her both as one who's capable but who does not feel that way about herself. So it isn't really giving in. You're acknowledging there's something there more than just the shear, crude motor power and intellectual capacity. There is the girl with her talent plus her feelings about those talents which have accumulated into a way that are detrimental to her (inaudible at 0:27:38.5) [0:27:38.7]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well I guess the reason why she didn't want to be bothered to further anything, I mean when she likes something and you get her that thing to do along that line and then because it's means work and time for her, she's rejecting it. When we're hoping that this will be the one thing that she will sort of take an interest in and work at it and we would be glad to help her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine what you're encountering is initial enthusiasm. Yeah. A fundamental (inaudible at 0:28:17.4) on the fact that I can't please them anyways.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well how—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: How do we—?</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: How are we going to make her understand that we are—?</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: We are (inaudible at 0:28:28.0)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: I mean all that we're hoping for is that she will try and follow through. And we will be so pleased and be so willing to help her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (inaudible at 0:28:39.3) that she's not feeling for that. [0:28:41.3]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well, then the questions is that how do we convince her of this? How can she see it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think we have to accept that this is the way she feels.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Or we could sit down and work with her on a project until it is completely done even though it's so simple?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For—okay, just take piano playing. Now Suzanne may not know why she's given up that. Do you know Suzanne why you've given up piano playing?</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well she—yes, you do. Don't you? You didn't want to practice, did you? Did you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you like practice? I don't think she really knows why she's given up. I think it's partly—it's a good expression of what she overall feels about anything now. And that is what (inaudible at 0:29:42.7) [0:29:43.2]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She's really good at it. I mean we were so pleased with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But supposing I try and try hard to play piano and play it well, what would you feel Suzanne if you practiced well and had lessons (inaudible at 0:29:59.3)</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:30:01.9)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you feel that your parents would want you to play a little bit better?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Like a little bit more all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just a little bit more. So why try?</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well I didn't—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think this is the (inaudible at 0:30:18.9)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: We did give up the piano lessons until I talked to the teacher first.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well there's no—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. It doesn't matter what the teacher decides (inaudible at 0:30:28.5)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:30:28.5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She was threw—</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:30:32.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Way, way back.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:30:33.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: But on the other hand, Suzanne wanted me to sit right beside her while she practiced every note. And she made a mistake and I corrected her. Then she did not like that. And yet, having had a little bit of music, I could not sit there and let her play the same note wrong every time. And oh course, I would correct her and—[0:30:58.6]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Well (inaudible at 0:30:58.1) I mean this or that are—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. But I think you have to understand why—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:31:03.0)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She feels—I think this all carries out why she feels she's not good enough.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: By how the (inaudible at 0:31:12.3) are that we don't expect this out of her. That I (inaudible at 0:31:21.0) If she gets a G, fine. If she gets an E, fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: But I know then disappointed that she doesn't get Cs, it's just that I, in my own way of thinking—maybe I'm wrong—but the only way you'll get anything is to give a little something either of yourself or whatever it is. That you can't set a goal here and then reach that goal without setting a little goal a little bit further. If you're going to take one breathe, you'll die. You've got to take another breathe. You've got to go on. And, it's not that we're criticizing Suzanne. It's—and I don't, frankly, know how to show her that I don't want everything out of her. I just want her to—[0:32:22.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think the thing that's at work here that could be helpful, I think within you or perhaps within both of you as parents are feeling that you have to help her strive to be better.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And set goals beyond what she's done in her next task.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: No. Not really. It may sound that way. (Laughter) But if she never was the greatest piano player in the world, it wouldn't bother me a bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, now wait a minute. Now I'm not talking about you're setting goals way beyond. I'm just saying you want to set a little too high.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: A little bit high. Just a little bit more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're saying if she does this much then I know she can do that. And I have a right to say that she could with growth and practice and perhaps would be a little bit better.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Grow. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So I think what you're saying is that you feel this is your responsibility to set the sights. Now what I sense is the deep disappointment in Suzanne is that she can't set her own sights. And she does. We like to grow ourselves. And we like to feel we're pleasing others and the pride in the parents with what we can do. And she doesn't get a chance to surprise you ever with what she can do. And to please you with what she came up with. Because you feel the need to help her to her next level and this not only doesn't help her enjoy the full measure of accomplishment at this moment in this level. [0:34:22.2]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it doesn't give the mechanic (ph) within herself or the trust within herself too. I'll make the next effort so that this will please them. Now Suzanne wants what you want as deeply as any child. And (inaudible at 0:34:41.3) pleased in these (inaudible at 0:34:42.4) what to be pleased by.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well I have a question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Then why? Now I will not cook (ph) for Suzanne anymore. I have all the things for her and I'm really happy when she does make something. In fact, I would like for her to make something for every Saturday. Nothing would please me more. And I always have it on hand. I can not cook with Suzanne. And I can't do many things with Suzanne because when we get into doing something—having majored in home ec, I am far from being the best but I do what—I do know a few of the rules along the way. And I want to give these to Sue. And then let her work them out the way she thinks is best. But what I run into is, immediately—perhaps my way of trying to help her is not correct. And there is a wall right here. [0:35:43.6]</p>

<p>(Noise on tape 0:35:44.5)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She doesn't—I want to give her suggestions on a way to do it and help her so that the next time, she will say well, now I have done this and I know that if you take a level piece of (inaudible at 0:35:54.9) take a knife and take it off and that's a level (inaudible at 0:35:57.4) I'm trying to give Suzanne all this and she doesn't want it. I want to do it my way. I don't want to do it that way. And, so you see, I feel like I'm being pushed back. And yet she wants you to work with her. With her music, she wanted me to sit right there while she practiced. If she's trying to make something, she wants to come—she wants you to be there while she makes it. This is fine except you see, we get into such a hassle that I feel it's not good for Suzanne. And it's not good for me to stand there and argue with her about something. So I say all right, you do it yourself. And oh course, I know that many times she gets into trouble because she doesn't know what to do. [0:36:41.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yeah—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: But I feel like I can't help her. I want to help her but apparently I'm going about it the wrong way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I sense a real concern for her making good cherry pie or whatever. Because there's certain ways you can louse up making.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well I—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, the thing that—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Don't want her to be disappointed at her efforts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And we won't know how to do it if someone doesn't give her a little bit of help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I—all right, then you're just documenting. You have a real concern for her making good cherry pie. Now the thing you do not—are not ready to do is be happy about mud pie.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well we eat everything that she makes regardless of whether it's good or not. And she won't touch it. (Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: So I don't know whether you could say that or not.</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:37:43.3)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're not talking about the eating. We're talking about the process. I don't think you enjoy the mud pie for all the (inaudible at 0:37:59.1) and enthusiasm and putting one's self into it that you can do. [0:38:03.1]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well probably not because it was pushed into me at school that you would do things right or wrong. (Laughter) And that you should be it right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does—there's one way to do things. And if you do things—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By one way, you miss all the fun in life that comes with mud pie.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well maybe I didn't make any mud pies when I was little or very few of them. Let's put it that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Possibly or it's (inaudible at 0:38:27.3) or the real problem is that there is an (inaudible at 0:38:33.3) joy that can never be had later in life. It can only be had right now in not being perfect. And not making real pies, just making mud pies. This being (inaudible at 0:38:47.6) [0:38:48.5]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when these things that—these things that Suzanne is looking for and this is why she (inaudible at 0:38:56.0) And this is all she's begetting out of cooking right now. And that is a sense of this is a joy that a woman has and will have some sense of their life around this if she does it well. And a boy can do this, sure but he'll be—could be an oddball if he does it. But he really (inaudible at 0:39:32.9) in the unique kind of thing that Suzanne is picking up. And that is a part of what it means to be a woman. And what she does drastically (inaudible at 0:39:49.9) compared to other women with joy and standing in the kitchen and being liked while they're—for this as well. This is not wanting mother around (inaudible at 0:39:58.4) [0:39:59.8]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:40:01.6)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:40:02.9) It's a deeper learning. (Inaudible at 0:40:09.5) and—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well then why ask for advice if you're not going to take it? (Laughter) Oh course, I—well you see (inaudible at 0:40:20.7)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:40:20.7)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: These are things that are hard for me to understand.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:40:24.8)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like no one wants advice when they ask for it. You have to assume that is true. All of your neighbors (inaudible at 0:40:38.4)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:40:45.7) It's true for the child too.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well, because I have a feeling that I'm (inaudible at 0:40:47.4)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Someone asking for advice (inaudible at 0:40:48.6)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: I don't want anyone to give me advice. But if I want it, I'll ask for it. This is one of my (inaudible at 0:40:56.3) quirks. [0:40:57.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But it's just saying the same thing in another way. You don't want to advice.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well when I want it, I'll ask for it. And I do occasionally ask for it, believe it or not.</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:41:05.2)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And I expect to have a good answer when I do. (Laughter) But I don't want somebody to give it to me free of charge. I want to have the privilege of at least asking for it. (Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to ask for it, right? But you see what I mean—?</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In terms of this—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: But you see; I didn't cook in a kitchen. And I—you brought up about the mud pies; I probably didn't make mud pies either. So, as I say, I know that a lot of this is because of the way I look on things. And that's why I'm here. Because I want to see Suzanne's side of it as well as my own feeling on the matter. [0:41:50.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, the (inaudible at 0:41:56.2) thing to learn and to realize for you in the light of your first inclination to expect more or expect well. I mean the tough and difficult thing to learn is that expecting what came and the way in which improvement comes, accepting the unacceptable puts (inaudible at 0:42:31.1) the low bar on worthy. So, there's a way in which you free the possibility of improvement occurring mainly.</p>

<p>Her wanting to be better for (inaudible at 0:42:44.6) says and this is all right for you mainly. Cherry pie without tapioca (inaudible at 0:42:59.3) sloppy as can be. If this is all right then she's got a big surprise in store for you. And that is a cherry pie that stays together. [0:43:11.7]</p>

<p>Well, and that one becomes the surprise in something where she could please you with something you didn't expect. Because you settle for something way down here. Man, have I got news for you. I've been thinking about that (inaudible at 0:43:29.8) and I can do it better. I know a new wrinkle on it. And this is where she can learn the desire she has to want to please you and effectively and actually be pleasing you.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: In other words, don't offer constructive criticism.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Forget it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Support and accept. Support what's been done and accept it.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: But support it enthusiastically when you don't feel it, I mean I'm a very honest person clear down to my toes. And, I want to say yes, it's nice and it is nice. But I can't get all this exuberance and (inaudible at 0:44:16.5) that is not there. [0:44:18.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well then—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: I don't do it with anyone. I—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But then you've got it as then this is exactly—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Your problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Exactly your problem. You're not seeing what there is from her point of view that represents something (inaudible at 0:44:33.2)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well that's very—I mean this is right. But as I say, when I don't see it, I just can't get all excited. Oh, this is wonderful. It's—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But when you don't—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Because I don't—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you don't see it then you have your problem in front of you.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see only my own standards. I'm not seeing her achievements, her efforts or whatever she's—this represents to her. So that when she comes to you and says, as a little child with a drawing that's (inaudible at 0:45:07.1) Well you're not going to treat the 3 year olds drawing and say well, that's nothing. When they come with glowing eyes; gees, that's great. Tell me about it. You don't say what is this? Because that implies that it isn't clear that it's something—[0:45:28.5]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: The beautiful array of color.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you say tell me about it. And they will give you what it is. Then by God, you listen to them (inaudible at 0:45:38.9) I guess so. Then you get enthusiastic about that red (inaudible at 0:45:43.1) Why, I'll go with you. It's (inaudible at 0:45:49.3) to me too.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:45:50.6)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so, you're getting kind of (inaudible at 0:45:53.1) And just with simple tell me about it. And any level along the line will let you know what you're missing. That what it might mean over on the other side of the (inaudible at 0:46:09.9)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: And I had (inaudible at 0:46:12.2)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: You see I won't gush over a person either. Oh, it's wonderful to see (inaudible at 0:46:18.9) I mean that looks beautiful. (Inaudible at 0:46:21.2)</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:46:21.8)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: No. But I won't. I'll say you spent a lot of time (inaudible at 0:46:25.5)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:46:25.5) matter of fact. [0:46:26.1]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:46:27.2)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And (inaudible at 0:46:28.3) dress and I think it's a beautiful dress. But if it does nothing for them, I'm not going to say you look gorgeous in the dress. I'll say you have on a lovely dress. It's a beautiful color. But you don't go—I am (inaudible at 0:46:37.7)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:46:37.6)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: No.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:46:39.2)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: I don't think they do. But I will not say they do when I don't think so. But I will tell them it's a beautiful dress. It's a gorgeous color. You know how I look at it? You look funny. No, I'm—I don't say that. But as I say, the truth is that someone instilled in me that I can't do all this fancy stuff when I know it's not right.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:47:02.9) this is our problem. We've got to do—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the fact is well from there, there are all kind—levels of truth you see.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think this is what you'd have to be willing to accept is that the truth of the accomplishment of the 11 year old or the 3 year old or the 5 year old in it's sense of rightness and appropriateness, there's a truth in that that you just can't get at any other age point. And this is the truthness—the rightness that is and is the achievement of the product of this level of ability and this level of maturity. [0:47:48.6]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: But I'm not (inaudible at 0:47:50.5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's not the truth of adult perfection and adult accomplishment. Again, it's the truth. I mean mud pies are really wonderful things. And I can't get back to making them you see. I couldn't make a mud pie (inaudible at 0:48:13.1) I'm spoiled into adulthood or I haven't found yet the exuberance of a three year olds mud pie and it's something to behold.</p>

<p>And it's a real truth and it's—this is accomplishment. And it's the stuff out of which rather than saying oh, don't waste your time on mud. It's a step out of which (inaudible at 0:48:41.8) And a three year old can construct this and a four year old can (inaudible at 0:48:50.6) And this says to each age its own level. And, you really have to be willing to one, to appreciate its own inner meaning, its own inner sense of rightness that must be there.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Understanding the other (inaudible at 0:49:17.8) [0:49:18.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now I'm a big (inaudible at 0:49:21.3) if you make the kind of effort with Suzanne on day to day things or school (inaudible at 0:49:30.0) and so on, she would be so startled with you that she would get a whole new zest of enthusiasm (inaudible at 0:49:40.9) of trying to do things that are startling to you. That she'll—she'd realize there's some things—she would be so—that you have broken through to her expectations in that nothing is going to be right. And she'll be free to go ahead and discover there's something more that would be even more pleasing. [0:50:05.8]</p>

<p>Try this for a while. And, maybe two or three months from now, you're (inaudible at 0:50:28.3) And we'll have another session about three months from now. And then if things are going well, we might be able to cut them back (inaudible at 0:50:42.0) session.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Okay.</p>

<p>(Pause in tape)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Family Pastoral Care by Dr. Russell J. Becker. Publisher is Prentice Fall, 1965.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: I (inaudible at 0:51:07.3) the fact that I saw Suzanne's teacher. Yesterday I had a conference with her. And, it's not a new problem. It's the same thing as in—she's had the same problem except that she (inaudible at 0:51:19.5) school. And, one of the new things is that she—[0:51:23.7]</p>

<p>(Noise on tape 0:51:24.0)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Which is something that she needs to work on. And, we feel that Suzanne is very demanding in attention. And—</p>

<p>(Noise on tape 0:51:43.6)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: In trying to get the attention that she would like to have and the praise that she would like to have. Many times my daughter, she is going able it the wrong way. And instead of maybe getting praise for something she's done, she's over (inaudible at 0:52:01.5) some place and instead she's getting criticism. And, that's hard. And so, we thought that maybe you could help us. Help Bill and I to present Suzanne (inaudible at 0:52:19.0) help her. Suzanne doesn't feel it is a problem. And, yet Bill and I are looking to the future (inaudible at 0:52:30.3) if we could give her help now (inaudible at 0:52:34.6) control. (Inaudible at 0:52:39.2) that she does but (inaudible at 0:52:43.6) getting her here. And we tried to give Suzanne the things (inaudible at 0:52:56.9) we try to divide (inaudible at 0:52:59.1) she feels that she is getting hers. And I feel that Billy feels he is always getting he is getting his share either. [0:53:06.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And so this—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And the other—there is one other thing. And that's the fact that Suzie and her teachers have always said she is a very capable child. A very capable girl. She can do much better work than she is doing. But she has the attitude that well, why should I work any harder? And this, for her teachers, this is something that bothers the teachers because they want her to work to—up to her capacity, if possible, for her own sake. And, they feel that she definitely can do better than she's doing but she doesn't seem to care. She doesn't have the drive to do better. And we would like to help through that so that she does have this desire to make better grades then this. Not that she—not that we want her to give up all of her pleasures and just sit at home and study and nothing else. But, perhaps having a little more self control and working a little harder at the time allotted her studies instead of maybe looking around and thinking well, now what am I going to do when this is over or what will I be doing say at recess. [0:54:26.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: If she would apply herself which she's capable of doing. And when she really wants to—</p>

<p>(Noise on tape 0:54:33.8)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Okay. Let me say one thing about it. There's—what we're talking about now is beyond the normal. That's—but, I mean this is normal throughout a childhood to have this type of reaction but this is a little bit further than normal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now let me have some time alone with Suzanne. And then, I can spend some time with the two of you. And then maybe if we can arrive at something that's helpful. Okay?</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:55:11.6) 15 or 20 minutes time. Yeah.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: My. (Laughter) I'd say (inaudible at 0:55:18.0)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's all right. Hello Suzanne. I take it they think there's a (inaudible at 0:55:29.1) problem here and, would like to know if there's some way they can be of help, I suppose. Some way things could be going differently. What do you think? What—? [0:55:51.5]</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: I don't think there's a problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't think there's a problem. How do things look to you?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Well I don't think—</p>

<p>(Noise on tape 0:56:00.5)</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: And when my daddy came home, he said it was awful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of that not to happen quite often. Is this what you feel? That you're trying and you don't even get credit for the amount of trying you do. Is that it?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Um—hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That kind of makes you feel like what's the use of trying (inaudible at 0:56:34.1) Are there things—how do you see things in terms of school?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:56:48.7) school for one reason. And the teachers are always so unfair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're unfair.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Because they think I (inaudible at 0:56:59.0) because a kid (inaudible at 0:57:00.2) And I say ouch and I get a detention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're the one who gets caught and gets punished. And that's unfair. When they say that you kind of you lose your temper, what do they mean by that? [0:57:21.1]</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Well I just don't think it's fair and I get mad and I start yelling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I mean I guess you're only yelling because it is sometime that's been provoking and kind of (inaudible at 0:57:37.1) you into a situation.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: And I'm also (inaudible at 0:57:43.6) caught for things that I didn't do. So I was sitting in my chair and these two boys were talking. And I dropped my pencil and when I turned around, they (inaudible at 0:57:55.3) And she said that I was in a conversation and I got in trouble for the other boys. I didn't say one word.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel she has it in for you or—?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Well I feel that (inaudible at 0:58:12.8) my teacher didn't like me, see? And so, I figured that she told the other teachers that I wasn't a very good student and that (inaudible at 0:58:22.3) trouble. [0:58:23.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And right from the start of the year? Kind of feel as though you're battling against some pretty tremendous odds here then? When they say you're not working as hard as you could and not doing as much as you could in terms of—?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Because when I get—when I do my highest, look what I get when my dad says it isn't very nice. He says it looks funny. I don't feel that it's very nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Inaudible at 0:59:23.8) [0:59:25.7]</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 0:59:25.6)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know he's pretty harsh on you? He really isn't as harsh on Billy? So in a sense, it really feels like you can get (inaudible at 0:59:57.1)</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: And I do things and momma says that I kind of want Billy (inaudible at 1:00:02.0)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of gets to you and you can't do anything wrong and—</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Just get so sick of (inaudible at 1:00:37.8) the other leaders always pay attention to their kids but oh, mother never comes up with me and helps me with anything. She expects me to care and hope that I will and it's not fair. [1:00:53.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As you lose out with her being the leader, is that it?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Well I want her to be the leader but (inaudible at 1:01:01.9) should just get more attention than me I'd like it better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not being completely knocked out of it. Is that it?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Yes. And all the other girls, she's always helping them. And then when I (inaudible at 1:01:17.7) ask her to help me, she says well I have somebody (inaudible at 1:01:20.8) to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's as though you're on your own? Do you have studying to do at home, Suzanne? [1:01:58.9]</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: For social studies sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Mommy helps me with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they keep after you to do your studying or not?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Yeah. And (inaudible at 1:02:13.5) doing it before or after dinner and I do it after dinner. And daddy helps me with my arithmetic because last year I got low grades in it. And so this year when—if I make a mistake and I don't understand things, he starts yelling at me. And he goes whenever you're not following it, always come to me. So when I come to him if I don't get the right thing, he yells at me. He wants me to be perfect all the time and it's not easy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you come to him because you need help and then he thinks this is just horrible that you're—[1:03:03.6]</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Um—hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Need help and still says you're supposed to come to him.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's kind of—</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:03:14.5) if you don't hang up your clothes (inaudible at 1:03:16.3) When he found one of my old (inaudible at 1:03:19.7) that wasn't (inaudible at 1:03:20.5) that's where we keep our old clothes. And he started yelling at me. And then I had to go to bed five minutes earlier because it was in there. I didn't think that was very fair. And I'm always trying to fix up Billy's. When I tell momma that I found some of his things, she says well let it go until I find it. Well what if she doesn't? Well if she does find it, all she says is Billy use your head. And then Billy doesn't have to go to bed earlier. Just me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The rules don't (inaudible at 1:03:56.0) for both of you. Billy gets a real break every time.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Um—hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you just kind of really can't leave them and give up trying. Is that it? [1:04:34.1]</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Um—hum. And when I do try, they're not (inaudible at 1:04:38.8) nice and make me keep trying. And I know when I try and you know if I'm (inaudible at 1:04:42.9) of not trying and I try my hardest. And (inaudible at 1:04:46.1) And I try and when I don't get good grades then I'm (inaudible at 1:04:53.3) and that I'm not trying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They don't recognize—they don't know when you're trying?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Yeah. (Inaudible at 1:05:03.3) I'm not trying but they don't know if I'm trying or not. I could try my hardest and they'll say I'm not even trying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. They're quick to tell you—</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: What to do and what not to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everything. So I guess you feel up against a pretty tough situation, right? Like when both of your teachers and your parents are—[1:05:46.8]</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:05:48.0) it's not easy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not really understanding you. That's a real up hill pull.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Um—hum. And I try sometimes real hard and daddy says well why don't I try harder? I can't try harder and it's awful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you just don't know what to do to please them.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: I can't turn to anybody for help because everybody is against me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The kind of people you expect to be of help to you—</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:06:30.3)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are not—they're not pulling for you. (Inaudible at 1:06:35.4) So how do you think your mommy and daddy look at you? I mean how do you they take these things? [1:07:04.7]</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Well they think of them a lot differently than I do. And I just don't think they care about what happens to me. But what happens to Billy is awful. And it's everything is for Billy and everybody's—my grandfather probably (inaudible at 1:07:25.3) here mommy (inaudible at 1:07:27.5) make you something out of it. So now mother is going to make Billy something when she promised me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you say you see them as caring an awful lot about Billy and just none at all about you.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Yeah. And I get up in the morning before school at 6:30 a.m. and I'm cranky because I didn't get enough rest from the night before. And then momma is mad at me because I don't want to wear this dress and that dress. And, it's just not fun anymore. [1:08:11.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just the whole day starts wrong then.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: And then it stays wrong for the whole day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um—hum. What do you think makes them unhappy with you?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: I don't know. But I'm just not the (inaudible at 1:08:38.4) child that they want. I (inaudible at 1:08:41.1) but I don't know what else I can do. And they're always telling me to do this and do that. And when I do it, it's just something else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a real struggle. Well it's quite a struggle. [1:09:11.7]</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: With your teachers against you and your parents are against you, it's not easy to hold out there any longer. Because there's nothing you can do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're just sunk?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Yeah. You sit and wait until they change their minds about you and (inaudible at 1:09:29.8) It's like you're out of the family because they won't help you with anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um—hum.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: It's not very fair to (inaudible at 1:09:48.8) because I'm always the one that gets left out. And last night momma told me I spent the night at my friend's house and momma told that all they were going to do is go out and get a hamburger and come home. And then they have my favorite dinner, steak and all kinds of stuff. [1:10:04.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of you missed out.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: When they tell you one thing—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And do something.</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: You believe in them. And then when they go (inaudible at 1:10:17.6) that's when they tell you to always believe your parents, you just can't because they never do what they tell you they're going to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you just can't be sure of them?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: No. I said you believe all of the kids on the block except your parents. Well what else am I supposed to—my parents tell me one thing and then they don't do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 1:10:41.7) Well, I guess this helps me see what's happening for you. And I would like to talk to your mother and father for a little bit. And then I'd like to talk to the two of you together—the three of you together. Okay?</p>

<p>SUZANNE BETTERLY: Okay. [1:11:04.2]</p>

<p>(Background conversation)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just I'd like to (inaudible at 1:11:51.8) with the two of you now to get a (inaudible at 1:11:57.1) as to how you see Suzanne. If you want to elaborate in any way (inaudible at 1:12:05.7) Basically, she isn't working up to her ability. And I'm worried about what this means. She got reports in terms of her temper. She lost her temper at school and so on. [1:12:25.2]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: I think it goes deeper than that, Russ.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Whether Maxie and I are—if we had laid awake at night past our regular bedtime hours, for hours into the night, discussing this thing. Once we had done this, I don't know how many times. And the funny part about it is we have done it for almost 11 years. Suzanne, as a baby, showed—was very indifferent about being loved. And, you'd try to keep her up and hold her and she just wouldn't—she wanted to get down. And you tried to love her up or anything; she wanted no part of it.</p>

<p>Now, she just can't seem to get enough of it. We try to love her. And we do love her. Oh course, we love her. But I mean it's just that she doesn't have a valuable that we can't give her enough. That there is not enough love in this world for her. And as a result (inaudible at 1:13:35.0) is constantly fighting for attention, for praise and everything else over and beyond her brother and her mother and her father and everything else that she just—we don't know whether it's extreme self—centered selfishness or whether it's insecurity or what this basic thing is. And it's all these things together which cause, I'm sure, the trouble in school. I mean this is not just a lack of initiative in school nor is it lack of self control. Is that I think it all comes down to the other thing that causes this. She—[1:14:20.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's a basic demanding here on her part that is—that presses you to the wall really.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Really it does. And (inaudible at 1:14:32.7) you want to express your love but—and at the same time, you know that if you go back hard you're going to get drawn in it much further. And finally, you are at the wall. And then Maxie and I are both only children. Frankly we're probably not the best of parents. We—let's put it this way, we've never been educated to be the best of parents. This is something that either comes normal or it doesn't come normal. We've done everything we think we can do and should do. And, I think finally the problem is with us of knowing how to handle her and how to care for her.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And yet, we've got two children. (Inaudible at 1:15:17.8)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Yeah. The other one is exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She would have been a perfect only child because she would have received all of the attention then. [1:15:24.3]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: And she has a terrific adult yearning. And like I say again, I'm fully aware of other children. I mean when I say the things I say, this probably sounds normal for any child. But she seems to want to go beyond this. For example, we always heard in (inaudible at 1:15:46.8) that they'll ask a question and drop it. Not there, it goes on and on and on and on in the matter of dating or anything like that.</p>

<p>Now she wants this type of thing. And she's not really old enough to have the responsibility that goes with it. I mean some girls mature early and you don't mind because they have the responsibility and the sense of reality to go ahead on some things like that. But not with Suzanne, she's still not even 11 yet. But yet she wants these older type things. She's crazy about wearing lipstick and will get into it at every advantage. You know kind of we ignored it at first figuring it would pass but this doesn't pass easy. [1:16:41.1]</p>

<p>She wants to sample alcohol or smoke a cigarette and things like this. But, to me, it looks like she wants to be grown up ahead of time. But, and then this is the thing that bothers us for the future that we—neither one of us had hoped for a while a teenager which (Laughter) we're trying to get at this thing now because—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really have because of her curiosity at this point; you really have fears for her of trouble later on. How far she would move into things which I expect most kids (inaudible at 1:17:28.3) about?</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. (Inaudible at 1:17:31.7)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:17:31.9) but she doesn't seem to have any—how did you say it last night? [1:17:36.7]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well, I was (inaudible at 1:17:38.8) her timing is very poor. She's always kind of irritated at me. I (inaudible at 1:17:45.9) Suzanne's (inaudible at 1:17:47.4) And the other day she was telling me that she takes ballet at 5:15 p.m. and she (inaudible at 1:17:57.2) So she leaves just a little bit early to get a ride over there to Roosevelt.</p>

<p>And, so Suzanne, she has a remarkable memory but it's very poor at times. It can be very poor when it's convenient. She always forgets to wear her Girl Scout uniform. And she's worn one now for three years. This is going on for every Wednesday and the day has never changes. It's been a Wednesday ever since she's started in Brownie Scouts. But this year, she can't remember to wear her Girl Scout dress.</p>

<p>So she tells me that the girls at school (inaudible at 1:18:29.6) I have many of them in my scout troop. I have 23. They're—I can't say the word but anyway, they're saying well, you don't have to wear your Girl Scout uniform because you're a leader's daughter. And you get to leave a little bit early to go to ballet see. With this part she says you'll have—you don't have no idea how much trouble I get (inaudible at 1:18:52.0) And yet, she is telling me that I don't give her enough time in Scouts. I don't sit down and talk. She'll approach me on how to do something and I'm always pushing her aside. [1:19:02.7]</p>

<p>And yet to give you an example of her poor time that I brought up in beginning, when I am explaining something, it's to the whole group. She goes up to me and (inaudible at 1:19:11.5) mother, mother, mother, I have to yes dear, your slip is showing. It couldn't be (inaudible at 1:19:20.2) Here I am, I am embarrassed to begin in. And secondly, it wasn't so important. It's already hung a half hour so why can't it hang a few more minutes until I finish with these girls? And then she come up to me when I (inaudible at 1:19:30.5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's extremely bright.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. She is. If she wants to know something and she's been this way ever since she's been—what's this? What's that? Never—she could never decide whether this is well something she should come (inaudible at 1:19:45.3) who is that or tell me about this. But when it goes through her mind, she's out with it. It doesn't make any difference where you are or what it's about. If she wants to know, she just will not wait. It's got to be right then. And, many times, you are embarrassed. And you try to ease her off and a little bit later. Then, oh course, later she doesn't always remember to bring it up to you and you don't remember to bring it up to her. [1:20:12.6]</p>

<p>So, she has it then and if she thinks (inaudible at 1:20:15.0) which really she's not. Whatever it is—this question is that she is asking; I would be more than happy to answer it. But sometimes we—I'm not in a position that we can do it right then. Because knowing Suzanne, some of these things involve a little more time than you have at this particular moment and depending upon where you are. I know she (inaudible at 1:20:36.7) outspoken but (laughter) going on, there will be (inaudible at 1:20:41.0) was wrong with one of the (inaudible at 1:20:42.3) I don't really (inaudible at 1:20:43.0) Mother, look at that man back there. Why is he (inaudible at 1:20:48.7) or whatever his deformity was? (Inaudible at 1:20:54.1—whispered) What do you (inaudible at 1:20:57.3) (Laughter) Oh, you know about these—this is Sue.</p>

<p>This is Sue. And, oh course, there's demanding of attention and a lot of it just to get attention. She resents Billy—has ever since he's been here. And yet, he doesn't resent her. If he does, he's is very mild. He's always had to—with him. He always thinks of her. If he's given candy at the barber shop, he'll just try to—he'll either ask for two and if he thinks there's a possibility of not getting two then he just goes over and takes two to take one home to her see. She isn't as apt to do that for him. She might take two and eat both on the way (Laughter) home. [1:21:51.1]</p>

<p>She is getting a little bit better. I was pleased with her the other night. Bill really didn't his dinner and Bill told him he was going to bed. And Sue got quite upset about it. Well she just thought he was being awfully mean to Billy. It wasn't fair that he was putting him to bed. Well Billy had a half hour to eat. Well, if he—if it told him an hour to eat, let him sit there and eat. And this is the first time that she has ever shown of really taking his part. We haven't been able to get her to take his part any place.</p>

<p>Outside and I never push Billy off on Sue. She never had to stay in from playing to care of him. She never—I don't think she's ever had to give up anything for Billy. I never wanted her to feel that she had to give up her stuff in order to—for me to go some place to take care of Billy. Once in a while (inaudible at 1:22:44.3) leave the two of them home to run and do any of that. But when he was little, she didn't have to give up playing with her friends in order to stay with her brother. So the feeling of resentment of him does not come from that. It's their sharing attention. [1:23:00.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you're saying you've tried to be lenient on her.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Exceptionally so. Yes. I have taken him with me when really she come have looked after him. And yes, her—she doesn't really—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: She never really understands how much attention she is getting.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And she really can't determine right from wrong. (Inaudible at 1:23:27.0) last Saturday Bill and I had to run into the lumber yard. And we were gone over longer than I thought we would be but the children were all right. It was in an hour of appropriate time that they could be watching television and (inaudible at 1:23:39.8) themselves. And we told them that. And came back and—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: We live in a wood house you know.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Suzanne had made a dessert which was fine. Because I try not (inaudible at 1:23:51.1) that was fine. But they built a fire in the fireplace. And this is one thing that we had pointed out to the children. They know that we live in a wood house and we have to be extremely careful. And when a fireplace is built, either Bill or myself is there. Now occasionally we let one of the children do it but it is supervised. And oh course, we were just well, it's a horrible thing when you think my gosh; I could have come home and both of children would have been laying here burnt to death. [1:24:21.0]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:24:22.5)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And she was extremely upset because she thought she had done something so nice for us. And it was too bad that we had to want to bawl her out for doing this because we don't dare let these children light a fire while we're gone. If a spark should—in there (inaudible at 1:24:47.2) fire—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: I mean it was beyond the normal of not having a good day.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yeah. I—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: That we had (inaudible at 1:24:52.3)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:24:52.4)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: It's not that we haven't explained this. We have done this. I don't allow either one of them to play with matches unless I am there (inaudible at 1:25:02.2) because the cork on floor and the wood walls and (inaudible at 1:25:06.0) and everything and (inaudible at 1:25:07.4)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And she was—she said well, Billy wanted to build a fire. Well that was all right but we said to her, you should have said well now Billy we should not build a fire when mother and daddy are not here. But the idea, one thought of it and the other one (inaudible at 1:25:24.9) that would be fun. (Inaudible at 1:25:26.6) when mother and daddy are home but she is 11. And I feel she is at the age where she should be able to think to herself well now is this something that is all right for us to do? We know other children of 11 that are quite capable of this and yet I know that you should not compare your child to some other child. But this is where Suzanne wanted to do something—[1:25:51.5]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:25:52.3)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Really nice. Doing something special so you'll be pleased when you come home. And yet her decision (inaudible at 1:25:58.0) is so wrong. If she would have just made the dessert that would have been perfect you see. But she had to go one step further and build a fire. And then oh course, the whole thing was burned out and she was quite upset over the fact that she had tried to do something nice and we didn't appreciate it. And it wasn't that we didn't appreciate the thought but it was that that was wrong in our house for she and Billy to build a fire.</p>

<p>Now this is Sue. Billy and the rest of us can work around a bucket of paint all day and not a drop gets spilt and no one gets it on them. Sue (inaudible at 1:26:32.1) could have been gone all day and walked in at 5:00 p.m. and that bucket of paint is still there. And before you know it, it's either spilt, it's down the front of her or it's on something. Now how it happens, I don't know. (Laughter) But this is Sue along with her striving her the attention and love that she feels she's not getting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (inaudible at 1:26:54.0) that she does all parts of exasperating things. So she'll find an exasperating thing to do. [1:27:01.9]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. I don't know how—and I don't know how (inaudible at 1:27:05.1) myself. And yet there are some times when she is very, very good about things.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: She's very sweet and—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She'll say that she can't do this. Now there are some things when she knows that she can't do it. Now this fireplace business, it can probably come up another time from now. And I don't imagine she'll ever light another fire unless she did ask. And some things she can just be boy, if she knows she's not (inaudible at 1:27:34.9) she won't budge. But when it comes to (inaudible at 1:27:39.9) in the very beginning is this right or is this wrong, she just doesn't (inaudible at 1:27:44.4) I don't know whether inside she's thinking I shouldn't do it. But on the other hand, it would be so nice to do it. You see? This I don't understand. (Inaudible at 1:27:59.90 and that she is a bright child.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 1:28:03.6)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Her teachers tell her she is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're saying you don't know how she arrives at the—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: No. I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actions that are wrong. And I (inaudible at 1:28:15.3) you're saying she just mystifies you. [1:28:17.2]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. And she is (inaudible at 1:28:19.2) There are times when it just got all over her and she's full of life. She loves (inaudible at 1:28:25.8)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: There's one other insight on that. I don't know if this has any bearing on it or not. But Suzanne seems to be an individual and there are quite a few of them I guess. I didn't realize there were. But she's extremely insensitive to or extremely sensitive to the pain in any sort of a way. She is—almost 100% of it is if she gets a slight cut or anything that drowns her physically, it's either the whole medicine chest or get to the doctor or complaining about it all the time all day long. A slight tummy ache in the morning is, to her, terrific and unbearable. And if we do leave her stay home from school and then (inaudible at 1:29:23.1) [1:29:23.7]</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:29:23.9)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: But, she is always over sensitive to pain as evidenced by if Billy happens to touch her, she's liable to bust out in crying. Or she'll hit him 16 times as hard as he hit her. She seems to have no balance either in recite to what she has (inaudible at 1:29:46.0) and what she receives.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And this has come back to her thing, she's not getting enough love.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: She doesn't seem to realize that other people feel pain. And yet, in her own mind, she (inaudible at 1:30:00.4) pain terribly. If you touch her, well as a child, you could play. And I had to be—it was almost like I was (inaudible at 1:30:11.1) because if I (inaudible at 1:30:13.1) a little bit wrong it would get her to a cry, a real hysterical cry almost. Billy and I, we wrestled. He wants to fight back. I mean he doesn't give up too easily. But Sue, as long as she's winning, will fight. [1:30:32.2]</p>

<p>But let one little bit of defeat come in there and she's had it. There is no fighting back after that. As long as she's on the winning team and well as evidence by the fact in school yesterday as I was saying, she had a bottle of paste on her desk which didn't belong there in the first place. And one of the kids made (inaudible at 1:30:52.9) and she just got out of her seat and crumbled every bit of paper on his desk that he had been working on all morning and, threw it on the floor. Well now, the point we're driving at is what was done her and the damage inflicted here was in no relationship to each other. And—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And she felt that she was right. Because when I got to see the teacher and when she—she was ready. She said and another thing, this particular sixth grade in junior high that have gotten (inaudible at 1:31:28.4) they are very immature for 11 years and so—</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:31:32.1) grade have been a problem. [1:30:32.2]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: This the teacher said, she said (inaudible at 1:31:38.0) But she was telling me about this and she said I don't know how to get through to Suzanne. She said I don't (inaudible at 1:31:46.5) And she said she did this particular thing and she said she couldn't understand why she was perfectly right in ruining his papers because he had touched her paste. But he had not hurt her paste in any way. He had not done anything to it that she could not use it. And he had (inaudible at 1:32:07.9)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: He didn't wipe it on her (inaudible at 1:32:08.8) so he didn't do wrong.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: It was just one of those things that was set to temptation and he just (inaudible at 1:32:12.4) stuck his finger in it. (Inaudible at 1:32:13.7) So here again, the balance is not—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're saying that you find her unreasonable.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. And Bill will tell you about seeing that. Suzanne had an eye test Thursday. Billy had his eyes tested Friday. They both had to have drops. They both wore little glasses like this. We had to wait a half hour after the drops were put in for (inaudible at 1:32:36.8) And Sue complained of these glasses cutting her face and hurting her nose for the whole half hour. [1:32:46.6]</p>

<p>So I thought well, now we have the same thing on Friday. Billy never once mentioned that those glasses were a little sharp, that they hurt his face (inaudible at 1:32:58.0) or that they hurt him in any way. He put them on and they did slide a little bit. And he talked about (inaudible at 1:33:05.2) He never once said they hurt him.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Well she expects life to be a complete bowl of cherries with sugar and cream right there and no hardship whatsoever. There's nothing in life that should irritate her or arouse her or anything else. And, but life just ain't this way. (Laughter) And I want to get her ready for it. And frankly, I think it's probably us that needs the advice of how do we go about this that life just is not a bowl of cherries. That there are other individuals' desires and things that have to be reckoned with and that she has to be a team in society. And there are bound to be irritations in everything that (inaudible at 1:33:53.7) [1:33:55.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you see her picture of herself? What do you think she's thinking of herself?</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: She don't think she's good enough. I don't think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good enough for what?</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: She doesn't think she's as bright enough as she should be or is or she knocks herself. She doesn't think she's up to par.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She thinks she's terrible. She's one of the shortest girls in her class. Everybody is so much bigger than she is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're saying she does not think she's good enough for whom or for—?</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Well as compared to the average.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's in what way? Intelligence?</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Yeah. She keeps saying when we're working on homework (inaudible at 1:34:51.3) oh; I'm not smart enough for it. I'm not—I'm a dummy or something like that. I forget what—[1:35:01.0]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And there's the lack of self confidence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she sees herself as (inaudible at 1:35:15.4)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Inadequate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Inadequate.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:35:17.3) And we have set her standards too high. Unfortunately Bill and I do have, I feel, rather high standard in work that we do. When Bill does any carpentry around the house, he wants it to be right. He doesn't like a sloppy joint. He doesn't want to (inaudible at 1:35:44.8) something together and have a crack in it. He wants it to fit. And I like to sew and I constantly strive for perfection. That's as much a phobia with me as whatever is bothering Sue because I want it to right. I want it to look right and whatever it is, to be the right color and everything else. That's something that's in me and perhaps; we have made the standards too high for Sue. This I don't know. [1:36:18.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And, when she says she can (inaudible at 1:36:21.9) as long as I can do something and get by but why strive any harder. Her teacher says she (inaudible at 1:36:30.2) her writing is terrible. She said she doesn't try. Her English is very poor. She said she doesn't (inaudible at 1:36:36.1)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: And then she had a vocabulary of a six year old when she was two almost.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 1:36:43.0) You're saying that (inaudible at 1:36:50.4) feeling as though she doesn't measure up. And, for yourselves as having helped (inaudible at 1:37:00.9) as believing that she has high ability. And, I guess you're saying by that that you feel well you've wanted her to measure up. You've wanted her to come up to some—[1:37:23.9]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:37:25.8) in her own (inaudible at 1:37:26.9) the one that she sets for herself, she loves plays and she loves acting. And she likes all these other things. But even those things that she loves, she will (inaudible at 1:37:47.8) piano and music. She loves music. She sings. She can memorize a song like that and that's that. She can hear a melody and she'd go down and play it on the piano.</p>

<p>As much as she likes it, she will not strive to do anything with it other than an occasional you know. I mean we give her her piano lessons. She begged for piano lessons. That's all we heard about. We went out and bought a piano and gave her piano lessons. As soon as she got this (inaudible at 1:38:19.7), she didn't want any part of it. She will get something on her mind that she wants, she wanted—what do you call those little animals? [1:38:33.1]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:38:35.3)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:38:36.5) The guinea pig like. Yeah. She wanted a guinea pig. That's all we heard around (inaudible at 1:38:42.1) is a guinea pig, a guinea pig, a guinea pig. So we got it and two days—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well she took her money.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Yeah.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: We finally told her she could have it.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: She'd earn it.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: If she would earn the money.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: If she'd earn it.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And so she finally scrounged around and found a silver dollar that had been given to her (Laughter) and some other money. And finally (inaudible at 1:38:59.3) that she managed to scrap $2 (inaudible at 1:39:02.6)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: She bought the guinea pig and then that was—and I—and she and I made a cage for it together. We worked hard. I figured if she worked on the cage with me and help me with the thing and she wanted to, this would build (inaudible at 1:39:13.7) Two days later bang, the guinea pig (inaudible at 1:39:16.5) and then nothing to do with it. Except maybe three minutes a day attention, that was it.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She might take it out of the cage and play with it a little bit. [1:39:24.1]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: But then put it away and then she (inaudible at 1:39:25.4) this desire that was there forgotten as soon as she had what she wanted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess I hear you saying that you see her as feeling inadequate within her and yet, you also see her as not pushing herself.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: No. That's true.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She won't.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: You know (inaudible at 1:39:46.9) connected with what she wants.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She'll—well she sees herself as wanting things and not wanting to do anything about them.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And Bill is an excellent father really to the children. He—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Well I don't think I am but—[1:40:11.7]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: He takes time out to help them build this and help them build that. Christmas day he spent all day on their toys. If they break down, he fixes them. He helps them figure out this. Helping them to figure out that. And I say there are few fathers that take the time with their children that Bill has. My dad traveled all the time. He certainly didn't. Bill's dad never did it for him. But the children can—will never be able to say that their daddy didn't sit down and help them. Because if they want to build something, by golly, Bill's got the nails for them and the hammers and we help them figure out how to do it. And then, oh course, he expects them at some point to take over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you think she looks at you? Sees you?</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: I don't know.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Again, this is probably one of the greatest things that baffles both of us.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Well I love that we love her and we wouldn't even be here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 1:41:09.0)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: I don't know.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well I would say, as a very strict mother and probably one that's not too understanding. [1:41:16.5]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:41:24.0) of always being unfair. How fair is fair?</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:41:29.4) was real little, you don't love me anymore or you wouldn't make me do this. And I keep saying to Suzanne, if I didn't love you, I wouldn't make you do this. I would just let you go. But I do love you and I want you to do this because it is necessary for you to learn it or whatever it might happen to be. But she thinks we are being hard on her. Yes.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: And unfair.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. And what else she thinks I don't know. But those two things, I know that she feels that way. She's unhappy.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: She is. Yeah.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And her teacher says that she's unhappy.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: She's an extreme (inaudible at 1:42:13.7) She can't—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: We can punish her by making her stay in her bedroom. [1:42:19.5]</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Yeah.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Because she's got books, dolls, paint sets—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Everything.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She can't find one thing to do in her bedroom. We put her in her bedroom (inaudible at 1:42:28.8) because—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Find something to do but she won't.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She hasn't—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:42:34.0)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Done (inaudible at 1:42:35.1) like she should. And I'll put her there and maybe she'll just interest herself in something. She'll either sit on her bed or in (inaudible at 1:42:42.5) or stand at her doorway like this. If she's going to think of going (inaudible at 1:42:47.5) And then—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: She's just got to be with people all the time.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And then she—</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Whether it's adults or whether it's children or what. If we have company, (inaudible at 1:43:02.4)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:43:02.4)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: Sit right down and carry on a conversation right with the rest of us. Or if she has a guest over, she wants the guest right with her and she don't want Billy or us around. But if Billy has guests, she wants right in there. I mean she's just got to be in with all these people all the time. Never by herself. And—[1:43:27.3]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And she wasn't left when she was little.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: No. No.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Never.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: It's amazing and it's like the (inaudible at 1:43:34.2) all the time until I was 19. I mean by that (inaudible at 1:43:40.1) I've never been one in the social world where—</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: We don't want now (inaudible at 1:43:45.1)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: (Inaudible at 1:43:45.3) and give her to somebody else all the time because we just don't.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: And we certainly didn't then.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: No.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: We couldn't afford to.</p>

<p>MR. BETTERLY: No.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: When she was little, to go out. Maybe we would go out once a month and it was (inaudible at 1:43:58.9) We even did that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think it might be helpful to spend some time now with the three of you to see if I can sort of play back the two of you these various pictures each of you hold of the other. And what are the—where the difficulty comes. I think that would be well to do with her here because I think that—[1:44:37.1]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Do you feel that she will understand this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yes. Just like that.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She was (inaudible at 1:44:44.6) over the fact that we were bringing her here today. She was very angry with me. Didn't think it was right at all. She didn't want to come. And I talked to her at great length about it. And finally I said to her, well will you please come just for her? I said not for yourself but I said I want you to do it for me. I said I feel that there are things I should be doing for you and understanding about you. And I don't. And I said I never had anybody's assistance and I, in my experience with children has been very (inaudible at 1:45:19.4) And I said I feel the only way I can understand you and children of your age will be to come here today. I didn't try to—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did she say to that? [1:45:32.3]</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: She still didn't want to come. And I said well you've just got to (inaudible at 1:45:37.3) Mr. Betterly is going to take his time this morning to see us and I said it would not be fair for us to call him now and say that we were (inaudible at 1:45:45.7)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think it would be very beneficial and more beneficial with the three of you than (inaudible at 1:45:57.1) speaking to the two of you or back to her alone.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well I have one other question to ask. Will you have some (inaudible at 1:46:09.3) to make on things that we should do or can do to help Sue?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's what I'm going to do now.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Yes. Well that's (inaudible at 1:46:18.4)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not in suggestion form but to let you see what you're dealing with in each other and in yourself.</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: Well, but I feel that unless we have some very concrete suggestions made, Bill and I have been struggling with this problem now for quite some time. And apparently we haven't been able to come to any good solution. And, I feel that you could probably say well now, this is maybe a place where you could do this. Or you could try this. [1:46:53.0]</p>

<p>And, I'm not speaking for Bill, I'm speaking for myself. I feel that I'm very blind and I—there are things that are evident that I should be able to recognize but for some reason I don't. My own personality is involved in this thing too. And perhaps I'm stubborn and just won't give up and say well, this is it. Let's do something about it. And even if I did know that something could be done, I wouldn't know which way to turn. So that's why I feel (inaudible at 1:47:24.9) something (inaudible at 1:47:26.4) now we are going to try this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 1:47:34.4)</p>

<p>MRS. BETTERLY: I work much better with a pattern. (Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think a pattern (inaudible at 1:47:40.0)</p>

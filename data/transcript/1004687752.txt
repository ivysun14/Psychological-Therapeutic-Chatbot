<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So any news on the insurance?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. Nothing definite. It looks like they're—sorry. Two things. It's looks like they're going to put me back on Blue Cross over the next week. That was what they told me on Wednesday; however they haven't sent me the contract they were supposed to send me as of today. And I called the guy back this morning to follow up about it and I haven't heard from him yet. So, it's been a short enough time-span that doesn't in itself make it seem unlikely, so that's been good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I haven't done anything for it yet so—okay, good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it is likely, in fact it's almost definite, that even if I get back on Blue Cross now, I would get off as of January 1st.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so I'll look into the other options anyway and just see how it goes</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. According to other people it does cost a little more to get on the other plan that would let you see me out of network, but it costs that much more for me to look for couples for $45 a month or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, and I'm only insured—I'm only—am myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh it's just you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He has his own?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, he has his own insurance. Actually what I thought about the  plan that you have to buy—you can't just buy it for your spouse, you have to buy the family plan, and so it ends up being more and it made sense when he had crappier insurance but now that he has better insurance it doesn't make sense. So, yes, so I'll look into that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess speaking of review I'm having some issues. So I didn't go out for my final. I was telling you that he was texting with some girl and it really hurt me. So I decided to just approach it, whatever. So I told him how I felt when he kind of backed up the message really quick and didn't really have an explanation or his hands went out when I said oh when did you start talking to her, and how it made me feel uncomfortable and uneasy. And I was just kind of wondering why he was talking to her so much, what was going on there, I don't want to make it seem like I don't want you to have friends but if you're going to have friends, have friends, not just somebody that you're chatting with all day long on text. And he basically, I mean he apologized. He said I'm really sorry, I honestly don't even think I realized how much we were texting—or no wait—or that was it. Well he was just saying I'm sorry, I don't want to make you uncomfortable about anything and so I'll be slowing it down to a halt. [00:02:49]</p>

<p>Now, I then said to him well if it makes me feel uncomfortable I should really be number 1 because he was saying he just doesn't want to hurt—just stop talking to her all the sudden. And I basically was like who gives a shit? I mean if I matter more—that's what he said. He said of course you're going to matter more than conversations and stuff. And I said if I matter more than like, there's really no need to be cordial or explain anything to her. I mean you don't have to reply to every message that she sends you unless she's having something—because he mentioned that she's in marketing and so he was trying to get some tips on marketing or something. I don't even know but she's going to help him get into something—whatever. So I said if that's the case then fine if it's about that but you don't feel the need—and then we kind of got into a discussion about him just not dropping it immediately because he is not a mean person and cares about other people and how they feel and he doesn't want her to feel like she did anything wrong and—I literally said something like who cares but okay because your [inaudible] of this whatever to whatever extent that you are. So I said I'll compromise on whatever I have to compromise on if it means that you slowing it down rather than just not talking to her any more. Okay fine. [00:04:06]</p>

<p>But so then he said that they finished up the conversation. He was oh I'm just out and about with my girl. We're hitting, whatever. Have a nice day; she said have a nice day. Then we go out later, well I babysat and then I met him up. He was meeting his friend at some club that they had been taking pictures at or something, I don't know, and I noticed that he was still texting with her and I said hey, what the hell? Really? Well because she was texting me that she was sick earlier so I just texted to see if she was feeling better, just out of courtesy. And I said you don't have to extend that courtesy to her. He said yes, but I'm not a mean person. And I said I know you're not a mean person. It's not not mean to leave it where it lays. If she's texting you about stuff complaining that she's sick that's her business. She should know that that's inappropriate anyway and there's no need for you to say hope you're feeling better. Please.</p>

<p>So then we got into a little argument about that and again I said okay, I'll just have to f***king compromise like that, you're just too nice—but I also told him, I said if somebody were talking to me and you said listen I'm really uncomfortable with you talking with this person, can you stop, I would stop immediately. And if they were super-insensitive and kept texting me why aren't you texting me any more I would say it makes my boyfriend a little bit uncomfortable, I don't really know you that well, he doesn't know you, so take care maybe I'll see you around. No big f***king deal, right? So then I pick Viv up on Monday and I got to check the phone records to see how much he had actually been texting with this girl. And this is something I used to do in the kind of somewhat beginning of a relationship I told you—checking records and calling to see who it was, all that stuff. I'm checking his Facebook, never had an e-mail password. And literally from June 20 through the 25, all day long conversations with this girl, back and forth, back and forth. And in the beginning, on the 20th when they first started talking she sent him three or four picture text messages. What are you sending him pictures of? Marketing ideas? Doubt it. So, and granted she was sending more texts, there was more received than sent, but still you're replying. Literally all day, all day, up until 8:00, 9:00 p.m. from the morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how many—that's a lot of messages. And how many messages is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot. I don't even know how many but five pages worth of clicking through pages of things. And hardly ever—and me interspersed, of course, and a couple other randoms. But so many messages. So I said to him listen Franklin (ph)... [00:06:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Twenty or thirty a day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, easily. Who even messages anybody that much? At all, ever? And I talked about it and asked him if it was about the attention and at first he said no, and then he said yes, maybe it is, or I don't know I just respond to people. And so I said to him one day listen I was looking through the phone bill because the charges were more than last month and so I just wanted to see what that was about. And who's this 603 number? Is that the girl Betty? And he said oh, I don't know. Let me check. I said okay. And then while he was checking I said because from the 20th to the 25th there's text messages between you and that number all day long. All day long, as much as we chat on G-chat at work all day long. And he said, oh wow, I guess I didn't even realize—I don't know—I'm really sorry. Of course I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable. I guess I —then he says well I told you that she's helping me with some marketing stuff. I said you don't need to have 50 text messages a day with her to talk about f***king marketing ideas, that's just bulls***t. I'm sorry. I didn't say that I was just kind of like looking like that's obviously not all you were talking about. [00:08:09]</p>

<p>And even if it is not flirtatious or I don't know what, sending him the picture messages, even if it's of her dog, who cares, right? And he apologized that he didn't realize that it was that much and I said if you're working with some of her marketing stuff, fine, but why don't you just e-mail her when you need to but you don't need to be texting her all the time, this doesn't need to be going on. And he said I agree, you're right, I'm really sorry, this and that. Of course I put my foot in my mouth because oh great, now who knows what going on via e-mail if he's not texting any more. So then of course I checked the phone records but he really hasn't. I think she sent a couple and then he sent one in reply. It really has slowed down. There's been a couple other numbers that there's been exchanges but I haven't really investigated because I just—I'm not going to do that. It's not as excessive as it was with that girl.</p>

<p>But it's just for me first of all he talks to me about how I just need to be—if there's no trust there's no relationship and so I need to just trust him and let stuff in the past go and this and that. But this has been a recurring theme throughout the entire f***king relationship, this texting girls. And I'm worried about it so much that I really can't see when he would've even gone out to sleep somebody or had coffee with somebody or kissed her, I don't care what. But it almost feels like more inappropriate or something. Not more but almost equally inappropriate. You're literally talking to this person all day. Girls don't—because she doesn't give a shit. She may not even know that we're still in a relationship. We don't have it listed on our thing, who knows? And yes, I want to trust you but I see all those messages, I see the picture messages, you tell me you're not talking to her that much then I find out you've been talking to her for frigging a week? What am I supposed to think? [00:10:02]</p>

<p>And then now—I'm thinking God, what the hell has been going on on Facebook or his Gmail, even, or G-chat. Oh my God do I even want to go there? And do I trust that now he's not really talking to her that much unless he wants to say something like hey, can you help me with this? Or are they e-mailing all the time? Did he say hey listen, can we chat on G-Chat instead, I went over my minutes or whatever bulls***t excuse he could come up with? And so what am I supposed to think? So he wants me to trust him. And he claims that because I cheated in the conflict that he should be the one that's more worried, but we never had a problem throughout our entire relationship, only with him texting inappropriately girls, even not inappropriately but just excessively and having inappropriate messaging relationships with females that he's not really friends with. And it's just making me feel nervous about if this is going to be something that's throughout our entire life and if I really can't trust him forever. </p>

<p>Then, on top of that, I still have issues. I really—I don't—okay, fine, he's slowed down the drinking stuff. But now it's—I feel like even if he's working on something, I find something else wrong with it, the way he's working on it. Then he wanted a glass of wine before bed last night and it was really f***king irritating because then it smelled like wine and I couldn't even be near him. And, okay, maybe you're only having one glass of wine but you're having it before bed. And I understand that he wants it to kind of make him sleep better or something but now I want to be like no don't drink before bed and it's just turning into a lot of stuff. Maybe there are people that don't—I feel like maybe people that weren't (ph) with it or with somebody else, maybe they wouldn't—maybe they would drink every night. Let's say they have a beer or glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail after work. But then maybe they're not drinking right before bed and so it's not as bothersome and it feels a little bit more like normal or something to me. Normal, like—I don't know. I don't know what normal drinking is ever because I'm just not from [inaudible] of normal drinking so I don't have any really good sense of it at all. So I'm trying to keep that in mind, but can I ask him now listen babe that really bothers me when you drink in bed? Or is he going to be oh, another thing? [00:12:28]</p>

<p>So there's that, there's the drunk issue. And then I'm also thinking all these other things are now coming back to my forefront. How—okay what else? Well the education thing and being worried about him just being behind me in life for the rest of our lives. And then, okay so he broke the mirror a while ago, fine, whatever, it happens, shit happens. He got a ticket because he made an illegal turn that he's done a few times before and I always tell him not too, because it's No Left Turn but between 4:00 and 6:00 and it's a shortcut from the highway to our house. And I said I don't care if nobody's around you don't—just don't do it, don't even do it at 5:59. So he got pulled over because they had a trap there, literally they trap specifically for that, for people taking it. And he's all up in arms about how that's bulls***t, how they can't trap people like that and I said yes, they can. If they know that that's a place where people take a turn illegally and they want to teach them not to do it, they have every right to trap people there. Yes, it's shitty and it's underhanded, but maybe somebody got into an accident and so the city told them you have to start being more vigilant, who knows? </p>

<p>So okay we paid the ticket. Then I get a letter that my insurance has gone up because he's on my insurance obviously because he drives my car. And so now I lost my safe driver discount and so now instead of $277 a month, we have renters and car combined, it's going to be $297 a month for the next seven years or some bulls***t. And then he says I'll pay for it. I said whatever, it's all the same money. He said well it's the bulls***t that they trap to put—I mean [inaudible at 00:14:06]—and he was just kind of being defensive about it, kind of being like high yield. And I didn't want to make him feel bad but at the same time, I'm really pissed about it, I'm pissed about it. You do stupid shit and talk about shit happens. I didn't know I was going to go off into that. Whatever it sucked. It just kind of made me think about God, he's so f***king lucky to have me. And I've done so much for him and I feel like I've—and I think just that kind of was the culmination of having some feelings of how much money has happened, has been whatever, because of this relationship and the car and then now this and it was just kind of... [00:14:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thinking how much it's cost you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, really. And that I don't—is he really nuts? Does he know what a good thing he has? Does he—I don't know and I want to think that he does because he's very sweet and loving and complimentary, especially after we had this big talk about things that I want to do and he hasn't been doing it and all that stuff. I mean even yesterday morning, we left a little late and he kind of blamed me. And I told him I'm not going to take the blame because you were ready literally a minute or two before I was. And he kind of wasn't backing down and I was like whatever. And he sent me a message after I had left, after he had dropped me off at the train, and said I'm really sorry for blaming you. I was upset about being late but it wasn't your fault so I shouldn't have done that. I'm really sorry. I hope your morning gets better. So I do know that he loves me and he does appreciate me and all of that. But I guess just the thing with the texting and then the insurance thing and thinking about God how much is this actually going to end up costing my whole life? Is he going to keep doing stupid bulls***t. God, really? And making me concerned about if—what I—the future of my relationship. </p>

<p>Again, I was feeling more confident about it after we talked about stuff that—the original, primary stuff that I was worried about in our relationship, like him blaming me on Friday and all that, I think that we got over a really big hump there in talking about it and did good work there and have been working on it ever since then. He's working on walking away when I'm frustrated and can't be consoled and all that, but I think then this trust issue is now kind of back in my life and I don't—it's just I'm concerned about kind of how to make a decision. My friends are—I was telling them what happened with the texting and whatever and that I was upset about it and they said you know obviously we would probably sit here and say oh my God, no way, unacceptable. But you're going to obviously not listen and trust your—the one thing is to try to trust your gut instinct. What is your gut telling you? [00:16:57]</p>

<p>My gut is telling me that he's not cheating on me but that he's lied to me about things, like little things that aren't so little when they're being lied about. And I said well so if I asked to see—if you're texting with somebody and I ask to see the message there should never be a reason why you can't show me them, even if you think it's stupid that I'm asking. And he said I agree, that's fine. Great but then he always ends up deleting all his messages, which he has done throughout our entire relationship. Some people are like this, they just don't want to have a thousand text messages so at the end of the day they'll just delete all their text messages. But, of course that's also unnerving. </p>

<p>And so that he thinks well we talked about this the other night and she doesn't like I'm texting her and okay I'll stop texting and blah, blah, blah. I have a feeling now he feels like it's all set, we got through it, we resolved it, I'll e-mail her when I need to and I don't want Trina to feel uncomfortable of anything that's going on. And of course he—in this whole time he did bring up how he feels like he can never text with any girls, with any girl it is whoever it is, even if they're a friend, I feel uncomfortable with. And I said well honestly, I mean I feel uncomfortable with you excessively texting with anybody that you're not going to hang out with. It's just kind of weird and pointless. I'm not really sure why you do it. I don't know. How do you even have that much to say to somebody, all day, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m? How do you have that much to say via text? [00:18:46]</p>

<p>And anyway so I think he thinks that this is all over but since it was all opened, I don't because now well I want to see what's on his Gmail and his Facebook. But I could look and then everything could be deleted and then I'd be thinking well what was there that maybe was deleted? And even if there isn't I don't want to live my life like this. I don't want to live my life not trusting him either validly or not validly and I don't know if it's valid that I'm feeling this distrust for him right now or not. And I don't want to continue my life—again, if I'm not trusting him and it's valid that I'm not trusting him that sucks for me or if I'm not trusting him and it's completely not valid and he's doing everything right, then it sucks for him. </p>

<p>So it's kind of weighing on me because I mean if he couldn't even stop texting her for a whole day after we had that conversation, he still is texting later, how am I supposed to believe that all the sudden he's just not contacting her at all just because I don't see the number on the phone. So where are you talking now? Yes, and I don't know what to think. And it's all so confusing because I don't think he's cheating on me so what is this about? Why have you been hiding these conversations from me throughout our entire relationship, whether it's one girl or the next or the next? Why is there—there's literally always been somebody and why are you... [00:20:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know—I didn't know that, that—I mean [inaudible] another person he was in touch with on Facebook that you didn't like, obviously this one. But this is something that's an ongoing thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well when we first went together he had been talking to some girl out West that was like a mutual friend of a mutual friend of his, or whatever, and a friend—anyway, and started messaging with her and late—there was a bunch of lies surrounding that that he never admitted to but that I found on Facebook. Like she was talking about coming to move out here with him and he was sending her love letters and poetry and stuff. And we started dating whatever in August and he kind of stopped the lovey-dovey stuff around then, but continued to talk to her. And even this past Fall or Spring, he left his phone at home and I picked it up because the alarm was going off or something and saw a message scroll across, apparently she was pregnant or something. He did tell me that she had messaged him and said she's pregnant and she sent him a message saying had my ultrasound. I'm going to be a hot soccer mom; it's a boy or whatever and I was asking that really doesn't seem like a message out of the blue that you haven't responded to her in months and she just out of—that sounds like an update, or whatever. And he assured me not and I've refrained from checking phone messages and stuff, like the phone records, because I just didn't want to go there. [00:22:13]</p>

<p>But so there's that, that he literally could not stop lying to me about. He would delete her number and then I'd find it in there under a nickname. Are you f***king kidding me? I couldn't stop. And then there was this other girl that he went to high school with. This may be the one that I told you that he ended up meeting back up with and when it ended and they were texting a lot and I found one message that was oh let's meet for coffee and he said okay. And then she said where do you want to meet? You're everything I would've wanted in a man or that I've been looking for in a man, or something like that. And he didn't respond to that one, there was no response, and I asked him about it and he said oh my God I'm so betrayed that you would check my phone, that you don't trust me, and oh I have to lose a friend. And I said this is not somebody who is just a friend if you've been talking to the point that she knows, feels the need to tell you that. </p>

<p>And so after that whatever I just let it lay and he stopped texting her as much. Then she sent him some junk message saying do you want to f***k me? And I made him reply, that was it. I said you f***king reply to her and you tell her it's so inappropriate, she knows you have a girlfriend and not talk to you that way ever, ever again. Then the next day I find him [inaudible] a background check. The next day I find a message oh I'm so sorry, I was so drunk last night, I'm really sorry for sending that. And he sent right back oh that's okay, I've been there, no problem. Really? It is a problem. That is a problem that you're talking to somebody who would, even drunk, feel that it's appropriate or that she can say that to you. Really? So there was that and then a couple times later I found some other messages from her, even though he told me he had stopped talking to her. But since those two girls, there's just been kind of every once in a while kind of just a random girl. I was like are you making plans with this person, what are you talking about, does she have any other girlfriend, all that stuff, which he would always tell me I'm making such a big deal out of it in not trusting him. He can't have any friends at all, he feels like he doesn't have any privacy and blah, blah, blah. [00:24:16]</p>

<p>And then it felt like we had kind of gotten over it but then again I haven't really been looking at his phone, paying attention to any of this stuff, looking at the phone records, nothing until now and yet again, there's something that I recalled. Then even in a conversation when I bring up the past and how he lied and what I found and stuff like that, even the girl he was dating right before we started dating that he claimed she was too much work for him, whatever, I found messages where she had even blocked him to the point that she blocked him, you're the love of my life, oh please, like even in August. And I said I thought you told me that you broke up with her. And I don't know, maybe...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, I'm confused. He wrote that stuff to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To some—yes, the girl that he used to date before me and I found it later. And I said, okay I didn't know you were so heartbroken over her, since you started dating me right after and you said how nice it is to be with somebody your own age and blah, blah, blah. But whenever I bring any of that up, what I saw and what happened with this other girl, and all this stuff, he claims that well there's no need for you to drag up the past. I said you always bring up the past. He said can we just move on? And I said well we can if that upstate thing doesn't happen again, which it seems like it is. And so, okay, how would anybody expect me to believe that this time it's not going to happen any more? There's not going to be any other conversations with females that are single that you're going on for days in a row and you're talking to them every single day all the time every hour. How can I—I just don't know how I can even expect myself to get over it. Especially because I felt like I did get over it. It felt like we were past it. And then the second I started paying attention again, it's right there in my face. How many other girls had these week-long little texting marathons with my boyfriend? [00:26:18]</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like—that's not what you do in my life, at least. I mean I have guy friends that I text with. But I won't text with them for hours. I have had conversations with my guy friends where they might have said something that was a little too close to the edge that could be inappropriate to me, and I told them no, not really, see you later, have a nice night, whatever, just because that's how I am. I don't feel comfortable with something, well [inaudible at 00:27:00] my boyfriend apparently because we're not cutting anything off here, I'm just trying to continue to talk to him about it and I don't know where it's getting me. Even the stuff about him costing me money essentially and sometimes acting stupid and drinking right before bed that bothers me, that stuff doesn't bother me as much as this stuff because that stuff is right there for me to see and I guess I have a little bit more control over it in the sense that I can talk to him about it and know the outcome because I can see it happen. But his private life in terms of his phone and his e-mail and his Facebook, I don't have any way of knowing if what he tells me about this solution that I proposed or whatever is happening. And it's super unnerving. And it's really disappointing as well. And I'm disappointed in him. [00:28:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me that you are startling to tell inside wanting to feel good about things of him and not—because I feel like there are problems, especially of the sort that you don't have much confidence you'll be able to resolve with him. And the other, I think you're kind of struggling pretty hard around taking it seriously. I think it sounds like you sort of let him talk you into not taking it seriously or you talked to your girlfriends about it and they have a very different take than you do and you don't really want to consider their take so much. And I think you also tend to worry about over-reacting and having confidence. You were having, try to have the confidence that your sort of perspective and reactions to this aren't easily resolved. [00:31:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean definitely the—yes, he does make, when I approach him about it, he makes me feel like this isn't as serious as you're making it; I'm just texting. And it puts me in a position where if I try to make him understand that it is serious because it matters to me and because I'm bothered by it, that regardless of what the world would think of how serious it should or shouldn't be, that he kind of—and I have a hard time doing that. I feel like kind of backing down and okay, okay, so it'll ground to a halt or whatever. But because I think that maybe, maybe—and this is speculation obviously—but maybe part of him feels like well it is in fact serious because am I cheating on you? No, so who cares? [00:32:15]</p>

<p>And while I see where he's coming from in terms of it shouldn't be a big deal if I'm talking, if I have friends that are girls that I talk to, because I'm not cheating on you so you wouldn't have any reason to trust them or whatever, me, with them, it's different—I don't know. And my friends are saying absolutely not. Ultimatum. And I said, well. And maybe that's because I've been freaking dealing with it for almost three years, the same recurring issue, which turns into my issue of trust and my issue of snooping, and so I stopped that. But now I don't feel confident that if I did snoop I wouldn't find anything or wouldn't worry about what I'm not finding that's in—it's just a very uncomfortable position to be in as somebody's girlfriend. And the fact that it's still bothering me after we talked it over is an issue in and of itself because I'm afraid of bringing it back up and him being like oh why are you dredging it back up, why are you dragging it through the mud, which I kind of think has to do with some things, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, all right. So maybe I'm sort of getting [inaudible at 00:33:49] a little bit. You seem kind of in denial about this. You have a conversation about not wanting him to be in touch with girls, it makes you uncomfortable, and then you buy into it for five days in a row and they exchange 50 text messages a day. And then you let him tell you that—then you talk about as your trust issue. That's not a trust issue; that's being betrayed. [00:34:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what essentially I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you become concerned that he'll be angry that you're dragging it, dragging out the past in some kind of way that's annoying when he's not been accountable in any way for what he did and the ways he betrayed your trust. And I believe that you have this reaction of feeling betrayed. But then I think you sort of let yourself be talked out of it because, for a few reasons but I think mostly, I don't think you can reconcile easily—I don't think you have a lot of confidence that he'll be able to do all this or really change. And I don't think you—I think you probably have serious doubts about marrying him if you thought this would never change. It's probably something you'll have to deal with after having kids and blah, blah, blah. And I think that's put you in a pretty tight spot. [00:36:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess I think that's probably—I think the way you're mostly responding to that is to be kind of worried and upset but sort of in denial about the seriousness of issue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, for sure, and I think that it also comes with 2-1/2 years of being convinced that it isn't a big issue, that I'm just not trusting and so there's nothing else to trust. So now I am kind of convinced of that. That's right, actually, no, I really haven't texted her in a few days, well, yes, he's probably right, it's just a fluke of five days of texting. And my friend Megan, who's been married now for six years and actually before they got married, I think maybe either when they were engaged or dating, he slept with another woman, and she made the decision to stay with him but kept talking about it for months and months and months. And so finally she said I have to make the decision to either not be with him any more or just if I'm taking him back not think about it any more. And she asked him to see his phone and if his Facebook is logged in she'll check it, but she was having him—well—yes, I mean, she was—I told her basically she's actually decided by, why aren't you engaged yet? </p>

<p>She hadn't known what was going on and I kind of assumed what's been going on more recently especially and I said if he did proposed to me right now I honestly I think that we are going through relationship growing pains and so I don't think he should rush to propose right now. But if he did I wouldn't say no and then she interjected and said you would just have one of those dreaded long engagements and then [inaudible at 00:38:04] get married after three years. She said but honestly if you're—you need to deal with these issues and these doubts you're having because I'm starting to feel we're not getting any younger, you're not getting any younger. You're beautiful, you're successful and he's really lucky to have you. Don't' waste another year of your life if this is something, if there are things that you don't think that you can deal with as a married couple with him. [00:38:31]</p>

<p>And it was good advice. I mean, taken with a grain of salt obviously coming from her own experiences. But it's—yes, I mean that's only if there is a sense of denial about the situation and the seriousness of it and how to proceed. So, I'm—yes, it's difficult. It is because somebody that's maybe they're dealing with trying to get their boyfriend to stop actually cheating on them if they found him cheating on her, whatever, and they might look at this and say wow. But that's—what is anybody really saying now? I mean I guess the bigger thing for me is how would I ever get stuck? I mean even if we did have something blow out where I was like this is so serious, you can't—this is horrible, I need all your passwords, whatever, how would I actually know whatever's stopping will I ever be able to feel confident that it stopped? Or will I still be thinking well I may check his Gmail but what is this secret e-mail that he probably set up to talk to her? I mean, do I want to be that kind of a wife? No. I don't want to deal with that as having a husband and thinking that either. So I just I don't have a—I mean last week I was complaining about not knowing how to approach the one night of texting, a discomfort, and this has now blown up in to not knowing how to handle him in general as my partner. [00:40:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you want to know. I don't think the problem here is that you—I think if you had a friend who came to you and told you the same story, you wouldn't be at a loss for what she should do. You might not know definitively what she should do but I think it would be a lot easier to think about the alternatives. I don't think you want to know because I mean you just told me this has been pretty continuous over three years. That's a pretty strong statement. You also said you—yes, that's a pretty strong statement and—yes, I think it's very hard to think about and very hard to confront him about and sort of stick to your guns about it in a way. You're not just complaining why don't you stick to your guns and keeping in mind what you actually know about what happened because it might be the end of things between you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And somehow even more definitively than talking about the stuff that we already talked about and blaming me for having a temper tantrum. Yes, for sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well this would be something you might decide to leave over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not just something he might be upset at you for bringing up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. And it's really scary to think about having to make that decision.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I'm sure it is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And feel confident about it. Then would there always be the question, what if nothing was going on? What if it would've stopped? What if I wouldn't do all the things—I mean, so it's a difficult thing courtship. [00:42:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I honestly felt like I wasn't worried about things any more or that I thought that he had stopped these stupid relationships with other women and to kind of find out that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there may have been an as but I think there's also probably some denial there. I mean that's what you really want to have happened, of course, but to the extent that you probably didn't want to acknowledge that he probably wouldn't stop like that. It's ongoing for three years. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Even if sporadically, over three years that's still too much. I mean for something that was brought up so early on in our relationship that I told him very strongly how I feel about and how uncomfortable it makes me and—what's the motivation to still do it? What's the motivation to stop? Why aren't they...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean he clearly has been dishonest about it. Oh, 603, I don't know if that's her number. I mean these text messages of today do you recognize [inaudible at 00:43:57]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, no, you're right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, oh man this is your problem and you're just dragging it up again after he agreed to stop and then didn't stop for five days...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no, the five days was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: After?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I found out that it had been five days when I approached him about the one night of it. But after I approached him about the one night, he still texted her later that night. And then after the saying well you have been texting her for five days even before I brought it up, then it kind of slowed down and he said he would stick to e-mail now but then of course it begs the question... [00:44:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's going on in e-mail, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. I'm around next week for this time but is that good for you [inaudible].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well actually I was just thinking actually I just have [inaudible at 00:44:51] that I drafted. I left my book at home. Friday, well, there's a couple Fridays that I have to change and one of them is next Friday. It's—well I have the day off because our Executive Director gave us one day a week off every week in July. But I'm taking that day off because it's a [inaudible at 00:45:13]. So I don't know if another day next week works even though it's a kind of funky week because of the holiday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, let me look. So there's Monday, Tuesday's not so good, Wednesday's the holiday...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and then Thursday. If you don't have anything, no pressure. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Friday, I have time early in the morning Friday but that doesn't help us, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What time? [00:46:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nine-thirty.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It might work. Can I e-mail you? Let me e-mail because I know we're all going to get our nails done together and then we have a rehearsal at 3:30. So can I e-mail you later this afternoon and I can give you the other Fridays that I may have to change.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Do you want me to assume one way or the other? Do you want me to put us in and if I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, why don't we do that just in case?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So assume that we're on...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...unless I hear otherwise?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And I'll shoot you an e-mail with more details, information about July because I have his phone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All righty. Thank you. Have a good weekend and a good Fourth of July.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you, you too. [00:47:09]</p>

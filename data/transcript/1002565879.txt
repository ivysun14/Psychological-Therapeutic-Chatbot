<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As a matter of fact, I read a book about this young girl that was in the same town that I was born in, the same city that I was born in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we had a beach and [INAUDIBLE] the ocean, there was a great big rock over here, so we called it egg rock.  So when she was writing her book she and her friends were swimming out to egg rock.  Well, she was kind of suicidal so she didn't care if she made it to the rock or not.  Anyway, it was a very, you know, very interesting book.  It was sad.  Very sad.  She was brilliant.  She had left [DEIDENTIFIED] and had gone to like New York and into that jungle.  But she was brilliant.  But anyway, in the end she dies, she kills herself and her mother finished the book for her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it was a little book.  Nice reading book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, how'd you come across that book?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do not know.  I don't know.  Have no idea.  I must have been somewhere and saw it and I don't even know what the name it was.  Um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How was your summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been in a rut for a couple of months and I don't know what it is.  I've tried to get out and I just want to crawl into the bed and put the sheets over my head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you doing that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am somewhat.  Um, I'm trying to mask it as I did in the past.  But I think it's going to catch up to me.  Um, I can't put my finger on it; cannot put my finger on it.  It's like I just find myself pushing myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  This is [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As I recall, uh, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  You think it has something to do with that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think.  Things like that can have an effect on us and we not even realize it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm having, um, I've been having aches all over my body and I'm going to call them phantom because if I go to the doctor there's nothing there.  And yet I'm going back to when I [INAUDIBLE], um, they're real, they're there, and yet, um, nobody can find them.  So I mean the pain sometimes will put me down like, um, I was [INAUDIBLE] analysis and I've determined it's not my kidneys.  And he said no, I think he said, I think it's muscular, so he says go on a heating pad and then ice it.  I did that, didn't do any good.  So and it stays around.  It's not something that comes and goes.  So that's, you know, it's not [INAUDIBLE] so much pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  The pain is new.  And then I'll have something like down here real low for a long time, and, um, my OB/GYN finally [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] retired and this new doctor is there.  And I said to him, I said, "Can you have like a first week of every month, I have really bad cramps [INAUDIBLE]?"  And he says, "No, because if you have cancer pain or an entity or [INAUDIBLE]" or whatever he says, "No, not if you've had a total hysterectomy."  I said, "Well, tell that to my body because, you know, I'm going through it."  Is there something in your brain that knows that you had it at one time and recollects it or anything?  I mean, it doesn't make good sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, there's other things in your belly besides.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, that's what he said.  He said like, you know, on your GI tract and all that stuff like that, but no it's not that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you always get that checked, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get your colonoscopy and?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].  And I just had that done not too long ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you get your blood work done pretty often too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, every 6 months.  So [INAUDIBLE], I mean what can I say, whoa.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, if it continues you want to keep going back to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  There are things that can happen that are a bit insidious obviously when you start.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So have you ever heard of anything like that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, when they do surgery also don't forget that things do cause scars and how does that affect other things that are in your colon for instance and the function.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is like female, not like stomach cramp, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not like GI cramps?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I mean, the other stuff, the [INAUDIBLE].  [NAME OTHER] has some, gave me some Vicodin and, um, last month I took about 2 of them to go to bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I felt so bad.  And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] used to have to give me Fiorinal for that time of the month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Did that alleviate it or does that just knock you out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it did most of the time but I couldn't ever take Fiorinal and then I was on the couch the rest of the day.  I thought okay [INAUDIBLE] took me to the hospital.  But I mean, I've always had that ever since, you know, I was young.  So it was, that was nothing new.  But it would usually go away [INAUDIBLE].  It's weird.  My body is weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've said that a few times over the years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  I know.  So I got into a slump about 2 weeks ago, I said, "I got to get out of here," and I called my middle son and I said meet me at the beach, we went down to the beach for 2 or 3 days, so, um, he met me there and but I came back and I was still yucky.  I don't know what it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I suggested something a few minutes ago and you just kind of blew past that one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, oh, oh, my mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, her.  The woman I spent so much time with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  How quickly you just put that one up, yeah.  Yeah, you think that could be it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It plays a role.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it plays a role.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something about that first year is the hardest.  It's the anniversary dates and things, it's the Mother's Day, it's the birthday, it's the getting together times, it's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And then so it'll start there and then just have an effect all the way down or all the way up?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're all different.  But those dates do stick in our brains.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That brain is a funny creature.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It really is.  It really is.  It, uh, I had a young boy that was [AGE] and his father had died 2 years ago, I think it was like [DATE] or something, and [DATE] he acts out and flips out and depressed and [INAUDIBLE] ends up in the hospital.  He's like he's clueless.  And I remind him and he goes, "Oh yeah."  Didn't think about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He doesn't want to go to the next day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does affect him.  And it's not conscious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just, you may find yourself having a bad day and then put it together and go, oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] long period of time.  And, uh, I had sinusitis and I was on penicillin since April.  And I had to go to the doctor 4 times, [INAUDIBLE] unreal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Frustrating?  Very frustrating for you, this is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And [INAUDIBLE] I can't go out on the farm, which makes me feel good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have to pull your light box out then, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I mean, nothing helps, I mean, everything else is wonderful.  I mean, you know, husband runs for [DEIDENTIFIED], the grandbabies, everything else is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Everybody's healthy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  They're really good.  They're really good.  My middle son brought his new girlfriend to the beach with him, her name's [NAME OTHER] and, um, I enjoyed that, she's really sweet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, really nice.  Little, um, little country girl from, uh, one of the little towns out of [DEIDENTIFIED].  So he always told me he wanted a little town girl.  He got her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even though she's a Yankee, huh?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where'd he meet her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I mean, I didn't get a chance to talk one on one with him, and he can be very elusive when he wants to be.  He's my quiet one.  I have to really pull stuff out of him, but, uh, I would probably say maybe like through a friend or downtown.  He lives right close to downtown [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So they just walk to all the places.  And she'd only been in [DEIDENTIFIED] for about a year, and so that will be my next question to him when I get a chance is where did you meet her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did he go to the beach with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He met me there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  And that's the best you can do, huh?  With [INAUDIBLE], huh?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was never left alone with him, so I mean she was just right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, she was there too, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So we went out to eat, um, I took them out to eat and just couldn't get him alone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The other two are okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well, [NAME OTHER] has the same problem that I do.  The other night he wanted to stay awake so he took his Provigil and, uh, his wife said to him, um, "[NAME OTHER] you okay?"  And he was snoring, you know, right through the Provigil.  So I said [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He pushes himself like you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But I will lay down and take a nap.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You didn't at his age though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did not when you were his age.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no, no.  No.  Yeah, I mean, sometimes I probably should not feel guilty about laying down and taking a nap for half an hour whatever.  And I've been doing that, um, hoping it would make me feel better.  And it does temporarily.  But I forget that I am getting older and to slow down.  My mom was the same way.  My mom was [AGE] and she was like the Energizer bunny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take her to [DEIDENTIFIED], gone.  I'm upstairs sleeping and she's downstairs, "Come play with me."  So, yeah.  But I'd much rather do that than sit in a rocking chair and watch the, I don't watch soaps but I read.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't [INAUDIBLE] things that I do do.  I enjoy going out in the sun.  Um, I enjoy walking my dog.  He walks me.  And, um, [NAME OTHER]'s been on vacation for a while and, um, [INAUDIBLE].  He's got a queen size bed downstairs, so I've been going downstairs sleeping on his bed with him.  He loves it.  I think 105 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I didn't know anybody was still working.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I didn't know he was still working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who's working?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your husband.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, he's not working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You said he's now on vacation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] with a friend, sending me all these beautiful, beautiful photographs.  I've been out there twice, and it's gorgeous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just not, it's just not a thing I enjoy doing, riding and riding.  I mean it's hot, very hot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  So what are your plans?  What do you got tap?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, going back to the beach in September and, um, then I'm going to go on vacation.  We haven't made up our mind where we're going.  [NAME OTHER] threw Africa out in the wash.  Um, haven't made up my mind where I want to go.  So my girlfriend [INAUDIBLE] Greece.  She says you've got to go, you've got to go.  She said it's gorgeous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On a cruise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, wait a minute, no, she wasn't on a cruise, she went her sister news company was there so they stayed on some little island—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where they had like a bed and breakfast—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then they took like a small, a little cruise out to [DEIDENTIFIED].  They went right to the bottom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the cruises to the islands out there are nice.  There are a number of people that have done that.  That way you don't have to worry about all the logistics, you know, getting around and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I love to go on cruises.  [NAME OTHER] won't go, so my girlfriend said she'd go with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To the Mediterranean, you know, and maybe [DEIDENTIFIED] or right there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, we can do that.  I wanted to go on that cruise to Alaska.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He has to do it his way, you know, up in the boat for one day and back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He doesn't like being pampered, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He does not like being confined is the word I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Confined.  Has he been on a boat like this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, we went on one and he [INAUDIBLE] must not have liked it although he didn't tell me at the time, but, um, but that was the time when you had to dress up to go to the dining room and you had to have, you had a certain time that you had to go and then you had certain people that sat at your table.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, oh, he said [INAUDIBLE] do this for.  He can be very, uh, vocal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's very independent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think probably some of the cruises are a bit different than that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think a lot of the cruises are much different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, now it's we'll do it your way, you know, with come whenever you want, sit at whatever table you want, eat whatever you want.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You think so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm glad you're making some plans or at least looking at some ideas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I looked into [INAUDIBLE].  I went to my son and, well, [INAUDIBLE] I went to go to bed that night and I didn't know I had my medication [INAUDIBLE] and I had looked in my bag and the little bag of pills in there, a bottle of pills and I had to get up the next morning, fly back home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you've done very well being compliant with your medicines all these years, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I can't function without my diabetes and medication and all that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, most people with bipolar, they tend to be much more noncompliant off their medicines and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh I wouldn't dare.  I know how bad I was.  I don't ever, ever, ever want to be in that situation again.  I mean, just shoot me and get it over with.  I mean, when my dogs get really bad I take them in and have them shot, yeah, I have them put to sleep.  And I always thought if I ever, ever got that bad I wish someone would do that to me.  You forget how you can get out of that blackhole when you're in it.  But if you're able to remember and realize that this too you can get out of here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, take that effort to call if you have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER] having mood swings too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but he's not too bad.  He really, he just, his problem is he just gets tired and he pushes [INAUDIBLE] really good with kids, has a lot of patience, and he and his wife [NAME OTHER] have a good solid marriage, as much as I can say, and so I don't know it's just, it's just a feeling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old are his now, his kids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[AGE] and [AGE].  [AGE] and [AGE].  [INAUDIBLE].  You had one in what, June, July?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, February and then [NAME OTHER] had twins 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What were the twins?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Boy and girl.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, isn't that perfect?  That's a handful.  Do twins run in the family?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just one of those things.  Yeah, it's fun.  Anything we need to do with your medications?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] lose it, what good is that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just got the Provigil I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm okay with that.  I'm okay with the Depakote.  Um, now my Xanax there's no refill.  I had a refill up to, um, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I forgot to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got 3 months on everything else I think.  So enough until January?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  On Imuran I don't, didn't I need?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh-uh.  Imuran, Cymbalta and Depakote should all expire in January.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  So Imuran's okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If they filled it properly.  I gave you 3 months with 4 refills at the end of January of this year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So the only thing that, I got Provigil's okay, Cymbalta's okay, Depakote's okay, so that means I only [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where is he right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He is coming back from Arkansas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He drove?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With his friend, huh?  A little bit of a drive but I guess it's part of the adventure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, he loves it, loves it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you going to do on the [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I'll probably go down to the, um, [DEIDENTIFIED].  I've not been there.  And [INAUDIBLE].  I haven't been there and I haven't even had the marker done.  Um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, is it done now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  It's on my to do list.  At least I brought flowers, and the flowers are right in the den where I have to eyeball them and, um, um, everyone has offered to go with me, you know, [INAUDIBLE].  And the inside when you walk through inside there it's absolutely gorgeous in there.  So that's where I'm going to go.  And when I go in there I like it in there, it's just peaceful and quiet.  The old stained glass there, it's nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that why you avoid it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, every time, my dad's in there, so, but, you know, if he, uh, at least I went and left the roses and, um, I'll take some roses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take somebody with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?  [NAME OTHER] will be back by then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He'll be back by the [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He'll be, wait let me see, where is he now, he called last night from Tennessee, so he'll be, I think he'll be in tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'll be good.  He's someone close, it's okay to cry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know, even though I try not to.  So you think that maybe that has a lot to do with my discombobulation?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it makes it worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?  Are you, okay, so you think that what I'm, the anniversary is going to make my illness worse?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  If we don't express things one way, we express them another way.  Headaches, stomachaches, tired, can't sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?  Wow.  Then I've done that, again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can see how you'd avoid it, it's painful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very painful.  It does get better after the first year.  Never gets—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Never gets good, but it gets better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, gosh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's the one that was born this year, bottom one there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This one here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, she's beautiful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, pretty, pretty, pretty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Got black hair and real blue eyes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] don't deserve, they deserve better, there's the boy.  That's [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're gorgeous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, gaining weight.  You take care.</p>

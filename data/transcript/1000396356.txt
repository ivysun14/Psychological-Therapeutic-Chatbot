<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (4-minute silence) I don't know, a number of things come to my mind, but some them I'd, I'm going through what I know I was going through last week, of thinking of them when I wasn't here.  But as soon as I get in here, I feel I don't want to think about them anymore.  And uhm, I mean, anything from yesterday, except th, the thing I can think about most.  And even that, I've thought about more or, or was more interested in thinking about it when I wasn't here, is my reaction to what you said at the end. </p>
 
<p>And now, when I think about what you've said, I just, I don't know, it seems very distant.  And, uh, y, yesterday I know I felt first of all, sort of, well I felt mad.  And I think my first reaction was that what you said wasn't true.  But then when I got home and realized I'd been feeling mad, because I didn't, I think I realized it by the time I left here, uhm, I was thinking, well I don't know why I'd feel mad, unless it was true, or some aspect of it was.  And I was trying to pretend it wasn't. </p>
 
<p>And I don't know, I don't, (Pause) I guess I can't admit it enough to see why I'd be doing it.  Or I don't know, th—, I, I just assumed there must have been something that I was accepting as true in what you said, because I had that reaction.  (Sigh, Silence) </p>
 
<p>Mm, s—, another thing that I thought I was thinking about more today, but I, I think maybe the reason that I'm now reacting, that I don't want to think about it, is because I really wasn't thinking about it before, and I could always play around with it and turn it off if I wanted.  Whereas, if I think of it here, then I'm sort of committed to it.  And uhm, well, last night MSCZ wanted to make love, or I don't know, first he put it, he wanted me to masturbate him, and uhm, I guess maybe I knew that perhaps, he was going to then ask for something more, I don't know.  But anyway, I was feeling very tired, and I know I wasn't really tired, I me—, I was feeling tired before he even said anything about this.  And then I felt (Chuckles) even more tired after all this.  So th—, I know it has to do with this. </p>
 
<p>But uhm, after a while, I was masturbating him, and then he said that he wanted to masturbate me, and I didn't want him to.  Because I, I just sort of, well I was willing to masturbate him, but I didn't want to be involved.  And it was as if I were going to follow orders that he gave me, as long as it didn't touch on me at all.  And he kept insisting that he was going to.  And I didn't want him to, and yet I'd, I don't know, he kept saying, "I can tell you want me to, even though you're saying you don't."  And I don't really know what my reaction was, because I didn't get really mad at him when he kept insisting, and I didn't just get up and leave, or anything like that.  So I, in the end, let him. </p>
 
<p>And, and then I went through a period of, I guess, probably thinking, well, I'm not going to let this affect me at all.  And I don't know, then I, it was as if, since, it was sort of, the fight was over when I let him, then I, then I sort of relaxed and enjoyed it.  (Pause)  But I didn't have any feeling afterwards of en—, having, uh, I don't know, peace, I guess, is about the only word I can think of.  Or, uhm, (Pause) or, or, I don't know, it d—, w—, uh, the phrase that comes to my mind is, that somehow it didn't have any connection with me.  But uhm, or, or, just my attitude was, as soon as it was over, I was going to forget it.  And (Sigh, Pause) —</p>

 
<p>Well I think, wh, what I'm comparing it to is, there was a time when it seemed as if I would feel closer to MSCZ and sort of peaceful and contented afterwards.  And uhm, (Pause) and it w—, it makes me think, I mean this time he was masturbating me when I had an orgasm, and, and the other time when I said it wasn't satisfactory for me — whenever it was, Saturday night — I had an orgasm, but it, i, it was almost as if soon as I started to, I made myself stop.  And again, I had the same reaction of uhm, whatever (Chuckles) the reaction is.  MSCZ thought that maybe I was feeling guilty, because he said I initiated it then.  Well, I don't know.  (Sniff) </p>
 
<p>It seems like I'm just trying to deny that whole aspect of being a female, and — (2-minute silence) Mm, 2 other things came to my mind.  One was that uhm, well first I guess, I thought of the fact that I've always had this fear of being raped.  And if I ever read anything about (Sigh) things that happen during any war, and I'm always fascinated and horrified by what happens to women.  And I don't know, just anytime where I can imagine the possibility of being raped, I seem to, and uhm, er, I seem to really have a fear of it. </p>
 
<p>And yet, then I was thinking that, like the situation like last night, in effect, it seems, almost that I, I was putting MSCZ in the position of, I mean, he didn't acutally rape me, but it was almost that, where he had to insist and be stronger than me, in some way.  And uh (Pause) I, I see it with MSCZ as, a way to avoid any responsibility for it, but, and then it isn't something I wanted, it was something I was forced into.  (Sniff, Pause) And, and so then I wonder well, if I'm always having this fear of being raped, am I going around always wanting to be? </p>
 
<p>And th, the other thing that I was just thinking of, that uhm, (Sigh) was i—, i—, I don't know, was on my mind yesterday, and has been this morning, too, is uhm — and I don't remember when it was — but, a few days ago I had some bleeding that I guess I just assumed was connected with, either the IUD or my uhm, cervix.  (Sniff) Except I don't know, and i, it wasn't very much, and it stopped.  But it scared me.  I mean, it always does.  And yet, I don't do anything about it.  Because when I used to, I was always told, well that's probably normal, and things like that. </p>
 
<p>And uhm, then yesterday I felt sort of crampy, and yet I didn't, I can't see why I would have.  And, so that was another thing that I immediately thought of, and why I didn't want to have intercourse with MSCZ last night.  And then this morning, I think I was assuming I'd have bleeding again.  I had a teeny bit of spotting, but I often do now, after we have intercourse.  And uhm, but I don't know, it was just very much on my mind.  And again thinking, having intercourse with MSCZ has done something to me, because in the end we did have intercourse.  And uhm, I know, just wondering about the IUD, and if everything's all right.  And I think maybe I was associating the cramps yesterday with thinking something's wrong with the IUD.  (Sniff, 5-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>Well I realize I wasn't thinking about it anymore, and uhm, first I was thinking, well I don't know what to think next, or where to go.  Or, uhm, and then it's almost as if I decided I'd thought all I wanted to think about it, because one of the first things I think I started to think of, off that topic, is uhm, I drove down here, because I had to pick up some pots we had fixed.  And uhm, a—, so I began thinking about how I'll go home, because I really hadn't worked it out.  And I don't know, then I started thinking about something that I'm in the middle of doing at home.  And it just seems like I'm almost ready to leave, because I'd thought all I thought I could about it.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: You have an recollection at all, of what your fantasies were at the time when you were masturbating him, and he you?  Do you remember what you were thinking about?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh, 3-minute silence) I don't know, I can't, uh, I keep thinking, well all I was thinking was, I wish it would hurry up and be over.  And I know that wasn't true when he was masturbating me.  But — (Pause) Well, I find it hard to think about, because there was some, another part that I haven't said, that — I suppose I haven't said it, because I just don't want to think about it — uhm, and I, I don't know, I was even mor—, thinking about last night, why does it bother me so much. </p>
 
<p>But uhm, first I was masturbating MSCZ with my hand, and then he wanted me to put his penis in my mouth, which I did do.  But I found it very, I mean, I, i—, he had to sort of insist that that's what he wanted.  And I, sometimes I'm more willing to do that, than others.  And last night, I didn't feel very willing to.  And I didn't really like doing it.  Except it seemed like when I was, uhm, I don't think I had the feeling that I wanted to bite his penis, as I sometimes do.  But uh, I don't know, it was as if I wanted to suck the whole thing in, or something. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, that's one way to get to him, isn't it?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) But th—, well I always resist his masturbating me, and, and he wanted to masturbate me with his tongue, which he refers to, I suppose, it's very common, everybody does, but as giving me a blow-job.  And uhm, I just was doubly upset at that.  And (Pause), and I don't know why, because th—, I, once I'd accepted he was doing it, and that I wasn't resisting, then I did enjoy it.  And I was thinking particularly of I think, having his tongue go into my vagina and liking that thought.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>But I, I don't know, it just seems like it's the, it's the thought of it, rather than the actual doing it, that bothers me.  Because uhm, both in doing it to MSCZ, or having MSCZ do it to me, it's I, I, I don't know, it seems somehow, the worse thing is to admit that I like doing it.  (Pause)  </p>
 
<p>Well it, it makes me think that it seems like somehow it's a more basic level of making love, or something.  I don't know, that I don't think necessarily it has to be more, a more passionate way, but that somehow, to be involved in that way is uhm, I don't know, you're just somehow, you're being freer with your feelings.  And it makes me also think that sometimes when we're making love, or it's a situation where MSCZ's wanted to, and then I'm going along just because I sort of feel I have to, or something, uhm, I don't like kissing him, or having him kiss me.  And that just seems like s—, a step before masturbating each other in the way we did last night.</p> 
 
<p>And uhm, I don't know, I've never understood that.  Because there are other times when I like kissing him and having him kiss me.  And, and there's nothing different about the way he does, it's just, sometimes I just, the thought of it is very repulsive to me.  Not just the thought of it, but the actual, having it happen.  (2-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>Well, I just thought of something that (Sniff) makes me understand a little more what I was doing yesterday.  But I still don't quite see why I would.  I—, i—, or seeing that probably I was, in effect, teasing you, as you pointed out.  Because just now, I was thinking well, this is the kind of thing that I guess, from what I was told, I w—, I always assumed you wanted to have me talk about.  And uhm, even if I didn't think it directly yesterday, it must have been, I must have somewhere, had it on my mind that you wanted me to, and I wasn't.  Except I'd start to, why I, I me—, even, I even knew I'd start to and think, well, I've been a good girl, and done what you wanted.  And then I'd go off it.  (Sniff, Pause) </p>
 
<p>I don't know, except today it seems somewhat different, because yesterday I think I really was feeling very much w—, I'd think of something, but I didn't feel any involvement.  And then I'd say it, because I knew you'd want me to.  And, and then I wouldn't continue on it.  But today, I feel more involved, except, every time I reach a point where I can't think, anymore — well in, I don't know if every time — but this time anyway, it seems like almost, I'm shifting responsibility, and it's not something, it was something I wanted to think about, except when I can't anymore, then I change it and make it something that I think you'd want me to think about. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: So, in a sense, kind of wanting me, or inviting me to force you. </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  (2-minute silence) Well, I me—, it's not surprising, I guess, but i—, I mean, that the thought of, the parallel between uhm, I mean, because really, that's what I was trying to get you to do, I think.  By then taking over and asking me something.  And uhm, immediately I thought of the way I made MSCZ force me to make love with him last night.  And, and just the way yesterday, wh, when you said I was teasing you, in effect.  I mean, I knew you meant to use the words that I'd used in connection with MSCZ and teasing him, but — and it does seem, I me—, I could — I guess yesterday I was refusing to see it.  And today, well I just feel mixed up again.  What am I actually doing?  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And, and just again, I think of the fantasies I have so often of being raped, and the fear of it.  And yet I'm, I don't know, I, I think if I keep going around fearing it, I must want it.  And uhm, and yet, on the other hand, when I can make love with MSCZ, and so forth, I refuse it, and I don't get involved in it, and I make it unpleasant, and I just deny this whole aspect of being a wife and being a woman.  And, and, yet then I'll go around thinking about being raped.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: By anybody in particular?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  Well, when all this, just now was occurring to me, right after you had used the word "force", it was you.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: And what did you imagine?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I think what I imagined then was, well what if you did try to force me and rape me, attack me, or something like that.  How would I react?  And uhm, (Sniff) I imagined fighting and being very frightened, and (Pause) I — </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Like all the times when you were a little girl, and you imagined a man coming the window and attacking you?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  Uhum. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

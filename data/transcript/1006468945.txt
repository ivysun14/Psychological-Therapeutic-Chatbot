<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I don’t think I got one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I’m going to ask you now, in person, because I know I’ll forget if I wait.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have a 30-something year old female who has had depression and anxiety basically her whole life. I think her major issue is self-esteem and she’s just looking for once a week therapy with a female therapist in Amherst. I have a lot of names but since you practice out of Amherst I was wondering if anyone came to mind for you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Do you have names?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you want me to tell you what I have? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: []. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I don’t know – I know []. She was a (unclear) peer. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what her insurance situation is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [] PPO. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’ll give you two names of people I really, well – I’ll give you – no shortage. []. Let me see if I can pull up her info. She’s really good. Have you ever been in that building? It’s like a million psychologists there. And her number is []. Let me give you one more. Can she drive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. She lives in Amherst. She says she’d like to ride her bike if possible. She lives in the Square.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And did I give you []? Have you heard of her? Yeah. She’s really good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Why do I know that name? Is she a [] person?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She is. Yep. I don’t know if she’s still there but she was there. I trained with her. No I didn’t train with her. What am I talking about? Okay, her number is – it looks like it’s [].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I can vouch for [], too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, back to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I passed my [test[. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea! Alright! Nice! Congratulations!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. I found out on Wednesday morning so it was – I didn’t have to wait that long at all. I got the e-mail and it was right before case conference so I was just looking at the e-mail and I was like should I just click on it? What if it’s not good news? The night before I’d had a nightmare that I failed. So it was like – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you know it was supposed to happen today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I knew five days after the first of the month it’s released. And then you wait a few days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I knew five days after the first of the month it’s released. And then you wait a few days. So I knew it was coming. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just not that soon. And so the number – and I knew what number to look for. So it was like – wow, it’s done. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Nice. Now you just do the jurisprudence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and just order the license once I pass the jurisprudence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can do the jurisprudence soon, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anytime. As soon as I can afford it, basically. Because that’s another $188, but still like for me – see I have – is it $21 - $21 in my bank account until the 16th. So. And then I realize that my credit card was almost maxed out even though I had requested more money than I did so I’ve just requested again a little bit more. I hope that part of it ends soon. This is all going to be like a nightmare and put it behind me and just start paying off some bills. My boss was like, “great, now you can open up a private practice if you need to – get some hours.” And I’m like, ‘yeah, well, what money? You know?’ I’ve got to wait a little bit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the people sublet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, for really cheap, I hear. So I’ll start thinking about that as soon as things set a little bit more because it’s like bill after bill, you know? And I heard that I have to renew even though everybody’s on the same cycle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So you have to pay – what is it? You have to pay now and then you have to pay in June again? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Something like that, yeah. Which is just ridiculous. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They don’t prorate it or anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, so – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, I had to do that too. And so your post doc hours start immediately after you defended, right? You don’t have to – </p>

<p>CLIENT: After internship they started. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you had already defended.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Everything was done. Right. So now I get to look over the post doc applications coming in for the interviews we’re going to have soon for post docs for next year and I get to be on that committee and it just feels so weird reading through letters of recommendation. Some of the letters are from Larry, who is a psychologist at Johns Hopkins who my friend just married, whom I’m friends with. Like it’s weird, like these people are my colleagues and I’m keeping an eye out for people I might want to supervise. It’s just – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible). [0:06:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And you know they’re explaining in their statements like, right now I’m doing internship and I want this as a post doc and I’m just thinking like wow, I did that already. It’s just really neat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re on the other side. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I never thought I’d get here. And it’s done and my mom was thrilled. She started crying. And Billy was all about business. But I expect Billy to be all about business. He was like, ‘well alright! So what was the score?’ And I was like, ‘that’s not going to mean anything to you.’ It reminded me of when I used to bring home a report card and he’s like, ‘well what’s the A minus in?’</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Give me the score.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then he was like, ‘alright, so what’s next? Can you open up a practice now?’ Like, let’s get down to it. And my dad called but shortly after like a few days after and he seemed really happy. But again, like remember when he offered to help me out financially? We’re still waiting or that to happen. Poor Dad. He sounds really stressed. He says he’s going through like some financial crisis and he doesn’t have a job yet. So I feel for him. It’s funny. When he called to congratulate me I didn’t bring up like, ‘wow, Dad, why didn’t you call me for Christmas or New Years?’ That just like completely didn’t register. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It didn’t register. Yeah, that is – </p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s kind of like well, like I’m pretty much back to the way things were with him which is kind of disappointing to me, but it doesn’t surprise me because he always like any time he hurts me so bad it’s just like I can get over it quickly and go back to the way things were. My friend Carly tries to make me feel better. And she’s like, ‘well it’s not exactly like the way things were because you’re going forward with some new insight, like you’re looking at it differently, you’re recognizing that you’re acting this way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but it’s an important kind of observation, I think, about that it will not register for you. It’s not like it’s something that you’re actively trying to kind of push down or something. It just isn’t there. There’s not like a repression. You know. It’s just really, it’s small D – like everyday dissociation. It’s dissociation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like I don’t know how I was reflecting on my last session here and how I was in so much pain reading that letter I wrote on Christmas and remembering, really sitting with the feeling that I was feeling when he just abandoned me and I could just walk out of here and be, ‘alright, that’s fine.’ It doesn’t stick. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And he disappointed me again recently and so I’ll catch you up. So it was a big celebration kind of weekend because of the N Triple P that Wednesday. I went out karaoke singing with my friends and these are this group of lawyers like my friend Emma and she has good friends, two other lawyers, one of them was pregnant so she was up there singing and doing a dance with her belly. It was hilarious. And it was a fun place and I got reminded of why I don’t go out on weekdays anymore because I was like falling asleep on the subway on the way back home. I suffered the next day at work. I’m just like too old for that. And then Friday I had a date and Saturday I had a birthday party with friends because I’m back on websites because after the Christmas thing happened – I told you. I’m back on it and I saw him on it and he kept denying like no I’m not on it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Looking for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was looking for you, yeah. So I went on a date on Friday with a professor, Ph.D., has written six books. I Googled him. European He came here like five years ago. He teaches at Brown. Very smart. We had a lot of e-mail back and forth like from New Year’s on I think. And he seemed very nice and you know, it’s different from when I used to talk with guys online because I’m behaving. Like I’m not using any kind of inappropriate humor. I’m not being too flirty. Like I’m looking for something serious. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Unclear) what you did before. [0:11:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I went out with him. I’d kind of given up on the whole package. Like I think before I was very much going for looks. I was trying to prove something to myself. Especially right after the breakup like, ‘oh wow, look. I used to be with this really unattractive guy, but look, I can get better looking guys if I want to.’ Because I never hadn’t. I’d always been with Kevin. But now, this guy wasn’t bad looking at all. It wasn’t like the ideal. You know? So, we met up. He was very funny. He started off the conversation. He asked me like, ‘so, you teach at BC.’ And I was like, ‘no, no. I work at the counseling center. I have a psy D (sp?). He was like, ‘oh, I haven’t heard of a psy D.’ And then I explained and he’s like, ‘oh, so you’re telling me is what I have is better than what you have.’ As a joke. So that’s kind of how the night started and very nice and a lot of conversation just about our passions relating to like career and our families and there was nothing inappropriate or anything, which before like on dates conversations quickly went to stuff like that. It didn’t with him. And then he kissed me at the end of the night and then he walked me towards the subway and then he started kind of feeling me up which I thought was a little inappropriate. I even joked and I’m like, ‘you’re like totally feeling me up right in the middle of the street right now.’ And he said something like, ‘oh, well you know I have some whiskey at home and I live right around the corner,’ which kind of offended me like why would you invite me to a bar right around the corner from your house? Is that just in case we wanted to go back to your house? Like wouldn’t it have been more polite to ask? So where do you live? Maybe we can meet halfway somewhere. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. So he didn’t, he was like, ‘let’s go over to my neighborhood.’ </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, we were in his neighborhood. But I didn’t realize that. So we met in a bar that it turns out was right around the corner from his place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he know where you live?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I had told him that I had just moved to Falmouth. Yeah. And I knew he lived in Boston, but that could be anywhere. And he said something like, ‘oh I have whiskey. We can go and take some shots.’ And you know like, ‘if you end up just wanting to stay the night you can stay the night.’ And I ended up in my head just like getting totally offended like, ‘wow, this could turn out to just be a one night stand and you totally did not give me the impression that that’s what you were looking for.’ We even joked – well, I joked in the middle of getting to know each other, I told him how I used to not be looking for anything serious, now I am and I’m not interested in one night stands or things like that. And he even made a joke. He was like, ‘oh, then I’ve got to stop wasting my time. I thought that was what this was.’ And told me like, ‘no, I’ve been in two relationships very long term and I usually like look for something serious.’ So that kind of disappointed me. I didn’t go home with him. I went home. [0:14:35]</p>

<p>Had a good Saturday. Saturday night I was invited to a birthday party out at some bar. So Brian has not seen me since I moved, right? And since he took me to work that day my car was not working. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is a long way back in what, mid-December?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I moved to the new place the second week of December, something like that, and – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you haven’t seen each other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, except when my car wouldn’t start and I asked him to take me to work and he picked me up and he took me to work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that was – when was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a week ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that was just a ride to work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I haven’t hung out with him at all. And Friday morning I’m at work and I get a text and he was like, ‘so, what are you doing tonight?’ And I know any time he asked me that it’s because he wants to hang out. And I’m thinking to myself, ‘wow, on the one night that I’m busy.’ So I texted him back. I’m busy. Why?’ And then he got all aggressive with me like, ‘oh, never mind. No sense in telling you since it seems you have plans.’ And I’m like, ‘Brian, are you serious? Like you wanted to see me tonight?’ And he’s like, ‘yeah. I’ve got work tonight but I wanted to go see you from like – I was going to go right after work until I had to leave at 10.’ My date was at 9. And I was like, well I have plans. I didn’t tell him because like that was going to start a fight. I didn’t tell me what it was but I got really pissed, like what does this guy expect me to just sit at home and suddenly, surprise, like there’s no rhythm or reason, you know, it’s not like every Saturday we hang out or every Friday we hang out. </p>

<p>So I ended up having to be the adult in that situation and I think I did that by negotiating, by saying, ‘okay, well tonight doesn’t work out, how’s your day looking for tomorrow?’ I was even willing to compromise. Do you want me to leave a little later to go with my friends? Do you want me to call them and say, ‘I can’t?’ Like I was even considering cancelling but I didn’t do that. I didn’t think it was fair to me. So he said that the next day, Saturday, he could see me and he could spend the night. And so I got all excited, but then I’m like, wait a minute. I have a birthday party. And I’d told him about it like for the past two weeks. And I said, when are you free? And he said, basically 7 pm Saturday until 7 am Sunday. So I said, awesome. The birthday party’s at 9. Why don’t we go, meet at the place. We can have dinner together before people arrive and then as people come in I can say hi to them, make an appearance and then we can take the rest of the night to talk because I’d been wanting to actually be with him and talk to him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you said the party was going to be, you guys were going to hang out at the party? </p>

<p>CLIENT: For a little bit. Yeah. But I mean I don’t even have fun at those things. Like at the most I’ll be like two hours. Like once it gets loud and stuff and you know I had drank like three beers the night before. I wasn’t planning on doing a heavy night of drinking. I would have been fine with half the night there, half the night for him, because I miss him. So that was a compromise I made. And he was quiet and then I said to him, please – it will be like a real date night. I’d really, really like that. Please can we do that? And he was like, ‘okay.’ And I was like – smiley face, smiley face. Exclamation mark! Thank you so much! And going into Saturday I ran errands, did my day, was exercising and then suddenly I got a text. [0:18:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is on Saturday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Saturday around 5. And he says, ‘baby, I have to ask you a question.’ And I knew what was coming. And I wasn’t that disappointed. I noticed, like wow, I’m not even disappointed. In fact it might even be better because I might feel more comfortable around my friends if he’s not around, in case I have to entertain him more, make sure he’s feeling comfortable. So he’s like, ‘my martial arts teacher asked me to teach a class on Sunday so that means I have to teach the class at 3 and then go to work at 10 which means I won’t have as much time tomorrow, Sunday, to write my paper. Can I use some hours tonight to write my paper and then I’ll come see you after your party? And I said, ‘of course.’ But I’m thinking, this is his way of getting out of socializing or being out in the world with me. You know? That’s what I’ve been complaining to my friend, Carly, about. I’ve been saying, I want someone that I can have a relationship with. Meaning – be out in the world with. I don’t want to just meet in my bedroom, have sex, cuddle, and that’s it. Like I want to go out. I want to introduce you to people. I want to do stuff? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does he know about what your friends know about him? </p>

<p>CLIENT: He just knows that I’ve told them that he’s really busy. That’s he’s a nurse and works night shifts and is in school and has a son. And he’s divorced. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he knows that he doesn’t think that you’ve led on anybody about him. I was imagining you’d feel very uncomfortable around your friends. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s the reason I’m not doing it. Just in case he ever comes around. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you feel like you feel for him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like he’s marked, like ‘oh, it’s that guy that cheated on his wife. =‘</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, that’s probably like one thing he’s thinking. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they don’t know. All they know is he’s really busy and it makes me sad sometimes that he can’t come out more. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it also makes me think a little bit about it confronts him that as you were sort of saying like he can kind of have the fantasy or something that it’s just the two of you and it’s not really – </p>

<p>CLIENT: The real world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s not with the real world, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I wasn’t that disappointed because I’m used to it and I got dressed up and – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But in some way you felt like it was okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, maybe in a way, too, it doesn’t just do it to him, it does it to the both of you. It’s like the relationship – how does it function in the world?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We don’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I lot of mixed feelings. A lot of stirring up of stuff. If you guys were to go out together and like present as a couple.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In a way, too, it kind of relieves some of the tension I might have had about, oh crap, I just went out on a date on Friday.’ Like in my mind I’m saying to myself, ‘this is why you went out on a date on Friday. Because he’s not giving you what you need.’ </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. And then for him to come it would have been like you would have felt – </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I would have felt a little bit bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It would have really surprised me if he would have come at dinner, like mingling with friends. Out in public with a crowd, like and then go home? Like wow, that would have been a date. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But yeah, I think it’s also, I think’s it is something also like as you were saying about him socializing. Where you said socializing – did you mean with your friends or with you – or both? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I see, yeah. It’s not just about meeting your friends. It’s also about being in public with you or being on a date sort of thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like we went to the lounge so they have like 80s night and 90s night sometimes and this girl was turning 40 and she wanted to go there for 80s night and so you know, there was like fun music. It’s like a fun atmosphere. So I can’t picture sitting across the table from Brian with like fun music playing, me maybe having a drink.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. He doesn’t drink? Is that right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. Very rarely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it feel like to think about –? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uncomfortable. Like I’m there with my dad or something. Like because he’s all serious. Remember how I told you about like I don’t really like the way he dresses and – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I knew that part. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think it goes beyond that. Like he just seems uncomfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think seeing him kind of uncomfortable or just like uptight or quiet, because that’s how he was the one time I took him to a bar where a band was playing and I saw him get a beer, but my friends couldn’t really talk because the music was so loud. I think if I see him uncomfortable then I get really stiff and uncomfortable. This happened with Kevin all the time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I ended up going to this lounge. All my friends were there. And a lot of my friends have boyfriends and there was this one. He’s like in his 40s. He’s been going out with this girl for a long time. And he’s just so social. Like he’s like dancing around and they’re looking at the football game and buying her drinks and then like mingling over here and offering to take pictures. That’s more of like my personality. Like why do I have to be with these stiff guys all the time that are socially retarded? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. No, right, right. Then it kind of inhibits you in some way to have them be there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I get stiff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s not how my friends know me. So I went and it was great because a lot of people had passed the test and like my friend offered to buy me a drink and I was like, ‘great – I don’t have to spend any money.’ And there was good music playing. We took some pictures and then they started playing Michael Jackson 80s. And like people are starting to get up and dance and they were starting to do things like Thriller and then I get a text from Brian like, ‘alright – out of the shower. Heading to your place now.’ [0:24:51]</p>

<p>And I’m like, I just got here like a half an hour ago. Do you want to pick me up or do you want me to take the subway?’ I can pick you up. Where are you? And I was like, when you get here why don’t you look for parking? Like it’s casual, come in for a little bit, free parking. And when I get a text when he finally gets there he’s like there’s no parking, I’m outside. And I knew that would happen. So I go from this vibe of people just like being happy and asking what’s going on and telling funny dating stories and dancing to Thriller to outside he’s listening to NPR in his car. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about that? Yeah. And what a different way of kind of – the contrast between the two situations, but also like the contrast between the way these people know you and you know yourself and with being with him. You know? Not just the way he sees you but also how you experience yourself and see yourself, too. It is really to – </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don’t want that. Like that’s what I used to have to do with Kevin because of the whole hiding thing? Like my parents can’t find out. Let’s hide our relationship. And I feel in a way that’s what I’m doing with him and I keep doing that to myself and I don’t know why. And then he was mostly quiet on the ride home. He doesn’t engage like asking me like asking like, ‘oh, so whose birthday was it?’ Or, ‘was it fun in there? Who was there?’ Like he’s – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is he like? </p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s quiet and serious. Like, ‘Hi. How are you?’ </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Unclear) and serious. Not like going into that world. You guys don’t go into that other side.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And we get to my house and he kind of goes directly into the bathroom, pees, and then goes directly into the bedroom. And I’m like, don’t you want to see my apartment? Like the last time he saw it there were boxes everywhere and I want to show him how I arranged stuff. And he was like, ‘oh, yeah, yeah.’ And I turned on the lights and I showed him and then laid down on the bed and put on my PJs and like I cuddled with him because I wanted to hug him because I hadn’t hugged him in forever, it felt like. And there was just not a lot of conversation. There’s so much that could have been said. There are so many things I wanted to ask him. In fact, the night before when I came home from my date he had texted me when I was on the subway going back home – he was at work. And he had texted me. He thought I was out with girlfriends and he said, ‘are you having fun?’ And it’s weird. He must have suspected I was on a date because he never texts me when I’m out. And I said, ‘yeah, heading home now.’ And then since I had had like three beers, instead of getting angry with him, I tend to get very like cutesy with him and I started writing him something about like I want you to make me a wife and I want to give Logan more playmates – like something like that. Something just very sincere and he wrote back like, ‘aww’. And I wrote back, ‘what do you mean “aww”? Like are you belittling me? What does that mean? He was like – no. That’s endearing. Kind of like, aw, there there. That’s cute.’ That’s what it feels like every time I say anything like that. And so I was hoping I guess Saturday night – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He’s also not saying, ‘I want that too,’ it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Who knows what he wants?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You don’t know (unclear).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like when we’re laying there I want to ask him, so how’s it going at home? How’s your relationship with your wife? Does she know anything about us yet? Are you ever planning to leave her? Remember when you said like your life will be different once you’re done with school? What do you picture that being like? Do you ever think about us and our future? Or why are you on the dating site again, and have you noticed I’m on it again? Do you want to talk about what that is? There’s so much I wanted to say and like – silence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And for the first time like I think I’m growing kind of disenchanted with his approach to sex. Like it was more rough than other times and although I do enjoy that I caught myself in the middle of it thinking like why can’t it ever just be sweet or why can’t I get more of that? Because there are moments that I beg him because I’m in pain. It hurts. And I beg him to like slow down and he does. But it’s very brief. It’s like few and far between, just like every time he disappoints me and actually does stuff like – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Not a tenderness to it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not enough. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not enough. But there are sometimes there will be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, but not enough. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don’t know, I was just like in my head I found myself not so in the moment this time as I normally am and I found myself just kind of thinking like is this worth it. Like, yeah, this feels good and this is fun, but then you have Brian who doesn’t talk about anything. I don’t know where this is going. He can’t be a part of my world and my social circles. Like I’m weighing those two things and – [0:30:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what? I just want to say it because it’s sometimes in my mind about it – that it would be worth thinking about. I was thinking that Brian has kind of really awoken a part of a side of yourself that you can kind of contact within the sexual realm, you know? It is something about something really personal and important to you. And one way that I think about hi and how he fits into your life is almost analogous to how that side of you fits into your whole life. I don’t mean to get too heavy about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I keep it in secret? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it’s like it has its own – it can exist – almost like it exists in this kind of very protected arena and it’s not yet – it’s also like it’s not yet ready. It’s not ready to be a part of the rest of you yet. It’s like you want it to be – you know it’s like you’re sort of saying, ‘you know, I want Brian to kind of come into the light, and you also don’t want to lose it because it’s woken something inside you that’s very important and personal. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But it’s not completely integrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it’s also not something that – it’s like a part of you that you don’t know what to do with yet. I was thinking about how it’s harder to go there in yourself with these kind of more straight men.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean like how I’m avoiding innuendoes and like I’m trying to behave?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking about it more along the lines of like the men being too stiff and then it being back in front of you with a problem which is ‘how can I get into that side of myself with these stiff men?’ </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like when I said the word, “vanilla”. Like they’re too nice or – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Too nice. Yeah. Vanilla. Too milk toast. Like in some way, I don’t know that I could bring that within the rest of me. How does that fit in – not just with men, with kind of different men but like how does that fit in with the other person you are too? The one, you know? All these other sides. It’s like a very important thing that’s been awoken, you know? It’s an area within yourself that you’re still negotiating with yourself how much – and also you don’t want to let it go. And I think that’s a side of why Brian is also very important to you. Because he does get into something deeply personal and important about how you feel. What makes you feel really alive and in contact with something about yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was remembering Saturday night today and I was like I just loved being so close to him. Because like I’d never, in any sexual interaction with anyone, I’ve never felt that close to anyone. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes! Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah. So that part. That’s you, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I’ve never been able to like lose myself in someone else like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I think what you’ve also been – and something that’s been happening has been, you’re really trying to go – well how does that world fit into the rest of my world? And even you talk about – wait – maybe I want that to be more? Well, you’ve always wanted to but it’s really confronting you more and more, this kind of dilemma of I want that, I’m trying to have – how does that become part of who you are more? How do you kind of invite that into the rest of your life? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I’d like to know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like almost played out in the exact – I wanted you to come into the dance party. I wanted you to – but you had to stay outside. And stay in the car and had to be really serious. How does that fit in with the other Melanie the people know? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He said something on Saturday night. He was asking me, you know, as he usually does in the middle of sex, like, if I’ve behaved while he’s been away, ‘because,’ he’s like, ‘there’s no one supervising you now. You’re living alone. Have you had anyone over?’ And I kept saying, ‘no.’ and he didn’t believe me. But then he said, ‘I don’t care who you sleep with. You can sleep with as many people as you want because I know that I own a part of you that no one else has access to.’ </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he’s right. I mean at least for now. He’s the only one I’ve been able to share that with. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And like afterwards, he just wanted to go to sleep and then he woke up. He’s used to waking up at like 5:30 in the morning, so he woke up at 5:30 and that kind of woke me up and we were cuddling and he started looking online on his phone for restaurants that were open that early and I was like, ‘oh, you’re hungry.’ He said, ‘yeah, I actually forgot to eat dinner. I’m kind of hungry.’ And I was like, ‘well, if nothing’s open I have eggs. Like I can make you eggs.’ I made him like eggs with feta before and he likes it. And it was amazing to see how difficult it was for this man to ask me for something. He wouldn’t. Like I was like, I’ll stand up like I’m wide awake. It would make me happy to make you eggs.’ And he was like, ‘no, baby. It’s okay. Maybe I’ll grab something when I leave here.’ And I just stood up and went to go make him eggs and brought him eggs in bed. And he kind of, like again in a childish kind of way was like, ‘oh, you know it’s hard for me to ask for things. I don’t want to ask you for anything.’ And I was like, ‘no, baby, this is how it works. I ask you for things all the time. And you need to be able to ask me too, and it makes me happy when I can make you happy.’ And kind of in a teasing way he was like, ‘you’re so healthy.’ Like ‘you want such healthy communication.’ </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And communication too between different sides of the relationship – different facets to it. Communication between them as opposed to them being very compartmentalized – split. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s very split. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think that’s what he’s confronted with. Similar things I think, about I can go there sexually and go and get in contact with an important part of me but I don’t know how to put that with the rest of my life. [0:37:3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. The previous night – Saturday night before we became intimate I felt comfortable enough to just ask. I was like, ‘tell me the truth. Why are you on the website again?’ He’s like, I’m not on the website. I told you, I went on it to look for you. And I was like, but I’ve been on it a few times this week and I’ve noticed that you were on it. So, seriously, I said like, ‘I’m not going to get mad. I’m not going to leave you. I just – I want to understand. Is it because you like the attention? Are you just flirting and that gets you off a little? Or do you like the attention? Tell me. And he acted like a deer in the headlights. He was like, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m not on it.’ And I was like, ‘Brian, sometimes I see the chat thing on,’ because there’s an option to chat and you can see when it’s on and you can see when it’s off. And I was like, ‘sometimes I go on it at 6 o’clock at night and chat’s on. I go on at 10 o’clock at night, you’re not on. I go again at 11, you are on. Like, explain that.’ He’s like – ‘oh, at home I have all these different things I open – Mozilla, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome and it must be attached to one of those. So when I open those programs everything gets opened up.’ And I said something like, ‘are you afraid that she’s going to find that?’ Like it’s sitting on her computer. And he’s like, ‘no, no, it’s password protected by screen. Anytime I walk away from it.’ And I was like, ‘are you sure you don’t want to tell me any other reasons why?’ He’s like, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m not on it.’ And I didn’t believe him and I just thought it was so sad. I really don’t believe him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean it seems like if you were really trying to open up that space for him to try and communicate whatever’s on that side. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m not going to judge it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he wasn’t able to share with me and that really disappointed me. And what also surprised me was he didn’t ask me, ‘so why are you on it?’ Or, ‘why do you keep getting on it?’ I talked to my friend Carly about this and she was like, ‘I don’t think he wants to know.’ It’s just like asking you for eggs and you say no. Like what if he asks you like why are you on it? I think he knows why I’m on it. I’m basically looking for someone like him that I can be out in the world with. (Pause) The other thing – my friend Carly had a similar situation once where her boyfriend accused her of being on G-Date or something and her therapist told her something about how when your partner is uncomfortable about something like maybe an app that keeps opening up – a dating app or something and you don’t mean for it to open, a partner who is not hiding anything and wants their partner to be anxiety-free will like go and remove that app. Like oh, it keeps popping up? Let me get rid of my account or let me delete it, or. And he didn’t even think to do that. So. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Like he didn’t – he’s not – he never closes whatever the - </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And like he texts me in the morning and he’s been texting me all afternoon like just sweet things. I don’t know what we are. It’s just so confusing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I’m talking now. So I’m talking now – like there was a special like $20 for a month on E-Harmony. And did I tell you I have a friend who just got engaged.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She met someone on there and so – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, they’d known each other briefly, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a month. But I kept hearing how – it’s not like I want to get engaged in a month, but I kept hearing how there’s a lot of questions and it matches you up according to like values and I was like ‘oh, maybe I have a better chance of connecting with someone like on intellectual, emotional levels who wants the same thing if I get on one of these sites. So I got paired up with a psychologist. He’s a child psychologist. He studied at MSPP and we’ve been e-mailing back and forth. My friend Carly, my friend Maura and my friend, Tiffany, know him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So they can vouch for him and I just – he asked me for my number so he asked me if it was okay to call this week. Which was very nice. Like taking the steps slowly. So I’m excited about that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did they say about that guy? What did they have to say about him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just talked to Carly about him. She said, ‘very solid guy, very smart.’ They didn’t hang out in the same social circles but they have similar classes together. He’s a psy (unclear). He does child and family work. He always had a best friend in the program, a female, who was actually married with a kid and Carly was friends with that girl and that girl used to tell her like, ‘man, if I was single I would start dating this guy. He’s a good guy.’ He looks kind of nerdy, yet kind of attractive. And he looks very sweet. So. Again, like not the typical look I would go for before. He looks vanilla. [0:43:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Okay. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of what this guy on Friday looked. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He looked more vanilla then the professor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I’m going with that in my mind. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of looking for vanilla?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Like that I tend to ex out these vanilla guys.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah! Uh huh, uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that’s not whom I – I don’t know them. Like they could have a wild side – like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s interesting. Like what do you end up looking – I mean are you talking about the pictures, the profile, or the –? </p>

<p>CLIENT: You can just look at a guy’s profile and think he’s a douche. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I’m thinking about this lawyer guy, the one that I found out was an alcoholic and had a cocaine problem. So attractive. And you can tell by looking at his profile he can sleep with whoever he wants to. He’s like in a suit and just very good looking. And I think he has a picture of himself with a bunch of girls and one of him. He might even have one with his shirt off, like he doesn’t write too much in the profile. Like he’s not even interested you know, about disclosing too much about himself, or putting too much effort in. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn’t need to. He’s very good looking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But maybe that sets up a kind of – I was thinking that in some ways a man like that might not ask a lot of questions or would want to go some places with you, with somebody else while he was looking for – he’s going someplace without asking a lot of questions. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I keep worrying that if I don’t let go of Brian I’ll never be able to open up myself to anyone and I’m also scared that what if you know, I do hit it off with someone, it would hurt me if I was with someone who was still emotionally attached to someone else. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you mean to the other person?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. I’m kind of stuck. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it is interesting though. You’re exploring this other – </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I feel like this is the first time I’m going for a different type of guy. And my standards are high like before I – it always sounds shallow to me when I say this, but like I want to end up with someone who has a graduate degree of some sort. I worked really hard and I value that and so I’m trying to look at that. Before it’s like I would go out with guys that would maybe did college, got a college degree and were doing something totally not related, weren’t passionate about their career. Someone who gets along with their family, who values relationships with self-aware – like I’m looking for different things now. So I feel like a difference now in dating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Do you have another date with the Professor?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not yet. I’m not getting too invested because he – the only thing I didn’t like is he said Wednesday he has a job interview and Friday a job interview somewhere else in the middle of the country because he wants to become a professor and right now he’s a glorified post-doc, almost professor. And so he’s hoping these two universities will offer him a deal and then bring it back to the dean of his school and then say, look – I got these offers to make me a professor.’ And I asked him, ‘well, what if they say no. Would you go to there?’ And he said, ‘I don’t know where I’ll end up. It’s pretty open. I don’t know where I’ll be next year.’ </p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the fall 2014?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before I forget – on the 27th which I believe is a Monday, I will not be able see you. (Unclear) colonoscopy for the second time. My mom will be here to take care of me. I’ll finally get to see her. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. </p>

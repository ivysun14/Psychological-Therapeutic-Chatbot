<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence)  I was thinking about the feeling I had when I came in that your expression gave me, or that I interpreted your expression to mean.  And my inclination I think is now to just be quiet until I start thinking about something else.  And I've—, well I've even talked about it before recently of, again, this feeling and—, I'm not sure if it's exactly this, but somehow feeling you're disappointed in me or, I don't know, just that I'm not doing something right.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  What now?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  Well I think when I was thinking about it—, first of all I was thinking I don't know what it is and—.  one thing I was thinking I could do was to keep thinking about it and sort of go over and over things and try to figure it out or get angry at you.  Or forget it, try to forget it, since I_ w—, since I don't really forget it.  But then when asked that, what I hear in your voice is, sort of exasperation.  And it made me think of something, again in this— the book—,I just finished it, and near the end at one point when the doctor is talking about, or thinking about different patients he's had, he's thinking about some of the repetition of the things they go through.  And how, h_ he's quite interested, but other than that it's quite boring.  So what I think when you ask that is, I'm just going over and over the same old things and I'm not getting anywhere.  And you're trying to get me somewhere and I'm not going and I'm boring.  I don't know, when I talk I s_, I hear myself and s_, almost feel I'm in the mood to feel sorry for myself.  And that's partly why I thought what I did when I came in.</p>

<p>And it makes me think about, how this morning, when I got up, I knew I was going to take—, get my urine sample.  And then so I did that, and then I felt good for the first morning in I don't know how long.  And I was sort of surprised about that.  And I felt good—, FYLR didn't come in today and it was frustrating because, right now getting ready for a play, it's hard to do it on my own.  The way things are and—.  Yet I, I, eh, I didn't—.  I still felt, I don't know, somewhat happy or something.  I d_, not sure if it was happy but—.  And then I took the urine sample to the hospital.  And then when I got back to school I had a lot of things to start doing, and the mood changed after that and I'd—.  I don't know whether it was because I was planning for the rest of the year, and I began to feel this terrific pressure I'm not going to be able to do everything I want to do, and had to do something with FBS.  And I think I was feeling again that competitive feeling I was talking about yesterday and—.  But it just seems like I suddenly became ready to th—, see things as against me or bad for me or I don't know, difficult or a feeling I couldn't do things somehow.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  You know, I, uhm, have the strong impression that I'm feeling disappointed with you, that I'm exasperated and, uh, so on, is connected with what you're, uh, up to.  You d_, you mentioned yesterday what you had done with MSCZ over the weekend.  And what it really came down to it seemed to me was that, after telling me how your mother managed your father, and how you saw this and saw it in yourself, and have been trying to make MSCZ submit last week.  Over the weekend, in effect, you said very clearly that you didn't allow him to make love, but when you were ready, you made love to him.  And then yesterday you brought up the whole question of the time change here in such a way that, uhm, it sounded very much as though you were trying manage it, to arrange it.  So the only acceptable outcome would be if I were to change the time the way you want it, which would be to make me submit.  And following this, you have the same idea that I'm disappointed in you, that I'm exasperated with you, and you don't know why.  But I think it's on these grounds.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (silence)  I don't know.  I was thinking several things that I had felt, had that feeling yesterday when I was talking here about changing the time.  But I hadn't thought of it in terms of what I did with MSCZ over the weekend, because it was one of those things where he got made at me again, like he usually does and practically threatened—.  I mean he didn't really say, "If you don't change, we're going to get a divorce," but I mean he used that same threat in vaguer terms.  And, so I don't know it seemed like I was submitting to him, in a way.  But I can, I can see how what I did was part of that, too.  I mean I knew he'd be pleased and that he'd feel better toward me.  He'd stop thinking what he was thinking.  And then while you were talking, I was just thinking about (hesitates) h_, or asking myself, did I try to copy my mother and—.  She managed my father, and did I try to manage my father, too.  And it seems like a lot of the time I did.  I wanted him to do one thing, and if he didn't I'd get mad.  And of course, he'd be getting mad at me.  Still my intent was to get him to do things the way I wanted.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Yes, and if that were your real intent with me, that would explain why you feel that I would get angry in return.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  It's funny.  This is—, I don't know if I've done this before, but when you say that, It's almost like I'm separating you now and your reactions.  Saying. well, if you understand or you know what I'm doing, you wouldn't get angry.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, maybe that's a way to fight off feeling how I don't want to feel.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I, I don't know.  It seems like part of that is, I was actively doing something that I'm assuming caused a reaction in you, and I don't want to accept the responsibility of having actually done something.  Which sort of makes me think again of that feeling I had earlier when I was talking that I was just feeling sorry for myself, that somehow I want to think if you are disappointed in me or angry that I don't know why it is.  And so I'm sort of this poor, mistreated thing that—.  Maybe I keep trying to work it out and do things differently, but really my defense is to keep thinking I'm this poor mistreated thing and, and I'm not really thinking doing anything.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking again of that feeling, too, when I was thinking about my reaction when I came in, of your disapproval had something to do with my not accomplishing here what I should.  And when I think of it again it seems in connection with what you've said, I would be aware I'd missed you, not just not doing something, but I was very actively doing something else, which was misusing the time or, I don't know.  I don't know it was somehow carrying on a deception.  Which seems to be very much against what the whole point of being here is, and—.  So I f_, I suppose in a way it was feeling guilty.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, I think in fact, there is w_ what you must call deception in regard to asking for the time change.  There's something of at least trying to throw me off the track on it, you see.  To present it as, well, you're tentative and you really aren't pushing it and you even hesitate to say what you really want and sort of try to lead me to think it's all very tentative and so forth, etc.  But what is really on your mind is you want it, and that's it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, and I didn't ask it directly.  I mean I think that's what I mean by the deception.  That I let me—, myself fool myself.  I sort of had this vague feeling I was manipulating the situation yesterday but I didn't really face it.  And yet I still knew that the honest thing to do, or, I don't know, honest may be the wrong word to use here, but what I wanted was to state clearly that I wanted to change the time and ask you clearly, could you.  And I didn't do that.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Because asking me is not what you have in mind.  That's the whole point.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  It's telling me.  Demanding, insisting.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know. It's funny.  It makes me think of—, well I don't think of too much in particular, but just somehow I knew there were lots of ways I could manipulate my father.  I mean I could—, I think more of my—, how I used to handle things when I was at college.  All I had to do was appear home tired and talk about all the work I had and how hard I was working and produce some good grades and then sort of work around something that I wanted and I could get it.  As long as it was within a certain field of things, like material things.  Because I remember, at one point there were—,  my mother was buying a car, and she'd had a VGW for years.  And just before she was buying the car, they were going away on a long trip.  And I was a senior at college and I could have the car then.  And I knew I could get that car, even they'd stated very clearly that lo—, years ago when they gave us bicycles, and that was the last thing they were ever giving us, and they would certainly never give us a car.  And that—, they did feel that way, but I knew I could get the car, and I did.  And I know, I mean this is the kind of thing again where (hesitates), I don't know if I sat down and thought, "Now I'll do this and this."  But I just unconsciously knew how to manipulate it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know.  I start thinking, well I don't know what to do with that idea.  It's just sort of, "Here I am and this is what I've been doing."  And then I keep thinking about this other view I've had of myself, sort of what I was saying about how I reacted, too—, when I came in here, too, that I've, I've been thinking even since coming here about how I've been feeling a lack of power, other people having power over me and wanting it.  But that means I don't have it.  And yet here I am having it, in a way, as long as nobody sees through what I do. (pause)</p>

<p>So then it almost is—, it's not so much a fear that I don't have it but that I could lose it.  And everything's a threat to it.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know whether this is part of it, but the I start thinking that (exhales) somehow part of this power is to continue deceiving people into thinking something I'm not.  I mean just like if I'm telling somebody I want something, like telling you I want the time changed.  And I'd deceive you into thinking I'm asking you, you'll think I'm really an unassuming person, and, and I'm not.  And so the whole deception is to make you think I'm a kind of person I'm not.</p>

<p>And, and then it just made me think of my parents again and how they have an idea of what I am that I'm not, at least I don't think I am.  My whole thing has been not to, to carry on that deception.  Let them think that their concept is right.  Because that's what they want to believe, and that's the way I'll please them.  And sort of get my own way as much as possible, without ruining that appearance.  You know, I don't know what I do then with my father always saying I was a bitch, because that means he saw through me.  Except he didn't always say—.  I don't know, I'm confused, because I think I mix up now a f_, an attitude I sensed that he had toward me with his calling me that.  Because I know the few times he called me that I was extremely upset that he could think it.  And I think I was partly upset because it must mean that he had seen through something I didn't want him to see through.  (pause)</p>

<p> And if I think well what was the concept they had of me, what was the image that they wanted me to be, I can't really (hesitates) think of anything except that somehow I had the feeling I wasn't supposed to be a very strong personality.  I was supposed to kind of do what FYC did, only not quite as well.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, it— it seemed—.  I think of what I've read about the middle child and I think well maybe I'm just reading that in now.  But it seems like the feeling I had about what they wanted from me was that I wouldn't be very noticeable.  That maybe once in while they'd want to complain about me, give them something to talk about with their friends, and sort of all the problems that we're having with FAJ now.  She doesn't do this or that.  But nothing really serious, so that they wouldn't look bad as parents, and—.  (pause)

I don't know, because then I think again of how I felt when I was going to grammar school and coming home.  And I know my mother was practically always at home at those times, but somehow the feeling I had was that she didn't—, wasn't interested.  She didn't want to talk to with me.  She didn't want to hear what I had to say.  And so what I think is that she was hardly ever home.  (pause)</p>

<p>And then later, I_ I suppose because I came home later, she'd be taking naps and, I don't know, then it was almost as if I'd given up trying to talk to her, but I had that feeling I wish I could go and wake her up and talk to her.  I'd sort of want to hang around her room and be around when she woke up but—.  (sniff)  And yet it's funny because I'm sure that she was very careful, since she was always so careful about these things, to give equal time to every child and—.</p>

<p>But then one time she said something that I never questioned that I could be FYC or MLWZ.  I knew it had to be either FNA or me.  MSCZ thinks it's FNA, but I don't know.  I don't believe that it's definitely FNA.  We had been talking about something—, this was just a year or two ago and, I don't know if we'd just stopped talking about FNA or what but, but some—, or maybe I was talking about parents that I was dealing with and their attitudes toward children, and my mother said, "Well, you've got to realize that sometimes parents just don't get along with a child.  Their personalities don't get along or they just, for some reason, they don't like their child.  In that sense they can love it, because it's their child, but they don't like it."  And I knew she was talking about one of her children.  And I just didn't know which it was.  My fath—, because my father's always liked FNA, I think, better than my mother.  My mother used to be really exasperated with FNA, more than with me.  But then she—, because my father liked her so much, and liked the arty side of her and that kind of thing which I think he'd always wanted to have on his side and he'd never developed.  Uhm, she, my mother, sort of put on a front, and I don't know how much of a front she pu—.  I think now she—.  Well, I don't know how she feels about FNA now.</p>

<p>And I don't know, th_th_, I think think, too, that, of all the children I look most like my mother.  I think in baby pictures, her baby pictures and mine.  But I mean, somehow I think there might have been some identification there and—, on her part.  And so how can I feel all this if she did.  And I think, too, of what she said about that time when she sent me to my grandmother's.  And I don't know, I was very young.  I don't know how young, and she said that we just weren't getting along, and I had to send you.  And it was almost as if I put up the blot first, not her.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  You had said before that that happened either the summer after MLWZ was born or the summer after that.  You weren't certain.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Actually I think it was several times.  Because I can remember one time staying with my grandmother.  Another time being with my uncle for a while.  But maybe they were the same time, I don't know.  And then one time I went with a friend.  I don't know, today I want to think it was before MLWZ was born.  (pause)</p>

<p>And, just for some reason it makes me think of the fact, again, that I never was aware that I can recall now of FNA's being born, and yet I read a report on me, when I was at, I think it was nursery school.  And I—, the report at one point handled how I was behaving and sort of recovering from FNA's birth.  How my behavior was getting better.  And it—, then it made me think—, I think part of it was talking about how much I sucked my thumb, and how that was decreasing.  And then it just makes me think I was the only one in the family that sucked my thumb, steadily, I mean as, as a thing.  And I sucked it until I was quite old.  I mean it, it got so that I'd go to sleep not sucking it and I'd wake up sucking it, when it would be very embarrassing to do that.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, it seems strange that I would suddenly do this, and I don't know whether it's just being willful or what.  But it just seems like I'm recalling or I want to think that I was antagonistic to my mother, before MLWZ was born, and that I already felt competitive with her.  (pause)</p>

<p>Because, uhm, I've had this feeling, and MSCZ's even said sometimes he thinks my mother's glad or more glad to see me than to see some—.  I mean she's still glad to see MLWZ in that special way of a woman to her son, but—, or at least my mother to her son.  But she now is very demonstrative when she's saying hello or good-bye to me, in way she never used to be.  And she really seems to be feeling something that—.  I don't know, I mean we get along better now.  And th—, today I've been thinking of it almost like she's hoping to reclaim me or reclaim some kind of feeling between us that was lost all those years.  Or maybe that's what I'm wanting, and so I'm thinking of it that way.  Because I think all those years, I kept thinking my mother's not acting like a mother should.  She's not being a mother.  (silence)</p>

<p>That just I think made me think how can I function as a mother.  And I think I mean in that s_, how can I—.  Well, I was thinking, somehow combining it with how can I be a good teacher.  And if I have the capacity to be a good mother, then I could be a good teacher, too, of giving to the emotional needs of young children and—.  And I don't know thinking how often I just take refuge in being the authority figure.  And fearful that my authority will be questioned.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it just seems that there I'm copying my mother again, too, because I think I think of her as putting authority first, establishing and not letting it break down.  And then if there's time left, or energy left or feelings left.  But there really never were.  And maybe that's why now she's different because she's not trying to be the authority any more.  I mean she's consciously not trying to be it, just as much as she was trying to be at first.  (pause)</p>

<p>Which is just what her mother did, too.  (pause)</p>

<p>Except there I think again of how I was manipulating things yesterday about asking for the time change.  And it makes me think of my grandmother and how—, I suppose my mother did this, too, but I think of her now, my grandmother, and how she used to try to influence us about attitudes and things, without directly saying anything.  Or just how she'd say things against my father, without really saying it.  And she never appeared anything but being a very gentle woman and s_.  An yet, in a way, she wasn't at all and—.  And I remember once I did something and I guess I was getting sort of hysterical and she ran after me an spanked me.  Grabbed me and held me and spanked me, and I was pretty big then.  I must have been in my teens.  And she was old.  And I was just so surprised at that strength in her and determination, something she always kept hidden.  And, I don't know, just physically, too, here she was looking like this gentle, fragile old woman, since she was about 40, and yet she lived to be almost 90.  (silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking that (hesitates) in a way it helps to be talking about these things, but yet it seems like I'm—, the question I sort of stopped with was, "Well, what do I do with all this, these thoughts."  And I don't know, then I got the feeling that as long as I keep thinking them I don't have to stop and be responsible about feeling these ways or—.  (pause)</p>

<p>I think I—, it's almost like I was thinking that, well these feelings I can see have made me antagonistic and, I don't know, with my mother and then with other people, you here and (exhales) MSCZ.  And maybe it wasn't just those feelings, but anyway, it's almost like I keep saying, "Well, now here I know some of the history behind them."  But it's almost like I'm saying then, "But this is the way I am."  And I was thinking I don't want to be a bad mother.  I want to be able to give what I feel my mother didn't give.  And yet on the other hand, talking this way makes me feel I'll just keep saying, "I know I'm a bad mother but here's why."  Or just a bad woman.  (pause)Or inadequate.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it, I don't know, it seems like I'm—, when I think of the word inadequate then it means that I could try to be adequate and, well, I think I'm afraid to try and so therefore I keep getting these feelings that I think mean I can't overcome these feelings or resist them or (deep breath).  And then I think I'm trying and I find out I'm just doing what I've always done and—.  Like sort of competing in a way that (hesitates) I'm not sure what I'm competing for or against whom.  But seems like sometimes it's men and sometimes it's women.  (pause)</p>

<p>I think that was part of the feeling I had today when I was planning out until the end of there's not going to be—.  Every year, at the end of the year, I can always think, "Well, next year I'll try this idea."  And it's so important to me to try new ideas, as if I'm proving something.  And so, I had to say, "Well, this is it.  I can only do so much."  And that I can't try any more of these ideas and it shouldn't be that essential.  The class should come before these ideas that are maybe nothing to do with the class.  And so I was going through that struggle and it was—.  I don't know, I think my attitude about I need school and working hard at was winning out.   And proving myself because I work had and then show how good I am.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

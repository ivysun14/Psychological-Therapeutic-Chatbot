<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence)  Well, the first thing I was thinking was of uh, I, I was thinking of it just before you came out for me.  And I don't know, it just struck me that most, it means something in that I've been aware of this since FDO came, and yet today it bothered me more.  Uhm, because I think FDO's inclined to, if FSO goes to a cupboard or someplace and says she wants something to eat, FDO would give her anything. </p>

<p>And uhm, the first day when I was just showing FDO where food was, FSO really didn't — at that point she was so sick I don't think she wanted anything.  But she just was kind of pointing, and FDO immediately, "Oh, what is it you want?"  And uh, it happened to be a shelf where there are crackers, and then s—, a few cookies were left there. </p>

<p>And uhm, so it just struck me, her inclination might be to overindulge her in this way.  And uhm, so I just said I don't like FSO eating a lot of that kind of thing.  And it should be something where it's planned, and that FDO feels she probably needs it, and not just FSO goes to the cabinet anytime she feels like it and says I, I want this, and then will be too full to eat her regular meals.  And uhm, I don't know how much impression I made. </p>

<p>But the thing I was thinking about, was today uhm, FSO still doesn't feel well, but she's gotten, I think, to the point where she realizes our concern and the fact we've been uh, trying to please her more than we might if she were well.  So then, she starts demanding a lot of things.  And she was kind of that way with me this afternoon.  Uhm, and then at one point I had to go to the cabinet where uhm, (sniff) among other things, there are some raisins.  And she'd already had quite a big snack, and uhm w—, she'd had juice, and then I was having my lunch.  And so she had some, a piece of cheese while I was eating my lunch. </p>

<p>And uhm, so she asked for some raisins.  I said, "Well, why don't you have some tonight with your supper?"  And she accepted that, but as soon as I was leaving, since FDO feeds her her supper, she started wanting the raisins again.  And instead of waiting until supper, which wouldn't be that much longer, FDO got them for her right away.  Uhm, and so I don't know, I was just thinking about that, and in a way I don't think it really matters, because raisins actually are fine.  And I try to have things that — on the whole I don't care if, I mean, that they're things I want FSO to eat, if she wants them.  So that uhm, something like raisins, it wouldn't matter. </p>

<p>But uhm, it just suddenly started bothering me that (stammers) FSO that FDO will just be indulging FSO, I think is mainly the way I was thinking of it.  And uhm, I'm not sure what aspect of it bothers me, whether it's the comparison with me, because I don't.  And uhm, and then it makes me, uh maybe I'm thinking, then I'll have to fight FSO more, because she's used to it with FDO.  And uhm, or whether I'm really concerned about if she's overindulged too much, what this would mean in her development.  Or I, I don't know why I'd be.  Because especially today, because I know I can say things to FDO if I really feel it's a problem, and uhm, I don't have to buy things that I don't think she should be getting.  So that uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>And then the second thing I started thinking of was (sniff) uhm, the schedule at school again, because since the time that the children go up to the roof has been changed, this has sort of changed my whole approach.  And I've had trouble anyway, establishing the schedule that I thought would be best.  I feel as if I'm fighting the children all the time.  But I haven't quite worked out which way would be best.  And then, with the change in the roof time, that sort of, I've had to rethink everything again. </p>

<p>And uh, so I was just thinking about that, because it was on my mind today again, of while the day was going on I was just sort of trying to — and seeing how the children seemed, you know, what, what times of day they seemed to be more interested in doing different things, and whether they'd be best being free first, and then having a sort of a work period last.  Or the other way around.  And I can't make up my mind.  Uhm, but anyway, I was just thinking about that.  And I suppose there, too, there's an element of uhm, what I feel s—, that I'm fighting them on is that uhm, and the way they are h—, well I don't know for the teacher last year, but I know for other teachers that were in the school last year, the way the day often went was just simply, the children came in and they just sort of wandered from one thing to another. </p>

<p>And uhm, I mean, they had to get together if they were going up to the roof, or something like that.  But there was never a marked difference, as I want to establish, between free choice and when they're actually doing what could be called a work time.  And then again, I guess I get sort of unsure about why I want, I mean, it's mostly because of things I've read about kindergartens, and things that then I've felt I agreed with, not having done it, but that I felt would be valuable for them to learn before first grade. </p>

<p>And uhm, but then I feel they're very resistant.  So, I don't know whether I'm pushing them too fast, or whether, well I don't know, I just feel th—, uncertain.  And uh, and I don't know m—, whether I'm thinking about it now, because I mean, right here, because it's again a thing of, am I going to make them do what I want, or am I going to try to work things out so I'm not in the end, what feels like is fighting them.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>Because then I think of yesterday, and how I found it so hard to uhm, think of anything that well, to think about that whole situation over the weekend and what really might have been behind it.  And I, I felt as if what I was thinking about were all things that weren't very meaningful.  (Sniff, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>(Sniff) Well, then I was just thinking about a uhm, thing I did this morning in the class.  Agai—, it involves th, the children being resistant, I think.  Uhm, but there was a little number exercise really, that uhm, I thought would be the best thing for me to use to tell me the most that I need to know about their understanding of numbers, not just simply counting in sequence.  But really understanding numbers working together, and uhm, some abstract, uhm, reasoning.  I mean like uhm, adding and subtracting, in a way, in their heads.  But it was all — so I had something before them, so that it was sort of semi—, I — abstract, I suppose. </p>

<p>But uhm, they, and I, I was doing this, perhaps the problem came at the way I did it, because I broke them up into small groups, so that I'd really feel I knew how each of them was responding.  And uhm, they had to either well, I mean, i, in effect, they to leave what was set up as the work period, and there were certain choices.  Or, uhm, to come with me, or else they, uh, I mean, they had to leave it.  And a lot of them just weren't interested in doing, and a few were, and a few were very good.  But uhm, most of them just couldn't apply themselves. </p>

<p>So in some cases, I think they might have been better if they weren't distracted, but they were very distracted.  And yet I felt I had to see the thing through, so I could get some idea of uhm, (sigh) their understandings.  And, and I, I feel as if I sort of defeated myself, somehow.  That uhm, and I'm finding even this hard to think about, I don't know quite why.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You know, it's very striking, really, uhm, wh, what a certain change this week, following the weekend.  You have uh, you know, fallen silent repeatedly.  And uh, I guess it was yesterday, you were talking about feeling you were blanking something out.  And it's really what you're in effect, seeming to do about the whole question of the weekend, and, and then, what preceded it.  So you're literally, trying to just abolish it, wipe it out.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence)  Well, I guess first I was just thinking about the fact, I can clearly feel that about what happened last week, because I just find it so hard to remember anything.  And uhm, but then I keep th—, except I don't really get at anything connected to the weekend, so I suppose that I really am doing it for that, too. </p>

<p>But I have also kept thinking that if I just try to uhm, forget it really, or it's almost like I'm pretending it didn't happen, or well, just not be aware of it any longer.  Uhm, I, I keep having the feeling, though, that that's just going to make things worse.  That uhm, well, I mean, because of uhm, our relationship with the BFM's.  Not so much for MSCZ, because I feel as if MSCZ knows more of what's happened, maybe than even I do.  Or at least, he would understand that it, that it, if, if I blank it out, that that's what I've done, that it wasn't that I didn't consider it important. </p>

<p>Or, I, I don't know, just somehow anyway, I feel as if he understands more.  So I guess, maybe this is even worse, but I don't worry about my relationship with him, so much as our relationship with the BFMs, and what it might h—, what might have happened as a result of that.  And uhm — (sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Who does MW really remind you of?  This man who has tantrums, who thinks you're stupid?  A man who gets very angry, thinks you're stupid?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, when you say it, it makes me think of my father, but —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Of Course.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, (sigh, Silence, Sigh)  Well that just uhm, I mean, I've always seen there certain similarities.  But I, I never had thought I really was reacting to him, because of being reminded of my father.  Uhm, but, what I mainly started thinking of, was how there've been times that somehow, I've been responding to FNI, uhm, as if she were something she's really not.  And I don't know, I'm finding it hard to remember, from what I've understood about before.  But uhm, it just strikes me now that there'd be things that w—, could remind me of my mother in her, uh, although th, they're quite different in lots of ways.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You talked about that, ah, and you mentioned MSCZ saying his theory was, that you had sort of almost brought it all about, set it up.  And that you were playing out the scene.  Last week,</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Interrupting) Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   — you began the week telling me about the previous weekend, when you had made love with MSCZ on Sunday afternoon.  Recall?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And you recall how you felt reluctant to tell me, because it seemed to you as though you were bringing me right into the room?  And among other things, you were reminded then of the closed door to your parents' bedroom.  Now, I think that's connected with whatever hand you, part you played in setting up this little scene, or at least, playing it out.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence, Sigh) What that made me think of right away was the, I mean, I don't see it.  Uhm, but, but maybe this is part of it, and I just don't see the connection.  Uhm, but I immediately thought of the f—, the way that evening began, with my uhm, calling FNI late afternoon, to tell her that we could get there earlier.  And her f—, her first words were — before she explained, or anything — "Don't bother."  And here I thought I was doing her a favor.  I called Mrs. BBG, whom I had prepared for this, but I always hesitate to keep changing things on her, because she's quite rigid.  And uhm, and I knew I couldn't, I just couldn't call her and change it back again.  Although I think she might have understood, if I made a big thing of it.  But, and somebody going to the hospital, and all.  Because since Mrs. BBG's always concerned about her own health, and everything. </p>

<p>But I don't know, it just uhm, I, I was doing it only because FNI had made me feel she wanted me, us, to come earlier.  I did not do it because I wanted to go earlier.  I had wanted to be with FSO later.  And uhm, I mean, have her closer to her bedtime, before we left.  And uh, so when FNI's initial thing was, well don't bother, and she said it in quite a uhm, abrupt way, which I suppose in a way was understandable, uh, because she was rushing out the door to the hospital.  Although MJ wasn't, it wasn't quite so bad, in that the doctor had already been with MJ.  And uhm, things were all right, it's just that he had to have stitches for, mainly I suppose, s—, to keep the wound clean, and for his own appearance later. </p>

<p>And uhm, but anyway, I just, I think I, uh, er, was al—, was in a, in another mood, right away, after she said that.  Even though I knew then that she was taking MJ to the hospital, I was already mad.  And I j—, I don't see how this all fits in, or uhm — (Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I just thought of another thing too, that uhm, must, I, I think I sort of carry this feeling all the time.  And again, I, I don't see all, how all this works into my feeling here last week, and uhm, telling you about when MSCZ and I had intercourse on that Sunday afternoon. </p>

<p>But uhm, I just thinking of, when I did call FNI, uhm, the oth—, yesterday, whenever it was, uh, and one of the things I mentioned was that we would like to join them for dinner on Friday, but not for the theater afterwards.  And she sounded to me uhm, I don't know if annoyed is too strong, but what I thought immediately, in any case, was that she was reacting by thinking, well here we go again, just what you said Saturday night.  Because I, because we do have to leave early on Saturday, and so I said we didn't want to make it too late an evening. </p>

<p>And uhm, I, I don't know whether I was making it up, or what, but she sounded displeased.  And uhm, (sniff) I, I think I always have this feeling, and it was almost something similar to that when I made the effort to go earlier, because FNI had wanted it.  And then —  because of what had happened that she couldn't foresee — but in any case, at that point, she didn't want us to come early.  And then as it turned out — I don't know why, whether it was they'd forgotten about the time change, or just they were in a different mood, or what — but anyway, they clearly did not want us to leave as early as I think was in her mind when she invited us. </p>

<p>And uhm, so I'm always feeling as if, if we do anything that we want, or, or I don't know, just always it seems like if we don't do exactly what FNI wants, then we're displeasing her.  Or I am, or I don't know, there's some conflict there in terms of FNI's plans, and then my feeling I'm displeasing, or I don't do exactly as she plans.  And uh, she loves to plan, and s—, and, and then, and then she does get annoyed with MW, I mean, sh, she's obvious about being annoyed with him.  And I think sometimes, uhm, she can't see why other people can't fit into her plans.  So then she gets kind of annoyed. </p>

<p>But I don't know, I think I bring, I mean, it shouldn't bother me.  If I can't, I can't.  And she can accept it.  She might be annoyed initially, but then she can accept it.  And I can't accept something about her response, and I don't quite understand it.  Because I think there was something in that when I went there on Saturday.  Uhm, mm, that led me to, I don't know, set things up.  Because then I was annoyed when we weren't asked if we wanted to play bridge.  It had never been mentioned, even when we were invited there.  And uhm, so it was almost like I was right from the beginning, not going to play good bridge, because I was annoyed.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was just, I guess first I thought, well maybe there's something to do with, with my parents' door being shut, and feeling left out, or not being considered.  And some element of that in my reaction to FNI and the way sh—, I feel the way she responds if we don't exactly fit into her plans, that she wouldn't be annoyed if she were considering us, too.  And, and our needs in, in fitting, trying to fit in.  And uhm, so I don't know whether there's something of that, there. </p>

<p>And then I, the next thing I thought was of uhm, today (sigh) when the children were having CHN — the one who teaches it is the mother of one of the children in the room, but he's been absent lately, and uh — while she was doing CHN, I was just looking at the way she was dressed.  And something just struck me about it that seemed to be a clue to me, over one of the ways that she deals with her child, and how he is a problem, and how he has learned to uhm, sort of pay them back for things he doesn't like.  And how he knows he can get them upset, because if he doesn't behave in certain ways and uh, have the kind of manners they want, they get extremely distraught.  And i, it's very obvious, it was obvious to me the minute I met the two of them at the home visit. </p>

<p>And uh, but I was just thinking about the contrast in the way she was dressed at home, and then the way she's dressed whenever she comes to school.  That she fits very much into the, sort of the role of being dressed like all these other PFD women.  And then at home, she was dressed very casually.  And she could have lived anywhere.  Uhm, but it wasn't that very, sort of expensive, but subtle, uhm, tasteful dress that she wears whenever she comes out to school. </p>

<p>And uhm, in fact, the first day that she came to school, I was kind of shocked at how attractive she was.  Because I just, or, I don't know, how well-dressed.  I don't, something had surprised me from the way she was at home.  And uhm, so I was just talking to FLMZ about something that was striking me.  And I guess maybe saying it, because I was kind of feeling out my own thoughts about it.  And we weren't standing too far away from, we weren't right there where the children were, and the lesson.  But we weren't standing too far away. </p>

<p>And just now, the way I was thinking of it, was here we were talking, and I wondered what FHYZ, this CHN teacher, mother, uhm, was thinking of our talking, and if she overheard anything.  And if she even noticed us, if we disturbed her, or I don't know, just anyway, wondering if she felt, I suppose, left out.  Or uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Mm.  So you come back to a scene where there are 3 people, two of them engaged in 1 activity, and the third one feeling left out.  The scene last Sunday, or Sunday before last, was FSO was taking her nap, and you and MSCZ were together.  And then here you were thinking I was the third person.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, all I can think of, what is obvious.  And that is my feeling the third person when my parents' door was shut.  Although, then I keep thinking, but I didn't know what was happening behind the door.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Mm.  You, yeah, you didn't know.  You were stupid.   But, as you indicated by all this talk last week about your IQ and all that, you weren't really stupid.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, that leaves me feeling all mixed-up.  Because I suppose I'm wondering on the one hand, what I wondered, especially the day when I talked about my IQ, what you thought.  In what way you'd believe.  I mean, whether you'd believe the figure or not.  And uhm, and just that I know there are times when I act stupid on purpose, but then there are times when I feel as if maybe I really am stupid, and how much do I believe I am or I'm not.  Or I don't know, I just, how much am I really doing it on purpose, and how much is it happening because I am stupid.  Or, at least not as bright as I'd like to be, or other people are, or something. </p>

<p>And uhm, and then I began thinking about uhm, well, I guess in part, how careful I am about certain aspects of the way I teach, because I don't feel confident.  And, I mean i—, sometimes I'm trying to be too thorough, I suppose.  I mean, some ways I suppose it's good, but then, sometimes it's, I think, out of feeling a lack of confidence.  And then, that made me think of uh, the meeting a, uh, the faculty meeting we had today.  And uhm, Mrs. BBF was talking about the conferences that are going to start next, is it next week, I guess, and just some points she wanted us to be aware of, or things she wanted us to think about in our approach to the conferences.</p>

<p>And she kind of got off track in trying to make her point, because she kept having this feeling she wasn't going to make it.  And so afterwards, she was in a, in a way asking me, did I make my point.  And I don't know, she struck me as how insecu—, —cure, she's feeling.  Uh, but then, after she talked to me, she was talking to another teacher who's new this year, and, and uh, who I think is quite sound and has good things to say, and is often quite perceptive at getting right at the problems, rather than sort of talking around it, and not quite being sure what the problem is.</p>

<p>And she was talking to her after, and she at first repeated practically, word to word what she'd said to me.  And uh, FBC, this other teacher, was reassuring her in a similar way.  But then FBC said something that I missed, but that I think, was something that she felt should be considered in all this, or I don't know, a problem that she thought might arise that uhm, they started talking about.  And I just was thinking about the way I was dying to know what it was. </p>

<p>And uh, I knew really, they weren't talking about me.  Because I was right there, the e—, I could have heard if I'd really tried hard enough.  There were ways I could have stopped doing what I was doing, and heard what they were saying.  But I didn't.  And yet, I had this feeling, what if they're talking about me in, sort of, as if in the way, well, I really was trying to get the point across, because FAJ's inclined to have this problem, or something like that. </p>

<p> And uh, or just, I was wondering I suppose, if they were talking about anybody, or just what they were.  But uhm, my inclination was to think, well maybe they're talking about me.  And yet I could be pretty sure they weren't, because I was right there.  (Sniff) I mean, they were in the hall and I was in my room, but they were just outside my room.  And I don't think they would have stayed there, if they had been.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I come away from that feeling uh, left out.  Because I don't know what they were talking about, and I wanted to.  And again, uhm, I don't know if stupid is quite right, but that there's something wrong with me, or uhm, I wanted to know what they were talking about, partly because I was thinking, well maybe it's something I should be aware of, and I'm not.  And — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I guess, uh, you know, another question is, is that all your curiosity's about?  Just in this situation at school?  See, one of the things you mentioned last week also, in connection with uhm, when I was asking you if you wanted to be a psychiatrist, you remembered MEINZ.  You talked about, the fellow's sexual experience uh, was while his 3 year old daughter was in bed with him and his wife.  And I think you had prefaced this by saying, you were thinking about these 2 things and it gave you kind of a perverse pleasure.  You were commenting on that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sniffs)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Another trio, a little girl there while her mother and father were having intercourse.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well I know I find that disturbing to try to imagine that trio, because w, when I try to imagine it, then it is involved from the girl's side of what she saw, what she was aware of.  And what she knew, what she couldn't say she didn't know, as a result of it.  And uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) But you didn't talk about that, here.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Hmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   That's one of the things that got lost and blanked out.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh) Yeah, well I'm not sure how much I knew it when I said it.  Because I feel I know it now. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, what do you imagine about the little girl?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I don't know exactly what it means clearly, that she saw her parents making love, and then I have a visual image of a man and a woman making love.  But uhm, it's not my own.  Maybe it should be, if I'm really being honest, I don't know.  And uhm, I mea-, and, and j—, I don't know, I, uhm, I, I think I'm already denying this, s—, that there's something more, I imagine, than, uhm,  I'll admit.  (Sigh) Or, I mean, there must be something about them, the way I imagine her feeling.  And that's what I, I think I lose if I try to think about what I imagine. </p>

<p>But I would think it must have to do with the uhm, imagining the parents being just totally, after a certain point, being totally unaware of her, or at least, being so involved with each other, that it would seem to somebody looking on, as if they were totally unaware.  And I do—, kn—, I, it would just increase her feeling, I, I guess I imagine, of being left out.  And uhm — (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, it seems like uh, I'm wondering a lot of things.  Uhm, well, I mean one thing is, but perhaps I'm not even ready to see it yet, but I'm wondering all this, all these things are connected that we've been talking about today.  And uhm, particularly, I suppose, this feeling of, I see s—, how some of them are, this feeling of being left out, uhm, but how it all i, is related with what happened Saturday, and what I was doing in setting it up.  Because I do feel there was a lot, that even I can admit I was doing it on purpose.  And uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Oh, I don't know, it, mm, mm, another thing I guess I was thinking, in one way it seems obvious, but in another way it just doesn't to me.  Or, uhm, well anyway, I guess I'm wondering why something like what happened today, when Mrs. BBF and FBC were talking in the hall, I felt so upset at not hearing, or not being part of the conversation.  And almost wanting to think they were talking about me, it would seem, because it just seems so unlikely. </p>

<p>Uhm, but anyway, very concerned that I didn't hear what they had said, and I have this feeling, now I have to in some way, ask FBC.  Think of some way so I don't ask her in too clumsy a fashion, but that I must know.  And I, I don't, and, and yet then understanding this girl's feeling as I imagine it, of being so left out when her parents were making love.  And uh — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, and I guess, just too, especially because of certain things that, I mean, feeling as if I played bridge badly on Saturday night on purpose, or I didn't try.  I didn't really put my mind on it.  Uhm, just wondering, uhm, how much I've set up my being stupid and uh, so that I want to believe it.  (Pause, Sigh)</p>

<p>Uhm, I don't know, because then, the way I felt Saturday, it would seem as if I was very upset when everybody so obviously reacted to make it clear they all saw I'd done something stupid.  Yet and, yet it seems like uh, somehow, everything had led to that, and that, that it was what I was leading everything to, in a way.  And uhm, I don't know, the whole thing is, doesn't all fit together for me. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, there's time.  But not today. 
??</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] told me that you called her and said you were getting married. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Got engagement ring.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Congratulations. When did that happen?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [DATE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow. That's exciting.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But we're going to wait a year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did he do like a formal proposal or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he did. Then I got the ring later because, uh -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where's the ring?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't put it on 'cause sometimes I have a hard time getting that on and getting it off, especially now and I don't know why my fingers are so swollen right now. But I like to have a tight fit because I don't want it to slide off and lose it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was it like a diamond? Wow. Did it surprise you when he got it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Were you excited about it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I kinda knew it was coming 'cause he had me pick it out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really? Well, how do you feel about the whole thing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Good. [INAUDIBLE] at work can be kind of stressful lately.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How come?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 'Cause they give me all the dirty jobs around there to do. I'm getting tired of it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They have you going out in the parking lots again?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Still, yeah, sometimes two, three, four times. And out of the blue I had the mother of two twins at the First Baptist Church she runs we had to start a daycare center, so I told her okay, and so we meet with her on Friday and schedule her kids in and then I'll try to schedule other kids in and then I'll see with work if I can work probably after five on certain days and schedule it in with what I'm doing and with what they're doing. 'Cause I can't just live off what they give me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No way. Yeah. I can live off, but sometimes I only make seventy nine dollars a week and sometimes it's a hundred and something dollars and it's just a week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, that's not very much for a whole week.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um. So that's why I decided to do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you like it better than [DEIDENTIFIED] or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, home daycare, I can take care of the kids in my home and it's like I am the boss, so it's kind of easier. And she knows me from the First Baptist Church and these two twins, they're great. I don't know why. Some of the women was complaining about them and stuff, but I'm kind of easygoing and I just like to have them play around the room and [INAUDIBLE] spirits and everything. And some things they did and upset the other ones and I'm the type that I'm not easy to get upset with and stuff. That's why her two twins just likes me a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're real easygoing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. I'm more easy and not stricter like some. And I think I'd rather be that because kids have more of a fun and fun time through the day. And a lot of times when they do something, they're not meaning to do it, it's just sometimes it's just, they're just little rambunctious and this and that and stuff. But they need to be corrected, but they don't need to be really, don't hard on and stuff. They just need a little guidance.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you talk to your brother about [NAME OTHER]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I kind of said something to him. He says I kinda knew it. He says okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How did he feel about it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He didn't tell me one thing or another, even [NAME OTHER] went to him to see. He doesn't even tell you goodbye or nothing at all like that. Yeah, that's just [NAME OTHER]. That's just his way.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You talk to your [NAME OTHER] though.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What are her thoughts?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She likes [NAME OTHER] a lot. He said my [NAME OTHER] and my cousins were over at his house quite a few times over the summer having cookouts and just meals and different things. They've been coming over and they pretty much [INAUDIBLE] kind of likes that. So and I met his brother and I met his daughter in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What are they like?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They're nice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum. 'Cause every time he gets into it with me and he tells them about it, they're on my side.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You've had some arguments or disagreements?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, disagreements and little arguments and stuff. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What about?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know what it is, but anyways they tell him to keep his big mouth shut and leave me alone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't really fight, do you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's just sometimes he has a few too much beer I guess and he gets a little mouthy and talking.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does he ever say negative things about you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes and he had me crying one time and he says he doesn't mean it and everything, but a lot of times 'cause I don't know him very well I don't know, so we kind of [INAUDIBLE] I really don't mean it or anything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What did he say that made you cry?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I don't remember. It's just negative words he says at me and everything mostly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Give me an example.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Give me an example, what kind of?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, sometimes he calls me lazy and this and that but he doesn't really mean it. Just sometimes I [INAUDIBLE]. I have a hard time understanding when he's kidding around and when he's not.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So he like teases you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. But [NAME OTHER] even said [INAUDIBLE] things that he shouldn't be saying, some words and some things at me and to me 'cause I'm too much of a nice girl for him to be doing that. So I guess she knows him more than I do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it takes time to get to know somebody. You haven't known him that long so it's probably a good idea that you have a year to plan.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Get to know him better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And plus I've been walking around with [NAME OTHER], she's one of my girlfriends. She's on [DEIDENTIFIED] but she's on the other side. She's behind [DEIDENTIFIED] on this end. And, um, she's met him and she told me [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What did she say?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like some things that I was having trouble with the words and she didn't like the way he came out with a few things and said a few things that I knew that too. He was more supportive, that he probably should have been, but he feels like you can't do anything to [NAME OTHER] or talk back to [NAME OTHER] because they give you the rotten hours and this and that and it's just to ride it out. And I'm the one that I'm usually take it. So we kind of get into it. And [NAME OTHER] didn't like that he wasn't more supportive in the way he just said to leave work at work, but for me that's kind of hard to do. And she figures it's like her and [NAME OTHER], she has a problem, they like to work it out together and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's her husband?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So [NAME OTHER] is more supportive?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know about the drinking. I mean, does he drink every night?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah. It starts at three and then it just ends, he won't have any more after he eats. But he usually starts having a few beers around three and then stops around five.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Every night?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. And it gets to be a little bit sometimes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How many beers?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Too much beer.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does he drink?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When I go over there there's probably about four cans already open on the table.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does his personality change when he drinks?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, sometimes. I've been noticing it. And then he tries to get me to drink a few more beers and I usually just stick around one or two because then that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, especially with the medicine one beer is like three beers.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So are you drinking more beer than you did before?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Be real careful with that. He wants you to keep him company?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah 'cause that's part of it what it is. I've just been putting in a lot of hours. I had today off and I've got to work Sunday from eleven to three. And what my schedule is next week, 'cause they didn't have it done when I left Friday, so and I think I'm going to go upstairs and write down the schedule. But last week I work twelve hours. This week I think I'm working twenty two hours.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it really varies a lot.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum. Some days I'll have more than other weeks. That's why I'm more tired this week. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 'Cause the extra hours. How about your anxiety or depression, does that worsen if you work more? No, it stays pretty much controlled?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't noticed it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you sleep well at night and?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. Sometimes it gets a little too cold. And sometimes it's hard to guess 'cause sometimes it gets a little warm during the day and then it gets a little cool in the morning and a little cool at night. That's fall.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How are the cats doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They're starting to crawl out from underneath the cat but the little ones and they've got their eyes open. They're getting bigger. She's trying to walk I think but she's can also walk underneath that thing and I can hear her hitting the board underneath and I'm going will you let them come out. And I'll just close the door and keep these other cats out. She crawls under there again. I took them all out and I had them in this little bed and they were so curled up and they were so [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They were so what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Relaxed and sleeping with each other and they were in a ball there and she.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They curl up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and she came along, she started picking them up and pulled them back under there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The mother?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah. [INAUDIBLE]. She don't want them out yet. She wants them under there. It's so crowded under there. Once in a while they crawl out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does [NAME OTHER] get along okay with the cats?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He's not mean to them?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um. Just Tiger Lily sometimes she comes up on the bed and she'll lay up on my head or lay on the pillow and sometimes he'll pick her up and take her off and she comes back. And it kind of aggravates me 'cause I'm so used to having them just coming to bed and just lay down with me. I think that's part of the problem, I think he's a little jealous of the cats.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He wants all your attention.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, it's a different experience. I mean, you've been single your whole life, so.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's like a different responsibility.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does it ever feel like a burden or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-hum. Sometimes but then we kind of talk it out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So he listens?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum. Sometimes though he doesn't, too many beers started already.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When he drinks he doesn't listen.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. And then I just say, okay, I'm outta here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's good. Set limits on the drinking. Has it been a longstanding problem, drinking or you don't know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know. But I know [NAME OTHER] told me, one time I told her about a few things, she said it's the beer. So I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, take your time. It's important to be cautious. But I think overall you're happier in a relationship. You've gotten more comfortable with the physical aspect?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You like that now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And your restless leg is controlled pretty well too?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know. At times I kick at night and I don't know because I'm asleep. I don't know, I don't realize it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still taking two?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With the Compazine? </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you do sleep pretty soundly.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum. Sometimes. And sometimes like those storms when they were running through, they were waking me up, but.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When those storms were going through they were waking me up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, those were pretty severe, yeah. Did you get any flooding?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't get any flooding, but [NAME OTHER] and some of the cousins did. And my [NAME OTHER] had the tornado touch down by her house. She's got a lot of the trees, the tops of the trees and fences all around is all broken. And her barn got the doors blown out. And she's got a couple of trees that was on top of her roof and they removed them now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But it didn't break the roof?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Breaking windows, and she was lucky 'cause the branches and all were all up against the windows and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So the tree actually fell on her house?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uprooted from the ground and fell right on her house. She said I am not going upstairs.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was she in the house at the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, she was with her daughter over in McDonald's when it hit. And they were inside the McDonald's and they had to get up against the walls at the McDonald's 'cause it was blowing so hard. And that was path of it. But she got really scared. It was kinda scary at the end and she said she was with [NAME OTHER] at the time it happened and when she came home that's what she found. When I went over there the trees were all just like toothpicks. They were missing its top. They were all just blown elsewhere and blown on her fence, and here and there and just everywhere. It was just all the trees had gone. And then they were saying, well, she called [INAUDIBLE] got damaged but I don't know what it is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I knew someone in West Chicago had no electricity for four days. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. [NAME OTHER] was out of electric for a while. My electric went out, it was off only for a few seconds and then came back on. And that's the way it was at [NAME OTHER] house, electric went off and then it came on just a few seconds 'cause when I just parked in front of his house that's when the siren started going off. And, uh, him and his friend were just cutting the grass [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah, I saw it was pretty dark in the sky out that way and I was just leaving the parking lot and [NAME OTHER] was just going out and [INAUDIBLE] when it hit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hopefully the weather will hold now for a while. You seem pretty calm though. Do you need refills?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I think I gave the prescription and then [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For the [INAUDIBLE] and the Klonopin, what about the [INAUDIBLE]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The [INAUDIBLE] I still got some of the samples that you gave me and the pills, I still got them. And then you got, you'd written down also.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Prescriptions.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Prescriptions and then I still got the card 'cause she gave me the card back.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay. Well, I can give you another sample if you like.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But no side effects or anything? You feel pretty stable with what you're taking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't noticed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What are you gonna do this weekend?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This weekend is almost gone. Tomorrow I gotta work from eleven to three. Frankly not doing much of anything this week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really? You're just working?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You going to see [NAME OTHER] tonight?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, 'cause he always fixes me dinner.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, always fix me dinner.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's nice. At his house?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> His house.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're going to go there from here?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum. But I want to stop at work first and run in and get my stupid schedule. 'Cause it'll be on my way. 'Cause I'm just curious to know what my schedule's going to be like next week. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They do it one week at a time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they come out with the schedule on Friday, but she was just doing the schedule when I got off of work at twelve, so sometimes the schedule's done, sometimes it's just not on Friday when I leave. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right. Have a good dinner. What are you going to have or you don't know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He usually sometimes tells me.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Stepmother, so I did miss the first one, and then [did well] (ph). And then I saw my stepbrother, who I haven't seen in a couple of years-both of them. And they made a big mistake, and it was so funny. They put us all at the end of the table-and so my two brothers and myself. And we were drinking Colt 45. And by the time we finished drinking her Colt 45, we were drinking to things - like somebody said - what did they say, "Pass the butter," and we always said, "I'll drink to that!" (laughter) </p>

<p>So we were just having a ball. It was so much fun. But I kind of got to like Jamie - I hadn't seen him in a couple of years, and he was a brother for a while, so you know, like that kind of (inaudible) for a while. And then he was going - the last time I saw him he was going with girl that was there. So I never realized how sharp he was and how appealing he was. Well we had a ball. And we were talking, but - . And it was so funny because when we left - what happened? Oh, something that kind of hit me because - a lot of times I think about myself all the time. </p>

<p>And this time I thought, "Boy, I never realized it, but Jamie got an inferiority complex towards Andy, who is a little bit older." And well when he was thinner and - he was better looking. But now - I don't know what it is, but Jamie getting really good-looking. He never used to be when he was younger. And - because I said something like - oh I know-Ed is - one of his stepsister's husband was using a choke hold on Andy. </p>

<p>So I (inaudible), so Jamie said, "That's not the way you do it." So I was showing him a judo hold. It was funny. And he got me out of it anyway. So I said, "That's not fair. (inaudible at 1:36)" (laughter) And he said, "That was so (inaudible at 1:39). So he says, "Yeah." So when I went to Jamie, I said, "Jamie, beat your big brother up." He said, "No." And he said it seriously. It was like - you know, like a kidding thing that was really serious. He said, "No I could never beat him at anything." And I thought, "Oh no!" You know? Not another second-bester. </p>

<p>And it's really funny because like Andy is what - he's a mailman now, which is - I mean, he makes pretty good money and everything; but like Jamie is teaching. So you know, you'd think he'd say, "Wow, I'm really doing something great, and that I was pretty good." Uh-uh-he's still got that inferiority complex to Andy - which is funny-I never realized it before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And other people in the world have that, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah-like a second-best feeling. And I thought, "Gee," you know? I was going (inaudible) to you, not to Andy. It was funny. Oh cripe-but we did have fun - and he's a real riot. But now -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's when you could feel him being second best to somebody else, when you didn't think that was still true? [2:40]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It kind of made me think, too-like, "Maybe I'm wrong." Or maybe I put my importance in the wrong place or something. Because I look at this fellow who's - he's as clever as Andy. Andy's a little more of a wit. You know, he can throw words back and forth. And so I guess maybe this makes him feel like he's dumb or something. I don't know what he feels that way. But as far as like being nice-they're both nice. I think Jamie's a little more clever. This is my opinion. See, I guess he doesn't share the same things, you know? </p>

<p>As far as good looking goes, he's got this crazy little beard. I told him he looked like the devil-which is even funnier because he's a part of the brotherhood. But I really couldn't see it, and I never realized it until he came out with that. And I thought, "Wow." And then I sat down and I thought, "Well you know, I got this thing I thought because of this bit of moving around." But my girlfriend brought this up, too. We have talks once in a while. And sometimes she'll say something, too, that I'll just start thinking about and realize that sometimes she makes quite a bit of sense. </p>

<p>And she was saying something about - let's see - oh she said, "You always think about yourself, and you always think about what other people have done to you. But do you ever think how - what you did to make them react the way they did?" Because everybody reacts. I'd react to them, but they were also reacting to me. And it's not always - like I used to - I didn't completely blame them, but I used to be like say, "Oh I hated this one because she did this to me." And so, "I hated this one because they did that to me." </p>

<p>And a lot of times, I guess I just tend to just take it and project it into somebody else because I don't like the idea of it being me. And like, "I wouldn't do that. You know, I wouldn't do something like that." And it just kind of makes me think that there were times when I would do things like - I was very hard for a long, long time when I was at the Foley's-very, very hard. I was like a rock. No one could touch me; no one could come near me because - I guess I had been hurt. </p>

<p>My stepmother said, too, she doesn't know where it started. But it had to start before I went there. Because as soon as - we were all right for a couple of months, and I don't even know what happened. And I can remember another thing, too. She said - and one of the reasons I didn't remember this too much. One of the reasons that I had left there was my brother had a really rotten attitude towards me. And I knew he felt like he didn't - I felt like he didn't love me-which his attitude was rotten completely towards me. </p>

<p>And I was trying to figure out why; and I wasn't sure exactly. Now I know there's another thing. You know, talking about inferiority complexes and things like this. I know when I was little I was spoiled rotten. Now my brother might have inadvertently been jealous of that-I don't know. Or maybe it was because I was rotten to him or mean to him that he reacted that way. But I can remember for a while - and this was before I left there. It was like after a while - first, you know, we had like a really rotten relationship for like a year and a half. We couldn't communicate at all. [5:39]</p>

<p>And then something happened-I think she said, "Now let's start a system. When I see you doing something, I'll say - or like getting hard or - " You know, like what I was doing-I'd start staring. I could stare - like throw daggers at somebody. She would say, "Red," or something like this. And then if you do something else that I don't want you to do, I'll just say a code word so that I won't be yelling at you in front of anybody or anything. </p>

<p>So I guess it was right around there that I felt like, "Well maybe she really does love me. She doesn't want to do something like, you know, yell at me in front of people." Because a lot of other people had-and I think she had before. So we started getting along pretty well for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was a nice thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it was a real great thing; but at the same time, when I was getting along, Ed started, you know, like getting (inaudible at 6:30). So what I'm trying to figure out is whether - maybe when we were little, we were more or less like in competition for my mother, because my father wasn't around very much. And maybe he felt like I won out; and that I was winning out again with Mrs. Hallyman; and maybe he was kind of happy that we weren't getting along. </p>

<p>And it could be that - and partially because he might have thought that because he loved her and she loved him, and I was being mean to her, that if he was mean to me it would be like - you know, it would be like being closer to her. I'm not really sure, but I'm just trying to figure out why the feeling came between us like that, because we were so close when we were little. And why - this is the only thing I can think of. </p>

<p>And I know like - I know definitely that Mary's taken my place. Boy, I almost died when I found out what he got her for Christmas. No card to me, right? No present to me. He gets her a stereo for Christmas. You know, this beautiful stereo. I came walking in - but I was kind of happy with myself because my first reaction was it was pretty and I was happy she had it. Because I do care about Mary. There is like a feeling that she's almost like my little sister. Mary and Julie, too. I'd like to take them both under my wing a while - not that there's much to put under my wing, but you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But also like you've been replaced?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was like that; but then I can start to think logically with my brother now because - you know that black-haired fellow in the dream? I don't know if that's Ed or not. That might have been Andy. Because we were talking about that-my stepbrother and I-that like I really - first I had a crush on him. But really what I was looking for was a father. And he was too young to handle it. He was like about 18 or something-whatever, you know. I mean, what's an 18-year-old fellow going to do with a girl who - he thinks she's got a crush on him; and really, it's - she's looking for a father or a big, strong image-and Andy was strong. </p>

<p>But the more I thought about it, the more I was thinking, "Sure, I wouldn't doubt it-that that's the one I always thought of." Because again, I pushed him out of my mind consciously. Consciously, he wasn't there. Like I didn't even - I remember because people said things. You know, like "Oh you always used to go goo-goo eyes over him." And I can't remember it. You know, I said, "I didn't - yeah, I kind of liked him and I thought he was cute." And that's all I can remember. You know, and it's like - again, I was pushing away because I felt rejected by Andy, because he didn't like me. [8:52]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he was pretty important to you than someone -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah-more important than I realized. And everybody was telling me, and I'm going, "What do you mean?" I just kind of looked like, "I can't remember that." And I can remember I was never real close to Jamie-that I remember. At least I don't think I was. But I don't know-maybe I was, and I didn't realize it either. But I do remember it did hurt. It was like a - it did hurt quite a bit from the thing that when he said something to me, too, about my mom - my foster mom, and my father did it. This was all like in the course of, you know, like maybe a month or two. Because we started really getting into bad relationships. </p>

<p>But Jodie said, too, like some type of - we were working for Christmas and New Year's. Oh I know why I was like this. I didn't really want to. I didn't put my heart into it. I did it-you know, like I do things on the last minute and that. Because she's got all her friends over. I don't have a lot of friends. And she shares her friends to such-and-such a degree. But things like - she said, "Well I'm going to invite certain people from judo to the - " Let's see-what was she going to say? Oh, "to our New Year's party." I said, "Okay, fine." </p>

<p>Okay, Tim I kind of liked-he was the youngest one. He was younger than I was, but I kind of liked him. She was going to fix him up with this gorgeous girl who was in our class-and now she's modeling and everything. She's really beautiful. Because he said he wanted to meet a blonde. So I said, "Well, he's going to take one look at this girl, boy, and forget it." And then the other one was this fellow who was kind of playing up to me, and I knew it because I'm not that dumb. </p>

<p>And I liked Tye, too. Boy, I was playing the little mother the last week-unbelievable. Tye comes up and says - he starts to kiss me and all this, and he was drunk. And I said, "Tye, come off it." You know? And then I said to him, I said, "I'm a very wise girl." Because I knew he liked my girlfriend Eliza. And one thing I didn't need was a guy I used to like - I used to have a crush on, then he starts playing up to me because he's trying to get my girlfriend jealous and all this bull. But anyway, he got drunk and he got sick. </p>

<p>So I was, you know, like helping cleaning him up and I was saying - well first, I was kind of afraid of him, because this guy's a fourth degree black belt. And I thought if I woke him up the wrong way and he slugged me, I'd go right through the window-I'd go through the roof. So I said - what did I say to him. Oh you know, "Easy, Tye." So Ed, this other fellow from the gym, said, "I thought that was so nice because you were so gentle with him." </p>

<p>And then he said something about, "Some day I'm going to have to tell you about my high school sweetheart." Well I knew he liked Jodie. You know? So here I am-I'm stuck with all these guys that - because they can't get to her, because she's got like lots of people around her a lot of times. And maybe one that she's with, and all the rest of them like her. You know? So here you're sitting. You're there, but you're not there. Because like-who knows and who cares? You know? [11:42]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you're sort of left out, and they have all the guys, really.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true. And especially - I don't mind it so much having all the guys; but when it's the guys I like-like Tye and Tim. I like both - well, you know, not so much - Tye I really liked for a while. But it's just the idea that - I don't even mind it so much if they have them. But why don't they just leave the rest of the fellows alone and stick with the ones that like them? And then it would give me a chance with somebody who didn't really care about them or who they danced with or whatever. </p>

<p>But I don't dig the idea - I shouldn't even say "dance with." I don't mind if they dance with me, but I just don't like the idea of somebody playing up to me to make somebody else jealous. To me, that makes me sick. Because first of all - all right, I'll do it a certain extent. If I'm with a fellow I like, I may goof around with somebody else, partly - maybe mostly because when he might be doing it with a girl first, and then I'll - or I'll just talk to somebody. </p>

<p>But like I wouldn't think of going up to a fellow and kissing him so that I would get my boyfriend jealous. I mean, that would be ridiculous. But this fellow was doing this with me. I wasn't really mad at Eliza; I was mad at him. You know, so it was like, "Forget you, Charlie. I don't need that type of thing."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it's dishonest and you don't want to be involved in it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's part of it, yeah. And part of it is I don't like to be the object of it. Because it's like saying like - like it could be anybody, you know? It wouldn't make any difference who it was. But if he thought she was cute or she was something, or that she was a friend of this other girl and it might make her jealous. You know like, you sit there and think, "Well geez, I'm not an object. I don't have to take that kind of stuff." </p>

<p>So I was really mad at him. So I just kind of pushed him away. But I don't know. And now I got to the point where I thought he was so sharp, too-and now I don't think he's so sharp anymore, so it doesn't bother me so much. You know, I don't really care if he likes me or not.</p>

<p>But Jamie, I would like it if he liked me. I really would. Because I really think he's sharp. And he's just always safe and (^ at 13:37) - he's good looking, he's nice, he's sweet, he's funny, he's clever, he's - you know, he's just like the type of fellow that I really like. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're really looking for guys, and sort of feeling good about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am. (chuckles) I may even be looking for a lover; I need something. But I don't know. Well partly is I don't know how to handle a fellow yet. I know that because I'm still kind of wishy-washy, and I don't know where I'm going or what I am. But it's just like I do need - I do need a man. I guess I - maybe that's why I say, "I probably should get married some day." It's just the type of feeling that I like. I guess it's the security. </p>

<p>Maybe it's because of my younger life where I was just thrown around here and there. And I'm afraid - like when I got older especially - I'd have to get married before I was 30 years old. Because when I got a little bit older than that, it would be harder to find a fellow. And I don't think I could go through like without a fellow. I thought I could; but I don't think I can now-without somebody to be there and somebody to be special. You know? [14:41] </p>

<p>Because I am the type of person that likes love from one special person and the type of person that likes to give love to some special person. And it's got to be like a special relationship. And a lot of times when you just have girlfriend/boyfriend relationships, they're not that - sometimes they might be even more serious and they might last longer, but a lot of times they don't. And it's - partly it's because it's so easy to just turn around and walk out. </p>

<p>You have a fight and you say, "Oh the hell with you," and walk out, and that's it. But you can't do that when you're married, and you feel like you have to make a go of it. That's almost like I would trap a man. Like if we weren't happy I'd keep him there anyway just to keep my security. But like if we just had a fight or something and I thought that there was something there yet for both of us, and he did too, that we could make it go. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like some kind of commitment to make things work out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Well this is one of the reasons I would [go out with him] (ph) a long time before I ever married him. Like Jamie - I don't know. I would still not get serious with him unless I had gone with him for a couple of years. First of all, I'm too young. You know? And he's not sure what he wants to do right now. He's in sort of a turmoil. So - like it wouldn't be any good if we got - you know, like just one of these whirlwind (ph) things, like we both fell in love and all of this. And besides, he's back in Alabama teaching now anyway.</p>

<p>But I don't know. I think there was just something there Sunday night, and I could feel it. I don't know if he returned-and he may have. He kind of - I kind of felt like - you know, sometimes you can just look at somebody and say something and they say something back, and you can kind of feel the vibrations going back and forth. And when I said goodbye to him - because I said goodbye-and Andy kind of pushed in. I just noticed that-that Andy is kind of - he's kind of buoyant, and that's one of the reasons why he probably gets a little further than Jamie did. Because if Jamie hadn't had a couple of drinks, he probably wouldn't have been so out of himself as he was.</p>

<p>But anyway, Andy - and not really pushed in front of Jamie, but he sort of like came right up to me; where Jamie just stood there. You know, and he's like, "Goodbye," you know and all this-and, "Be good." And I said, "You just wait-another 16 lessons in aerobics." Yeah, we went back and forth. And then I said, "Goodbye Jamie." And he looked at me and he was just kind of - his eyes started twinkling. You know how that happens sometimes? And he says, "Bye-bye." </p>

<p>And then we walked out and he went to heat up his car or something, and he came by and he knocked on the window when he went back in - on the car when he went back in. And there was just - I think there was just something there-like whether it's love or whether it's a big brother - what it is that I'm looking for, I don't know. But I think whatever it is, I found something in Jamie; and I'd like to pursue it-if and when he ever comes back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a lot of warm feeling there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there is. There's a very warm feeling for him, and I don't know - I'm just kind of mixed up right now what feeling it is. I don't whether it's like I like him as a boyfriend or I don't know whether it's - like he's become the type of brother that I always wanted to have, you know? He's everything that I wanted to have as a big brother-except he's got an inferiority complex. (chuckles) [17:43]</p>

<p>But like Andy-no, not any more. At one time, he was something that I really got like, "Wow," but not any more. And - I don't know. But that was one of the things that I found out over the weekend, and it was so great. When I came home, I had to tell Jodie all about it. I said, "Boy, what fun we had." And everybody was bringing out the instruments and we were singing, and really just having a good time. I felt a little bit bad that more - it was really funny-it was more for her than it was for me. I was really shocked at myself. Hey (ph) I like that kid. Because Gertrude-that was the girl who threw the party, and she was my stepsister-they were opening presents - a lot of the kids. </p>

<p>And a few of the adults didn't get any. I didn't get one-and I didn't expect to because like they didn't know I was coming out until two days before. And I don't expect them to run out and get me something-they haven't seen me in years. I brought her a bottle of wine, and she was, "Oh gee, thanks." And I didn't realize why she said that; but I guess it was because she had nothing for me and she felt funny. So everybody was opening things, and there was two packages under the tree. And somebody had to say, "Who are they for?" And she said, "One is for Madelaine," who was the girl who used to go with Jamie, "and the other one is for Ed's friend." And she kind of hesitated. And it was like this thing in the room like, you know, everybody said, "Oh geez." </p>

<p>[It was like] (ph) something was said wrong and they were expecting something to happen-and you could just feel it, you know? And it was so funny, because then I was trying to - I felt really good because then I was trying to tell these - trying to bring these people so that [they to] (ph) overlook that comment or that they didn't take it like I would get all hurt-because I didn't feel all hurt. You know, because I was there, and to me - you know, the first thing I thought was, "Oh gee, it would have been nice to get a present." </p>

<p>And what [ma said] kind of helped, too, because she said, "Oh you should have brought your present along here," because she gave me something little. She gave me five dollars in a little box. She said, "Are you going to open your present here?" which was cute. But like mostly the feeling that was there was in trying to bring these people up so that they wouldn't feel like that. Because you could just feel it - it was so funny. The whole room went, "Oh Jesus, I wonder what she's going to think or what is she going to do?" It was really funny. </p>

<p>And then like another time, too, we were at the table. Andy said something about - he called me "orphan." You know? And at one time, boy, if somebody called me that, I would have felt so hurt. Oh God. So I just looked at him and I said, "Look, I got three mothers and two fathers-try to beat that (ph)." And he just went, "Well, I guess I can't do that." So - and Jamie-I could feel Jamie - you know, like, "Oh Jesus Andy, don't say that." That kind of made me feel good, too, because it was like Jamie feeling for me, which kind of - I could feel it. You know how sometimes you can just - it was just the way he kind of moved, like, "Oh Lord-Andy, you shouldn't have said that." And (overlapping voices) when it came back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were feeling pretty good about yourself? [20:39]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was feeling pretty good about myself and the way - just the people there, and I felt good with the family that I was with. And you know - maybe it was with me, too. I felt kind of good with myself; I guess I did. Because like some things that I could feel - I really didn't feel a hurt, you know - welling up. I mean, I felt maybe - how can I say it? Maybe just almost like a beginning of a feeling. </p>

<p>But rather than exploiting that type of a feeling, I came back with either something funny - and I really felt it. I mean, like I really felt - or I replaced it like with something else. Like when I said that back to Andy, I really meant it. You know, "I got two fathers and three mothers." And all of them - like both the stepmothers want me to live with them now; and they've asked me already. And again, my stepmother said, "Oh yeah," you know? He didn't ask me again this time; but he just said, "Yeah, there was a secretarial job over - this fellow said he would have paid anything for a secretary about a month or two ago." And I'm going, "Hmm." </p>

<p>In other words, they want me to move up there and then take the job, you know? But you need a car and everything else - and I would never move back into the family-not because I don't love them; because I'm getting to the point where I really do love them. But it's funny because I just feel like that would be a regression, because now I'm coming out on my own, and I'm with a roommate. And I'm going out on my own finally. And now this is like a make-or-break because this [is the thing] (ph) that we need. And I don't have any excuses for anybody else's actions or anything else, but mine. </p>

<p>And so like I would never do that, because that would be like, again, falling back on somebody else. But it's really nice to know that you've got people that really care about you. And like for a long time I didn't feel like anybody did. Like - so I don't have a lot of friends. I've got two girlfriends that are real close. But I've got two stepfamilies, and they both care about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's true now, and you can carry that with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I can feel it now. You know, like I think, partly, it's because part of the things that have come out already - that I have felt a lot of times, because of what people said, I'd feel rejected. But you know, like - my foster mother brought this out too-that she said she wished she had taken some psychology-child psychology when she was younger, because that would have helped us. And it would have helped her with her own kids. Like she told me one of her boys took - I think [like a] (ph) therapy. He went to a psychologist before he got married because he had hang-ups on marriage. </p>

<p>And I just thought to myself, "Well you know like, look what she tried to do. She did the best she could do under the circumstances." You know like she had no education in that. And she didn't know at the time - she really didn't. Because in those day, like until like the last ten years or so, they really haven't come out with a lot of things like Spock and that - to help the mothers out, or even to take psychology courses-child psychology courses. [23:41]</p>

<p>So she didn't know. There wasn't anything she could do. She couldn't crawl inside my mind. In fact, nobody really can unless - you know like, you know there's a problem and they know there's a problem, and you can try to work it out. But you know, like then, I thought I was normal. I was a normal little kid-but I wasn't. And there was lots of things that were wrong, and - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But she couldn't have helped you (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: She couldn't help it. You know? It's not that she didn't want to; because she said she cried so hard when I left. And I believed her, because I know she did. When I saw her for the first time in six years, we both started crying. And it was so pretty. (inaudible at 24:22) And then I didn't know if I could call her "Mother" or not; so I called her "Mrs. Foley". And she - and I said, "Mom-can I call you Mom? Dad, can I call you Dad?" "Yeah," they said right away. So that was - it was really nice. But I think, too - you know, I think I really got a lot more fun (ph) because Ed wasn't there, too. I got to admit it because of our attitude towards each other. We don't feel as if we're brother and sister any more. </p>

<p>And I'm getting to the point where I'm getting over him. It's hard, but I'm getting over him as a brother. Because I have to admit that he doesn't love me. And it's very hard to admit that he doesn't love me. Even though Jodie says, "I think you're wrong." And I said, "No, I don't think I'm wrong. Because if he cared, he would be doing more things. He would be seeing me more often, he would be - " He just wanted (ph) to initiate something; and I try to initiate. </p>

<p>You know, I've called him a few times and things like this. And we always end up either in a fight or - I don't know. I just - there's just something there. Maybe it's just he and I now-that we can't - maybe eventually we'll be able to work something out as a brother-sister relationship. But if not, then I just have to get to the point to admit it. You know, like most people that have a brother or a sister, they're pretty close; but some people aren't. And so we're just the type that - you know like I guess there will just never be something there between us. So that's one thing that I think (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just not going to work.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not going to work. First of all, our minds are so different. Maybe that's partly it; but really, that doesn't have that much to do with it, I guess. Because there's a lot of people that are in different fields and that, and they still care about each other. But I think part of it is because I've been replaced-that he loves Mary. And he loves Mary, and he once probably loved me. And he's taken that love and he's given it to someone else. </p>

<p>So if there's no room left for me to be loved as a sister, so then there's no room left. You know, like what can you do? He's got only enough love for one sister. And he's replaced the one sister he had with another sister. So what do you do? You know? You can't really say - because like I've done that, too, now, practically. And I think I did it when I was at Foley's. I think I did it with Andy. I used to think of Andy as God walking on earth, you know? [26:36]</p>

<p>And I don't know. I really don't know whether it's all that bad anymore. I've always looked for somebody to lean on. And I feel now like I can't wait till Jodie and Eliza go away. Because then I won't have somebody to lean on. In fact, right now I just started to cut it off. Like I don't hardly talk to Jodie about my problems and that anymore-because I figure that I've got to work them out. Now she can tell me some things; but then sometimes I just rely on what she says. And then it's not me thinking-it's not me working it out; it's somebody else telling me what they think should be done. And that's not going to help me any.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you know what to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I've got to sit down with myself and figure out things. Now I like the idea that she's there if I start crying or something-that she would be there to console me. But otherwise, like I don't want to sit down and talk things like that out with her-like not my own problems. Because she doesn't know. And there's no way that she can give me advice on me-because she's not me. You know, she says, "Well the reason why we got to be such good friends is that," well she said that we were so much alike. But I was like, you know, like when she was younger and that. But we were so much alike before we took therapy. </p>

<p>And I don't know-I think part of the time I listen too much to her. And this is one of the reasons, I think, that I ended up mimicking her and that and things like this. Because partly I said, "Well I am quite a bit like her, right? And everybody likes her. So let's mimic her and then I'll be completely like her, and then everybody will like me like everybody likes her." But it's very hard for me to come to the conclusion that I am me-but what am I? And get away from this bit. So I'm trying to do a little more reading now. </p>

<p>I've got myself on this - my New Year's resolution-at least two books a week. And get myself going and take a speed-reading course and then start to college-which might help me. I don't know-I hope it will. It will help me at least in the direction like of discipline - like well that's true. Because Jim said that, too. I mean, Jodie said, "Well probably the biggest reason he wants you to go to college is discipline and reading," which did make sense. Because a lot of the things they teach you - and like the professors and that are so darned old hat anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're left with if you're not her then, what are you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's right. Who am I? What am I? Where am I going? It's that type of thing that I still don't know. And it's - I don't know what's going to wake me up. I don't know whether it's - you know, like when I finish with therapy that I'll figure out what's wrong, or whether I'll have to get through college first or whether - you know like whatever. And decide just I want to do with my life. [29:34]</p>

<p>Because otherwise, it's just like - you know I thought last night - I was typing envelopes. And I said -I thought I heard somebody. I thought I heard like a man's voice. And I said to myself, "What would I do if that was somebody - you know like a big - some kind of a rapist or a robber or something?" Or if they were just coming in to rob and they saw me sitting there, what would they do? They would probably kill me. And I said to myself, "Well who the hell cares?" </p>

<p>And then I thought to myself, "Boy, this must be sick because you don't even care if somebody kills you or not." Because I said to myself - I said - the only I thought of was, "Well then I don't have to go through New Year's Eve night." You know? Because that's going to be a (inaudible at 30:08) and a half. But I figured out what I can do for that. Because I said to myself, "Look, all you're thinking about is who's going to be there for you. Is there going to be anybody there for you? Are you going to have any of your friends that are going to pay any attention to you? Or are they going to be your friends or are they going to be Jodie friends that are just being nice to you because you're her roommate or whatever?" </p>

<p>And then I said, "Who in the hell cares if they care about you or not?" First of all, they're her friends. Like I do have a couple of friends. I may invite one of my friends and her boyfriend over. I don't know if she can make it. But I said to myself, "Well who in the heck cares? What you should be doing is making sure you're a hostess-make sure everybody has fun. If they have fun, you'll probably have fun, too. If you don't have fun, at least they're having fun. Who in the heck cares? It's only one night."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's like putting yourself into it, instead of depending on them to -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right-to bring me in. Because I've always done that. I've always sat back and said, "Well what am I going to do now if somebody doesn't like me? Or what am I going to do now if I don't have fun?" And I said to myself, "Hell, you're doing it again." Because like I went to that all-Spanish party with my girlfriend. And I knew - see, it was supposed to have been given by her and another girl. </p>

<p>And it was supposed to be like all young people. And all of them spoke English, and some of them - I guess she said there might even be some Americans there, but mostly like from Spanish. Then it turns out that I guess that party didn't come about. And she told me - I told her I'd go to the party like three days before the party. And she had asked me like a week before the party.</p>

<p>And here it turns out that it's going to be at her aunt's house, and it's going to be a family-type thing. And I knew when I walked in the door that they had had a fight or something because of the way she was being kind of cold towards me. And she wouldn't talk to me hardly all night. But I had a ball. Because like her cousin's friend, who didn't speak a word of English - we had a ball. He was teaching me to dance, and I was drinking and I was eating all the hot foods and everything. </p>

<p>And I ended up having fun because I went there with the idea of partially having fun and partially just being fun. You know like eating, drinking-whatever you - whoever you met or whatever - talked to them - get interested in them and start forgetting about yourself. And I had fun. I could really say - I can look back at that party and say it was a fun party. Probably one of the most fun I had.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because you could get out of yourself. [32:23]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And not think about myself. Like "What happens if they don't like me?" Or "What am I going to do if they start speaking Spanish?" Because I don't speak Spanish. I didn't care. They started speaking Spanish, and once in a while they'd tell a joke in English so that I would catch it if it was a good joke. Otherwise I'd just be looking now (ph), watching their reactions and dancing and drinking, and I had a ball.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then it could work. They could have fun and you could have fun-both.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But the only way I can really have fun is when I get out of myself and figure out not - not who's there for me, but what I can do for them. You know like - who's ever there-it doesn't make any difference. And make them comfortable and really be - see this is going to be a problem, partly because I'd found out that Emma was coming, and she is so gorgeous. And she - Jodie says, too, "All she has to do is walk into a room and every fellow in the room falls all over her." She's just that type. </p>

<p>There are some girls that just have that. They walk in and everybody goes, "Ah." I mean, I thought maybe you could acquire it, but she said, "I doubt it, because she's been like that ever since - " She was a tomboy and everything with girls. If you'd see her with - you'd say, "Oh she's such a tomboy." But the fellows even then dug her. So it wasn't just that. She's just got something about her that just attracts men. So I figured, "Well now this is going to be a problem." </p>

<p>But I just have to overcome it. That's all. I just have to take her as a person-because she is a delightful person. She's a nice person. And just take her as somebody who's there and who's adding to the party. And she's a lot of fun and she's a nice girl. And that's it. And then don't worry if every guy in the room falls all over her, because who cares? </p>

<p>First of all, I don't have a boyfriend in the room. I think if I did, it would be a different story. You know, like if I had somebody who was really mine that was there, I probably would feel like, "Oh gosh," you know? "We're not even staying for my party. We're leaving." But this way, I think the thing is that that's the only way to feel when you're just with a group of people. And the one there that's special for you. Because even Jodie says that she gets jealous when she's got a boyfriend around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like why hang onto anybody when it doesn't make any difference anyway?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well see, because to me it was like a big - almost like an ego thing. I don't know. Maybe it was just a real insecurity-that I felt like I had to have - every place I went, I had to have somebody who really cared about me-whether I cared about them or not. It wasn't important. But that there was somebody there that had to like me or care about me. And now I figure that's so stupid because everybody can't care about you and you can't care about everybody else. </p>

<p>You know, as far as like an individual goes. All right, so maybe you are a little bit possessive of somebody that you really about. But I don't think that's terrible. I don't think that's really sick. I mean I don't think there's anything really (inaudible at 35:06) about that-just really caring about somebody and really wanting them to spend more time with you than other people, and pay more attention to you than other people. And you the same for them, of course. [35:17]</p>

<p>But I mean like just with every person-that's stupid. That doesn't make any sense. Or just to say, "Now I have to meet somebody special that night." That's dumb. It's just like - like I said-if you're making sure they're having fun, it ends up that you have fun, too, whether the person likes you as a special person or not. They might like you in the circumstances. In other words, if they don't, they don't-that's tough. </p>

<p>But I mean - you know like as long as you're making them happy. Because you're making them happy, they kind of like you as being that-you know, this happiness - whatever you want to call it - booster. And I feel like that. Now there's a lot of people that I can say that are nice-they're acquaintances-and that I can do things for. And then they reciprocate, too, you know? And then they're nice, too. And then you just have fun-like you both have fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you just make things happen right now instead of grasping and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, right. It's something that's got to be permanent. And it's really a lot more fun that way. You know like, so you don't get any lasting relationships out of it-so what? Who needs it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you're saying that the lasting relationship would not come from the grasping either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think they would. Because that's when I've lost a lot of people. Not a lot-but like a lot of times, one of us or the other will get very possessive, but not both. Like if both of you really care a lot about each other, I think it's natural to be a little bit possessive. And I'm not saying that you couldn't talk to someone or even walk away and talk to somebody. But I'd say like things like - well like you would want them with you the majority of the night, or at least half the night if you went out someplace. </p>

<p>And you would want them - let's see-well unless of course you're married. Because if you're married, then I think it's a little different. I think then you should spend the whole night away from each other so that you have something to talk about when you go home. But I mean, just if you're dating, then spend like half the night or something with [even then] (ph). Then half the night just (inaudible at 37:22) around the rest of the people. </p>

<p>But if you don't have a relationship going already, that's stupid. You know, it's stupid when like one person at a party comes up and sits there and talks to you all night. To me, I don't think that's - I think it's dumb because you're missing a lot that you - you could be talking to other people and getting to know them. If you spend all the night with one person, then how are you supposed to meet everybody else and get to know them?</p>

<p>So this is why - this happens to me sometimes too with fellows. I went with this fellow - oh God for our Christmas party. Talk about latching on to you-unbelievable. You go to talk so somebody and all of a sudden you feel this guy come up and put his arm around you. "Get away! You know, you're just a friend, first of all." And you've both had this agreement. "We're going to go into the party; I'll dance probably the first dance with you." And he said, "Fine, and I'll do the same with you." "And then we're going to dance with other people; and we'll go home together. And that's it. We'll sit and eat together and then we'll go out and we'll disperse among the crowd, and everybody will dance with everybody else." Ha, ha, ha. [38:21]</p>

<p>Then I realized - I think that's probably why-because he helped me realize how I was with somebody. You know like I said, boy, somebody would dance with a person twice in a row - and even if she was a best friend or anything-"You don't like me." You know? "Because I was with him tonight."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aha. So then when you were getting the other end of it -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then you realize, "Oh boy-was that bad news." So this is part of the reason that woke me up in that area-not to grasp onto somebody and just hold onto him and say, "This is mine. This is mine. You can't have it." Because it's sickening. It's like you're in jail. [Like you're around] (ph) a warden there. And it's bad. I really don't like it at all. And so I guess I realized that I had done it; and so now I stopped doing it. Or at least, you know - it's hard to do because emotionally you kind of do get attracted to somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And then you want to hang on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It makes you want - you sort of want to grasp on - but you know you can't, so - . But like with Jamie, I didn't feel like I wanted to grasp onto him. But like we were sitting around the piano. I wished he would have edged over a little bit. And he didn't. My step brother-in-law is sitting there, and we finished a song. And it was - oh, this is funny. So Mary is trying to match me up with every fellow in the place-married or unmarried. </p>

<p>So we were sitting at the table and I was next to Jamie and then Andy was next. And so she turned around and she was like, "Hey, you two make a pretty good couple," meaning me and Jamie. And I said - I looked at her and I said, "They do?" You know? (inaudible at 39:54) Andy and Jamie, and they went, "Oh." They were ready to kill me before we left the table.</p>

<p>But then towards the end of the night, Ed and I sang like the ending of a song. You know it was like, "How dry I am, how dry I am." And we both, you know, went together. And she turned around and she said, "Oh, watch the way those two look at each other." And I thought, "Oh boy." Because Gertrude's a little bit insecure. And I could tell it because I said - I didn't know. She said she was at the school and she was doing something at the school. And I said - I thought before she hadn't been to college, but I thought well maybe she had been to college since I've known her and gone at night or something. And I said, "Oh do you teach?" And she said, "No!" And I said, "Oh boy." I didn't mean it that way. You know like, because her husband's like a Ph.D. or something, and I guess she's got like an inferiority complex in that area.</p>

<p>And so she said, "No, I'm a secretary." And I went, "Oh that sounds very interesting." You know, I had to sort of cover it up and hope that she wouldn't know - and Jesus (ph). And then Mary has to say this, and she's playing piano and I'm standing like two feet in back of her. She couldn't have missed it. And I was ready to hit her and go (inaudible at 41:05).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you said the wrong thing or something there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there I said the wrong thing. And the other place, Mary said the wrong thing. Inadvertent - I mean, she didn't mean it. She's like 14 and she's trying to match everybody up with everybody else. And since I'm the only single girl in the room, so she's got me with Jamie, she's got me with Ed. I'm surprised she didn't put me with Andy, too. [41:26]</p>

<p>But you know, when she said that, [oh the way] (ph) those two look at each other and I thought, "Oh! I'm going to get killed before I leave this house." But I'm really kind of happy, though, because at one time I wouldn't have picked that up, and I wouldn't have been able to come back with something that kind of salved somebody else's feeling. It would have just gone right over my head. And I would either have continued on and maybe somebody would have been hurt - or I would have been hurt in the end. Or somebody - or both of us would have gotten to the point where we just didn't even want to talk to each other.</p>

<p>But I'm beginning to be able to pick up other people's - you know like vibrations and their - not really even a vibration; it's just the tone of their voice and things like this-how they say things. And it's really funny because like I said, at one time I would not pick it up-not at all. Like I picked up with these fellows right away. At one time I would have thought, "Gee, Tye really likes me: I thought he liked Eliza." I would have really thought that. And then I would have felt very hurt later on in the evening when he told her he loved her and he was in there. </p>

<p>She got sick so she was laying in the bedroom and he was standing at the door waiting for her. He was half sick himself. It was so cute. Because I went up to him and I said, "Tye are you all right?" And he was, "I love her so much," or something like this. And he went to cry on my shoulder. Here's this great big guy-fourth degree black belt in judo, right? And he's crying on my shoulder because this itty bitty little girlfriend of mine is (inaudible at 42:54). It was so funny. He was bombed, though.</p>

<p>And so I said - you know, I got him a (inaudible at 43:00), "Japanese men strong-no cry over women." And he went - you know, "(inaudible) Go away. I am fine." It was so funny, though, because he was really just like a little kid. (inaudible at 43:17). Oh cripe. But it was really funny that I can pick up things like this now in people. And I'm kind of happy about it because I need that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that makes you (inaudible) more protected.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, partly protected from me. I admit it-it's partly a protection for me. But it's partly because I used to hurt people and turn people away, and never realized it. You know, I'd come out with these stupid things, and people would take it wrong; and I'd just keep going, you know? I never realized that what I was doing was hurting them. Because they had - you know, I was feeding an insecurity of theirs. And it was their reaction. Like you could say it to some people - like you can joke with some people in a certain area and they'll laugh. </p>

<p>Like people can joke with me. It's very funny-they can tell me I'm fat and I'll laugh. But if they tell me I have fat or ugly legs, I won't laugh because I got about those since I've been a child-that I got ugly legs. And like people have told me, even not if they're heavy in the thigh area-people are still saying - like fellows are saying, "Oh you've got such nice-looking legs," and all this baloney. And I don't believe them. I feel like saying, "I don't think they're so nice-looking. I think they're fat and I don't like them." You know? [44:26]</p>

<p>I guess it's just - see this is what I'm saying. This is a complex that I have-and that I realize now that other people have complexes. And sometimes I feed them - and I know how it feels. But at one time I couldn't pick that up. And a lot of people don't pick it up when I come back with something. But people who are very perceptive do, and then they either change the subject or they say they were kidding or they do whatever-you know, to salve it so that it's not hurting anymore.</p>

<p>But it's so funny that - I really felt good that I could pick that up. And when I picked it up I was really surprised, though, when I picked it up with Jamie. Because I never realized it. That went right over my head for a long time. But then when I think back, I think, "Yeah. Why was - he was always the quiet one and he never really came out of himself." Andy always took the focus of attention and everything. And I said, "Well sure-he was probably a little bit jealous of his brother-ever since he's been a child." Because - you know like Andy's always had everybody falling all over him. [45:22]</p>

<p>So it's like when you start being able to see other people and you can see their hurts and their problems. It's not so - first of all, it's not so hard to take your own-and you don't think that you're the only one in the world that's hurting. You can see that other people hurt, too. And you don't - well see, part of the reason is because I tend to dwell on it and then I get very sad and very depressed and all this other bull. And you know like-who needs it? Like what good are you to other people, especially when you're sitting there and mooning about your own problems. And then, first of all, it doesn't help them to sit there and moon about them and say, "Oh gee, I wish I was better, or I wish I was this or I wish I was that." The only thing that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're still hurting-and you don't want to lose that, but it helps to get out of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well if I don't hurt, I think I'd become hard again. And I don't want to become hard again. Like I've been that route, and I don't like it. I tried to be that way. I tried to regress to that with Jodie, like I said. "I don't care what she says," you know? "I don't care any more about her." And like I was even hurt today - yesterday. I got a card from her, and it said - but see, what happened is I realized - because I saw another card that had the same verse on it. But this was just a verse-and that it was printed up like this for all the cards. And that same card went to all of her friends. But it said, "Have a merry Christmas and a happy, peaceful new year. Jodie Ammons". I mean, not "Love, Jodie," or you know, anything like this. "Jodie Ammons" I said, "Oh thanks." You know? Like what good is that going to do? You know, like with a good friend. </p>

<p>Like what I put on mine - I just put a little card on hers and I said, "To the bestest friend I ever had," and put that in quotes, you know? And I put it funny, but it got the point across-the message across how I felt about her - that she was my best friend and I really cared. And I put, "Love, Jane." (coughing) Pardon me. But you know, like the thing you get back like, "Merry Christmas and a happy, peaceful new year." But I noticed that - I checked this other card that I saw. I thought it was mine-that's the only reason I read it. Because it was in the front room, and I said, "Oh I must have put it in here." </p>

<p>And I opened the card and it says the same thing that mine did-so that must be mine. So I went to bring it in the other room and I saw mine laying on the table - and I had left it on the table. But she had underlined, "peaceful," but that was kind of cute. Or was it "happy"? No, she underlined "happy." Because she knows how unhappy I was myself and like sometimes I can really be muggy (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like you wanted to be special some (inaudible at 47:52) to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because like - well first of all, she said one time while she was high - but still, even when you're drunk. I don't say things that I don't mean when I'm drunk. And usually I've heard that people - a lot of times the real feeling will come out when they're drunk. So one time she had a friend over and just out of the clear blue she says, "And this is my best friend." And you know, I thought, "Wow. I didn't think I was your best friend. I thought you were best friends with Eliza." [48:20]</p>

<p>And then she came out later on and said, "Things don't always - they're not always the way they appear to be." And see she goes out with Eliza because Eliza can drink more than I can, and Eliza can handle herself a little bit better with men. Partly because she's been going out since she's 15 years old and 14 years old-and she's been going to real nice places. And she's been all up and down Zan Street when she was 16 and 17. You know? I've never done this. I was very protected, and I didn't learn how to handle myself with men. Because Jodie says, "You're full of baloney that you don't think men are attracted to you-they are." But a lot of times, after they start talking to you, I get all flustered or I try to impress them and I put on a big phony that's not me. Or I try to act like her when I'm around fellows. And then again, it's not me. And it doesn't - you know? Like there was one time, I had about four or five boyfriends at the same time - that I was dating at the same time. </p>

<p>So I can't really the fellows don't like me; it's just that like, once they get to know me - I don't know. Partly maybe it was because when they get to know me it is me, because I like come off that bulls**it. But like when they first meet me, I'm somebody else or I'm something else. I put on this big - you know, I make sure that my charm school shows. Oh, this is bull. That - I keep trying to tell myself it's not that important-but like what is? You know, like what can I give them? </p>

<p>I know what I can do if I act like her - I can-you know. And it's bad. But it's stupid, too. It's - I say to myself it's stupid because I know that like the girls like me. Because if they didn't, they wouldn't be around. Why would they stick around? Why would somebody like Jodie, who's got friends all over the world - she's got - why would she stick around? Why would she sit down and talk to me and spend that time with me if she didn't think there was something there?</p>

<p>And I kept thinking, "Well, maybe there is; but what is it and where is it? You know, it's hiding someplace-let's get it out. Find out what's there and what's the basic of this "me" that I can - you know (inaudible at 50:13). I want to do something-something for people. I don't know, maybe I'll join the Peace Corps for a year. I was thinking of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't you want to know what you have to give there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I really don't know what there is that's really special that I can give.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's tangled up with somehow wanting people to like you or being afraid they don't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Partly-fellows especially. You know like - well of course, I never really had a good friend, either-a real good girlfriend before Jodie. Eliza not so much. And yet sometimes I sit there and compare myself with her and I say, "She says I'm inconsiderate because I got her make-up wet or something." I didn't move her make-up a couple of times. </p>

<p>And it was closed and I really thought that because it was closed in a plastic case - I thought, "Well it's not going to get inside," but it did. I was washing my face and a couple of drops hit it and kind of went inside. So she said I was inconsiderate. But I'm thinking of things like, "Me inconsiderate? Yolanda says she's going to be someplace, she's not there. She hasn't come to school She's supposed to be taking the next class for Jodie and she hasn't come."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And why does she have to tell you that you're inconsiderate? [51:14] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And she never tells Eliza things like that - I don't think anyway. Because I never heard her. And Eliza gets sick over at our house all over the place, and Jodie's sitting there taking care of her. And the next time she's inviting her again and things like this. And I says, "Well if were to do that, she'd be telling me to slow down on the drinking." And I only had like five Colt 45's, and I wasn't even that high. </p>

<p>I was dancing kind of wild-I was just doing the football. And she does the football. Of course, when she does it it's all right; but when I do it, it's not right, see? She tells me to slow down on my drinking. So I did. I stopped drinking-that was it. I didn't drink any more the rest of the night. And you know, like Eliza gets sick all over the place. So I said to myself -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She doesn't trust (ph) you right or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's almost like she says I'm inconsiderate, and she gets mad at me. It's almost like she's pushing me away. When I got that card I thought, "Jesus, maybe she doesn't even like me anymore." But that kind of - I mean, that the type of a greeting you'd give to an acquaintance you don't know very well. You know? (inaudible at 52 09) your best friend, you're going to write this down? Just your name underneath a "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year"?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're really not sure you can count on her. And then a Christmas card like that just changes everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't put quite that much importance on it, but see like we've been - we haven't talked a great deal in the last few days. Probably it's because like I feel inferior; and partly it's because I know I'm going to have anybody there at the New Year's Eve party. And it's (inaudible at 52:38); it really is. Like all right-I'll invite Charlotte. I was thinking of inviting another girl I knew from like our old neighborhood. She's very pretty and she's about 24 or 25. And she would fit in, I think, with the crowd that she's having-that Jodie's having over. </p>

<p>However, she also knows my friend Jim very well. And somehow I don't want Jim there-I don't know why. I don't know what I'm afraid of, or whether it's just because I feel like I know he wouldn't want to be in that big of a group of people he didn't know. And he was all right - he stayed over at our house for a while for about two hours. And a friend of my girlfriend's, Dennis, came over. And like this guy is so smart. He is really one of the smartest guys I've ever met - and she says he's one of the smartest guys she knows. But he's nice. He's not the pseudo-intellectual; because he's a real intellectual. And you can sit down and you can talk. He doesn't sit there and say, "Oh I went so many years here and I did - like all this. And I read so many books last week," and all of this. </p>

<p>It's not - he doesn't want it, and yet he's - the answers he comes back with, you know he knows what he's talking about. You know, like if you asked him he'd probably say, "Well I read this book and that book and I took this course and that." You know what I mean? And he really - he could back it up; but he's not the type that would unless you asked him to. And yet like he and Jim had a real good talk because they were talking about politics and everything and the ideas. </p>

<p>And I was very proud of Jim because Dennis had said something like, "You were in Vietnam weren't you?" And he said, "Yeah." "And I bet you have a lot of stories to tell." And Jim looked at him and he said, "I don't tell stories from there." He said, "You don't?" You know? And he was really like surprised because like most of the fellows will come home and they'll say - you know like they'll tell a lot of the things that went on in Vietnam and everything. [54:24]</p>

<p>And the only - Dennis did get something out of him - like how the people feel towards Americans. But I mean, not a real story. Like the fellow will come back and say, "Oh I was in the foxhole and I - " You know, this type of thing-like the fighting stories. Jim wouldn't talk about that-at all. I don't even know to this day whether he ever killed anybody or whether he was ever in action. I don't even know. He wouldn't talk about it. The only thing he will say is like, "The people over in Vietnam hate us," which is pretty well-known now. </p>

<p>And I don't blame them at all, either. But when he was talking about some of the different things like why the cities are so overrun-because they're trying to get them away from the Communists. And they take all these people from farms and stick them in the city, you know - all of this and this. and there's not jobs and - oh cripe. He says all the daughters and the wives and everything else to get money because the men can't work. There's no jobs available, and - oh, it's just - like when he talks about that country-and I say, "And we did this to them. How rotten can we be to somebody like that?"</p>

<p>But anyway, I was really happy because Jim and Dennis got along very well. And Jodie said to me - she said, "Now, see it's not so bad is it? Like he wasn't taken away from you. He still liked you even though he met me, and he met Dennis." So what I'm thinking of was my problem was this-I am trying to be friends - or trying to get friends in the same places Jodie has already been. And Eliza has - well Eliza is like on different nights and things like this. All right, well maybe I can't even use that. Because Tye got to like Eliza, and he met me first. </p>

<p>So I really can't say that he met Jodie first, too. But - see, these Japanese fellows stick together. And if Chang liked Jodie, Tye, therefore, could not like Jodie. You know? Because they don't do that. I mean, he might like her as a friend; he might have fun. And they went to a party - and this is where he really got to like Eliza; because he got to meet her socially, not just in the gym. Like he's never met me socially, except at our house then.</p>

<p>So like you know, they got together. Okay, so that was the way it went. But I think what I am going to have to do is somehow get into another organization or something, where I can fellows on my own. Because once they've met me and they like me, I don't think there would be any problem with them, you know, leaving me for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to have your life separate, and meet people on your own time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that's actually what they do. They do that first, and then they get us in. Like Jodie will do this first. She'll get in and she'll get in with these people - that like Chang liked her, even when I started working out there-the head instructor. He liked her. So you know, it's like I am trying to - I am playing second best because I'm taking friends that are hers already-or people who already like her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It is second-hand already.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's second-hand because they don't like me (ph). If they like somebody else and they really like that person, no matter what you do, you're not going to change their mind. And I don't want to. It's not like I'm trying to muzzle in-it's just like - if somebody's going to pay attention to me, I wish it was because it was me, and not because I'm a friend of hers or because they're trying to get her jealous-or whatever the heck they're doing. Or because she's not around, they have to take second best. [57:27]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, like if you had somebody, then that would be okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I don't think now - because of Jim coming over, I think that day. And Jodie - he didn't get to like Jodie. He liked me-he's always liked me. You know. And like he liked Jodie to talk to and he liked Dennis to talk to; but it wasn't like I wasn't there, or that he didn't care about me. And she said this too afterward. She said, "Well it wasn't so bad, was it?" And I said, "Look, when I was about 15," which is true. I went with - I was [drinking around with a girl] (ph). And she'd always get the best fellows, too; and I'd get what was left over. But one fellow really did like me. It was a friend of her boyfriend. He did like me. He got killed in Vietnam.</p>

<p>But - let's see, how can I say it? One time - I guess maybe it was just that one time - and that's all it needed for me. And she took that fellow away from me that I really liked. And we started riding the bus - all three of us together. And she started talking. And she knew how to flirt - the whole bit. And she was built (ph) like this. And I think they were both Italian, too. So part of that - all of a sudden I just felt like I wasn't getting there anymore. Pretty soon it was her, her, her all the time. And they were talking back and forth. </p>

<p>But see part of it was because I let it go, too - because I just sat back and said, "Well, talk to me or else." And instead of getting in there and just showing my personality too, I just would clam up and sit back-and say, "Well he doesn't like me anymore; he likes her." See, so it wasn't really just her fault-and I don't blame her anymore-you know, entirely. I admit she flirted-okay. So I flirted, too. That doesn't mean I liked the fellow; especially even. Because she said she really didn't even like the guy. But she just liked flirting, and she liked the nice-looking fellows and all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just like you're really sensitive there-that somebody else could win.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well partly because I felt - I already felt inferior to her. She was a couple of years older than I was. She had been out and around a lot more. You know, and so that's the way it goes. And it was stupid; but I felt that way. I actually let her - what I did is I actually let her walk off with this fellow. I really did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So - and that's why you wanted - you wanted to be different. Like you don't want to just sit back and let things happen because you're uptight about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's part of it, too. Yeah. You know, that's true, too. But partly I think - partly my problem is, too, that I am trying to go in a place where I could - in an area where I could only be second best for her friends-because they're her friends. You know like, you can share them like I share Daniel with her. But it's still-Daniel loves her more than he loves me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying you're doing that to yourself somehow?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well partly, and partly -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're fixing it for her. [1:00:22]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think I would fix it by just getting out and getting my own friends. And now trying to share her friends completely. Because again, like I said, you can share a friend. That person can like you, but they'll never like you first best. And I like to be liked first best when I - and when I like somebody a lot, they're first best. Like Jodie is my best friend. She is my best friend; and there's nobody else who is my best friend. So if I want a fellow-in other words, I want to be the best girl for him, and I want him to be my best fellow. And that's it. I don't want anybody else - like I don't want him to love three or four girls the same way or the same amount. You know?</p>

<p>And this is why I like to have a special feeling. Now I could have a special feeling - like towards Daniel I have a pretty strong feeling for-but he's a fellow so - and he's not a boyfriend, but he's kind of like a friend. But still, if I had my choice over Jodie or Daniel, I'd naturally take Jodie, because I do like her the most of any of my friends.</p>

<p>But - let's see, how can I say it? Maybe it just bugs me like because of this. Like he could - like Daniel could be my best friend if it's a fellow; but he's not. Jim is my best friend who's a fellow. And then Daniel is second. But see like I don't know why I should really feel that way; because like he's second with me. But I don't like the idea of being second with him-which is stupid. It doesn't make sense. Because why shouldn't it be the same for both of you? </p>

<p>But see again, it's like me feeling inferior then because I'm not first, which is stupid again. I just realized that now-that it's dumb - because Jim is a much better friend to me than Daniel is. And so I like him much more than I do Daniel. But it's still the idea that I would like Daniel to like me better-which is dumb. It's stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why should you think that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What, that it's dumb? Or that - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I don't know.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know why I even thought about that-that I really - I guess it's just because I like to win, and I don't like being second in anything-which is, again - you can't be best in everything. It's just that - it would be nice if I could be best at one thing though. One day I'll be best at one thing-it'll be nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well our time is up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, all rightly. Oh son of a gun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It went fast.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it sure did. Oh cripe. Oh that Jamie is a riot. Too bad he couldn't come to that party. He'd really liven it up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your cookies were really good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I'm glad you liked them. I am real happy that you didn't get ptomaine poisoning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) I didn't die.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I'll see you next Wednesday at nine? [1:03:11]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Bye-bye now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye-bye.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have a happy new year, and don't drink too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I won't.</p>

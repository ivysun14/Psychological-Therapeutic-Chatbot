<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I think I'll be going away next Friday.  And, uhm, it depends on my husband but since he doesn't know for sure I think I'd better cancel next Friday.  (Clears throat, pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What are you planning?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Just to go to PTN.  And he was plann—, he thinks he'll take the day on Friday and so we'll leave Thursday.  (Silence) Something happened when I came out of the subway today.  And I'm not sure exactly what it was and I don't know why it's bothering me the way it is.  But I was going through — they have a revolving door there because you can't go down into the subway, you can only exit at that point.  And I had, had heard this person running behind.  And usually I'll look but today I didn't.  And just as I was about to turn the door so I was out of that particular thing, the th—, the door stopped.  And I looked around then, thinking it was caught somehow.  And, and there was this negro boy there holding it.  And my immediate reaction was just to be very annoyed that he was doing this to me.  And he said something, I didn't even catch what it was and I didn't really pay much attention.  I just tried to get the door moving again.  And he sort of shrugged and let me go but he could have not let me go.  And I was just sort of mad at that point.  But then as soon as I was out I began to feel very upset.  And at that point I was trying to figure out what he had said to me.  And I, I think he was asking me for my wallet but it might be that I'm just imagining it because of the situation.  And I don't know whether it's because of what could have happened to me, since the place was deserted then and people wouldn't be coming down into it so nobody would come along till the next train, or, or just what it is that got me so upset about it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are you wondering what was upsetting or —?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I'm thinking of that and I'm also thinking of the fact that you asked what I was planning.  And for some reason I didn't like your asking that, I don't know why.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Perhaps because I didn't choose to tell when I was telling you that I wouldn't be coming in.  Or perhaps that I didn't want to cancel the time and I think I have some kind of feeling of guilt about it.  (Silence) I don't know whether this is it.  To—, I know that today I've not felt very happy with myself.  And I don't know whether this is reflecting in how I feel now, but right now I feel as if you're sort of annoyed at me or exasperated.  Just when you were as—, said, "Well, what do you think?"  I had the reaction that you expected I would know these things now and almost that they wouldn't have to be said.  Or that at least you wouldn't have to ask.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you thought I was irritated.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhum.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I wonder if it's possible that really, you know, you feel, you think I'm irritated because you, eh, feel something about it that you would rather not get at.  Because you imply that when you say you felt guilty or not sure you want to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, I think I — well, perhaps I misunderstand you.  I said I feel, I was very hesitant to cancel the time because I felt guilty about cancelling it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ri—, I understood that</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: The point I was trying to make was that you felt that I was irritated.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What I'm suggesting is the possibility that you felt irritated at my question and you're attributing that to me.  Because the, my question brought up your other ideas about it, that you feel guilty or you're not certain about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) The thing I can't understand is what I hear.  And very often if I have these reactions it's because I've thought I've heard a tone.  (Pause) And the feeling I got from thinking that you were irritated was one of almost just being at your mercy and I can't understand what it would serve me to give you this, this feeling I had felt toward you.  Oh, I suppose then if I felt irritated toward you I would, wouldn't feel as guilty about it if you felt irritated to me.  (Silence) But I do think, just generally, I've been in the frame of mind to be bothered by things.  Because the whole day I've just felt as if I had to push myself through it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Mm.  Ah, I'm still, eh, not clear on what you feel guilty about the idea of taking the day off.  What is it about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I don't know exactly except I'm the one cancelling it.  I guess I'm not meeting my obligations.  Or I suppose it's a little bit too that I find coming here so hard sometimes that I'm afraid I'll get a—, use any excuse I can to cancel because it's sort of a relief not to come.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I suppose if I knew that then I would be irritated, hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But I told you that yesterday.  (Laughs) So perhaps I assumed you would be irritated today, anyway.  (Pause) But I think there's something else too in my cancelling a time.  Even if it were a time I wanted very much to come, I would still feel very hesitant to tell you.  And I don't know whether it's part of this idea I have about our respective roles and the fact that you're in charge and so you, you are the one to take the initiative to change anything.  And it's not for me to do that.  Or just simply that it's not part of your plans and so you might be annoyed having something changed. (Pause)</p>

<p>But I think this time bothered me more because it's not definite.  And this is something I've been bothered by a lot with other people too, especially with my parents if we're going to PTN and we sh—, and if they'll be there then we should let them know before the day they go up.  But MSCZ will always say, "Well, I'm not sure."  And it ha—, it disturbed me enough so that it just ended up that I wouldn't call my parents at all.  And, and I would say, "Well, if, if you want to go badly enough you call them and tell them you're not sure and all that."  But I, I couldn't stand the indefinite part of it.  (Pause) I suppose that came partly from having seen my mother so many times being upset because she didn't know exactly what was happening, which I guess would mean she didn't know what was going to be expected of her.  And knowing she wanted things either yes or no, I, I guess, always felt when I'd have to leave things in a tentative state, that I was just bringing her disapproval down on me.  And (pause) And I think somehow that's an aspect of why it upset me to tell you this time, too.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mean you think I wouldn't like it if you, eh, leave it tentative.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  Well, I wouldn't like it even if you didn't mind.  (Silence) I feel sort of ridiculous even mentioning this but it has been on my mind and it, I'm thinking it now so I guess I should.  Uhm, yesterday when the time was up I couldn't remember if you had ever said it this way before, perhaps you always have but I heard it differently, when you said, "Your time is up."  And I just had a very, uhm, well, sort of strange reaction to it.  I, I couldn't quite figure out what it was.  I just didn't like it being said that way.  Because I think I felt somehow excluded or (pause) I don't know, almost as if, well, that was the end of my existing or something.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mean like, your number's up?  I mean that as a question sort of.  Eh, tha—, that's the way you make it sound, as though I had said something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, because it didn't, I mean that to me is sort of a joking thing to say.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah!  But this was very serious, what you felt, I mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  But I feel ridiculous saying it because somehow —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I feel it shouldn't be that serious.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why?  Why shouldn't you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, partly because you, I keep thinking that probably you've said that every time.  (Pause) In fact, I was tempted not to say anything today just to see what you would say at the end of today.  But I think there was an, there's something about it being not just my time here, it's your time as well.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I've the impression today that you feel very restrained, as though, you give me the, the fee—, feeling that you'd rather not have to say anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I suppose it's true because wherever my thoughts go I don't want to face them.  (Pause) And I, for some reason I'm very close to crying today.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are you trying to keep from it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What do you feel like crying about?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, my inclination is to say I'm feeling sorry for myself.  But that's such a general thing.  The fi—, first time I felt like crying today was when I had the feeling of your being irrited—, irritated at me and that I had to spend an hour here feeling sort of at your mercy with you being irritated at me.  And my, then I knew my inclination would be to try to do something so you wouldn't be irritated at me.  And the feeling that I wouldn't be able to change it or meet your expectations.  And (pause) and I think later it was just the feeling that there're so many things that I find practically insurmountable that shouldn't be.  (Pause) And when I feel that way, I sometimes will feel self-pity and other times I'll feel very cross at myself.  And I think I was feeling cross at myself part of the day because I have some work I have to do for my course, some books I have to read.  And I just, I had time to do it and I just, somehow, found excuses to do other things so I wouldn't have to do it.  And I'm going to have to do it eventually and then I'm going to have a lot of pressure on me because I won't have allowed enough time.  Or the other thing is that I have time now and I'd like to get it done so I don't have to do it later.  But I just can't seem to make myself.  And we're also giving a party on new year's eve, which I'd like to have a little bit different from just the usual party.  And I can't, I have time now to think about it and plan it out and I just can't seem to make myself do it.  And my reaction whenever I st—, try to sit down and think about it is, well, I can think about it later. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I had the strongest feeling today that what I'd really like to do is just to go somewhere, go back to bed or just sit in a comfortable chair and read a novel that would be very light and romantic and take me away from all these different problems that I find so hard.  And before coming here tonight, I just suddenly felt extremely tired, tired enough so I couldn't even keep my eyes open on the subway, which is, there's no reason for me to feel that tired.  And I just wanted to go to sleep.  And I suppose that I didn't think of just reading a novel in terms of coming here because I knew that wouldn't get me away.  But going to sleep would be the escape from coming here.  (Pause) And it was just so frustrating, and this is the way so many days can go for me, of not giving in to this feeling for escape and yet not really accomplishing anything either, just being at a stalemate.  (2-minute silence) And I guess I'm really at a stalemate even while I'm here because even though there're so many things that I start talking about, I can't seem to keep thinking about them.  (Pause) And for a minute that made me feel like crying too, just thinking of that.  But then I think it just struck me that instead of crying while I'm here, which I seem to find that I just can't allow myself to do, I've worked out the way of telling you I feel like crying, which, it's sort of, it's like saying I'm crying now without really crying.  And for some reason that amuses me.  It makes me think when I was little and sharing a room with, I think, FYC and sometimes we'd talk or play or do something that we weren't supposed to do and my mother would come in and spank us.  And FYC always knew that you'd better pretend you were asleep.  But I'd always say, "I'm asleep."  So that she wouldn't spank us.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I think you must feel I really am angry with you for cancelling now.  The thing you haven't mentioned that keeps crossing my mind is whether or not it has any connection with the hours I cancelled, the way you felt about them.  You said you felt a certain relief at not having to come and how hard it was to come back.  But I wonder if the thought ever crossed your mind that it indicated something else to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean that something else was more important?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I suppose it did, although, I don't know, I probably countered it immediately with the fact that anybody is going to have times when they cancel.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you might not let yourself feel it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But I was, I think that's partly why I, I was annoyed when you asked what we were planning, why I was cancelling.  Because I didn't ask you.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And I didn't feel I could.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

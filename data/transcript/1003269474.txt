<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no, but I feel like even though you (inaudible) 1,000 scarves and you're like I don't need this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's why I've been trying not to buy scarves, but....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever, on sale.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you said that you want your schedule first?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes, I wrote down what my class schedule is first. Well all right, now what were you open for because I -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, God, that's the terrible part that I can barely remember, okay, so there's always the 10:30 in the - the 9:30 and the 10:30 slot that's still open today -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - like what you're at right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's those, then there's on - oh, God -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is there anything later today? That's -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, because I only do the mornings and then - because normally -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What about Tuesday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - supervision, Tuesdays I'm not here, it's only Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So those are our days. Are there times on Thursdays and Fridays that are good for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thursdays, it would be after 5:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, hold on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On my network because I think I have those filled. What about Friday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Friday I can do earlier though, in the morning I would say. [0:01:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, I'm only here in the afternoon. So can we stick with the 10:30?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess then 10:30 on Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, as a new permanent slot, I know it's not a ideal time, but -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's fine. I was actually wondering when the school year begins if we could start like an every other week thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually that's something that I was going to think about talking about too and I think that we should talk about it -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - because I thought about it before and then I'm like is this a good idea, is -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - this not, so I think that's definitely a topic that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and I'm glad you're bringing it up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, so Wednesday at 10:30 (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, are you sure that's okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, yeah, I was just trying -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's a hard time -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - to figure a time close to classes but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, the other ones would be easier but they've all kind of filled up and there's random slots I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's like a 4 o'clock open on Thursday and you have class then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think there's a 4 o'clock and had a - no, the 6 o'clock on Friday just got taken so -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - yeah, I know. I just got something in the mail, so....</p>

<p>CLIENT: So okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, I'll remember to pencil you in permanently for - [0:02:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now wait, oh, you were supposed to be - what was your double time, it was five on Fridays, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it was 5 o'clock on Fridays.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can't do that anymore?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The only thing is now that I have Fridays off, all my doctors and whatnot are in Joliet and right now I'm having so much dental work done -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, that's what the dentist stuff so -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - so I make all my appointments on whatever day left over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Friday, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we'll just keep it Wednesday morning and that might be a good day for you to like get into the city early and in your library and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't want to have to cancel on Fridays or anything, so I figure -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - keep that clear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So every other week, now I thought about it before because I think that you are doing well. Do you think...are you thinking every other week because it makes your schedule easier or there's a financial issue or it's more like you think you're doing well and you would like to take it down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I've been doing well and also I don't want to...I feel like that would be a little bit easier every other week, like nothing more than that because I feel like when I don't have someone to talk to, that's when things go - [0:03:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I agree, that's the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - same type of thing that I was thinking is that, oh how well you're doing, but then I notice that during break sometimes -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that's when I find you were slipping a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I feel like maybe when school starts because it's a little bit easier in the beginning of the semester -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and then I mean hopefully things go well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, yeah, if that's what you want to do, look, I've thought about it before with you too. The thing that I would ask from you is that, you know, I think sometimes - you're not alone in this - that most clients, when there are weeks in between, homework gets forgotten about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because there's not the same looming, oh, I have to see Christy on -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's the only thing is that I would really want you to make sure you're really doing homework -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and you're doing them diligently so that we can still continue to make progress because you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - are making great progress.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I felt it was a lot, it was kind of nice for me when I last - class - the last session when I had written down before that over the - I don't even know how many weeks we didn't see two weeks or so - [0:04:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were logging (ph) the mindfulness, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and also more so I was lacking when I felt anxious and I feel like that's good because I forget a lot of the time like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because that's such a -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - the smaller like, you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's a common feeling for you so it's not always sticking out in your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and now that I do control it a lot better, I feel like I'll forget more when it's like at that moment, I want to talk to you about it so I feel like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no, and that's a great idea to continue to write the incidents down -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - so then you can have a specific one that you'd like to talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that would help also if we start seeing every other week so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I forget.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but that just means that homework needs to be done, okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or else it just turns into...I think that happens with everybody -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that the first week they're like, "I kind of did it" and then the second week they're like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - to do anything. So last week we talked about the ski trip and this week I thought maybe we'd back to talking about maybe social interactions and uncomfortable situations or do you have something else that you'd like to...? [0:05:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really, I mean, I have that career development appointment that I was supposed to have on Monday, she -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - rescheduled for today at three.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they want me to bring a resume and I have an old resume but nothing has changed since then and I feel -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - kind of like not so...I thought I was going to be anxious today because I kind of was before Monday but then it was canceled, but I'm kind of nervous because I feel like my resume is so weak like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well some things to talk about when you don't have actual jobs, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some people put relevant courses -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - on there so this is for career building thing, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's for an independent study -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Psychology.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - in psychology -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So definitely, these are something that you can put down, you can have a section called relevant courses.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I've had that before because I didn't have that much job experience, and you can put the psychology courses in - [0:06:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and bullet-point the specific things that you learned maybe -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - or that you did in each class that would be helpful maybe towards a career. So what are some relevant -</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a good idea, I didn't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - courses that you think you have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I guess I only have, I have some now -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or how many psych courses do you have now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I only had four, Psych 101 -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - Human Development -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think Human Development's a good one.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. And then I had Psychology of Women and the animal behavior course, which I mean I don't think that I'm going to be working with animals with this one, so I don't know how relevant that is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it only animal behavior or was it kind of the general principles of behaviors?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it was both, it was more animals and then towards the end we got into a little bit about human evolution more than anything else, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So it wasn't really like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was mostly animals.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - it wasn't learning like...well I guess you did talk probably about operating conditioning and hospital conditioning?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we did do that, but related to - [0:07:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - animals and....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I definitely say the women psych you can put that because -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you know you could put some kind of BS about understanding -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because that was cross cultural too and -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, cross cultural differences and being able to work with different communities and understanding minority and diversity -</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that I guess -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be - and then Human Development was so broad and -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Human developments are great because if you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - are should, I know you're not necessarily but I mean children, that's always like a huge part, the human development stuff -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but even just understanding life stages because if you work with the geriatric community.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, because you can say that you have an understanding of the developmental -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - or like trajectory or something in there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because it went through all life stages I guess so -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so that you have a broad understanding of that. Do you have any volunteer experience?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, so....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This will be my first.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But this is what you're doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, this isn't a job interview so she just - [0:08:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - wants to see what you've done before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess, he said bring a resume if you have it; if not, just bring whatever you have so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and you have -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I guess -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - a few jobs in there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just feel like they're so long ago, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long ago are they?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well like 2 1/2 years ago was probably my last job and then it was for like four months or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, Catherine, most people, I don't think actually - well I mean, I guess a lot of people do - but a lot of people don't work during college -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - so the fact that you don't have anything for two years, I mean some people would work in the summer, you know, and that I guess would be what you're lacking -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but other than that, for not for two years, you've been in school so -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like because in Chicago everyone's working and I have so...everyone's like I have two jobs or I have whatever, but all my other friends who go away to school don't have a job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly, so I mean they're not going to judge you based on it, this is just to see where you're at -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and now that you're going to get some experience then you can put that on your resume. [0:08:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that's why I want - yeah, I want to get experience so then I can build a resume and then I also want to volunteer to figure out where I want to end up or head with -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - psychology, so....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Definitely, I think that this is a (inaudible at 0:09:09) and I don't think you have anything to be nervous about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But rather than courses or something, you can always put on -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I'm trying to think of my CV, CVs are a bit broader, but you don't have any like...oh, do you have like your honors, academic honors in there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not since like high school -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you gotten good enough grades to like...do they at Shimer send you like you've made -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - Dean's List or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because of the semesters, they just brought me down so much that I don't know if that's why but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, they don't tell you semester by semester.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess they do, but I haven't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Checked. If you have over - I mean you got a lot of A's this semester, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All A's?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got threes because I just got my last grade for...my professor was sick so he wasn't able to give us our grades.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you never know, you might have made - I guess you'd have to look online.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But most people put their GPA, I know that might not be something that you want to put on, but - [0:10:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: If only for the semester and last -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - semester.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And some people put that on, I'm trying to think of anything else that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you haven't taken any like course...like outside of school courses or workshops or anything -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that you would consider relevant or anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, that's always good, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, yeah, and also I'll see what she says then too because I guess -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and then she'll probably help you build that resume yourself -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I guess she knows what they're looking for, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so I think definitely relevant courses. Do you put people...everyone has it now, but like just sometimes you put your computer skills, that you're -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I have that on there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - use Microsoft Excel and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Older -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - PowerPoint and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - resume, but I feel like I mean that's very irrelevant nowadays but like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Never know, but you could - I mean, obviously you'd like to get a position that's more practical -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but you could find a position that wants you to do a little bit of research or - [0:11:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I had an administrative internship in my senior year of high school, a paid one kind of, so I was always on a computer for an accounting firm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I just kind of got thrown into it but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - yeah, so I have a lot of I guess from that job experience.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, definitely. And in the Psych 101, you didn't do any SPSS did you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, it's like a -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I took that at Greenville my first year so I don't even...oh my gosh, that was like when I was into math -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I thought I was going to be a math teacher.</p>

<p>(Chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know anything you got, you can put in -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - any honors you've ever received, some people even put like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might have at Greenville actually, I don't know if that would even be relevant because that was like three years ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you never know, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or just (inaudible at 0:11:56) I'm sorry, I'm not really tired - [0:12:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's all right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I don't know, must be lacking oxygen. Isn't that why people yawn or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's like you don't have enough oxygen in your brain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually there's like an effect if one person does, someone else does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Definitely. So this weekend you went home, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I went home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your brother's birthday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well because all the football games are on and they wouldn't go out to dinner - my two brothers because I have two older brothers - they wouldn't go out to dinner until after the game but my parents won't go out to dinner at 8 o'clock, like no way, so it was just me, my mom, and my dad and grandpa, so we like did a toast -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the birthday -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - Happy Birthday, Michael, and you're not even here, but so we didn't really...and he didn't really want to go out or anything so we didn't do much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh so didn't do your homework because you couldn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, me and my mom ended up playing a board game and so it was just like very relaxed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Relaxed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is still the part...oh, before we get onto this, I guess, remember I think you had talked about joining a debate team, have you still - [0:13:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, like a public speaking -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, that was what it was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually I forgot to, I haven't looked into it since before we had talked, but I mentioned it to...my roommate's taking, I guess it's like a PR type class, I don't know, over the winter so she's doing a lot of public speaking and she's taking another...I don't know, well both her classes have the same teacher and he has them do a lot of public speaking like write a speech, the beginning to a speech and present it and whatnot, so we were talking about that and I was telling her, oh, what kind of classes are those so I guess I can find out from her and see -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that if you have a chance to take an elective -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you've already registered for your classes for the semester.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yeah, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - there any that could go if you could get into?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, yeah, because now I have until next spring so I can take electives so if there's an open class for that, yeah. [0:14:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that one of those courses would be the best homework that you could possibly do, like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - it would be so beneficial for you to have to get up every day or every once a week and do this, and I know I can tell you feel anxious just thinking about it, but getting through that, it's going to do so much for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I know my roommate, she actually, she walked out of her class like last Friday or something and she was like, "I felt sick, I swear I had anxiety, I wish I could have called you or something," and I was like why, but it was a creative...one of them is a creative writing class and she didn't expect to have to read it out loud -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that one can be a little personal and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and he's making them read it out loud so she freaked out and whatnot and she's not a shy person either, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how'd that make you feel hearing that she (crosstalk) trouble?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I kind of, I was shocked actually that she had trouble but I guess it was just like anyone can but I was kind of trying to like pump her up for it and saying well don't worry, you know, doesn't matter what they...because she was intimidated by everyone else's because they were going before her - [0:15:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and I was kind of saying all the things to her that I should say to myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good practice too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I don't know, I felt like she would have been fine if she went up there, so I probably would be fine too if I just took my own advice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great, and I think that one of those classes if you could...no, what courses are you taking for next semester?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm taking three psych courses and my science courses, Physical Anthropology for -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you take a core science course, is that for -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need one more, but I want to take biology so I might drop my science course for next semester and wait to take it in full on in spring. [0:16:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then maybe if you dropped that, you would have an opening to take -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - public and usually the public speaking classes they're not...like academically -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - they're not, I'm not if they're the same at Shimer but they're not like the most strenuous courses.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I know I'm a good writer, I can write very well, it's just I don't always like to share my writing, like so that's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know what for -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - my problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I think creative writing could be more in that kind of vein, but public speaking, I mean, it's personal, but it doesn't have to be too personal, you know what I mean? You can write it academically, you can write it however you want and the whole point is that they're going to teach you how to speak better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I also I figure during the actual spring semester would be less intense as hers is right now because she only has three weeks, three and a half weeks for -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And even if you wanted to speak with a professor if they felt like it was a nice professor before, you could even let them know the reason that you're doing this, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think they would probably think you're quite brave if I think -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - most people avoid, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Isn't that what most socially anxious people would do, would never take a public speaking class. [0:17:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, but I think I need to because eventually I'm going to have to speak in front of people if I want to continue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Definitely, and regardless it's just going to be something that's good for your health.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if that could be something you could do -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I think some kind of class that would require a lot of presentations, I just think that that's a good class because it won't be academically so hard as maybe other class that would require a lot of presentations, but it will still advance you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm going to see what...because I know she's taking the creative writing, which it wasn't supposed to be public speaking and I don't know what the other one's called or considered, but could see if Shimer has an equivalent to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Definitely, I think that that...I don't know, do you think that...I mean, you say it's something that would work for -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to do it, I think I'd be okay to sign up for it and I would start and then I'm kind of nervous for...I'm not nervous right now sitting here, but I feel like I don't know what could happen during the semester because I had so much trouble with such small presentations in other classes that - [0:18:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if you weren't worried about the grade about it, what if it was just like if someone said this is an ungraded -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't care about my grade.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's not -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that's not considered at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I would love to...I'm focusing on getting all A's, but that wouldn't even be the issue at that point, it would be speaking in front of people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there any way you could take a course pass/fail or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess it doesn't matter because you're not really worried -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - about the grades, but something that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just think it averages in as a C and I don't want to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But you know what I mean, you have a few weeks before you can decide if you want to drop the course, right? There's like a -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I think you have a good amount of time during the semester to figure it out, so....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or is it possible to audit a course, to just go...I don't know if Shimer would let you do that to just let you sit in - [0:19:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They do, I know they have -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not get graded, not get credit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - like older people are able to do that, I don't know if there's an age limit or something if that's for seniors or -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that might be something to think about because then if you don't need this many courses, right, because you have so many semesters that you're going to still take so if you took three courses -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - next semester, that wouldn't be a big deal, would it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? So you could take that, I mean you could talk to your advisor and say is it possible that I don't do this for grade, this is something that I want to do for my personal development, but I'm -</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - worried that in some case if I can't get through it that I don't want it to bring down my GPA.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I don't want to...I want to definitely have like a full course load and then if I have that and I drop it and...I don't know, I think that would be a good idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if that's not something that they can do, I bet you could probably find a place to take like a public speaking class in the city.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true, I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I don't know where -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I'm sure there are places because I -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - the learning annex -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I always see advertisements on the subway for different places where you can take workshops and whatnot. [0:20:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe something where obviously it's -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - complete unrelated to a grade.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I should, I think I'm going to look up that because then I also don't have to -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: First, I'd see if...well I don't know I think with that is part of it, but I do think that maybe just talk about it first at Shimer and that could be a good option for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that it doesn't pose a real threat to your GPA which is something that you're concerned with, but it has the same uncomfortable factor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So as far as going out and doing things like that, how are we going to work on this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I'm going home the next two weekends, but I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have dentist appointment -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, the dentist appointments.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - the next two Fridays for two different teeth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're only going home for a...you could come back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can, but I don't think I am. But I guess I could see - [0:21:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there anyone you can go out with in Joliet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd have to like...I don't know, I guess there are friends that I feel really bad, but...I don't know, but I have friends that these two girls that one lives across the street from me, they're older than me, one's a year older, the other is two years older, and we've been friends since I was like two and we were best friends growing up and we haven't hung out in forever and it's been at least a year now that we haven't hung out but we still keep in contact every couple months now. We used to see each other every month or so and so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is this a good opportunity?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been meaning to call them but then I don't and I don't know - I feel bad, but...I don't know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why don't you call them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if it's anxiety or I just don't have a desire, I feel like I don't ever have a desire to go out but then...I don't know. When I'm here and I don't go out, I'm bored; when I'm home, I'm fine because I'm with my family and I don't mind, but I'm still kind of bored I guess, I don't know. [0:22:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I just avoid, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they live across the street.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe this is like a perfect opportunity for the next two weekends, you say "oh, I'm going to be home this weekend so are you available, but I think it's always a good idea to get in touch beforehand because it's already Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe you could message?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can message them both and see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what would you do? Where are you from in Joliet again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will County, like I don't know -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, yeah, I do know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay, so Will County.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's far out, jeez.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that's where we all...oh, well one of them now lives I think in an apartment at her uncle's house, I don't even know where she lives, that's like another thing, so....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you could find out -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, no, yeah, I just feel bad that she moved and now -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I don't know, because she lived right next door, right across the street too. [0:23:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how long has it been since you've seen them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably, I would say even more than a year now, maybe like since, not last summer, the summer before that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a good opportunity to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - catch up and to do some homework, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are they like party girls or the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, they're not, one of them I would say is more than me and the oldest one, but we usually just go out to eat or now that we're all able to, we'd go out to like a bar sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think a bar would be a good suggestion for you, I mean, maybe you go out to eat first and then go to a bar -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - so you can catch up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It's usually me and the older one and then the middle one, she's always dancing off like the party one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that sounds like something you could do, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I'd like to see you talking to some strangers. Are they single as far as you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if the middle is single or not because she's always back and forth, I don't know, but the oldest one, she's got a boyfriend, but he usually he doesn't come out with us or anything, but....[0:24:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But is she like the type of girl who's going to talk to some people or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I feel like though when we go out, me and her are always like, "wow, these guys are such losers" and then our other friend's like, "hey, meet so-and-so."</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we're like, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well maybe you could go out of your way when she brings that guy over to have a conversation with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so, because they now know me as...from the few times that we've been able to go out together like I just blow guys off, so that's what they -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - say so....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I mean, are you close enough that they know that you have some anxiety and issues?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I might have told them the last time we hung out, I think they do know kind of, I think I might have had anxiety one of the times we went out. So I think they kind of know, so....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not to be -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - maybe you could let them know that like - [0:25:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: - they probably might have forgot by now, so....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay. So they're maybe not the people that you can use as like ‘I need to talk to some people and" -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - not like your (inaudible at 0:25:09).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like they don't know really -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I guess, they wouldn't expect it, it'd probably be in the back of their -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well maybe you could go out of your way and if you do see someone -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - or when you go to the bar because I'm sure people try to talk to you when you go to the bar and get a drink.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't they?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you normally do when they go to talk to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Say hi and ignore them after that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe this is your homework that when you're at the bar, you're going to go get a drink and when someone says hi to you, have a five minute conversation with -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I just blow them off because I feel like I don't know what to say or something -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - half the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So remember what we talked about -</p>

<p>CLIENT: But a lot of times in Joliet though I really don't want to talk to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, but even if you don't want to, I think it's still worth it, talk to them for five minutes -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and then you can say, okay, I need to go back to my friends -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - or you could say I got to go call my boyfriend. [0:26:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true, I should use that because all my friends always have boyfriends so they are always like I have a boyfriend or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But maybe who knows, he could be someone pretty interesting, it could be -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - a diamond among all the losers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, someone at home who's home getting their teeth worked on just as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, I guess, yeah, I could at least try to talk to someone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you have to if -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you're serious about, you know, doing this. And then since I won't see next week, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So we're going to need homework for two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're going to be...oh, you're going to be home again the next weekend, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it is going to be the two weeks in a row.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'd like you to see you try to get out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At least a few times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I want to hear a good story about a conversation, he doesn't have to be right...even if he is the most terrible guy in the world, you can still have a conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That might be easier actually. [0:27:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of easier to have conversations with guys that I'm completely not interested in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because you're not nervous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But most of the time it's like I don't even know, so I just blow them off so....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's who it is, you could be blowing off your soul mate one of these times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If someone was actually very good looking, would you try to talk to them or not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that would make me more nervous, I don't know, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think that's what I'd like to see you work on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can still keep that list of the experiences so that we can talk about one if there's one in particular that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like besides that, there's not really much going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, it's because you're going home a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and end of school is...this semester really isn't much though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I want to hear about the public speaking thing by the time I next see you, if you find something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'll look into it, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? And the going out. And whatever happened with the guy, that what's his face? Brendan (sp?)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even talk to him anymore, actually...oh, well my roommate's boyfriend broke up with her, yes. [0:28:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They were dating a long time, weren't they?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - he's been kind of trying to break up with her and she...for the past like six months, they went on a break for six months last year and when that happened I was like all right, it's over, I don't know most breaks usually mean it's going to end and then they got back together and ever since then it's like after the first month, she's always like once a month or twice a month crying hysterical because of him and he never would hang out with her, like never would want to hang out with her. And then she went to his apartment building because he wouldn't come out for New Years to Joliet so she went there crying hysterical waiting for him and then got him to come out and then the next day he broke up with her after. And I was just kind of like frustrated because she just that day called me up like someone killed her cat or something like screaming, crying and then she texts me like an hour later, me and Heather are coming out and I was like, okay, like whatever and I didn't even hang out with them on New Years and all she talks about is him constantly so I've been trying to avoid that. So he doesn't hang out with us anymore and even - [0:29:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then Brendan was....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Brendan's always like a package with him, and even before that me and him were kind of not talking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're disappointed or how do you feel about -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm kind of like whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean he didn't seem like a person that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because even like I guess shortly before they were about to break up we weren't talking and I don't know -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Strange, he seems like a strange guy, like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I mean he certainly was interested but -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but he's so shy - like and for me to say he's shy, he's really, really shy -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and I can't deal with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe you need someone at least a little bit more outgoing than you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To pull you out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so now that your roommate is single, is she like considering herself single yet or is she still just totally - [0:30:02]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: She wants to go out because she's...well the last thing he said to her was like you know I still love you, I just can't give you 100 percent of me right now. He didn't actually break up with her until she made him say the words or whatever, he was kind of more like pushing her off and he was like but I still love you, so she's hanging onto that and I told her, what, you're just going to wait for him. But she does want to go out I think to kind of be like in your face, I'm going out, look at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she might be...I mean, although she's probably going to turn into like a drunk crying mess each night -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - she might be a person that could be a good person -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - to go out with because she is certainly going to be trying to talk to people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh definitely because last year around this time when they were on their break, she was going out and meeting people so I guess that's....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you guys, I mean, you don't have school right now, so is she going out on weeknights? [0:30:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She actually has two winter classes -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - so she's in school all day long until very late at night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would she be willing to go out on a weekday or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, I don't know because I know those two classes she's had a lot of trouble and has a lot of work compared to -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So but maybe that's something that you could do since you don't have -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been meaning to call my other friend who lives in Chicago because I don't know, she might be in Joliet because she doesn't have a class now and she lives alone and her boyfriend's in Joliet so....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's only one way to find out, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she meets guys and like he has no idea, it's very odd, but she's a very social person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, so that sounds like another option. So I just want to hear lots of stories about going out and talking to people, okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, okay, by next time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At least one guy a night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least, yeah.</p>

<P>We know that children need lots of positive strokes, but all too often therapists focus on problems. In this compelling session, John Murphy encourages a family to recognize successes and focus on small changes for the future. The two boys, ages eight and ten, are struggling with fighting and turning in homework, leaving their single mother overwhelmed and discouraged. Dr. Murphy transforms this family’s <i>dis</i>couragement into <i>en</i>couragement, building on their strengths and validating their successes.</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, I appreciate everybody coming here. It’s nice of you to do this. Nick, and you are—don’t tell me—8.</P>

<P>Nick: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. Jim: 10.</P>

<P>Jim: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Murphy: Your mom is Christy and I’m not going to ask her how old she is because that’s not polite for adults to do that.</P>

<P>Christy: Good idea.</P>

<P>Murphy: I really do want to say that I think that it’s always hard to try and make things better in life when you’re struggling with something, but it’s, I think it’s especially hard, it takes a lot of courage doing what you’re doing. You know, with the cameras and this sort of thing and I..I think that’s, that’s impressive.</P>

<P>Let me explain just a little bit about how this will work.</P>

<P>Murphy: And we’ll take it from there. Basically, you’re going to need to teach me some things about what’s happening so that I can catch up with you, and I need to learn some things. So I’ll have to ask you some questions. Okay, I’ll be firing a lot of questions to you, and I really appreciate you answering those so that you can teach me what’s happening so that I can be of use to you so that maybe we can work together and think about some ideas on how to turn some things around, okay? Start things and move things in the direction you want them to move. Alright?</P>

<P>Nick: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Murphy: I can’t remember everything in my head, so if it’s okay with you, now and then as we talk, I might jot some notes down to help me remember what we’ve talked about. Is that alright?</P>

<P>Nick: Mm-hmm.</P>

<P>Murphy: Is that okay?</P>


<P>Murphy: Because I can’t keep it all in my head and remember it. So maybe I need something to get, to put the notepad on. Can you guys help me move this, this table over here? We’ve got water here, too. You got it over there, Nick? Are you guys….</P>

<P>Nick: Here wait. Jimmy, you can hold those up…</P>

<P>Murphy: I’ll let you go. I’m in your way.</P>

<P>Nick: Okay.</P>

<P>Murphy: Well done. Well done.</P>

<P>Nick: What’s the water for?</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, if you guys want a drink and Ms. Bryce here’s, here’s one or we could play checkers with the…. No, I’m just kidding. That wouldn’t be, that wouldn’t be really good.</P>

<P>Now I told you I need your help. So I need you to help me understand what’s…what’s going on right now that you would like to change. Okay…</P>

<P>Murphy: …so I’ll just maybe start. Oh, hey, I’ll go left to right like they do sometimes.</P>

<P>So Nick, tell me, tell me something that you would like to see changed.</P>

<P>Nick: Me bringing my homework in.</P>

<P>Murphy: You bringing your homework in. Bringing your homework in where?</P>

<P>Nick: To school.</P>

<P>Murphy: Is it all of your homework or just certain assignments?</P>

<P>Nick: Sometimes I forget them. To bring them.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. Oh, you forget to bring them to school. Okay. So you want, you want that to change. You want to be, you want to bring them more. Okay.</P>

<P>Nick: Because last year when I was in school I hardly ever brung them in. Right, Mom?</P>

<P>Christy: You have all the answers, Nick.</P>

<P>Murphy: You hardly, you hardly brought them? Is that accurate pretty much?</P>

<P>Christy: Well, he’s giving everyone the assumption that he actually brings them home and does them and just doesn’t bring them back. Nick can’t remember to bring them home.</P>

<P>Nick: I sometimes….</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh, so, so there have been times where, there have been times in the past where he hasn’t actually brought them home in the first place. Okay. So you’d like to bring the homework in more. Why? What’s the big deal about homework?</P>

<P>Nick: Because I, if I get five homework alerts I don’t get to watch a movie, but we don’t really watch a movie anymore.</P>

<P>Murphy: So, but you still want to bring homework in more to school? So even if you don’t get to watch a movie, you, that’s still important to you to bring your homework in? Why is that?</P>

<P>Nick: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, you don’t have to have a reason, but I just, I just wondered. That’s pretty neat because I meet some people…</P>

<P>Murphy: …your age that say, "Eh, homework, schmomework." You know. They don’t care. You know, they don’t care about that.</P>

<P>Nick: My brother hates homework.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh, does he?</P>

<P>Nick: Mm-hmm</P>

<P>Murphy: How many people do you know that really… love homework? Like the people that say, "I live for homework. Homework is my life. I love home—I love homework more than watching <I>Boy Meets World</I>." Do you know—I don’t know. Have you met anybody like that?</P>

<P>Nick: [No.] The only one I know is Melanie. And Shannon.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. The homework meisters?</P>

<P>Nick: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Murphy: But how many, is that…is that you think most people just love homework or not, or they really don’t like homework? I mean, if you had to group people, would most of them be over here in the, "I don’t like homework too much…"</P>

<P>Murphy: …or would most of them be in the….</P>

<P>Nick: I think most people don’t like homework.</P>

<P>Murphy: What do you think, Jim?</P>

<P>Jim: Same thing.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. Most people don’t like homework. I just wondered what you thought. You know, it’s been awhile since I’ve been in school. Now I work in some schools but I’m not a student in school anymore so I just wanted to check you guys out and see if that was still the deal because that’s how it was when I went to school. Most people just said, "Ew, homework."</P>

<P>Nick: Schmomework?</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, yeah. Depending on who they were. Some of them said, "Homework, schmomework."</P>

<P>Nick: Did you like homework?</P>

<P>Murphy: No, I didn’t like homework.</P>

<P>Jim: Neither did I.</P>

<P>Nick: So you’re…</P>

<P>Murphy: I’m over here. I’m with this, I’m with this group. I’m like over here.</P>

<P>Nick: There’s only about like three people over here.</P>

<P>Murphy: Uh-huh. So are you guys both over here? On the homework thing?</P>

<P>Jim: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Nick: I know my mom is.</P>

<P>Murphy: Alright, well, hey, tell—So…so you would like to bring in more homework. Okay?</P>

<P>Jim, what would you like to…</P>

<P>Jim: Change?</P>

<P>Murphy: …see changed?</P>

<P>Jim: My teacher.</P>

<P>Nick: I knew he was going to say that.</P>

<P>Murphy: Your teacher. What is it, what is it that you’d like to see changed about your teacher?</P>

<P>Jim: I’d like to change her, change her, not have her as a teacher.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. How possible is that going to be?</P>

<P>Jim: I have no clue.</P>

<P>Murphy: Have you, have you gone in and tried telling them, "Change my teacher"?</P>

<P>Jim: No.</P>

<P>Murphy: No? Do you think they’d do that?</P>

<P>Jim: No.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. Do you think somehow you could actually make your teacher change?</P>

<P>Jim: No.</P>

<P>Murphy: Have you ever thought of that?</P>

<P>Jim: No.</P>

<P>Murphy: Ah. Would you be interested a little bit later? I’m not quite ready to get into that now but would you be interested before we leave in some ways that some other students have actually changed their teacher? I don’t mean change them like magic, made them from Mrs. Smith to Mr. Jones.</P>

<P>Murphy: But I mean they’ve actually—</P>

<P>Nick: The same teacher but nicer?</P>

<P>Murphy: Yeah. They’ve actually controlled, they’ve sort of changed the teacher by changing themselves.</P>

<P>Jim: You can change me teacher.</P>

<P>Nick: Like make my teacher say "no homework forever."</P>

<P>Murphy: Yeah.</P>

<P>Nick: I know what Jim would say.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh, so maybe we can get into that in a little bit. You think? Maybe?</P>

<P>Jim: I can’t change my teacher.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. Alright. Well, well, if—</P>

<P>Jim: She’s too….</P>

<P>Murphy: …you can’t change your teacher then, then is there something else, something else that you’d like to, to see changed? Jim?</P>

<P>Nick: The other thing I wanted to change is….</P>

<P>Murphy: Hang on a second. I want to, I want to hear this but first I just want to give Jim a chance. Thank you. I want to hear this.</P>

<P>Alright. Would you be willing to, because we have a few minutes here and, would you be willing…</P>

<P>Murphy: …to, to work towards helping Nick bring homework in and….</P>

<P>Jim: I can’t. I don’t go to the same school.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh, no. I just mean with ideas. Like are you willing to sort of throw around some ideas if you have them. Then you can sort of share them.</P>

<P>Jim: Okay.</P>

<P>Nick: I’ve got an idea.</P>

<P>Murphy: What’s that?</P>

<P>Nick: He can, he can write "Bring your homework in" on my forehead and when I look in the mirror, I’d see it.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh, well, that’s a thought. What else…. You started to tell me something. You said, "Another thing I wanted to change…." Thank you for waiting, too. I appreciate that.</P>

<P>Nick: No more fighting.</P>

<P>Murphy: No more fighting. Tell me, tell me about fighting.</P>

<P>Nick: Because we were, me and Jimmy was fighting a lot. We act like we were wrestlers, and Jimmy just said, "That’s what brothers are for."</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay, but you, you want—</P>

<P>Nick: And we, we accidentally put a hole in the wall.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh, by fighting? You, did one of you fall into the wall or something like that?</P>

<P>Nick: Jimmy pushed me. Jimmy was holding me like this and he…and I went into the wall. There was a little crack right there.</P>

<P>Murphy: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you’d like to fight less and bring in more homework. Alright. Now let me check with Mom, okay? What would you like to see, see changed?</P>

<P>Nick: She wants to change her life.</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, I’m asking—</P>

<P>Christy: Got a magic wand?</P>

<P>Murphy: But I’m asking her. Well, let’s….let’s…let’s…</P>

<P>Christy: Obviously, Nick knows my biggest problem’s homework, that—basically—with the two of them is terrible. And the fighting. And that’s all they do is fight.</P>

<P>Nick: I know I change a life about that.</P>

<P>Murphy: Homework and fighting. Okay. Well, so you agree on, on, on the focus…</P>

<P>Murphy: …which will, you know, save us some time because sometimes I work with families that, that it takes three or four weeks of meetings, like you meet maybe three or four times to even come together and decide on, on what to work on. So, you know, that’s, that’s saying something.</P>

<P>What are some things that you’ve tried, what are some things that you’ve tried along these lines to help improve—and you may just want to pick one of them. Maybe the, either one, the home—Which one? Do you want to do homework?</P>

<P>Christy: Well, we tried pure torture. When they fight and I hear them, they have to sit for 10 minutes and hug each other. They usually cry, scream and yell hysterically through the ordeal but we’ve tried that.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay.</P>

<P>Jim: And it works.</P>

<P>Christy: And it works for about a day.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. What else?</P>

<P>Christy: Homework, that’s a lost cause. It used to be where they’d come home from school—Last year, they’d have time to have their snack, relax for a little while, do whatever they’re going to do, watch a little TV and then we’d do homework. That didn’t work. We were still doing homework at 9:00 at night last year. So now as soon as they come home from school, they’re allowed to get a snack and then they have to start their homework.</P>

<P>Well, this is where all the lying comes in. Because now we’re in too big of a hurry to go outside and play or too much of a hurry to lay down and watch TV or we’re just done with school for the day and don’t really care to learn anything else, so we either lie, don’t bring it home or…. I don’t know what they do with it. I really don’t.</P>

<P>Murphy: So of the two things, knowing that we’ve, we’ve got…. I know you’ve got some time, you know, with Kim and so on, but we’ve got…</P>


<P>Murphy: …maybe another 30 minutes. Of those two things, the fighting and the homework, which one would you guys prefer to focus on?</P>

<P>Jim: Homework.</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, that’s the first one. Are you okay with homework?</P>

<P>Nick: Um, yes.</P>

<P>Jim: I am, too.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay, very good. We agree on something else. I don’t take that for granted. Way to go.</P>

<P>Now, if I ask you any questions that you’re uncomfortable asking—did I say that? Did you make me say that? Did you hear what I said?</P>

<P>If I ask any questions that you’re uncomfortable answering, just don’t answer them, okay? And I’m just curious, as far as, this is, this is who’s at home, right? Any other, you guys, any other brothers or sisters?</P>

<P>Christy: No, there’s no other siblings.</P>

<P>Murphy: So single mom?</P>

<P>Christy: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Nick: There’s another sister but that….</P>

<P>Christy: But Ashley does not live with us.</P>

<P>Murphy: Yeah. I just, I’m just wondering who lives—So you’re doing the single mom thing? Wow.</P>

<P>Nick: What’s this?</P>

<P>Murphy: Excuse me just a second. You know what that is? That’s the antenna for this thing they’ve got us hooked up with. Okay? So that’s, that’s no problem. Yeah, you can just….</P>

<P>Nick: Flip it under my leg?</P>

<P>Murphy: That’ll work.</P>

<P>How, how do you manage, how do you manage to hang in there as a single mom? I know that’s difficult. I obviously don’t know what that’s like firsthand but I’ve, I’ve certainly learned a lot by working with some people who have taught me that that can be just extremely challenging to say the least. But here you are…</P>

<P>Murphy: …you’re working on trying to change things. What has prevented you from just giving up on things at this point?</P>

<P>Christy: We all do what we must. Push on, little soldier. I don’t know. I’m a very strong-willed person.</P>

<P>Murphy: So that helps you just keep on hanging in there with this.</P>

<P>Christy: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Murphy: Wow. That’s, that’s hard work.</P>

<P>Okay, now this may seem like a kind of a different sort of a question: if there was a miracle that occurred, just like that, while you guys were sleeping tonight and this homework thing, this homework problem just vanished completely.</P>


<P>Murphy: Tell me what would be different about life right when you woke up on through the school day into the evening, okay? Jim, thank you for raising your hand. That’s a good organized way to do it here.</P>

<P>Jim: I raised my hand and then I poked myself in the eye.</P>

<P>Murphy: Poked yourself in the eye. Well, you alright? Okay. So tell me, this miracle happened. The homework problem is gone, vanished. How would you know this miracle occurred when you got up the next morning? Tell me, tell me what things would, what would be different about the next day?</P>

<P>Jim: Because I would be happy.</P>

<P>Murphy: You would be happy? Okay.</P>

<P>Nick: I’d just…it’d be another miracle.</P>

<P>Murphy: You’d be happy.</P>

<P>Nick: I’d be very happy. I wouldn’t have to do my homework anymore if I was that smart. 100 IQ.</P>

<P>Nick: I’d be really wanting that.</P>

<P>Murphy: If I, if….</P>

<P>Christy: Could you please speak the right way.</P>

<P>Murphy: If I had a, if I had a video camera and I was watching after the miracle happened, then what would I see, what would I see different, what would I see different in the morning? And Mom, jump in, also. How would the morning be different?</P>

<P>Christy: The morning wouldn’t be different.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. How about school? And maybe I’ll kick that to, to….</P>

<P>Nick: Homework?</P>

<P>Murphy: Yeah. Yeah.</P>

<P>Christy: If you, if you didn’t have any problems with your homework, Nick, how would that be? How would your school day go?</P>

<P>Murphy: What would be different about it?</P>

<P>Nick: Great.</P>

<P>Murphy: How would your, how would your teacher treat you different if, if you did all your homework and handed it in, this miracle?</P>

<P>Nick: Normal.</P>

<P>Murphy: And what would normal look like? What would….</P>

<P>Nick: Just the same as the other kids.</P>

<P>Murphy: Which is, how does the teacher treat the other kids?</P>

<P>Nick: Nice.</P>

<P>Murphy: What does she do, or he do that’s nice? Is it a she?</P>

<P>Nick: She.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. What does she do that’s nice?</P>

<P>Nick: Because when we had homework, everybody got it wrong except four people and she gave us suckers. And my mom said she was very proud of me.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh, you got a sucker that day. You did your homework. That day?</P>

<P>Nick: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. What was different about that day when you did your homework.</P>

<P>Nick: I don’t know. Because my mom helped me out. Just with the whole, that paper and I only got two things to do today.</P>

<P>Murphy: So, so when was that day that, that you, when’s the, when’s the last day that you, that you turned a homework thing in…</P>

<P>Murphy: …and you got it, you got it, got it in on time?</P>

<P>Nick: That was probably the last—What, last year or this year?</P>

<P>Murphy: Just this year. If you can think of one just in the last few days or even weeks.</P>

<P>Nick: That I brung my homework in?</P>

<P>Murphy: That you did your homework , that you brought it in, or that you did a little more than usual.</P>

<P>Nick: I think it was yesterday. That was the last day I had homework.</P>

<P>Murphy: What, what, what do you, what kind of homework was it? Was it math or reading or….</P>

<P>Nick: It was spelling.</P>

<P>Murphy: It was spelling.</P>

<P>Nick: And the, and my mike fell.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh, cover on that. Can you get it on there? So….</P>

<P>Murphy: So what did you do different that time? To get it, did you, is that the time your mom helped you?</P>

<P>Nick: Yeah.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. What else is going to, what else is going to help you get homework done? Something that you might do or even something someone else might do.</P>

<P>Nick: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. Jim, this is where I need your help. What else do you think might help Nick turn homework in a little more regularly? Not perfectly, but just get a little bit better than it is now?</P>

<P>Nick: Put a note right in my face.</P>

<P>Jim: No.</P>

<P>Nick: Put a note right in my face saying, "Bring your homework in."</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay.</P>

<P>Jim: No, I put….</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, I’ll take Nick’s idea. Now I want to hear yours.</P>

<P>Jim: I put a little paper that said, for his teacher, that when she read it, it said, it said, "Read out loud," it said, "Nick, turn in homework."</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh. You put it around him? Or….</P>

<P>Jim: I pin it to his shirt.</P>

<P>Murphy: You pin it to his shirt.</P>

<P>Nick: And if I go in the mirror and I see it, I’d probably rip it up, rip it off.</P>

<P>Murphy: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Jim: Or, you know what he can do?</P>

<P>Murphy: What else?</P>

<P>Jim: He can put notes all over the blankets: "Do your homework," "Bring it in," "Do your homework," "Bring it in," "Do your homework," "Bring it in," all over my face.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. Okay, now I want you to imagine something. Okay. It’s going to take…take using your imagination. You can close your eyes if you want. Alright. You ready? You walk into your room after school. You have your backpack. You go into your room…</P>

<P>Murphy: …and you see on your bed about 10 of these Post-It notes, okay?</P>

<P>Nick: I know what they’re going to say: "Bring your homework in."</P>

<P>Murphy: They say, first they say—No. Not when you come in from school. When you come in from school, they say…. I’m going to, I’m going to write one.</P>

<P>Here’s what they say on your bed. Ready?</P>

<P>Nick: "Do your homework."</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. Now, now you can go back into…. But you don’t really feel…</P>

<P>Murphy: …like doing your homework. You want to do something else instead of your homework. Like—Now if you stay with your eyes closed and don’t answer this because now I’m going to consult with Jim, okay? Because you would rather…. What would you rather do, Jim? What would you rather do besides homework? Just give me an idea.</P>

<P>You would rather play. Okay. So that’s called, that’s called you’ve got a decision to make. Now you can, now you can come out. Okay? Very good. Alright. Nick, that’s a hard decision you would have, isn’t it?</P>

<P>You could, what if there were, even if there were 12 notes…</P>

<P>Murphy: …20 notes, if there was a note pinned, if there was a note here, if there was a note on the bathroom mirror, everywhere you looked there was a note. Okay, your life is a note. Jim turns into a note, just one big note.</P>

<P>Jim: Hi, I’m a big [fluttery] note.</P>

<P>Nick: Here’s Jim: I’m a note.</P>

<P>Jim: Sit down. Okay.</P>

<P>Murphy: He becomes a human Post-it note, okay. Now, so your whole life, everywhere you look there’s a note.</P>

<P>Nick: Even on a calendar?</P>

<P>Murphy: Everywhere. Every single place you look.</P>

<P>Jim: And if he looks at me, I’m a big note, too.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. Here’s, here’s my question: that’s still not going to get your homework done, is it?</P>

<P>Nick: Oh, yeah, it will, knowing me.</P>

<P>Murphy: But what has to happen between the time you see the note and you get your homework done?</P>

<P>Nick: I go right outside.</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, so in other words, do you have to, do you have to do something, you have to do something with your hands to get homework done, don’t you, usually? Do you usually have…</P>

<P>Murphy: …to use a paper and pencil or something like that?</P>

<P>Nick: Sometimes. I do.</P>

<P>Murphy: For certain, for certain homework?</P>

<P>Nick: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Murphy: Like what? What kind of homework?</P>

<P>Nick: Like I have to write 30 sentences, and which I really did.</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, okay. So, so when you have to write sentences. Do you ever have math homework?</P>

<P>Nick: Yeah.</P>

<P>Murphy: Alright. So in other words, you have to actually do something besides look at the note to get homework done. That’s…. Right?</P>

<P>Nick: Sometimes.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. How else do you get homework done?</P>

<P>Nick: Mom just tells me to do my homework and I do it.</P>

<P>Murphy: So how do you, I mean, do you do it…. What works best for you? Sitting down at a table? Is, do you, do you do your homework in a certain place?</P>

<P>Nick: I have to do it in, on the table because I’ll look at the TV.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay. Alright.</P>

<P>Murphy: But that works for you sometimes. Do it at the table.</P>

<P>Nick: And I sometimes do it in the front room and I don’t really look at the TV.</P>

<P>Murphy: Which one works better: looking at the TV or not looking?</P>

<P>Nick: Not looking.</P>

<P>Murphy: Why does that work better?</P>

<P>Nick: Because I’ll get my homework done faster.</P>

<P>Murphy: I got you. Do you sometimes, does your homework period sometimes last a long time?</P>

<P>Nick: Yeah.</P>

<P>Murphy: Does it sometimes go on, does it seem like it goes on from the time you come home from school sometimes till even after supper?</P>

<P>Nick: No.</P>

<P>Murphy: No. Okay.</P>

<P>Mom, excuse me. Does homework sometimes spread into the evening times?</P>

<P>Christy: Homework is my third job.</P>

<P>Murphy: Homework is your third job.</P>

<P>Christy: Yes.</P>

<P>Murphy: And unpaid at that, huh?</P>

<P>Christy: Yes.</P>

<P>Murphy: What have you found helpful? Even just a little bit helpful. It may not work all the time. In fact, it may usually not work but have you found anything that, that just. (Christy shakes her head.) No.</P>

<P>Christy: Well, they switch, too. They switch personalities. So it’s hard to tell who’s who when you come home that day so you never know how much trouble you’re going to have and it’s usually the one with the most homework that’s acting the worst.</P>

<P>Murphy: You’ve worked some, you’ve worked with Kim.</P>

<P>Murphy: What, what kinds of things have, have you…. I don’t know if you’ve focused on the homework or…. What kinds of things…</P>

<P>Christy: Not yet, no.</P>

<P>Murphy: What kinds of things are you working on there? You guys jump in, too.</P>

<P>Christy: They’re about as motivated with their homework as they are about everything else.</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, no. I just mean as far as the—</P>

<P>Christy: Actually, we’re just working on trying to make them clean up after themselves right now.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh, with the counseling? Alright. How’s that working? On a scale, a scale, a scale, on a scale of one to 100, one being absolutely not working at all and 100 being exactly how you want it to be when things get, when things get exactly how you want it to be.</P>

<P>Nick: I was a little, "cause I…</P>

<P>Christy: The number two sticks in my head.</P>

<P>Murphy: Two? Okay. Alright.</P>

<P>Nick: And number 99 sticks in Mom’s, I think.</P>

<P>Nick: Because I was good one of that days because Jimmy, we had to clean the room. Jimmy didn’t even clean it. He always kept up an excuse: "I always clean it." And he made me clean it by myself, right, Mom?</P>

<P>Christy: Well, that was…. That’s because you sleep with oatmeal bowls in your bed even though you’re not allowed to have food in your room.</P>

<P>Nick: No, I don’t sleep on oatmeal bowls.</P>

<P>Christy: Alright.</P>

<P>Will you just leave that alone, please?</P>

<P>Jim: It keeps sticking out.</P>

<P>Murphy: Yeah, it gets, it’s, it does that sometimes.</P>

<P>Nick: It sticks out. Isn’t that an imagination.</P>

<P>Murphy: Hey. Do you ever play, did you ever see those games where it has a word, did you ever play Hangman? You know, that game where you spell things like that? Well, this is going to be sort of a Hangman game, except…</P>

<P>Murphy: …I’m going to stop and I’m going to let you finish the sentence, okay?</P>

<P>Okay, it goes something like this: Like most families, my family’s not perfect. But one little thing that I like about my family is…. That’s where the Hangman. Fill in the blank.</P>

<P>Let me ask you, Jimmy.</P>

<P>Jim: My brother.</P>

<P>Murphy: Your brother. There are no right or wrong answers here.</P>

<P>Jim: Okay, what was the question again?</P>

<P>Christy: Yeah, I didn’t think you heard that question.</P>

<P>Murphy: It says…</P>

<P>Murphy: "No family’s perfect. My family’s not perfect either. But one little thing that I like about my family is…." Scratch it?</P>

<P>Jim: Yeah.</P>

<P>Murphy: How would you finish that one, Jim? One little thing I like about my family is….</P>

<P>Jim: My mom. I’d say my grandma, too.</P>

<P>Murphy: Miss Bryce?</P>

<P>Christy: They’re mine.</P>

<P>Murphy: What, what kinds of things…. Let’s just take a little jaunt out of the, out of the homework thing for a second, okay, because I’m just trying to get to know you a little bit better. What kinds of things do you…</P>

<P>Murphy: … enjoy doing together? I know there’s not a lot of time because…</P>

<P>Jim: Playing catch.</P>

<P>Murphy: …school and all that. Hmm?</P>

<P>Jim: Playing catch.</P>

<P>Murphy: Playing catch. Okay. Who do you play catch with… usually?</P>

<P>Jim: Dad.</P>

<P>Murphy: Dad.</P>

<P>Jim: Mom plays basketball with us sometimes. She does.</P>

<P>Murphy: Basketball. Okay. Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Nick: Only about once, only once a year.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay, what else do you enjoy doing together? Even things that you don’t, you don’t get a chance to do a lot? But these can be very small just couple-minute things. And it, it doesn’t have to be anything, you know, dramatic or, you know, like the Waltons or any of that Brady bunch stuff or anything. I’m just talking about some, some moments where it goes…it goes well and you enjoy doing them together.</P>

<P>Christy: They forget the whole weekend thing.</P>

<P>Jim: Oh! On Friday, we always order Phil’s pizza and it’s delicious.</P>

<P>Nick: It’s the best pizza ever.</P>

<P>Jim: Not greasy and not chewy.</P>

<P>Murphy: What kind do you get? What kind of pizza do you get?</P>

<P>Jim: Cheese.</P>

<P>Murphy: Cheese….</P>

<P>Nick: Cheese, sausage and pepperoni.</P>

<P>Jim: Pepperoni.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oooh. Does it come with different kinds of cheese or like one kind of cheese and then sausage and pepper—Does everybody eat the same thing?</P>

<P>Jim: Uh-huh. I’m a pepperoni eater.</P>

<P>Murphy: You’re a pepperoni guy.</P>

<P>Nick: I’m a sausage eater.</P>

<P>Murphy: Sausage, okay.</P>

<P>Jim: He’s a sausage and cheese eater.</P>

<P>Christy: Obviously, I’m the cheese eater.</P>

<P>Murphy: You’re the cheese. Okay, got you.</P>

<P>Nick: I’m saus—I’m more of sausage than cheese.</P>

<P>Murphy: You’re more of a sausage guy, huh. More of a sausage than a cheese guy. I thought that when I saw you. The first time I saw you out there…</P>

<P>Jim: He looked like a big sausage.</P>

<P>Murphy: He looked—No, he looked like a sausage guy. No, I’m just kidding. I couldn’t tell you were a sausage guy until you told me.</P>

<P>Nick: What did you think I was?</P>

<P>Murphy: Nick, a boy watching <I>Boy Meets World </I>on TV. I’m really a smart, smart person.</P>

<P>Okay, tell me about, so, so you, how does this thing work, this like a, sort of a ritual on Fridays that you do?</P>

<P>Christy: Every Friday we watch movies together. We have pizza. Every weekend, my children get up. I’m in the kitchen having coffee. They have to sit in my lap until they’re fully awake. It takes at least five or 10 minutes.</P>

<P>Murphy: And that’s a time….</P>

<P>Christy: Since they were babies they’ve done that. When they wake up, the first thing they do is climb in my lap. As big as they are now, they still do this. And they sit there until they’re fully awake…</P>

<P>Nick: I don’t do that really, anymore.</P>

<P>Christy: …and can walk with their eyes completely open.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay, excuse me. I want to ask Mom something. And how is that time for you?</P>

<P>Christy: It’s nice. They’re quiet. Although I enjoy it a little better before they open their eyes, but it’s not bad after.</P>

<P>Murphy: How’s that time for you guys?</P>

<P>Jim: She calls me a big lapdog, though.</P>

<P>Nick: Schleprock.</P>

<P>Murphy: So I’m going, I’m going to get back any, tell me about any other things like that that you do. It sounds like you have a couple rituals and that’s kind of neat because there’s some families that don’t have those kind of times. I mean, any, any moments like that. What other kinds of things, kind of that special sort of time?</P>

<P>Nick: It’s Jimmy’s turn.</P>

<P>Murphy: No, anybody. You guys are doing real well. I’m serious. You, you know, I’m asking you questions and, and that’s good. I appreciate your thinking about these.</P>

<P>Nick: My hands are cold.</P>

<P>Jim: We’ve got 10 more minutes.</P>

<P>Murphy: Thanks for the cue. Neat. Are those things you think that you’re going to continue as a family?</P>

<P>Nick: Oh, you want to know my worst subject in my school? It’s probably about like science and social studies and reading.</P>

<P>Christy: If you want more water, have mine.</P>

<P>Jim: Okay.</P>

<P>Nick: I’ll pour some more in yours.</P>

<P>Jim: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Murphy: Science, social studies and reading. That’s a lot of that language arts stuff, huh.</P>

<P>Nick: And my worstest, worstest, worstest is spelling.</P>

<P>Christy: Can you tell by the way he speaks?</P>

<P>Nick: I can sing like a woman, I can sing like a boy, and I can sing….</P>

<P>Nick: And I can almost act out Mickey Mouse: "Hi, folks."</P>

<P>Murphy: So you have different talents, huh?</P>

<P>Nick: Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.</P>

<P>Murphy: How long have you been doing that? Is that something that just started or….</P>

<P>Nick: I’ve been doing it since I was probably about, like 7.</P>

<P>Murphy: Let me ask you this: do you ever feel like you’re tired of hassling with all this homework and school stuff? Does it get old? Do you sometimes feel like it’s almost this thing called The Homework Monster?</P>

<P>Nick: Oh, yeah…</P>

<P>Murphy: Does it feel like it’s, it’s just sort of pushing you around sometimes?</P>

<P>Nick: Yeah, it always does.</P>

<P>Murphy: It always does.</P>

<P>Nick: But I get it finished. Better than cry, I get it finished.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh. The Homework Monster sings just like you sing sometimes. Does The Homework Monster do…</P>

<P>Nick: Hallelujah. Hallelujah.</P>

<P>Murphy: Does it do like, "Nick, don’t do homework, don’t do homework, don’t do homework." I mean, does it sometimes feel like it does? What about you, Jim?</P>

<P>Jim: No, there’s no Homework Monster. I don’t believe in that anymore.</P>

<P>Nick: He doesn’t even believe in the Tooth Fairy.</P>

<P>Jim: Nope.</P>

<P>Murphy: You know what, you know, I tell you what. I’m going, I’m going to suggest we do something. We just have a few minutes, but I’d like to take a really short break, maybe just three or four minutes, okay? You guys can, you know, you can stay here. If you want to just, if you want to stand up or something like that. You keep the, keep the, you can keep the things on. You can talk about something we’ve talked about. I’m just going to, I’m going to break for about…</P>

<P>Murphy: …as I said, maybe about three or four minutes. Help me gather my thoughts because I told you I have to write things down. Sometimes I need to just stop and think about things. Okay?</P>

<P align="center">[Short Break in Session]</P>

<P>Okay. Thanks for waiting everyone. Thanks for waiting. I wanted to give you something that I wrote up. What I’m going to do is just read it, okay, and I’ll leave a copy here. Yeah, you can look on with me.</P>

<P>"I’m impressed that you’re trying very hard to make things better and that you have not given up. That takes courage and love. I also think it’s very useful to you to keep the family rituals like Friday pizza nights and the weekend wake-up time. Families that have these rituals are able to stick together during tough times better than families that don’t have them. Maybe you could even add…</P>

<P>Murphy: …other such rituals as you think of them.</P>

<P>On the homework, I urge each of you to pay attention to the times when homework is completed and turned in and continue doing the things that seem to help get the homework done. The massive Post-It note campaign might also help."</P>

<P>That’s the thing we talked about, the Post-It notes, reminders.</P>

<P>"The only way to know is try it. I’ll be curious how things go with the homework, and I’ll check with you and Kim next week to see how it’s going."</P>

<P>I’m going to check with Kim to see how this homework thing is going.</P>

<P>"I’m also wondering what else that the three of you will think of that make things better at home with homework and other things. It’s been a pleasure meeting you. You strike me as a family that’s been through some tough times but that cares very much for each other. You also appear to be a family that does not give up when things get tough.</P>

<P>Murphy: "I wish you continued toughness along with the soft, warm times that you have together on pizza nights and wake-up times."</P>

<P>Nick: Dr. John…</P>

<P>Murphy: Murphy.</P>

<P>Nick: Murphy.</P>

<P>Murphy: Good. Now do you have any questions or comments for me? I really do appreciate it. I’m going to, I’m going to hand you that note. And I, you know, I will check up. I don’t want to be pesty, but I’ll be very curious how, how things go the next week.</P>

<P>Nick: I want to see you again.</P>

<P>Murphy: Okay? Alright. Thanks very much. Nice meeting you.</P>

<P>Nick: This was fun.</P>

<P>Murphy: Oh, it was? Well, you know what’s really going to be interesting is to see what happens with the homework and the fighting, to see if our conversation leads…</P>

<P>Murphy: …to any changes because that’s what it’s all about.</P>

<P>Nick: Are we going to come here again?</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, no, you won’t come here again with the cameras and such, but I know you’ll be meeting with Kim and she’ll be working with you to help bring these changes out. And I’m going to be asking about the small changes that keep occurring.</P>

<P>Nick: Four things we need to get done, so check by check by check by check.</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, you can make a checklist if you want. You can take that letter and do what you want with it. And you can, if a checklist, if you think that would help, you can do that.</P>

<P>Nick: I can draw Captain Underpants.</P>

<P>Murphy: Well, yeah, the three of you might want to talk about that, even on the way home, how you can try and keep this, some of this stuff, get, put some of these ideas in place. A lot of these ideas you’ve already started. You have the rituals and the other things. Okay? See you. Thank you.</P>

<P>Christy: Thanks.</P>

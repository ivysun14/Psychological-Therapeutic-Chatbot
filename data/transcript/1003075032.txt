<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, just want to go ahead and let you catch me up on how you've been these last, I want to say, three months or so, three months or so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we, we've gotten off to a, a really good start.  When, when was the last time I was here, you —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Looks like [DATE].  So just over three months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, then I have the, yeah, I haven't had a chance to review my notes from that meeting.  It seemed like, I, for some reason I thought it was longer ago than that.  But, but sales really started to, were arching up, I think I probably told you at the time, at the club.  And we did 100 new memberships for the month of February which, in this economy was probably three to four times my projections to what we could really do back then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Things are looking a little brighter now in perspective in June, but back then I think November, December, January, February, were some of the most terrifying months in US.  History for practically everybody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, so I was really shocked and pleased by that.  Um, the numbers were coming in, the money's flowing in, and, and as I get into March and April and my analysis of those results comes back a little bit [INAUDIBLE], we had lost almost as many members.  In fact we had lost as many members during that period as we had gained.  So the net membership in November was about 850, 860, peaked at 899 some time in January, and dropped back down to 850 and remains at 850, or that neighborhood.  We added, you know, 57 in March, we added 48 in April.  I don't know if something, May, I think, came up just under 40, which would be roughly typical to what happened last year.  Maybe 5 or 10 behind.  But it seems for every membership we're gaining, someone's falling off.  Everybody loves the club.  I haven't had a significant complaint.  With my sales background I know what to expect in terms of customer service, and people's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Typical, you know, the typical business is going to have 10 to 20% of the people that unreasonably feel unfairly treated or whatever.  I don't, I think ours would rank around 1 or 2%.  [NAME OTHER] and I enjoy working there, we enjoy the people.  Hell, I can't get out of there some nights.  You know, lately I've been working a lot more to run labor costs down.  So, you I'm supposed to be done at 8:00, I don't get out of there until 10:00, 10:30.  I'll try to get a workout in, maybe.  Well, hell, I can never get through a workout.  And, you know, the trainers, guys that are doing training for us and members.  So overall, the experience has been very, very positive over the past three months since I saw you last.  Unfortunately the real estate side of my business picture has been about as ugly as it can get.  I stopped making payments, as I told you, on 10 mortgages, 12 mortgages in January.  And then [DEIDENTIFIED] came through and we renegotiated four.  And so I got eight mortgages that, about four or five which are heading into foreclosure right now.  I'm allowing it to go there.  Well, I don't really have much choice, but the main reason I'm allowing it to go there is to get somebody to sit across the table from me.  Because we'll spend 100 hours playing around with their phone systems and, you know, the variety of things that they've, barriers that they've put in place.  So, well, since my credit is destroyed anyway I might as well push it to the limit, let the foreclosure get started and have a judge say well, hey, this guy sent you two letters certified.  So we know you got them.  He's made offers to try to settle and work this thing out with you.  Uh, why don't you sit down and talk with him?  Now, that's essentially my thinking of what's going to happen.  I've engaged, uh, a pretty good attorney in this area who is actually representing two or three outside mortgagees from outside the state of Ohio.  So he really knows how the, the rules go and how the actual workouts go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm thinking, I don't know.  I think I'm going to lose Florida, I think I'm going to lose California.  And up until this week, I thought I had it all kind, like, I mean, it's like a chess game.  There's each piece has about 13 variables as to how you can play it, and I'm trying to play out four moves in advance, and it's a freaking nightmare.  Because then each time somebody moves then that completely changes all the variables again.  So I really thought that my local bank that has 20 mortgages, and our astute businessmen, and do sit across the table from me and know me very well, would eventually come to their senses.  And they, not they've done anything yet, but I have a $300,000 credit line with them.  I've burned up 225 of it.  I keep spending, I've shelled out over the last eight or nine months.  So I'm thinking just maybe the cash flow from anytime could start to chew up that if I can keep the cost down and stuff.  Went down to visit my mom, came back.  I'm feeling kind of good.  I'm feeling like I think —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your mom got sick, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she got, yeah.  She had this kind of a, a relapse with her, um, her lungs.  She's got, she's had pneumonia that keeps coming back, you know.  I can't, once, I guess, you get pneumonia it's very hard to get rid of it.  So her doctor, I feel like he freaked out.  She went in to see him and he goes oh, my god, and throws her on all these antibiotics and things that you breathe.  You have to have this breathing machine, all this stuff.  And so she was getting scared.  My stepdad died in, at the end of December.  So this, she's all alone.  So I shot down there, and, uh, really she seems fine to me.  I mean she's very stable and calm.  But I think the doctor kind of worked her up and being alone, it had some impact, quite a bit of impact on her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so, so I get back.  So the trip was good for her, and it was really good for me to get away from all this crap for a while.  And, uh, because I was down there five, six days.  And, uh, I get home and the damn bank on Monday had cut off my credit line.  This is my bank, these are my guys.  These are my homies.  Cut off the credit line.  And when they did that they refused to honor the $8,800 rent check, which was four weeks late to the landlord anyway.  So I got hold of him right away and said I've got a little problem with the bank, got to get the.  He seemed to handle it okay.  Got them on the phone.  Well, the value of your stock and your, you know, your assets.  We can only loan up to 70% of that and blah.  Well, they've ignored these restrictions for the last five years.  But, of course, you know, and I have to accept the fact that their world is changing and they don't know what the hell they're doing, either.  So, well, then we better get together.  Prepared a real nice document, set of documents to really work with them and explain to them that, look, I've lost everything now, boys.  I'm [AGE].  My net worth is shot, my credit is shot.  Everything's gone.  I'm willing to hang in here and I'm willing to work out all these properties for, you know, who knows how much.  And they're worth half of what your mortgage principal is.  Now what their original purchase price, they're half of what the mortgage principal is.  Am I ever going to get any money out?  Pretty damn unlikely.  You know.  But there's a chance and I'm willing to do it because we've been good parts.  And I want to try to see if there's some way that if I can get any time to do it, it can pull the whole train.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Long shot, but, you know, if we work together and give me some room.  I'm running a 5, what was a $5 million valued assets, and all the businesses and all the properties and everything, on what was $100,000 worth of working capital.  Which is stupid.  Nobody can do that.  Now you're going to crush it down to $20,000 worth of working capital?  And I have no place else to go.  You know, I can't go into securities and I can't go into this or that any more.  It's all gone now.  So they were very cordial.  And they're smart guys, and they're, they're not stupid.  You know, it's not the kind of crap that you get from Citibank.  Well, [PATIENT NAME], you're going to have to just figure this out and get back to us, because our rules state that, you know, they didn't give me that crap.  You know.  And, and I, right in the documents I said you stand, if we can't work this out so I can keep making my payments and everything, you stand to lose $900,000 to $1.2 million, based on today's market.  And that's not considering all your costs of trying to get it away from me.  So is it better to take a few risks, you know.  I'm asking them to drop their interest rate from 6 to 4, and I'm, you know, would ask for $200,000 worth of additional working capital.  That should get me through.  Because I'm, you know, I'm not too far from equilibrium, there.  And, uh, the guy, the guy's really good.  But he's, and he said, well, we can probably do the interest rate thing.  Have your bank, he, I wanted them to take over my SBA loan and do an interest only loan with me.  No, can't do that.  Go to your bank and have [DEIDENTIFIED], the SBA people do that.  Well, you know, that's going to be tough.  But I, I'll give that a shot.  And just totally turned me down on the $200,000.  So taking $20,000 from me, now leaving me at $20,000, now I'm at $20,000 worth of working capital.  I don't know.  And, see, the cash flow things, you know, come in so much lower than $100,000 worth of working capital I can just go to.  And all my systems are set up so they, uh, my, the working capital account, I write a check, it funds it.  When I get some money to cover, it automatically washes back to working capital.  So every account's just doing this all the time.  And the only thing I really, then, have to watch is where is the credit funding.  You know, am I making, obviously, if the credit line is going down, I'm making progress.  If the credit line's going up.  And he just, you know, he says, you know, you need a, you need a venture capitalist to put 200,000 bucks in the bank.  He's not going to do that.  And so what it's really going to work down to, just like the other guys, is if I can make it, I will.  If I can't make it, then I'm simply going to stop making the payments on all the [DEIDENTIFIED] loans.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I can't make the payment fellows.  What are we going to do?  Okay.  Then, and, and then we duke it out from there.  Do you want to take the million, you know, you want to take the million dollar loss or you want to come up with a little credit money for me someplace.  Your call.  Oh, you want to take the property?  Here you go.  And, you know, you don't expect to have to face these things, you know, after you've been hustling for as long as I've been hustling.  But I think, well, and just getting the, I would be, I would be in not necessarily in tears.  But I'd be a lot more down in my presentation of this stuff to you today.  But three hours ago I met with the landlord.  Pretty damn good guy.  And made the same, you know, kind of pitched to him.  I said I'm going to have to cut your rent down to $4,000 a month from $8,800.  Now you can imagine what the kind of look I had to have on my face when I made that pitch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, I said, well, I can see, I said, he says how long do you have to have it like that?  And I said at least six months.  And he said are you talking about a totally giving you that money back?  I said no.  We're going to load it back through the lease someplace.  I don't want you to lose any money.  But we've got to give me some breathing room here, because the bank isn't.  He says I think I can get that through with my people.  We're getting this from everybody, blah, blah, blah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So maybe —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I about, yeah.  I about wet my pants when he said that.  I figured sure, he was going to go, we'll give you, we'll give you a thousand bucks off.  And that's the best we can do.  And if we, if you don't go along with that, then we'll bust you out of here so fast it will make your head spin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the alternative is that there may not be anybody else to rent anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They got too big.  It's his butt.  They also know that I got 500,000 bucks in equipment and in leasehold improvement and stuff.  I mean, he could have twist, he, actually, he's in a position to twist me 10 times as hard as the bank.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that was a, that was a whole, I mean, and this is what's, maybe you can explain this to me, [PHYSICIAN NAME], is I was lower than whale shit all week.  I mean, this week I just, I could barely get out of bed.  And I've been doing good.  I've been getting out of bed at 5:00, 6:00 in the morning.  Almost all of, uh, probably April and May.  I'm back to writing good stuff and, uh, in fact I'll even show you an example, here.  I, I call them high performance days when I either work more than 10 hours or I, or I, uh, have two major accomplishments in a day.  Of course, this is all my subjective opinion, you know.  But I haven't, for the past year, I haven't been able to even do anything alike that with all the stress.  And, uh, here in, I guess it's April, I did, I got my first, I gave myself my first high—performance day sometime, I think it was some time in March.  And then look at, uh, you can just kind of see.  I haven't had a chance to fill any of these out.  I got all my colors going again, I got all my highlights, you know.  Which is a real upbeat kind of thing for me.  And then, see, then in May I went wild.  I just, this was just terrific.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> About five of them, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Tons of them.  And I just, uh, and then here's the trip down to mom's, which was more party for me than any kid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There was no stress.  I mean, it, it, I went down there figuring I was going to get creamed.  And, uh, that worked out beautiful.  And I come back and I mean, it was like taking a baseball bat right to the back of my knees.  Just dropped me right down.  And, you know, a lot of the depression symptoms had slipped.  I stopped taking any kind of Xanax or Ritalin for almost two months in there.  [INAUDIBLE].  I mean it just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So now you're back to where —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it just, just bank.  But, see, then, then I popped right up today.  You know, after the bank meeting was tough.  I took a lot for the bank meeting and stuff.  But I mean, it, it, this just, this, the credit line being cut off is the nightmare scenario.  That's the worst thing that can happen.  Because without working capital, now you get, I can't make payroll.  You know, I can't make payroll, that's a big problem.  So it's, it's just all that kind of stuff in it.  Because you've got to reset, or now I've got to take money from, I've got to take the credit card bills and send them to a new bank and then write checks out of the new banks for payroll or for the power bill or all this stuff.  Because now [DEIDENTIFIED] is going to be sucking it out all the time.  And, duh.  Now, they said that they're, they've all that off.  They're restoring the line and all that stuff.  But, trust —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So maybe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  They just, they just whacked me too hard.  They should have given me that 11,000 bucks back and they did not offer.  And I asked them about it and they were just, like this kind of silence.  And to, and they know damn well that very few little businesses can afford a $20,000 hit when they're already in a, in a squeeze.  So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you, you've been consistent with your Lithium all along, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been doing, yeah.  I've never left Lithium —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's just the other ones.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I was, I did —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to say I did, things were going along so well in the high—performance month there of May, I did start to lighten up on the Lithium.  I was down to just, uh, two at night and one during the day.  And, uh, now I'm back to three at night, two in the morning.  But, you know, I, I don't feel any sense of, I told you that before.  I don't sense, feel any sense of addiction to that crap.  Because I only use it as long as I have to.  And as soon as I can get off, you know, I'm off.  I, uh, I don't take, uh, at my, at [AGE] I think I'm pretty lucky.  I don't have any heart medicines or any kind of anything.  The only thing that I take is Lithium.  Viagra.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But on a regular basis, there's one thing and then here and there with the rest of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, thing, things are still waiting to work out.  What is your target for membership to, to get your —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Break even, break even, I'm right at break even right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you, you need to cross the threshold.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Need to cross the threshold.  My projections were that I would be at 1200 by this time.  If we would have kept half of our people that quit in those few months, I'd be at 1000.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So many of them are going through hard times, too —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They just have to give up something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  But, and so that, but that was my thinking.  But it just applied to the existing members.  All those new people, where the hell did they get the money for it?  And it was full pop, it was 40 bucks a month.  We had no big, I think we had some, we, we knocked 25 bucks off the enrollment fee.  They were, I mean they were backed up, five, six, seven people.  Just made my heart sing.  So, I don't know.  I mean it, it's, that's going to be the, this big struggle.  At, at 1000, at 1000 members, that would be another 150.  I'd pick up, it's about 40 bucks a member.  So, so, so that's about six, 6000 bucks a month.  And, so that, so I would be right around six to eight, maybe $10,000 a month.  And then if we can get it up to 1200, see, then that's another eight thousand bucks a month.  So now we're flicking along at about 20,000 a month in cash flow profit.  And I don't have, thank God I won't pay taxes for the next half a century.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it's all, it all drops right down.  And it's all, it's almost pure profit.  Uh, the tanning really took off nicely.  So we're doing about, we did 2600 bucks last month in tanning.  And I use the same staff.  I don't have, haven't hired anybody.  I just beat up on myself and on [NAME OTHER] to get the whole thing done.  And, uh, so there's, there's some real nice in, I'm hoping we can come up with more personal training, too.  So there's a bunch of little avenues there that, you know, it' actually three little business units to it.  One large and one, two small.  So, yeah.  I mean, it's, it's not impossible for us to be in a, in a really decent situation.  But then you get banged like that, then the whole world goes right into the toilet.  And then 15 minutes later the landlord says he's really making up a lot of the slack, but if I could ask you to knock off four grand a month.  And now he's knocking off four grand a month.  That's the equivalent of getting another 150 to 200 [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It can still work, maybe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  That part can.  I don't know what the hell to do with the real estate.  I just, you know.  If buying houses, [NAME OTHER], my manager, just bought a house in [DEIDENTIFIED] that had formerly had a $200,000 mortgage on it, 65 grand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a steal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, it had to be, I don't care, no, how old a [INAUDIBLE] it was, they had to put a $240,000 value on it to get $200,000 mortgage.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It will all come back some day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it will.  But see, now what you're facing is, and I think it's going to be a trough for about anywhere from about two years to four years until [NAME OTHER] goes out and picks up a small portfolio or has somebody pick up a portfolio for him of 10 $45,000 houses.  And he finances them, you know, 90% or something.  And, and, you know, you've got $45,000 in the whole darn shooting matches, and the houses will sit there until all those houses are bought up by 50 other [NAME OTHER].  Right?  Then, when that, when that window closes, the value of your little portfolio is going to go up about 50, 60% because now it's getting legit again.  And then, depending on how long you want to sit with it, yeah, I think they'll come back in 10 years, over a 10 period to rough, not where they were '05, but probably 2000, something like that.  Which wasn't, wasn't bad.  Why, I think my house in 2000 was, like, I bought it for 91 in 1991.  It was about 125 in 2000, and as high as 200,000 in, uh, in 2005.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Basically, your few percent a year, it's all working right.  It's going to take a while, though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it'll work, it'll work beautiful.  And I, I think there's some chastise now, that lending won't get too out of control.  But, you know, there's, you know, you're pretty good with investing in your retirement plan.  You know, I'm, I'm, I'd like to figure out a way I could, a big investment in my retirement plan in equity.  I keep my equity trust, and, uh, I bought a limited partnership with a communications company called [DEIDENTIFIED], where a couple friends of mine work.  If that would pan out, you know, that could be worth maybe anywhere from 250, 300, uh to 500,000.  And, uh, you know, I could buy the houses inside and the darn, the retirement plan could buy the houses for me.  So there's all kinds of stuff that would, you, you know.  Just, and this is where I wanted to hit you with this.  I'm so hungry for just a little bit of good news that, I mean, if you could see the difference in me from, from before that meeting with the landlord this morning to, I'm practically myself right now.  This is about —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  This, this is the guy I know.  Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, this is pretty much me.  You know.  Now I'm thinking about how maybe I could come up with, you know.  Because that's what I love to do is come up with these kind of deals and horse around with stuff.  I haven't even been able to think past here for, almost, well, it seems like a year.  But it was actually the end of September.  I mean everything went down in September last year.  Everything just crashed.  So, yeah, if I can, if I can, I do need to, right now I do need probably the Ritalin and the Xanax to, to help me catch just a balance.  But as soon as I can get rid of them then I can get back to my old self.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you should have enough of the Lithium to last you for a few more months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think I gave you six months last time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you gone through the little bit that I gave you on the others?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I've probably got, I've probably got 10 Xanax and probably 15 of the, uh, Ritalin.  So I could use a, another couple prescriptions there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  We'll, we'll do that.  And then we'll keep you on the two and the three, the two in the morning and three at night on the Lithium, because that's where your level is right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And Lithium's actually a good antidepressant when you get the levels up to where the blood tests say they need to be.  So I think going through all this, that's probably the place you want to stay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you need the adjunct with the Ritalin or the Xanax from time to time, then —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll, we'll get those in as a adjunct.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Little extra buffer, yeah.  But it's, it's really funny, too, though.  You get down so low sometimes, and I know I should, uh, take a Ritalin.  And I can't even get myself to take the damn Ritalin.  You know, I'll go, uh, I don't know yet.  I can gut this out.  Or whatever the hell it is.  And, uh, is it better to just force yourself to take it when you get down there that low?  And it, because, man, I mean, I, tomorrow morning I could be right in the sewer again.  I, not, not only based on some traumatic event, you know.  I get a call from the bank, well, we decided to foreclose on everything, you know.  Oh.  It's all event—driven for me.  I don't get a sense that my brain chemistry changes much on it's own other than when a high—stress or a very high—positive event.  You have some minutes like, uh, the end of the world.  Or, save the world.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which tells us that you Lithium's keeping things pretty much where you want it to be for baseline.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then different things come up in life that drives you up or down, one way or the other.  And that's where there's nothing to do except think about it ahead of time now where you say I've got to take that adjunct therapy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So got to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I've got to get, got to get that boost from Ritalin.  There is an antidepressant effect from Ritalin.  It does give you a little bit of drive to get through.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's not that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And on you, it really works well for that type of situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].  And it's not going to hurt.  You scared me a little bit because you say, you know, I think you're worked about the, uh, addictive affects on me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's in, we know that there have been lengthy periods of time where that's not even an issue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  Well, I went from, uh, spring of 1993 to the fall of 2002 without having to touch a drop of that stuff.  From the time I was [AGE] to [AGE].  And that damn [NAME OTHER] screwed everything up for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not her fault.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So I've got the two prescriptions that you need, and then you've got refills on the Lithium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  In fact, I've got one that I've got to pick up at the drug store anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what I'm going to say is let's try to touch base in about three month's time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if you need anything along the way, let me know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Right.  I don't think I'm going to be tearing through this stuff very fast.  I'm hoping I can just operate without it.  You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, things have a way of working themselves out.  So take it one day at a time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  Well, good deal.  Good seeing you again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, good luck with everything.  I hope it all works out sooner than later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, let's hope so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, then.  So it will be probably early September and we'll talk again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I would think, well it will be interesting to see.  As I say, we'll be able to figure out the chess game here in a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good seeing you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

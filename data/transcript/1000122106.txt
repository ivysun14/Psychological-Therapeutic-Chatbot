<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today is December, it is not December at all this is February 17, and this is Carrie's eighth, is that right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Eighth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eighth session with Tyler. We can go until standard time, a 50 minute hour. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I was I thinking that I am resolving things in here and this is what is worrying me sort. That is one thing but another thing was that this morning when I got up I just realized that some of the feelings that I had about teaching is that, it was the same sort of feeling that I had when I went to overnight camp, like it was fourth grade and I hated it. For two weeks I just hated it. I was homesick and everything was painful. And my stomach was like always upset in the morning. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wanted something that you weren't getting. Part of it was that you were upset and you were in pain and homesick means that you wanted something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was the same thing of not being comfortable and not feeling like I am making it, I guess, in that situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So I exaggerate things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean everything blows up and nothing is worth trying. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you're whole being or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but nothing I do is any good either; like it affects everything. And I remember and it was the same thing because I remember when I went to camp like I felt, "Why are you the only one who is homesick? Why can't you adjust to camp?" And it seems like my sisters went and they could adjust to camp and they really liked it and I am doing the same thing with teaching like why is it so painful for you, it seems like everyone else can get through it very easily. And so I just start blaming myself for being maladjusted. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so everyone else, to you, in the world was your sisters?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everyone else was what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you it seems like at least then and now too, sounds like, everyone else in the world you equate to your sisters?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. I mean clearly it is not everyone else in the world. I was homesick at camp. I'm sure that it wasn't just you and I in the world that was homesick at camp and didn't like it. </p>

<p>3:28</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well like the people I met at camp also seemed to really like it. Like what happens to me in some situations is that little things just hurt me in a way that they shouldn't, like there is no need. Like I just remember at camp these little things like it just seemed to me, and it was my fantasy that the counselors were paying more attention to the other kids, and they looked at me like no one - or everyone was ignoring me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like at home? True or not true?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know about that. Maybe, yeah, maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you feel that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you mean now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and then. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I guess I always felt that no one took my problems seriously. But I don't know maybe I am just making that up now. I can say that about now and through high school but I don't remember really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't care about way back when really; it is more important how you feel now. And you certainly do feel like no one is taking you seriously. Well, now not seriously is not the word, it is more like  - ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is more like I think, like I want to say that everyone is persecuting me sort of but then I feel like it must be something worth persecuting. I mean, I don't know, I don't, I can't - it was just that same feeling like I only have a certain number more days left and you can get through that. And it is the same thing I did at camp and I think it is the same thing I do with anything when it gets me down and now I feel like it is all it is ever going to be. Looking at things like just a few more days and you are going to get through it but then it's through it into what? </p>

<p>6:14</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you just have another one of those things again. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you give me another example of that I'm having a hard time getting a hold of that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am too; it's not coming out right. Let's see, well I guess what - first of all it's that - see there are so many things that I'm trying to say. Like even with student teaching, like I can't divorce what is happening in there from what is happening with everything else, you know what I mean. And I have a tendency to do that I think with a lot of things, like it just sort of takes over. So I go to be thinking about it, I woke up this morning and I was just sort of really scared of the whole thing building up all these fantasies and stuff. And when I go in there, I mean, I know that if I went in there and you came in there to look at me you couldn't - I mean it doesn't look on the surface all that bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's how you feel about it though. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, inside it is just incredibly horrible. But you see, I build it up and I did the same thing in camp; like I build it up so I function less and less and I can't relate very easily with people like these kids in my class. Like if I am in a counselor situation then I will say, "You aren't saying anything, how come?" and I can handle that but I don't, it's like it is like a persecution, like everyone is out to get me, sort of. And I am sure that when they are silent they are all thinking vicious little thoughts and stuff like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some of them are. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, some of them are but not all of them are. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't' have to deal with them. That loud minority or however many there are. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But why can't I handle it, I don't know why they crush themselves, I don't give a shit about them really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd be crushed by that too, why shouldn't you? Who are you not to be crushed in a crushing situation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but see I think I create the crushing situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, there is some truth to that. Choosing that job is one way for example. Why did you take that job, it is an impossible job that you took?</p>

<p>9:25</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was thinking about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was thinking about that to last night driving. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why I did, I know one thing is I don't' look into things really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: True, that is what hit me, true. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't, like that ludicrous ball, I didn't' even know what was going on there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: True. And that's another thing that crossed my head. Why? The question was for me not so much why do you do that because you do that, and a lot of people do that, I do that too. I jump into everything and expect people to like me because I am a good person. And then when they don't then I think I am a bad person. I did that for a long while. 'Now, I haven't changed myself, by the way, very much, I still do that. It is hard for me to change that. I just keep getting knocked down, that's all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know what this is like another thing is that people can destroy me really easily, I think. Like I won't look at the reality of what I am, sort of. Like I can sit and I like to think of myself as having sort of like do my thing and stuff like that and no one else likes it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's not true. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because if none of them like you then you are going to get crushed. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So like, last night I called my masters teacher to find out about this stupid (inaudible 11:07)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's draw on this one for a little while. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Well this has to do with this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I said "I could go like from four weeks to six weeks of teaching and I will be finishing up after five weeks," and she said, "Chicken." And like she was only kidding and I was like, when she said that I said to her, "You think that really?" I was really cool but right then I was ready to go an extra week of that horrible torture just so that someone wouldn't think I wasn't a chicken. </p>

<p>11:41</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm kind of surprised you didn't say, "Fuck off" because you do that sometimes. I wonder why you didn't do it that time? Well, she has authority over you, that's why and that is harder. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah she is an ineffective role model, you know, she is not someone I want - I can think of five other people who have more strength. But do you see that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: For a minute I was honestly going to do that and like it wasn't me that counted at all. It was them and this asshole who I don't even care about and I don't respect t all in any sort of way. She said as a joke chicken and I was ready to say, "Well, I'll do it six weeks." Like I don't' mean anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right, so there is a moral there somewhere, what do you think it is? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think that I honestly don't think that I mean anything or very much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you really don't. I have a different moral. Make it so that you do mean something and you should do something for yourself. There are two ways to go with this; one way is -there are at least two ways. You are in a bad situation that is a reality, everything has lead me to believe that high school kids don't learn anything in high school no matter what happens and two why teachers don't teach black kids today. That is a reality; you are in a bad situation. Survival is the best you can do. Okay. It has nothing to do with who you are, except that you are white. </p>

<p>13:44</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but it does. I mean it would be a cope out for me to say that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, why is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because there are other people, white kids in black situations who are making it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, name one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: People in the program are. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't believe you. Have you seen it with your own eyes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What makes you think so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel that anyone else can do anything better than I can. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's it, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. See I have no, I want to say I have less and I could have said maybe the first time I was in here I don't know when it was anymore and I want to say that it was this place has knocked me down so many times that I have less resilience than I ever did but I don't' think that is true I think that I have always been that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. That is something about choosing this situation. Two things about today: One is that you tend to rush into things without thinking about how you are going to make out, you, will it be good for you. And the second thing is you beat the hell out of yourself. You expect things of yourself that superman couldn't do. And then when you don't get it you say, "Mmmm, I must be terrible." If you would at least say I guess I'm not superman that would be okay but you don't stop there. You are no good at anything. You can't do anything anymore. Maybe you could make clay bunnies, but other than that; do you see what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are in a horrible situation; I would be scared to go in there too. Well, not anymore because I have failed so many times I could fail again. </p>

<p>15:37</p>

<p>PATIENT: See that is what I can't accept, that has been instilled in me to and that is why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say "that" what has been instilled?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, you can't accept failure; when you fail it is always your own fault, it is not the situation.</p>

<p>15:57</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's never the situation. It is your fault. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you didn't work hard enough; you didn't put enough into it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah-hah. That reminds me of when I brought home the report card with all A's on it and my mother said, "Can't you do better?" </p>

<p>PATIENT: No my mother would say, "What, did everyone get all A's?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah right of course, like it's not that-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It must this must be an easy teacher. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there is some way to undo it, to undo your success. So then you choose things that if you make it through this one then there is no way that they couldn't say, or give you some praise. But they will find a way not to do it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You see I'm - yeah, my father said to me, "Don't go into an all black school you aren't going to be able to handle it." And so I had to go in there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I had to show him I could handle it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact I always thought that they considered me the dumbest. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and you want to show them that you aren't, you want their praise. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It ain't worth it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not; I can honestly say that it's not. You know, I wonder if also I do want to fail just to see if I fail one more time they will accept the failure. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would failing - what would the criteria of failing be? How can you even tell that you failed? I think you were already told that but how can you tell?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean in this situation I'm in now? I guess I just feel this hostility with the kids like in this one class and the snide comments and stuff like that. See I hate that, I can't stand the people who, and maybe I am one of them and I've never been able to accept that, who just sort of are followers and get crushed and care about what other people feel like, and get involved with peer group pressure and all that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everybody (inaudible 18:17) that is what makes me feel bad that you are really caught and you don't see that. You keep thinking of yourself that you did it. The ironic part about that is that all the evidence was built up in that building that you go to everyday that says that you are in a no win situation. And it has nothing to do with who you are. Whether you are terrible or fantastic you would have pretty much the same outcome. That has been proven in the building you are going to everyday, I can show you the research. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Next time I will try and bring it to you so that you can do a reality thing; all right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but there is still that thing like why it effects me so strongly? It does not paralyze other people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not the question; the question is why do you think you are the only one who is paralyzed by the situation. Why do you think that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Well no wait, because I don't care if they are or not really but you sort of get comfort in feeling like everyone else has the same problems too maybe. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More than that you get to feel that it isn't your problem. It is not your problem. That is the problem that you think it is your problem when it is not. You take on problems that aren't yours. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, why can't I divorce myself? I mean I can come in here and say things to you and it sounds really good and sort of, and then tomorrow morning I am going to be physically sick before I go in there. My stomach will be turning and I will hate every damn thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I wish I could suspend us now until you had to make another big decision and then what I would like to do is before you make another big decision whether you know me or not or whether I am still seeing you or not I want you to call me no matter where I am at and talk to me so I can get at how you feel. I get a sense of you not acting on what is best for you, or - that is not quite true either but not realizing how hard a situation you went into or set yourself up for. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't, I don't honestly realize that. No, but you know see I did the same thing last quarter that I couldn't talk in class and I was sure that everything I said was really, really stupid and I just was, I really couldn't handle to work here. And I had reached the point that I was sort of, with the exams and papers, they were paralyzing and the fear and that and I got my grades back and I got A's. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It must have been an easy teacher. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that probably was it. Like, "What were they thinking?" Well you see I do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should like you as much as I like you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then we could stop. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I have to always internalize stuff and pull me down. </p>

<p>22:01</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should you get sympathy if you fail?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that's what I want if I fail? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That didn't hit the point. That's not it  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: There is this one thing that sort of goes through my mind </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just had a flash, but go ahead. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just thinking about saying that is going back to that whole thing of like it must relate, ironically, to that feeling that I am not happy and I think that I should be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you should be and I know why you should be. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I look good on paper kind of so I should be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh sure, but too bad it doesn't work that way. I did the same thing in grade school. I looked real good on paper and in graduate school. You are in a miserable situation, but it won't always be that way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, I feel like it will be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't understand - I'm trying to think of how you could have chosen a harder situation and I can't think of one. And you have to keep saying in your head that you are in a very bad situation and then okay, if you accept that then where do we go from there and we can do this. You are in a no win situation for a while and it has nothing to do with you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No but you see I'm the one who creates that no win situation and I'm going to do it somewhere else or with something else. I will create it in a personal situation, I'll create it in another teaching situation, I'll create it in any situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I mean, I hate it. </p>

<p>25:21</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's try another tactic. Tell me what you want to do now. Let's say you had no obligations here teaching what would you do? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Go to France or something like that or do something physical with my hands like farming; I just sort of like that sort of stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then why don't you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think one thing is sort of that I would be doing it alone and I am afraid of that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you ever been to France?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is an interesting fantasy? </p>

<p>PATIENT: But then I would have to come back. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be another one of those situations. It would get you away from some things but I think there would be no chance or little chance of resolving your personal thing. Zero, zilch chance. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there would be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, have had therapy so I am speaking as an authority. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I meant like left the country and just to get away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Think about it with your eyes closed. And if you went to France it would be even father away, that's the point. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I know why because I feel like I'm still going to have to deal with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you'll have to deal with it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and there is a chance that - you see I am just in a fail frame of mind. I'd fail in a personal relationship right now, I just know it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's okay to feel like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can't, I just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are going to fail a lot in that by the way probably, for a while. But that is okay. I mean what I am saying is that your standards are so fucking high that it is amazing. You don't give yourself any chance to win. </p>

<p>PATIENT: None. So I just get this feeling that I am more and more inadequate. </p>

<p>28:36</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are we going to do with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We have to figure something out? I don't know. I mean the fantasies, like I create incredible - like I'm taking these kids to this movie this afternoon, we got some free passes to see Love Story which they all want to see. Well, this is that very, very hostile crowd so I fantasize that I will go in there and no one will speak to me. They are all going to be in one group which won't, I'm sure happen at all but that is my fear thing. I couldn't' even think of this as a chance to see the movie free and not pay for it or any of that shit. You see the kids outside the classroom and maybe the new dynamic but I can't see any of those positive things.</p>

<p>29:57</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When are you going?</p>

<p>PATIENT: After this at about 12.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You need to be keeping in touch with those things you do out there. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I am keeping in touch?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I want you to. Because if I didn't have anything to do I would go with you, okay but I can't but I'll give you what I call play acting. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Play acting?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know what play acting is? What play acting is that we go out and go through it and we see how you feel doing it and process that; that is play acting. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You see because like, it just really it affects everything else sort of like I have done. There is just this like guy in one of my English classes that I am really attracted to and it is one of the few people that I haven't I have met him for coffee a few times and he had gone away for a weekend on some crunchy granola thing and stuff like that and all of a sudden I didn't want to see him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like I just felt like class is such a fucking mess over there at school and I was just sure that I was a fucking mess and I'd rather have as few people know as possible. Like maybe that wasn't why, I don't know</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I think that is right. It sounds right to me; that's okay if you don't want people to know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but see I was reading all this stuff and I was really getting in to it and I liked a lot of it and I thought I would like to play that because it was good but it was that whole thing of like why I couldn't talk to that woman about what was happening over there because I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that your supervisor?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't want people to know that I am doing a shitty job. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should do that with people you trust. That would be good for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it seemed like it was good for you to talk to her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You need more of those kinds of people. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I guess I don't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is that group going by the way? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Fine, I can get the people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, in a couple, maybe three weeks. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It should be definite then. And that would be a good one for you. If I can get you into that it will help. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But that doesn't explain why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't matter. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is not the problem, you are doing it so it is not the why; you never know why. The why keeps shifting all the time as you grow. There is a million of reasons in other words and why is not the important part, the important part is that you do it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems like the older I have less and less confidence in who I am and what I mean. </p>

<p>34:03</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are really down on yourself again, huh? You don't seem quite as panicked but you don't seem more hopeless; is that right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If I just had one thing that I really cared about, one person or one sort of like a job or like I really don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's sort of like it is going bad all over. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I never really had either I don't think. There has never been anything that, I don't think, like I get scared to care maybe. I never have cared and I think that really is strange to be this old and not have had that happen. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really is strange. You do a mistake in here. Let me tell you your mistake. You hold back your tears in here and I with you wouldn't do that all the time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I really wanted to cry Monday and I guess I should have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It hit my why you do that too, I think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do that for the same reason that you didn't want to talk to your supervisor. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't want you to see how hurt I am?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, the same reason you didn't want to go see the guy with the granola anymore. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, probably. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you ought to try me out a little bit, try to let some new things in here and see what happens. Take a chance. Don't hold back in here that is all I'm saying. If you feel like crying, do it, if you feel like hitting me do it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not good at that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know that is why I am goading you. </p>

<p>36:45</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't feel like crying or anything today. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to cry either. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 37:04) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, you had a good cry in there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I definitely felt like I got a lot more positive reinforcement. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you cry in there? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I didn't say anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing happened. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and that is another thing. I was the worst one. I thought I was a freak. And I was so sick and I was very uncomfortable in there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hate to take away your allusion but you are just not that sick. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No, I'm not but I think I could be. Like you know, I think there are a lot of things that I need to straighten up that are preventing me from being happier. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would like to see you get into your sickness because your sickness is not very bad. It doesn't scare me in the least. Sometimes sickness scares me but you, zilch. I'm afraid that you are a light case. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not though. I'm really not a light case. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To you, no. And now you are mad at me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean you have no right, you don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Plus, you know what is, how can you say who is sicker than another? It isn't the same feeling of sickness. Do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>38:38</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get the feeling that your feelings are very intense but you are not very sick. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you see - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do some dumb things, that is for sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you kidding my life has been one dumb thing after another. You know, like I just feel like I am getting scared that I can't cope with things; that I am less and less able to cope with things. Like things just sort of - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a flash on you or a fantasy. My fantasy is of you opening a hot dog stand at Woodlong (ph 39:15) 24 hours a day. And then it wouldn't work and you would think you are terrible. Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. You see what is sad is that - it's like, you see on the other hand I want you to think I am perfect. This is what I do in personal relationships and that is why I think it is hard for me to get near people because then they realize that I am not. Like I seem to sort of project a sort of - well you probably won't think this but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you project?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This sort of, you know, cool, can take things in stride. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you project that; I think you project that very well. </p>

<p>40:35</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't think underneath. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it would take and expert to see that wasn't true. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Underneath I am just scared of a lot of things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and you hide that from people. You would be a hell of a lot better off if you showed your nervousness a little bit more. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like put yourself out there to get killed, like, people kill people who come off all cool. Like, I know I have been killed many times trying to look cool. You have to act more like you feel. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it's hard. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just do it a little bit. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I know I have to and I find that it  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm a little nervous today because I don't' feel like I am coming across the way I really want to, can anyone help me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I just don't know what they would do with that one. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The other class is you have is all right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not that bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that class doesn't count, right. That must be an easy class. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah, I'm thinking to myself, it could be better. You see, right; like it could be really bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have a lot of guts too and you don't notice that though. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I thought I use to in some situations. I don't know now though. See, I think I want to be less sensitive, but I don't' know how to. Like things shouldn't' bother me, certain things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let's forget about that. Let's get at the moral of who you are since we are getting closer to that. It is like, a more useful thing is to know that you are scared and you don't tell people you are scared. You should say that more often. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, then I feel like, so what, they are going to feel like they have this big responsibility. You see I have that, I think I have a real problem with feeling like I am imposing on people so I would rather just kind of, in front of everyone play it cool and seem to be all right and just hide it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is a good way of taking care of yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. It is a good way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you ought to know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I ought to know; I do that a lot. I don't know why I keep on doing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When was the last time you had a date?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Last weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, what night?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Friday night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did it go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was horrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Horrible, why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was boring. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you go out with someone safe?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Always. See, I don't' have any self confidence left in myself for that. Like I couldn't go in and try and meet people. There are certain people I have seen on campus that I think are really attractive and I never made any effort to meet them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about, "Hi, my name is Jennifer; it's nice to meet you." </p>

<p>PATIENT: I couldn't' do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They would eat right out of your hand. .</p>

<p>44:46</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, they wouldn't; I couldn't do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Take a chance. Ah-ha. I have an idea, see I am (inaudible 44:57) to get you to do this still because I think that issue can hold when you are done with this teaching. I think -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would make me happier though, the teaching, I know like I am an old frustrated dame. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is horrible. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And everything gets focused onto this teaching. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that's terrible. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. I mean if I could have a release somewhere else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm looking at this in two ways. In one way I'm saying, "She has had it hard enough now so why make it harder." That is going to be shitty no matter what happens. Maybe we can do or invent a diversion. I have a diversion in my head. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What is it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know where these guys are and at what time; you know where you can meet them. You know how to find them and at what time exactly. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And we should go and you should go try it and I will push you into it. I won't let you chicken out. And then if you get I'll be there but and if you get killed I'll fire myself over one student. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is a good idea. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It does, it sounds good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is a damn good idea. Why don't we do it? You know what you have to allow yourself; you have to allow yourself 100 failures with men. You are going to have to grope around a lot; it is not going to be easy. Right? It really is not and you are going to have failures and you are going to have intense feelings and maybe this magical love thing and you will probably chicken out or you will cry and all that. You will have a lot of that until you finally hit, but we should do that maybe and then we could process it and maybe try a different way. And I think it will constantly get better. But the first times are going to be hard and you are going to make an ass out of yourself and you will feel foolish and all that, but you have to understand that is how it happens. It will be hard for you and it doesn't mean that you are evil or no good because you will make a wonderful wife someday. .</p>

<p>47:22</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is what I have done since I gone here, you know, just gone or stayed with people who just don't turn me on at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you avoid guys who turn you on. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You're right; exactly. And like now I say I don't even want to see guys or anything like that because I have so many other problems. I don't want the bullshit that is one reason I know why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, since your work situation is so bad how could anyone expect you to go in the other direction too; even I was thinking that way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: See that is what - I would rather like not be rambled at all and not try to meet guys and fail. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess that is the other thing that if they get to know me they won't like me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are going to fail, god damn it, and you have to accept that you are going to fail. I learned that lesson the hard way and I learned a lot later than you have a chance of learning. I learned it when I was about 27 or something. I learned it in an interesting way. There ways this guy whose name was Buster Casey and he use to do shows around the city and I did shows. Every time I saw him he was with a different beautiful woman and I thought he must really have something going, what does he do? How does he do that? Not that there were any around, like where does he find them? Then I got to meet him personally and I found out how he did it. He would get turned down 100 times a week but after all he developed an incredible sense of that and sometimes in three minutes he knew whether it was going well or not. So he just tried 100 times until it just rolled off his back like water. And so I said, "I think I will try that because it looks like it works." And it was very hard to try. I always felt inadequate and cheap and like you do. But then I felt that way for a long time, a couple of years, like two years, and then it started to reverse itself; the odds were shifting. It was like 98 to 2, you know, like the balance shifted and then I got to another bad thing I got into it so strong so that then if there was a pretty girl I was still afraid and I would punish myself if I wouldn't. And there wasn't a pretty girl that went by at the bar that I wouldn't or I couldn't and I was exhausted but otherwise I would punish myself. Now I can give up both of those things, I can take or leave it. But at sometime you are going to have to get into taking it and it might be better while you are seeing me then when you are not seeing me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that would be really good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I wish you would do it. I can't do that for two weeks. But you can try that on your own, by the way. </p>

<p>51:11</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can try it with this guy in my English class. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The granola guy? No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This has to be someone you like. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the granola guy. He is really attractive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is his name? No, I don't want to know his name. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He is really attractive though, he has a really great body and that was the first thing that struck me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have some really nice qualities going in your favor. Now imagine the problem if you were ugly, then we would have a problem or not intelligent or you had a handicap. The only handicap you have is your feelings and your conflict of feeling torn and being afraid of intrusion and getting abused and used. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I have a feeling of being used. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So be used, be a social worker. </p>

<p>52:19</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but you know you are 100 percent right, I have had this fucking thing -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's a fucking thing?</p>

<p>(laughter) </p>

<p>PATIENT: I meant my school situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: This is my main focus, but partly because there is nothing else, there really is nothing other than that. So if I fail there then I fail at everything. There is no one I am relating to, there is no one I care about, I have no one I can express myself sexually with and plus on top of it these little black bitches can't stand me. Like what is up? </p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm laughing because I have hope for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, there is possibility. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Slim. Yeah, I think so too. It is just that - see that whole thing that I make it big. Like if there is someone that I like and he rejects me it is like huge and it doesn't roll off my back. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It won't for a while. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I guess what I am doing is not doing anything to help it and it will make it worse. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it won't make it easier. Things get harder after 35. How old are you, 22?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is about time you did something in that psycho sexual area. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But be careful, let me warn you about something. Contraception is a good idea. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I realize that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As a matter of fact if the pill was really safe for ten years I would advise you to get on it now but it's not you can only use it for three years safely and you don't want to blow those three years now, because you will want to use it someday. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you can use other things. How are you going to do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How will you protect yourself when the time comes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I probably wouldn't think about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is the point; that is why I am brining it up. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that would be, that is my excuse for not sleeping with anyone and I know that. And too I think that I would jump into the situation and just hope. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it is really up to you to protect yourself, the guy won't do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, sometimes I do and sometimes I don't. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I figure that I wouldn't do anything until I want to sleep with someone like when I am fifty. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hold for a minute. </p>

<p>(Footsteps, sounds like walking out of the room)</p>

<p>(Door closes)</p>

<p>(Footsteps return to the room.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You are giving these to me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>56:59</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why are you giving them to me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just put them in your purse. I don't want you to get pregnant while you are under treatment. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm scared. Oh my god. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not old enough. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That is how I'm feeling, like, "Oh my god." Yeah it makes me scared. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? Talk about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well all of a sudden it makes it real kind of. And I feel like I can intellectualize it and it is cool and all that stuff but when it's me I feel like I can't hold it in my hand. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you ever held on in your hand?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, and I have never seen - no I have seen one. But yeah, I'm scared. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me tell you what my message there is, my message is not that you should go out and get laid tonight, that is not what I am saying at all; nor even in the next six months if you do when you feel ready but damn it if you do -</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think I am ready. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not ready yet and you don't feel ready. You just told me you felt scared that you are not ready. But if you do get ready real quick and especially if the guy is good, if the guy is good he can get you ready very quickly, if he is not good he won't. By the way, it won't be fun too much right away. As a matter of fact he probably won't get penetration the first time. You'll say okay, now I'm going to do it and he will get frustrated and he will think you are awful and a lousy lover. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I would like it to happen while I am seeing you. Don't you think?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That wouldn't be bad. The interesting thing is - remember the first time you smoked grass?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing happened right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, it's the same with sex. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's an interesting way of looking at it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That happens to be true, it's not always true but more often it is true than not and you want to tell him that you are a virgin by the way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'd have to right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, not necessarily. You could come off cool; you could do the cool thing, you've done that before. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I do in that situation. It is almost like I want to screw with you, that is how I come across, but I'm actually petrified and have never done it before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you could fool them damn it, you could fool them. And then if you get into a game playing thing like that it won't be good. You need to be straight with him damn it, be straight with him. The guy could be very tender if you are straight. Take a chance, don't bullshit him. You lie a lot by the way. That is what I think you do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think you are right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A lot. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A real lot? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When it comes to this business you do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not saying you are a liar, that is not what I am saying but you're phony as hell when it comes to sex. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you're right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everyone like you is that way - the things I am saying to you are so god damn characteristic that I'm sorry you don't have a rare disease. </p>

<p>60:54</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you are straight with the guy and he likes you, you need to get a sense that he really likes you and cares for you then damn it be straight with him. You don't have to go to bed with him. I'm not saying that but say you are afraid to go to bed with him and tell him how you feel. Now that might be a disaster ten times in a row but it will be a disaster a lot longer if you are not straight. You don't have to go to bed with him, if you feel like you want to tell him you feel like you want to. I mean that is not the first thing you say like, "Hello my name is Jennifer I feel like I want to go to bed with you." But like when that is appropriate you need to tell him both parts. And there are at least two parts. You are scared and petrified and the other part is I'm sitting here with my knees crossed just thinking about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I am. That is very interesting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think I picked that up because I am perceptive but I picked it up because I have seen it a million times. You are a garden variety type problem. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What is that though? I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not - the point is that and you are going to feel like all those things that you always feel but you can work it out. If you have a disaster which you may have or a series of disasters, your feelings may go and you may have a hard time with your feelings and may get hysterical and cry and wail and pound your head against the wall, call me, day or night, call me. Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. That did though, when you gave this to me, it sort of blew my mind, I thought oh my god. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And by the way if anyone said I gave that to you I would deny it in public. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have enough trouble. Oh, by the way, interesting enough let me give you a clue. If the guy is not prepared to be and he doesn't have anything then he is as afraid as you are; you are both in the same boat. If a guy does not come prepared to go to bed with you I mean they all have rubbers with them, helmets, or condoms or whatever you call them then he is exactly where you are at and then you really ought to share your feelings. Well you ought to anyway. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What I can't stand it the person who still wants to use you and is so prepared for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am always prepared even though I am living with someone I am always prepared and have them on me; always. And let me tell you sex is not that beautiful. Sex for fun is not that bad. Albert Ellis once said, at the American Psychological Association convention, he said, "Look, there are three things you're going to have, nothing, you are going to have sex and you are going to have sex with love." And he said, "When I'm hungry if I can only have ice cream I'll take it, I would rather have the chocolate sundae, but ice cream is okay." </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're awfully hungry. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I am but I couldn't handle it without love, really, I don't think right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not saying you should I don't want to determine that. I mean I can handle it without love. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you are more sure of what it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is true, but that didn't come easy for me; not at all. If you get some - come to that thing tomorrow at 3 o'clock. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you can get some sense of who I am. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I have to go. </p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because, ah, don't touch them.  Okay because people would like bang the wall and they'd come flying off of there.  And I keep having to look at [INAUDIBLE] weighs about 6 pounds and that would hurt if he fell on me.  All right well let me, um, let me talk to your dad for a second.  Okay?  You want to go out?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Go [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they're not doing anything?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are they doing there?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What's that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At the school [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, yeah.  I mean he's just got a kid that's, um, that's kind of a bully.  He's a big kid and just picking on him.  He's a, his mom works there so he's kind of gets special.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The kid's mom?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah the kid's mom works there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh geez.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] class but, ah, yeah.  [PATIENT NAME] been trying to avoid him so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's not been a big deal but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The kid pushed him a little bit.  I guess they're getting to that age.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do did anybody see it or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  They wrote up an incident report.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did it say accurately what happened?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	"Yeah cause the guy, the, the teacher in the afternoon is real protective of [PATIENT NAME]. "</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So that was kind of [INAUDIBLE] issues and stuff but yeah.  I mean he's just having a hard time, ah, knowing how to react to that.  Kids can be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but it's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] he can deal with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So his mood is really stable.  That's excellent.  Um, that is really good.  Um, he's very, ah, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	High functioning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah high functioning.  I mean he's, today I mean he was very, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Lucid?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You can, that's better if you say those words.  Very, I mean no he's very interactive and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know and not, appropriate is not the right word cause he's not inappropriate but he just really was kind of, um, you know, he's curious and he's, you know, he's, ah, he just, he looks good.  He looks like he's, you know, doing well, stable.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, he'll listen.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's kind of neat.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, I wanted to say something else so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Oh later.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll do that in a minute.  I'll have to wait a second.  So are you, um, are you getting married soon or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Early March.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, not that soon.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right well that's nice.  All right well let, let's leave him, um, oh he's taking, he's, he's okay we'll leave him on what he's on.  And the Risperdal is good and he seems to be doing well on just that.  So that's excellent.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And not, not too much problems with compulsions or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Stuff's a lot better.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  His teacher said he's probably the best behaved kid in the class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I mean you really, he like, wants to it appears, he likes to please people and wants to be good and happy and [INAUDIBLE].  I'm glad he's happy, but he wants to do what's right and stuff.  It must be real hard with that other kid picking on him and.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well we'll keep things the same and I guess we've been doing this every 3 months, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

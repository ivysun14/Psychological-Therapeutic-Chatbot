<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so how's your mom, is she still around?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's doing good.  I mean still the same.  More problems at home, it's getting ugly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's happening?  All right, tell me so I can figure it out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> See, my daughter left her fourth husband now, so she has her two kids plus four from the state that she has, so she had to get a house, okay, when she moved away from him, so she took all of our savings and gave it to her to put as down payments and all this kind of stuff and now she's mad because we don't have any money and I says what do you want me to do, I said I am 100% disability, if I go out and start working, they're going to start analyzing my case and if I have it taken away, there's no way we'll get it back and so -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did she do this without telling you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She told me, she just told me she was doing it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That, you know, she hates me, you know, despises, if I had someplace else to go I'd leave right now and I said well don't let the ass, you know.  I said you can't live by yourself anyhow, I make more money than you, I could live here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But you couldn't live here by yourself, you know, it's just, I just, it's like this, she's off Saturday and Sunday, I despise those days, despise them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because there's so much fighting and all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Tension.  Yeah, I feel like a little kid, you know, afraid to do anything to get hollered and screamed at and it's getting to the point, I'm getting real real tired of it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well now if your daughter was okay and lived in another state, would we still have this problem you think?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She has no money, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No but I mean, suppose your daughter was financially okay and didn't need anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, we wouldn't have the problem.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like Christmas, we didn't have a good, couldn't buy everybody, you know, the Christmas presents.  I said where are we supposed to get the money and she wants me, you know, we don't have, we burnt them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh that's good, that's good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She wants me to go and hit my mom's checking accounts to give her money to bring us back to where we were and I won't do it.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I thought your sister had charge of that anyway.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She does, I can't get into it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's time for your wife to rein it in, I mean she isn't realistic. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I understand where she's coming from but what the hell do you want me to do, you know, it's just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then, you know, talking about prescriptions, I'm in a hole now, you know, the donut hole you're in.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, Seroquel is 506 bucks, I  can't afford to pay that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well I can give you as much as I can.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, I just went last time, I've been on the ones that you gave me to carry me through but I haven't been taking my 800 mg either.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How much are you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Some days I take 4, some days I take 6, you know, which I didn't even know anything about a donut hole, I didn't -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you reached it already, holy shit.   When's the year start?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mine starts in April.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, oh, oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, plus they hit me up for all that meds, you know, because of my knee surgery.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They put that on there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Geez, so you got to it fast.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I jumped into it and they said there's one other one that I'm taking that costs, don't cost me a lot but it's a lot towards the -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, are you still taking the Lexapro?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Lexapro, Xanax, blood pressure medicine - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Seroquel.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Seroquel, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well we could switch the Lexapro to the drug that was the precursor of Lexapro, Citalopram, that seems to be working and that's a lot cheaper, that's a true generic, that's one of those $4 ones. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but do you want to play?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean I've done this with a lot of people because of the same reason, you know, Lexapro is expensive, it's sort of a luxury, it's nice but it's probably ten times more than, you know, it's twenty times more than the other, so try it and we'll give you a little extra dosage because it might be weaker so, you know, we'll cover that right away, so you'll need two Citalopram and I'll see, you know, get as much Seroquel as I can.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I couldn't believe, because I went down there to pay for it, usually, that's how I was getting through, like I told her, I says I paid for my medicine all year long by writing a check and I took a, you know, and her sister gave, I wrote a big check out, right, so I've been dwindling it down, you know, paying gas, going and buying dog food, you know, my prescriptions, yadda, yadda, yadda, you know.  It's dwindling down and she's been, like yesterday there was a bill for rehabilitation for my knee still coming in, okay, it was $137.42, she's says, throws it to and here, pay it, find the money to pay for it and I says I will.  I says if you want me to, I says the direct deposit of my check, my social security check, I'll open a bank and put my check right in there and you live on your stuff and I'll pay for half of mine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, did she go for that?  What does she make, minimum wage or something?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, she makes about, she makes 22-23,000 a year, 10.75 or 11.25, something like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What did you and your sister do, decide to take so much a year each out of the money or something?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  She hasn't called me since, she used to call me at least once a week, she don't talk to me no more.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The only person that talks to me is my brother.  Like I try to tell her, my, it's hard relating to my sister because my sister's business has been very very profitable for a lot of years, okay, and they just have her and her husband and, you know, cocker spaniels, okay.  They live in a big ass house, got boats and fancy BMWs, you know, I said [NAME OTHER], if it was me, if it was you and I was, you know, incapable of working due to whatever problem that I had, you know, I would let you have whatever money you needed, you know, to maintain at least a halfway decent, you know, living standard so you wouldn't have to drop all the way down in the dirt and I wouldn't think a thing of it, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, me too, I mean - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I says, well they says we have to think of mom, I says wait a minute, I says mom could live to be 90 years old and we wouldn't be able to spend all her money, you know, $3500 a month for her sitting over there, you know, and I says, they says well you know I'd like to have some too, I said I know you would.  I said but the idea is, you know, who, I can't pay for all the stuff that I am in need, I'm not talking about wants, I'm talking about needs that need to be covered, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I just don't know, I just don't know, it's just not right, dah, dah, dah.  I says who's talking about it, we're not talking about right and wrong, I said we're talking about just, you know, what is the right thing to do period. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's your bother, is he okay with it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Never breaches the subject, never.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So he's doing all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, he just got, he used to be the head of children's family services up there in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now he's the head of the, they just promoted him, I guess they promoted him, he's the commission for the elections now for the county.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Pretty good job.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He makes his own kickback before you retire, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, well I mean, he don't need any money.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, my sister in law, you know, the both of them, the state sent my brother for his masters, sent my sister in law for her masters and doctorate degree so she works in a high school.  She's the head of the high schools in [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, [DEIDENTIFIED], the head guidance counselor, so she's in charge of the schools and stuff like that so she's not hurting any.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Well, maybe you could, is there any way you could propose and get your brother to back it up, okay, we all get 500 a month out of there.  I don't care what, 300 a month but everybody gets some, someway you could have something coming, you know, predictable.  You know how much is in there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but my sister has it too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean you're going to have to sell it to her.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She sold all the [DEIDENTIFIED] and is sitting on it, there's a chunk of change.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well it's there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well how much does your mother, your mother has social security income, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How much is that do you think?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's a little bit over a $1000 because her raise just got through and that's direct deposited and she has an insurance annuity that brings her in $272 a month and then she has [DEIDENTIFIED] retirement that brings in $800 a month, you know -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So she only needs about $1200 a month it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Something like that, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And that would translate to $14,000 a year, something like that.  So to generate $15,000 a year, she got, is it worth $200,000, the whole thing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What, what she has?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Three hundred, yeah, I guess 300 would be better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Between the stock, I think she has about half a million dollars.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So there's 200,000, so 300,000 could generate the money she needs to live there, easy, easy, with any kind of modest investment, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I don't know how long she's going to live either.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, well first of all, it's more sophisticated than this but you don't touch the 300, now you can propose something about the other 200.  Let's suppose that generated 12,000 a year, so that's 4,000 each a year under my basic simple plan.  Or you could argue, a little further, actually you can take, the advisors say of your base money, you can take also 3% of the principal every year but, well, so leaving 300 is plenty.  So even if people agreed to, well that's only 4,000 a year but I don't care if they agree to 6,000 a year each or 500 a month, then you can say if you don't need yours, leave it in there but I need it.  So in other words, say this is fair, we don't touch what she needs to live on.  I don't know what else to tell you, I mean it sounds fair to me and it comes to, okay, you guys don't need it but I do, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My sister has a tough shit mentality.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well the other way is -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because prior to that point, you know I was dipping into it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How much did you take out of there, I mean you know they know that, 50?  Of course, this is why you did that but -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Over the last two and half years, probably 50,000 but I don't have anything to show for it, that's why I wanted to get it out of my hands, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I get bored at home, you know, nothing to do, I go write a check, go to, you know, [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, go the fish for my salt water tanks, you know, this, that, it just - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Trickled away, you didn't go to [DEIDENTIFIED] or something?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I hate, I never did like gambling, I find it - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, there's still got to be some kind of formula.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There's got to be flexibility and I don't think my sister is going to give me any flexibility which is fine, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean you've got, maybe you've got -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, my wife is the one that's, I just don't know what to, I just don't know what to do and if there is anything to do right now except let things run it's natural course.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, have some garage sales or something but - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We already had that shit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, all right.  I don't know what you can do, I mean you're allowed to make what, $9,000 on social security or something like that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but I'm just wondering, you know, I'm so precarious about, you know, the majority of it's because of my mental disabilities.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It doesn't matter, I have people that do it.  This one girl amazes me, she really can't work, nobody would want her but she gets jobs as like a nursing assistant and she last a week to a month and then she'll get fired but she keeps going back and trying.  Well, she never makes the 9,000 but she's been doing this for years, I mean so they're reporting, you know, they're taking social security and all out of her pays, they never bother her.  I have a couple guys, they say, they plan, I'm going to work right up to like 7,000 and then quit so whoever they work for knows that up front, you know, it does happen.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I had that happen when I was with [DEIDENTIFIED], the door greeters that used to be retired, you know - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm working up to, you know, October then I've got to leave.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I don't know, I mean that's a possibility, you could do something, because I think at your age they wouldn't bother you really.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You don't think social security would start snooping around.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I mean all it is, they don't snoop anybody or go look after anybody ever, you know, that's private disability insurance people, yeah, they do that but, you know, they just cross check, you know, their records with the income tax people and then see if you're there or not, that's all they do, so you could consider it.  Hell, you'd be getting it at 62 or something anyway if you wanted to, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Social security.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I get it now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I know, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know when it drops, at 62 or 65.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can do it at 60, well you might be 63, yeah, you know, they're raising it, like mine is 65 1/2 or some shit like that, I'm not going to take it but, well it's the only other way you could get some money.  It should help, let's do that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I need Xanax.  I think you gave me one but I can't find it.  But see, the worst part about it, she's turning the whole, her side of the family, you know, against me and I hate that.  She's setting up her weapons.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you talk to them much anyway or - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't talk to them much anyhow, except when, you know, we get together but you can tell there's like a -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> See but none of them know the whole story.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, obviously.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she's not going to go and blame herself.  She blames me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, probably both of you dug the whole, you know. I mean she somehow directly or indirectly spent some of that money too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Indirectly. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where the hell's my, I have to get another -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is that Seroquel?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is that Seroquel?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah but I'm going to give you some.  Now if you've been getting by with the average of say 600 mg, then try to do that, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I stretch it.  So who's going to win, think the [DEIDENTIFIED] are run the board?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah but I wouldn't mind betting on the [DEIDENTIFIED].  The last thing I saw was 13 1/2 points. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'd take that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, because they played in a pretty good game a while ago.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The only thing about [NAME OTHER] when he gets in that, you know, he pressures himself and forces balls, he's done that, that's the reason he's, you know, he hasn't been back to the super bowl for a long time, he just presses.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean he does but when he's not pressed he's just fantastic.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Relaxed, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He can throw some shit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think they'll still keep him around for one more year to teach the next guy, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Who is the next guy?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know who they got, I don't really pay attention to them. It's like, who's our next guy, [NAME OTHER]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I would think so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well, blowing up at your wife, that's not going to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I don't say a word.  Sometimes, the majority of the time I just go phew or screw you, you know.  [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't get in my car and leave.</p>

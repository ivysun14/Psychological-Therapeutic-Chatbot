<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Anyway, so [PATIENT NAME] in the short time that I first saw you, you're taking the 5 mg of Abilify, you're not having any issues to speak of and - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My eyes are dry.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And your, your eyes feel dry?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Dry.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well sometimes these drugs can have a little bit of a drying effect but I think you're going to acclimate to this drug and, like I said, this is a drug that many people do very well on and what we're trying here to do is to stabilize your mood, we're trying to contribute to your mental health and perhaps lessen the risk of having a relapse of putting yourself into situations that are, you know, make you vulnerable, pose a threat to your health and safety.  You know, we're not trying to make you a dull person, we're not trying to make you feel like a robot but I think you and I both agree there have been, as a result of some changes, that you've compromised yourself in a number of ways and, you know, you are healthy and you are here but not everybody can say that because sometimes they get just put in a bad situation and it ends up biting them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Either dead or, you know, sick or whatever, broke, divorced, whatever, jail, you know, so you're going to, how many sessions did you make so far of the group, just the one?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> One, I have one tomorrow night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have one tomorrow night.  Do you like the group?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, you don't, how come?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There's a woman in there that I've seen in AA, she's pretty crazy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She ticks me off.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There are lots of crazy people out there and you kind of pick and choose who you interact with and who not and it's a good exercise for you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There's some women in there, it was hard for me to understand how a woman would stay with a man that - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not meeting my needs.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we have, everyone has a different threshold.  Some people do it just for the lifestyle, some people do it for the kids, some people do it because they have no self esteem or they don't feel that they have any other resources, some people feel that they don't mind, maybe enjoy being punished in some way, shame, guilt, you know, all kinds of crazy reasons people do all kinds of things but, you know, there's something you can get out of that and you can contribute to the group in some way, you know, it's a very healthy thing and a therapeutic thing.  Nobody wants you to go if you're wasting your time or it's not meeting your needs. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's not a waste of time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you know, you determine that as you go through.  How's work going for you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Excellent.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Very good, that was part of my feeling so high yesterday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm up early, I'm productive.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Doing great, I feel good about my job.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, well I know, I think you've enjoyed this work that you've been doing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, thirteen years I've been doing this job.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's great.  Health has been all right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, my health is fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and how about the drinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not doing it.  Tomorrow I'll have seven months.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, congratulations.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was feeling really good about that and I woke up this morning and I thought about my day.  I did two meetings today, I did a 7 a.m., I felt a little panicked, then I went at noon.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What are you panicked about?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have a lot of awareness of stuff coming, I guess it's with [NAME OTHER] and today thinking about coming in here and coming to [NAME OTHER], but I do feel better on the medicine, more focused and I'm working the steps with this [INAUDIBLE] and she's not an AA nazi or anything and she slowly works with me.  I couldn't handle somebody telling me what to do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, well, I will say this to you [PATIENT NAME], you know, we tend to be, as Americans and maybe Americans living during this time, very impatient people, we want results yesterday.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We want things tied up and bundled neatly.  You know, remember that, hopefully, this is a marathon and not a sprint, you know, you should live a long full healthy life and, you know, you didn't get to this point overnight and it's not likely to get better or go away completely overnight and so as long as you're moving in the right direction and each path you go down you meet, you know, different people and, you know, you take your experiences along the way of this journey that is life and, you know, you learn, it's a learning process, so I think clearly it seems to me that you are moving in the right direction.  We want you to be healthy and stable because, you know, the way life is, we're going to get thrown a curve ball, it's not if it's when and you want to be in a position to handle it so whether it's a relationship or a death or an illness or financial or something else or the end of the world, who knows, you know, it's a matter of you being as healthy as possible to weather that storm and come out on top, you know, so I'm not going to say only the strong survive but I think the stronger you are the better likelihood that it is that you're going to survive and, not just survive but, you know, flourish and do well.  So I want you to look at this as a tool, like AA maybe a tool or group or, you know, your sponsor or somebody that, you know, has an impact on your life.  You know, most people know right from wrong, it's just a matter of, you know, being able to put the breaks on some times and not look back and say how did I do that, why did I do that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There it goes again.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We do a lot of stupid things and a lot of times, you know, it may be part of our biological makeup to do that, you know, we may just be programed that way.  It may be a chemical reason why some people are afraid to do things and other people are very bold.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was kind of freaked when I went last time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why is that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mood swings.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well look, we all have mood swings, there's no doubt about it, you know, you wake up one day and you get good news, you feel great or you wake up some days and don't feel well and you don't know why but we're talking about changes in moods that put us in harms way or - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Boredom, irritable.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, whether, you know, you become agitated and irritable or you become, you just do things that would be uncharacteristic or unwise, I mean you know that comes with the territory when you're 16 and 17 to be that way but not at 40 or 50, you know, it shouldn't be that way, I mean it should be, you know, been there and done that and it's a matter of, you've got to take some risks in life but you don't have to be a fool about, you know, you can gamble, that's okay.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I can't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm just saying.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you do some, you take some chances in life because it's exciting and because that's how you get ahead sometimes, whether it's in business or in relationships what have you but you don't have to be foolhardy and jump in with your eyes closed and bet the house on something that's frivolous or stupid and I think sometimes when you have mood instability that effects your thinking and reasoning, you know, that's how you get into trouble, it puts you in - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When I get in trouble, I don't have to be feeling bad either.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Compromising situations, right.  [PATIENT NAME], you know, I can't send you for a blood test or I can't send you for an x-ray to say this is working or not working like somebody who has a medical illness so I think part of your recognizing that you're doing better is for other people to comment on how well you look or how well you sound or you just have this feeling inside.  You look at what happened in your life that you didn't like and things that you questioned and see if it becomes less of an issue for you that you're more comfortable with things, see how, hopefully, how you can maintain your sobriety and maintain unhealthy or avoid unhealthy relationships and situations that are, you know, likely to hurt you in some way and I think if you, you know, are able to live that way, I think things will just be a whole lot easier for you.  Are you still in that relationship with that other person and, hopefully, that will, you know, work itself out in a way that's productive and healthy and supportive?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's very healthy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, good, well that's great.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's great actually.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's moving out from his house this weekend.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Again, you know, one step at a time.  I think if you see progress and you get positive feedback, I think that's, you know, encouraging and that's easy to kind of, you know, once the ball's in motion, it's kind of tends to be easier than starting from scratch and having to overcome that inertia so I think it should be easy just to kind of keep the rhythm going for you, you know.  All right, so I want you to keep doing what you've been doing.  I want you to call me if you have any questions or problems or comments or concerns.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Fortunately, I had called you and you were nice enough and called back and I kind of worked it out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh actually I know what it was about.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't know if I want to say it on the tape.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That doesn't matter, no one is going to, it doesn't go anywhere.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Somebody listens to it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not really, I mean it's, they're not interested in - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They're just interested in part of the whole -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean it's not -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Giving the medication.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that should not be a concern for you at all, trust me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, how should the medicine affect me sexually?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It shouldn't.  Some medicines like serotonin drugs like Zoloft and Paxil can make it difficult for you to have an orgasm.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I was concerned about.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you haven't had any problems have you because this shouldn't do that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, ones sexual behaviors could be related to anything from, you know, how tired you are to who you're with to, you know, so many different things so, you know, you look at the tends and again, play it one step at a time and see if things continue or whatever, if there's a problem, but it shouldn't be an issue.  So you have, let's see, I saw you three weeks ago, so you have about half a prescription left of the Abilify?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let me give you another prescription for the Abilify for 5 mg and I will plan on seeing you back in about, well I don't even know if I need to see you in six weeks or not but I could see you in six weeks or you could call me as you're nearing the end of that prescription and we can decide whether I would see you the following month or see you in six weeks time.  I don't want to be overly intrusive or forceful in anyway.  I want you to feel like you're in control and you're in the driver's seat and you and I both have a say in the matter and, you know, we're adults and we think about what needs to happen so that you're comfortable and I'm comfortable.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I felt so good yesterday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It really is a roller coaster.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well it's going to be less.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't really think about a day at a time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've been living my life in like 4 hour shifts.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This morning I woke up and I was thinking about going to [NAME OTHER], coming in here to you and it's been my history that if I'm feeling really good, I might start cutting some things out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like what?   Like meetings?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like maybe I don't need to see [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Well look, you know, life is like this, you know, we want to avoid life like this and so we need to kind of -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I do like - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Of course, I mean sure and one of the companies that used to make a product for bipolars, they used to have a picture of a guy literally on the ad was a guy on a roller coaster, you know, the thrill of the, you know, zipping down the roller coaster but then, you know, when things were low, you know, the sadness, the crying, what have you, so -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You really think I am bipolar?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yes, oh yes, but I think you have a milder form of it and I think there's no reason why you should be -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because you asked me some questions the other week and I was just having trouble answering them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Whenever I was in here and after I calmed down and I thought about it, it was yes to a lot of the things that you had asked.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I'll tell you what, I told you before I think the first time I saw you, it takes about five years to diagnose somebody with bipolar because they tend to only come when they're depressed or down and not when they're on the other side of things and not everybody has the super duper highs, some people just have the, you know, not quite as, not the mania but something less severe called hypomania or they may even have just periods of irritability and agitation but I think part of some of your, you know, your drinking behaviors - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sexual - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your sexual behaviors, I think that's all related to some of that.  Look, even - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I miss the drinking.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> People in sales, you know, like realtors and people who sell, a lot of these people tend to be these, they tend towards the bipolar side or ADD side, you know, these people who are very energetic and very emotional people and very, so you know, I think it fits but you know what, I told you before, I'm not ready to close the book on any of this stuff and, you know, we'll give this a course for, you know, eight months, a year, whatever, and we'll see where you are and then we can see about whether or not we want to come down or go off and see what we're left with.  I mean this is not a life sentence necessarily because I think there's more we don't know about this than we do know about it but I think for right now, given your history and your response to both previous medicines and this drug, I think that this is something we should just entertain and keep this out there as a working diagnosis. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> After you're here, it's probably a possibility that my father is bipolar.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I had him, and that was another question I think I was going to ask when I called, I have him seeing the same psychiatrist that was treating me with the antidepressants.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it's not helping him - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> At all.  Could he come in here or would you be able to recommend somebody that he could see.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Whatever.  How old is your dad?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My mother is [AGE] today, so [AGE], she has him as - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Who is she seeing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And he needs somebody that's really going to talk.  I mean you talk, it's not, [NAME OTHER] is not a -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, look, I told you before [PATIENT NAME], I need to do an evaluation when I see somebody and that takes, you know, depending on what's going on, anywhere between, you know, an hour and an hour and a half or whatever.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Excuse me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Then beyond that point, I mean if somebody doesn't want to see me for therapy, I could refer them somewhere else for therapy.  If they don't want to do therapy at all, if I think that it's okay and I'm comfortable with that, I'll say that's fine.  If I really believe that they really need to be in therapy and it's not going to be, you know, have less of a likelihood of success, I'll say look, if you don't want to see a therapist then I can't treat you because I don't want that liability, so sometimes I see people, you know for a full session every week for regular therapy, sometimes I see them for medication only and follow them every three months, sometimes, you know, I see people for both, it's, you know, I have my time to give to you and so, like tomorrow, I'm seeing somebody who,  I've seen him twice and his wife is ready to leave him and his wife said can I come in and see you and I said no, you know, I'm patient but if he wants you to come in with him, so they'll come tomorrow and I set aside a half an hour, you know, a half a session for them instead of a med check up, basically just giving him antidepressants and the wife doesn't think things are happening and wants to dump this guy, you know, so in other words, I'm here to give you whatever time is appropriate to give you based on what your needs are but I don't want to duplicate, I don't want to put somebody, you know, in a situation where they say well [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said this and you're saying that and you're both saying different things and I'm confused now because there's different ways to deal with some issues and different - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So you think he should see somebody else?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No I'm just saying, no I'm talking about somebody who's seeing two different therapists let's say.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, oh, no, no, he - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But I'm just saying that - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, he needs to switch and he would switch, he actually would do anything but I -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He would do anything.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's going to, he goes to church for the first time in his life and I've got a lot of codependency issues, care taking kind of things.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I feel guilty because all this stuff is coming out and I can't fix him.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, what you could do, what you could do is, I try to keep things simple and not - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What you could do is ask your dad if you, if he can give you permission to speak to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], okay.  If she wants to play it by the book, she might want a signed release rather than just verbal and then say, you know, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], you met [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I mean she knows you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's the one I was seeing and then I -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you could say listen, you know, I don't know, it gets complicated doesn't it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I've already called her and talked to her.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Look, I -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, that's okay, what I do, I've seen many people from the same family for an evaluation and possibly medication management.  What I don't do is do therapy with people from the same family.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because even though some people do that, I can't, I don't feel that I could separate myself. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And not, you know, so medication management is different than doing therapy with people from the same family, I don't do that, I don't do therapy with the same family.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So he could call you and set up time for medication.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> His last time [NAME OTHER]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well I'll be happy to talk with him. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He is so agitated. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I would be happy to speak to him on the telephone and let him decide what he wants to do, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's really - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He throws things.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's not very pleasant.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean I'd be, look I have - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He wouldn't throw anything here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't care if he did, I don't care if he did.  I could help you out any way I can, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay but I don't want to waste my time talking to -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Even though I brought it up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's okay, it's your father.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm faced with going to my mother's birthday tonight.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's going to be there and I've really been detaching from him.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know what, maybe you be on your best behavior and he may comment on how well you're doing and ask you some questions or you can share with him how you're feeling and, you know, bring up the conversation and see where it goes but it's tough enough being responsible for one life, let alone two or three lives, right, so it's a big task for each of us to manage our own course.  Anyway, [PATIENT NAME], look, I want you to stay with the 5, I'll give you another prescription, you let me know what's going on.  If you need to check back, you know, we're here.  Don't get too comfortable or confident and, you know, where you are, and start cutting back on things.  Like I said, you know, it's very early on in things and, you know - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yesterday was actually kind of scary being so high.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

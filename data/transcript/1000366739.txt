<p>PATIENT:  (5-minute silence) For some reason when I came in I began to think about something that had been on my mind this weekend.  And (clears throat) yesterday I think this is what I was thinking about when something occurred to me that seemed very true.  And then I tried to remember it a little while later and I couldn't.  And when I came in, I think what started this was my thinking, "I wonder if I can remember what thing I forgot yesterday?"  And I don't know whether it's the same thing at all but my thoughts were on, uhm, the need I have to control everything, every situation, or else sort of withdrawing from it and just letting things happen and not controlling it at all.  And I don't know th—, I was trying to understand why I have this terrific need and also how I can see when I'm doing it.  Because so many times I won't realize I'm doing it until MSCZ, for instance, will say something that makes it clear to me.  And, and it wouldn't have seemed that I was doing it, to me, before then.</p>

<p>And I suppose that's part of why my father used to be so upset at me.  And I couldn't really get any feeling on why I do do this or else, how much a person would normally do it and how much more I am doing it than is normal.  And I, I just don't seem to have any feeling or judgment about it.  But I think, yesterday when I was thinking about it, the thing that seems to be escaping my recalling it is something about wanting to control myself because I wanted to control what I was thinking so that I wouldn't be thinking about, perhaps, all the horrible things I could think about or, or I suppose acting according to the horrible things I was thinking about.  (Pause) But somehow that doesn't seem quite right either.  It's funny too, how (clears throat) at different times when I'm lying here, my body will feel so different.  And sometime—, I remember one time I said I felt as if I were just sinking.  And right now I feel as if I'm all blown up and huge.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And there's something about this feeling that I associate with how I felt when I used to have what I thought were dreams when I was little but maybe they were some kind of a fantasy.  And the only thing I can remember about it was that it was, well, well, mainly just the color red and that there weren't figures that you would recognize as being true to life in it.  It was — (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Does anything else come to your mind in connection with feeling huge, all blown up?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, aside from the fact that I, if I really were the way I feel right now, then I would be very grotesque and fat and awkward, (pause) I don't really think of anything else.  But it was — except for some reason I want to know more about what that dream was and why I had it so many times.  And it's always bothered me.  And so I think when I began to have this feeling, which is going now, I wanted to just think about that part of it and not see where else my thoughts went.  (Clears throat)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, what does red bring to mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, blood, but I don't want to think about it, and fire.  (Silence) And I can remember always having a fascination for this (clears throat) almost as if it were a fantasy and not dream, that I was controlling making it up, though I don't think I really did.  I think I was asleep when I had it.  But (clears throat) and then I'd also feel as if I were in the middle of it and it was horrible and I wanted it to stop.  And then whenever I think about it now, I always have that mixed feeling of wanting to recall it and yet wanting to put it out of my mind.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I think I'm doing something right now too that probably I did with both of my parents.  For some reason I have the feeling you don't think I should keep thinking about that, that there's no point in it.  And so then I just felt, well I'm going to just think about it then.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What reason do you think I would have to not want you to?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  If — because it won't go anywhere, perhaps.  It's sort of pointless.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Is it possible that that's your fear, that it will go somewhere so it occurs to you that I don't want you to follow it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, it was the way you said, "Well, what does red make you think of, then?"  It was almost, it seemed — perhaps I'm doing that but your tone s— — except I know I always read in things in people's tones.  (Pause) It just seems amazing to me, if I'm trying to be aware of what I'm doing to myself, that I would still deceive myself that much.  (Silence) When I think about it, the only reason I think it could go somewhere is because I used to have it, (clears throat) except perhaps once in a long while, mainly when I was around 4, maybe a little younger, maybe a little older but (clears throat) just around that time.  And one time I was reading an article on the prenatal state (clears throat) and it just struck me then that this was almost what a person could imagine the womb to be like.  And I wondered, when I read that, if that's not what my dream had been doing in a way, putting me back inside.  But there was something more to it, too, perhaps because I knew I couldn't so it had a unpleasant element to it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you do recall the first thing that came to your mind when I asked you, you know, what red brought to mind, was blood.  And then you said you didn't want to think about that, which would seem to suggest that there is some reluctance for you to follow the, your thoughts.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) But I don't know, well, there was, but I don't know whether it's something I'm doing now with my thoughts.  Well, I suppose it doesn't matter really.  (Pause) Because the reason I didn't want to think about blood was my thoughts began to go to the blood of different members of my family and the fact that I could be the one causing it to flow.  And I didn't really want to think about that.  (Pause) And it also made me think of the fact that recently, I don't remember just when, I had another fantasy about my brother dying.  And I always put it in very acceptable terms.  This time he's going to have to go into service but he probably won't ever serve overseas.  And so I was imagining if he did, and were killed, how would everybody react and how would I react.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And just the fact that I've been concentrating on my brother lately, just in reacting to him, something I, I don't recall that I did for a long time, and the fact that some of the things I've recalled that I used to feel about him or do with him that involved very much a male female kind of relationship, it's made me wonder just how he has functioned in my life.  And (pause) it just seems almost that I had feelings for my brother that, I don't know, I hear many people have, without knowing, for their fathers.  And I don't, I still can't remember feeling that way about my father.  But I know I did about my brother.  (3-minute silence) It's funny, it makes me feel just awful to even think about the fact that I used to feel that way, or perhaps I still do.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You didn't make entirely clear what feeling you were referring to, how you did feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, I'm not too sure either how I did feel.  Except I just felt it was wrong, whatever it was.  (Pause) And it was something that was totally unacceptable for a person to feel.  And even thinking about it makes me feel very unacceptable.  I just don't even know how — well, I guess I was just trying to control myself but it was some kind of a sexual attraction, I think.  I don't really know how much.  (Pause) But I remember even from when he was born, I was very curious about what he would look like and what a penis would be like.  And so I just concentrated on him all my curiosity about what a male is like, especially since my father always had to be fully clothed when you saw him.  So it just seemed like there was some huge mystery and I was really curious.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>For some reason my thoughts have gone to shutting away, shutting doors and I suppose, partly because when I think of my father being so very modest, he was, it was always because he'd keep his door shut.  And if we even knocked, he'd (clears throat), seemed to me he would yell and say, "Don't come in"  and things like that.  He always seemed kind of hysterical to me at times like that.  And I was thinking about how I used to shut myself away from my family.  In particular, how for years I don't remember being around or knowing my brother at all.  And it also struck me, sometimes — now, in this one time in particular is if MSCZ and I are having intercourse and I just suddenly just can't stand it or there's just something that makes me want to just not realize he's there.  And, and I'll cover my face and shut my eyes.  And it's shutting away again.  Or just shutting myself into my work or just anything where I'm withdrawing.  And I think it was after Friday when I was going home I was thinking about how it just seems always I can only go so far in a relationship and if it gets too friendly or too intimate, except in rare cases I just have to withdraw.  It just seems to happen.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And something that bothered me on Saturday: we were, MSCZ and I were shopping and there were several people on the street that, if I just noticed them quickly, they made me think of you.  They might have just been tall or they had a moustache or something.  And I just had this feeling of, "I hope I'm not doing anything wrong, if it is you."  It was a very strange feeling and it made me think again of something I said earlier of, I don't know, feeling you are judging me and I'm putting you in the position of doing it and that I'm, I don't know, almost that I have to tell you anything that comes to my mind or intimate things that I don't like telling.  But I don't know if I feel that way because it's a way to avoid feeling the responsibility or, or just why.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I think that it's almost anybody — perhaps I've already said this — but anybody that is in the position to know more about something than I do or to guide me or be my supervisor or instruct me or anything, I always, I don't know, just it's like a child to a parent relationship that I put myself in.  Because it doesn't matter the sex of the person.  And it seems to be part of this thing of controlling it all or not controlling it at all.  Almost, as a child I wouldn't be controlling it at all.  And if the person is above me in any way, they have more control and so I have to just relinquish any and just be totally obedient.  And the only times I don't do that is when the person that I'm trying to be that way with won't accept that, and then — I was thinking of my present supervisor and, and she just doesn't like a person being totally obedient and so I'm finding it easier to, I don't know, play a little bit more with following her ideas yet giving my own.  But this is a very new experience for me.  (Pause) And even then, my first inclination is always to think, when she comes in to some room where I am already in an activity with the children, well, wonder if she'll approve or is there something wrong that she doesn't like.  And no matter how much I know how she thinks, I still will do that first.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think in all the cases I want to be told I'm doing the right thing.  And my assumption is always that probably I'm not.  Because I remember, I think it was last year, when I was working under a woman that was particularly hard to work under and the only times she said anything to me it was usually some type of criticism.  And I didn't, I didn't have a great deal of respect for her so it was easier to take than it might have been if I had respected her but I remember saying to MSCZ at one point that I was just feeling very demoralized because she never praised anything and said certain things were going right.  And MSCZ just said, "Well, you're expecting too much."  And I, at the time, didn't see how I was.  I still think she could have taken a more positive approach but I, I do think I was looking for a you're right or you're wrong kind of attitude.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I suppose I feel this way because my, the whole time I lived with my parents, they were constantly making it very clear to us what they approved of and what they didn't.  And they never really had any free attitude toward us being anything except for what fit into their rigid idea of what people do and should be.  (Pause) My father has this attitude about it that I think I have too.  It doesn't make me very happy to realize it but it puts so much pressure on you, especially if you're young and you don't know what's happening.  Because he would, he does act, if you don't agree — now it's just a matter of discussing ideas — but he'll act as if you've rejected him and he'll be sort of hurt or something.  Or if you do agree, he gets, I don't know, sentimental is the only way I can think of it.  But it's sort of like, "We 2 are together."  And either way it's putting so much pressure on you.  And I don't know if I do it that way in agreement but I think when people disagree with me — well, I suppose I do it either way but I'm most aware of the feeling I have if people disagree with me then I, I do feel that I've been rejected and well, also that they must think I'm stupid.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

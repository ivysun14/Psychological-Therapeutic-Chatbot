<p>PATIENT:  (5-minute silence) I was just thinking that in a way I just don't feel like talking today (sniffle) or I feel better about not saying anything than saying something.  And I think it has something to do with the reaction I had to what I was saying yesterday because even at the time I remember being uncomfortable about what I was saying.  And then, later, it seemed to me that a lot of what I was saying was my feelings and reflected something which really isn't true, it was just the way I see it.  And that sort of disturbed me.  And I, I read something yesterday evening about (sniffle) a person who was being critical of somebody else and how it might show hostility and, uhm, on the part of the person being critical.  And that's just the way I felt about what I was doing here yesterday.  (Pause) And I don't know quite why it bothered me or bothers me still.  But it's almost as if usually, even if I feel angry at a person, I still think of them as being right and me being wrong, or their being better.  And yesterday, when I was talking, I wasn't thinking of them being better at all in any way. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think it bothered me partly because they aren't, or the situation isn't quite the way I was saying it, I don't think.  I mean, it's almost as if I were making myself seem better to myself and so that I was lying to myself in a way.  And that wasn't right either.  And I somehow felt as if I'd degraded things or, I don't know, just in pretending things were the way they weren't, that I just wasn't being honest.  And that bothered me.  But what I don't know is, if I had realized at the time that I was just being hostile toward them, which I think I was, whether or not I could have done it then without feeling the reaction that I had.  I just don't know whether it's the being aware that I was just being hostile that's bothering me.  And it's funny, I was, when I came in, I was thinking a lot of things.  And one thing that struck me is the way I am toward people I have to direct, whoever they may be.  And it's almost like I feel if I have to tell somebody what to do that it's indicating my hostility to them.  And so then I'll let things go until I do feel hostile and then, in the way I tell them to do something, it comes out in a hostile way. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was thinking mainly, although this is true of my assistant, of, uhm, how I am toward anybody who cleans for me.  And we used to have a man who'd done it, done cleaning for years.  And so I felt, well, how can I tell him what to do, because he knows more than I do?  And I didn't do too much directing of him.  And then, now, he died.  And we have a cousin of my husband who, ah, is going to school nearby.  And so now I tell myself well, how can I tell somebody like that, who's just doing it for a little extra money, what to do.  And I, if I do tell him anything I am very apologetic.  And this bothers me because he took it as a job and I should just look at it as a job.  And I know, I, I can see where I often make things worse by not being directed and clear.  But for some reason I'm afraid to, to take on that kind of direction.  And yet, if I were doing it for somebody else, and I think of when I spent some time with FYC after her first son was born, then I expected very explicit directions on what to do.  And I, from, from the point that I was doing the job, looked upon it as a job and e—, and expected to be told exactly.  And, and it just seems funny that I'll expect one thing when I'm doing the job and another thing if I'm directing it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, I was thinking of another thing too, that today I took, ah, another teacher's class, painting.  She was not at school.  And she has things set up differently and her, the whole tenor of her class is quite different.  And I didn't try to impose my way or much control over it because I just would do things so differently and I was just going to be doing this one time.  And I, I couldn't decide at the end whether I'd made a mistake or not in not being stronger in directing them because they seemed to need more of it.  But I know more how I'd approach it if I did it again, I sort of got a feel of them.  And it, I don't know that this would bother me at all because things didn't go that badly, they just didn't go very well, except for the fact that my supervisor was in the room.  And I don't think she cared but my whole attitude was that she was judging me by what was happening right then or, or this was always on the back of my mind.  And that bothered me because then I didn't, I still did what I wanted to do but I didn't really feel free about it.</p>

<p>And somehow this judging me or feeling that I'm being tested made me think of the fact that sometimes when things happen here, my attitude has been that you were probably testing me to see how I'd react, although usually I didn't really take that thought seriously, but it would always come to my mind as a possibility.  And it even came to my mind when you didn't give me the bill for last month yesterday.  And I s—, I was expecting it so I was surprised.  And, again, I didn't take this thought seriously but I thought, well maybe you just wanted to see how I'd react.  But that's putting it in mild terms, really.  I'm probably thinking that you're testing me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What do you imagine I want to find out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I really don't.  But it must somehow be connected with a feeling can I behave myself — that's what came to my mind — in whatever way is proper for whatever situation.  (Pause) And it made me think today, too.  I, when I came back to my room after taking this class painting, my assistant was having the children clean up and making a contest out of it, having 2, 2 groups race against each other cleaning up.  And for some reason that infuriated me.  I just, I, I was so mad I had to leave the room so I wouldn't say something.  And I decided, well, I won't say anything now but I'll talk to her later about it.  Because I, I have a real aversion to using competition at all for anything that is a job that must be done.  And I still feel that competition for that age group is not good but there's something about my own reaction to it that figures in this.  And then later when I saw her again, because we have separate lunches and so forth, uhm, I just decided it would be better not to say anything, it really didn't seem so bad after all.  But I was surprised at how mad I was.  And I think it must have come partly from the feeling that she herself is the kind of person that loves competition because she feel secure in her place, or wherever she is and what she can do, and doesn't care if she can't.  And this is good for the type of child that also feels that he can do it.  And then there are some children who can't, and they just kind of collapse under it.  And I always have felt that way.  And so, and I saw some children struggling to get things cleaned up and not doing a good job and other children were yelling at them, "Hurry up!"  Be—, you know, they'll ruin their team's place, so to speak.  And it just didn't seem to me a proper kind of thing to have a competition for.  And I was just, I suppose, feeling feelings I would have in the same situation, if I were in that contest.  But I knew I was so mad beyond just what she had done and principles for education that I, I just knew I shouldn't say anything to her. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think there's something in competition, I don't know, there must be times when it's a very healthy thing but there's something about the desire of every individual to get something on everybody else and be better than everybody else and beat everybody else that bothers me about it.  There's an attitude in it that I just, beyond never feeling strong enough to also join in, I, there's, it's just, it's sort of inhuman.  (Silence) I don't know, it just made me think I had read something recently that spoke about competition.  I, I remembered that it was in one of the books on teaching art and whether or not to have art contests.  And the author described what she thought happened in a competition of that sort in a way that I've always felt.  And it didn't really relate just to art but sometimes I wonder if I don't carry this too far in my attitude.  But I don't feel the same way when it's sports, that's about the only thing I don't feel that it's bad.  And I don't, just thinking that well, maybe it's because of my reaction to sports.  And I ne—, I knew I never was that great in any sport, I'd never really stand out, but I could always play fairly well.  And if I wanted to make the school team, I could always do it.  And I liked it and I, I just knew where I stood and I could accept where I stood.  So perhaps that's why I feel more comfortable with competition in sports. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's also the one thing that, well, FYC never did much with the ones — I never did anything in the sports she did a lot with, which was mostly swimming and then different boating, canoeing type things.  And it's funny I don't know why, I just had, I just grew to not particularly like swimming at all.  Although I can remember being really small, loving it.  And I never had any interest in doing anything with any kind of boats, although now I know I'd enjoy it.  And then later FNA picked up some of the different sports I did, but at school I was mainly, I was pretty much the only one who went out for sports and did anything with them.  So perhaps it had something to do with my having my own area, that I could feel the way I did about sports.  And I used to love riding.  FYC didn't at all.  And this was sort of my thing too until FNA got older and then she began to get more of an interest in riding.  And I think, I think it really did spoil it for me, to some extent, when I had to share that with somebody else.  It was sort of, I was no longer the rider of the family. (Silence)</p>

<p>My thoughts have gone back to that time I was with the other class in painting.  And I think probably it's bothering me more than I'll admit.  Because I don't really feel sure that what I was doing was right or that I assessed the situation correctly so that my actions were the proper ones for that situation.  But the children were showing very little control over themselves and I k—, I couldn't decide whether it was something I was doing that made them be less controlled than they usually are down there, or if they haven't learned it and because I was new it showed up.  Because I was being fairly lenient in that I was asking them to do what they usually do and I wasn't saying "Do this, do that"  until something happened where I had to just say, "No, you can't act this way"  or, "You must do that."  But (pause) I think what bothers me is the thought that maybe they were less controlled because of something I was doing with them or how it was something I didn't do to give them the limits that they needed.  And what I'd like to do is (laughs) ask — I won't ever do it.  But I'd like to ask my supervisor if, if they were worse than they usually are when their regular teacher is with them, just to see if there was a difference.  Because they were worse than my class when they're down there.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why wouldn't you ever do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know.  When you ask, I don't know.  I suppose because it would be an admission that I thought maybe I'd made a mistake or that something had gone wrong, that I was unsure.  And sort of, how can she trust me with my own class if I show her I'm unsure.  (Pause) And I think there's an element of something else too, in that if, if she said, yes, they were worse, well, then I don't know where I'd go from there.  It would bother me if she did but — and of course, that's partly why I wouldn't, I feel now I wouldn't ask.  But if she said, no, they were the s—, they're always that way, then I know my temptation would be to start almost, well talking about that class in a way that's sort of behind the back of the teacher.  And I never like myself when I do it but if I have a situation where I can, I always will.  So what I have to do is not set up situations where I can.  (Pause) And that would sort of be my way of being competitive with my co-teacher.  And then, I suppose thirdly I'm not sure how my supervisor would feel about my asking a question like that anyway.  And this would stop me too. (Silence)</p>

<p>I just keep thinking back to what I would do if I could do that particular part of the day over.  And I seem to ha—, be compelled to think about it.  And I can't really see where I'd do it differently.  But I guess basically my feeling is that I might have done something differently and it wouldn't have been so bad, so that it was my fault.  (Silence) And that just made me think of how my attitude toward having to have the total responsibility or none.  And I was thinking, well, I like to feel it's my fault if it is my fault, because it will be ultimately if it's my responsibility.  And then it didn't seem that that really is it.  It's more just a compulsion to do as much possible in any task.  And the only way you know if it's really done is if you do it yourself.  So I am unable, in a way, to give responsibility to somebody else.  And it just made me think of my father, who drove himself or keeps driving himself so on everything.  And that is an aspect of him that my mother made very clear to me that she admired.  So I know for a long time I used to think that this was one of the highest virtues you could have.  And I never could really see that very often you lose sight of what you're doing by trying to cover too much and driving yourself too hard.  And you just get in with the details and you, and you can't see what's happening and you don't get the rewards for it, either.  And I used to think, well, maybe if I just worked a little harder, then it would, that maybe that was why I didn't succeed in the have anticipated, or something.  And even in the last few years, when I've known sometimes it's better just to sit down and do something and then leave it and, and really narrow it down or not dwell on it for a long time, or not, or sometimes if you have a long task, to take breaks from it and to work and then play and then work, that kind of a balance, I, even when I know it, I can't do it. (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I still feel confused about this attitude toward the way you do a job or a task or an assignment because I'm sure that it signifies a lack of trust in one's own ability, whether it's me or my father or anybody else doing it.  So you have to keep double-checking yourself and getting every point you can so that you'll be sure you did cover everything or that you didn't misrepresent something or make a mistake.  And then sometimes I'll think, well, at least with my father who was or has been successful in what he's done, maybe he wouldn't have been so successful if he hadn't worked so hard.  But then I end up wondering, well, what's the point, anyway, because it was almost as if he worked so he didn't have to be around to be with people, too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And that is one thing that I know I've always felt because I've always been annoyed at people who will feel sorry for someone for whatever it is, whether it's that they're working too hard or something else.  Because it just generally seemed to me, a person will do what they're most comfortable doing.  They might not be happy doing it but — my father didn't have to work that hard and people would always be very sorry for him.  But he chose to be.  And I think I felt some hostility toward him too because he did choose to be working so hard and not be home very much. (Pause)</p>

<p>And when I was thinking about that I was also thinking, it just came to my mind suddenly that feeling uncomfortable or upset about what happened today with the other class, I can just see where my defense could be that I'll pull apart the different boys in that class and become critical of them as sort of counterattack and thereby implying that the teacher didn't, hasn't done a very good job with them yet.  (Pause) And I really don't want to do anything that just is defensive on my part but I can just see where I have this great need to.  I'd like to really feel, well, I knew what I was doing and I had something in mind and I don't really care if my supervisor was judging me then.  Because if she really did, then she obviously didn't understand what I was doing.  And that I can be upset at, that the day went, or that particular period went unhappy but still not have to say anything to anybody about it.  But somehow I can't quite feel that way. (Pause) It's funny too, how it is.  Because somehow I'd push this to the back of my mind enough so, although I knew I wasn't happy with what happened, I didn't think it was really bothering me.  And yet after it, I wasn't in a good mood and, I don't know, I just sort of felt under pressure.  I suppose, pressure to prove myself.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about how my attitude toward not saying anything has changed.  Because I remember at the beginning, I used to be very upset if I wasn't talking.  And when I said something to MSCZ once about not having said anything for a while, or did he ever not say anything for a while and he acted as if it was very bad not to, because then you're not using your time.  And I sort of accepted that and I, I think I feel very differently now, in that I feel so—, I don't know if I completely feel this way, but if I am quiet, I don't really mind being quiet if, if, if I've chosen just to be quiet.  If it's because I can't say something that I know I should say or want to say or am going to say, then it bothers me but it's, I don't know, I just feel it's more the way I want it to be.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

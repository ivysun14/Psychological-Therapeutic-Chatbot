<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) The fact that I'm so late, I don't even know how late but I know it must be pretty late, really was bothering me tonight.  And it wa—, I was, I might have been a few minutes late because I couldn't get away from home until fairly late but it was mainly the subway that, uhm, kept me.  And I, I just feel totally responsible even though there was nothing I could do once, you know, once the subway was slow.  And even saying this, I feel as if I'm just making an excuse for something that I'm at fault for.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why would you be at fault if it wasn't, you know, something you did?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Almo—, well, I don't know, almost the, the reasoning that was in my mind was, if I had left with more time then this wouldn't have happened.  Somehow (clears throat) the fact that I was a little late, this was, I was paying for it by having this happen to me.  It was — (pause) and the whole thing, as it always does, whether or not I am at fault or responsible, make, made me feel very nervous.  And I don't, I can't see why I'd feel nervous unless I'm afraid of what you would do or how you'd react.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What do you imagine?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Clears throat) I think just (clears throat) being angry that I was late and thinking that it was very irresponsible of me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What happened to your thoughts?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, I felt as if I were, there was some other idea connected with it too and I couldn't seem to get it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are you aware of any feeling of not wanting to be here?  You've mentioned before that when you felt miserable you'll, well, after the holidays, for example, how it was to come back.  And this week you have felt quite miserable and unhappy.  Yesterday, ah, well, it was very hard to talk.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I know yesterday (clears throat) in particular I didn't really let myself think it, but I know it was in my mind, I would've been so relieved if I didn't have to come.  And I think that's what made me feel so very tired right before I did come.  And I remember thinking even while I was here and finding it so hard, it'll be a, be nice to have the feeling of relief or release or something when I'm out, although it didn't quite happen that way.  So I suppose that, after feeling that way, I'm not anticipating it being easy today, or wasn't.  (Clears throat) And when I was so late I kept — I don't have my watch on so I don't know how late but I kept thinking, well, maybe I should ask and just not come if it's going to be late enough so it's pointless to come.  But then it just seemed like I was escaping, trying to avoid coming because I though it would be hard.  So I didn't.  (Pause) And I was just thinking about how I feel at other times when I'm late.  And if I'm late meeting a person that, for pleasure, I might feel uncomfortable because I've made them late and they might be feeling angry at me or something.  But I never have that feeling of nervousness.  Once I'm on the subway, if that's how I'm going, I know there's nothing I can do now to get there any faster and I can relax.  But if I'm late for coming here or if I'm late for going to school, even while I'm on the subway I just am very fretful and nervous.  And it's almost as if by determination and thinking and willing the subway to go faster, I'll get there faster.  And it is true that, in a way, I probably don't want to go to school either.  As much as I don't miss days unless I'm really sick or I keep teaching year after year but I suppose in a way I really just don't want to be there.  So, just like in a way I don't want to be here when I'm finding it hard. (Pause)</p>

<p>So then, knowing I don't want to be there, I suppose I would assume you and whoever at school would care would think I'd done it on purpose.  Or maybe I think I've done it on purpose, I don't know.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: But in any case you feel that it would make me angry if you don't want to be here, if you tell me that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I imagine I do.  I don't react to that but all I can think is that if I were doing something and I knew the person, or just in teaching, if I knew the children didn't want to come I'd take it very personally.  So I suppose I would project that to you too.  (Silence) And I was just thinking about today.  And I became extremely strict with the boys today because they had to have some structure more than I had been giving them.  And, and so I just completely swung back and I think maybe I'm feeling quite guilty about that.  I didn't really want to talk about it today, here, either.  Because it's referring to what I was speaking about yesterday on first I'm one thing and then I'm another.  And I know that's not good.  (Pause) And I think, too, not wanting to talk about it is because it wasn't only that I got strict, I got, I felt angry at them.  And I did something that I just don't like doing if I'm conscious of doing it but I still did it, in using the power to create guilt in them in order to have them obey me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How, how?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, at least I think that's what I'm doing.  Uhm, sort of, the situation will be such that boys of that age just can't help but start making noise.  And, and it will be my fault that it's that way.  I might not have the activities changing fast enough or enough things to keep them occupied.  And then I will sort of berate them for, they know better than doing what they were doing and they should have been doing this and that and causing them to feel, I assume this is what I'm doing, guilty that they weren't doing something that they probably couldn't do anyway.  (Pause) I suppose mainly just suggesting that they are failing me in my expectations of them.  And (clears throat, pause) and the day was sort of chaotic for other reasons and again it was poor planning on my part.  And then it was just the way they sometimes are on a rainy day that combined to make it quite a hideous day.  And at the end of the day a boy said to me something which really, it's sort of funny but it was sort of a horrible comment on how they were being treated.  Because he's, he's the, the boy who seemed to be so unhappy that I feel sort of a sympathy for or I don't know what feeling exactly.  But he says very cute things.  And I was going by him and he just said to me, "Mrs QSE, I'll try very hard not to get in the way on Monday."  And I don't think he in particular had been taken out as being in the way or spoken to harshly or anything.  But it was just the feeling that the boys must have all had in the room that, today.  And I just keep hearing that, him saying it.  And as much as it's sort of a cute remark, it's a horrible comment on how I was handling things. (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about how I, just in terms of school again, how everything seems to come down to the fact that I just feel very confused and my thinking is confused.  And today was a perfect example of how I generate confusion in the classroom.  And this whole week has just made me want more than anything — I just don't feel I'm coping with it and I'd just like to suddenly just walk out.</p>

<p>ANALYST: As you would like to have done here yesterday.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I probably would have yesterday but I wasn't aware of it in the same way.  Some days I've really thought in terms of, I wish I could just get up and walk out.  Yesterday I didn't think it.  Maybe it was on my mind. (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, it occurs to me, you, you said, uhm, something about, uhm, a feeling, your feeling that the boy that you fe—, that the boys have the feeling of having failed your expectations, or something of that sort.  And what I'm reminded of is your feeling that you expressed, well, I, I think you put it, ah, different ways.  But one way, when you said in regard to something I commented on, that knowing that doesn't make any difference.  And you've said things of that sort several times, as though you were expressing something of the sort of feeling that you feel the boys have, that I have failed your expectations or that the situation hasn't met your expectations.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I think my thinking is confused here too.  Because, and in a way it's doing something that I didn't expect and in another way, even when I started I, I was hoping that it would practically be like magic but on the other hand I, I couldn't see how it could be any help.  So I really don't know exactly what my expectations were, except that I was impatient.  If something were going to happen, I was very impatient for something to happen.  And h—, and it just seemed that even though I was becoming more aware of certain things and in some ways, I think, handling things better, I still seemed to repeat over and over again all the same mistakes or at least reacting in the same way that caused me to feel so unhappy.  And now all I, it was almost more intense because now I was aware of it in a way I hadn't been before.  I couldn't just put it out of my mind or pretend that I didn't know. (Pause)</p>

<p>It's almost like what's happening to me as a teacher.  I, before I could feel insecurity about being a teacher but I didn't have the feeling I have now of, or I wasn't as aware as I am now of some of the mistakes I'm making and in the nature that they are.  Although I think probably in some ways I'm better as a teacher, I seem to be concentrating on the awareness I have of the mistakes I'm making.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

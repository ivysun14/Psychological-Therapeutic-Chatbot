David has trained and consulted for hundreds of organizations, ranging from small mental health centers to government departments and national behavioral healthcare companies. David has also authored a number of book chapters and papers in a variety of professional publications. He is Chief Editor of the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria and is Senior Vice-President, The Change Companies.</p>

<p>David's medical, psychiatric and addictions training began in his home country of Australia. From there it took him to Ohio, Massachusetts, Hawaii and eventually California. He has trained and consulted in almost every US state, and his international work has taken him to Australia, Japan, Singapore, Germany, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.K.
David Mee-Lee is the Moderator in the session that follows. It is a role play with this "58 yr old man" living in a shelter. He is angry and feeling discriminated against. The interaction attempts to work through his anger and suspicion as a foundation for engaging him in a goal that he can buy into. </p>

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>MODERATOR: James is working in a shelter with a client whose name we will call - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Douglas.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, and Douglas is about how old?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: 57, 58.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: 58.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: African American.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay. A little closer on the thing. Yeah. And what - what's the dilemma with Douglas?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Chronic homelessness. Chronic homelessness.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Chronic - Chronic homelessness.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Substance abuse  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: - that he doesn't admit to, alcoholism that he doesn't admit to.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, so he's not working on recovery in any way in terms of that?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: No, no.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah. And he had - comes into your shelter quite often?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Second admission. His first admission was 10 months.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: 10 months?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, like, he was there for 10 months?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: There for 10 months.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: And then what off and  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Went off and came back  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: - less than a year later. (0:00:53.1)</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Alright. So the question is how to try to engage him in making some positive recovery or changes, okay? Alright, so Douglas, glad that you're here, and - and I - we're going to be working together, and so we have to kind of develop a plan together and I'm not sure, what's the most important thing you'd like us to focus that around?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: You're glad I'm here?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well, yeah, because we're here to serve people, and you - I  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: You're not glad I'm here. They - they don't like me - nobody likes me here, and this place sucks.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Wow, okay. So how is it that you showed up here then if it's that bad?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: It just sucks. You know, my - my attorney said I needed to come here while I wait for some stuff to happen, but I really don't want to be here and  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: - they don't want me here, and  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Actually, you suck. My last counselor sucked. She really sucked.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, okay. Well that's why we need to talk, because if we're that bad, we got to find out how to make it better, because  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Well understand, I don't want to be here. I - I have family in New York  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: - who are very rich, and I don't have to be here.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay. (0:02:05.1)</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: They sent me here.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Alright, so is that what you would like me to help you with, is not be here? Because we could work on that.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Yeah, we can - we - you can help me with that.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay. Decided to come anyway?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: He sent me, so I - I had to come.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: So I'm here.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: What - I mean if you said, "I'm not going. I hate that place. I don't want to go there," would - would he have said, "don't go," or what would have happened?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: I would have probably got a tent from the Outreach people or something.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: A tent?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: A tent, to - you know, to go into the woods.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: To live in the woods?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: It's kind of cold, so - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: - it's probably better that I'm here now.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay. Alright, so if you had said, "Attorney, no. I'm not going to go. I hate them there. They don't like me anyway,"  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Are you a case manager?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Where'd you go to school at?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Because I went to school in New York, and I - I - I'm not understanding you at all, and  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: - I really don't want to talk to you anymore, and  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: What are we talking about? (0:03:00.7)</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well, what - what we're talking about, and I appreciate you letting me know that, because if you can't understand me that's not very good, but what I understand we're talking about is what you want, and what we can do to help you get what you want, and so right now I don't know clearly what you want, or the - well, from what you've told me, is that you'd rather be here than in the woods and in a tent. Isn't that what you said?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Yeah, in the wintertime.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: In the wintertime, yeah. And that's - that's a lot of people - that makes sense to me, that you'd rather be here than in a tent. So would you like me to help you to be here, or would you like me to help you not be here because this place, you don't like. I mean, either thing I can help you with.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: See, you - you guys talk with both sides, because you're asking me if I want to stay here, and I just heard that they was kicking me out in 30 days. It's only a 30 day shelter stay, so I know I'm going to have to leave in 30 days, so - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: - why are we even having this conversation? Let me do my 30 days, and I don't even want to speak to you anymore. Can I leave now? </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Let me think about that, because even though you're here for 30 days, we do expect people to not just be using this like a hotel, because it's not really a hotel and you're not paying hotel fees, and I know it's not that great a place, but we do expect people to have some sort of plan, even if they're just here for 30 days, so probably, in answer to your question, no. You - we do have to talk enough to get up some sort of plan for the 30 days that you're here, so - (0:04:22.3)</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: You know what I want to do? All I want to do is get my SSDI and go back to New York. That's - that's all I want to do.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, so let me - Douglas, I'm a little confused now. Is the main thing you want is get your SSDI and go back to New York? </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Yes.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Is the main thing you want to stay here for 30 days and not be in the woods, or is the main thing you want me to work on is getting you out of here as soon as possible? Because we could help you get out of here before the 30 days if you want.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: I have to wait  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: I mean, you know, which is the most important?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: I have to wait for my money. I can't go to New York without any money - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: - because my - my family's not going to be with that, so I need  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: I see, and help serve your needs. I'm not meeting my needs. So I - but I'd be happy to give you his name, but what's that got to do with helping you get what you want. So what do want again? SSDI to go to New York, be here, not in the woods, or to get out of here as soon as possible, or will it take 30 days to get your SSDI, is that what you mean? (0:05:10.3)</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Well it's - it's taken more - longer than I expected.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: And I'm - you're probably going to kick me out before my SS - SSDI  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well, I - I don't know. We've had  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: No, they already told me they was kicking me out because they don't like me at the front desk.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Nobody likes me here and I don't like them. Everybody sucks, and I just - you know, I don't even want to talk anymore, but  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well, but - I know.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: I'm not saying anything else.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, I know. I'm glad you're (inaudible 0:05:31.6), but Douglas, you were here for 10 months last time, so we do have people here longer than 30 days. So that is a possibility - I mean I'm willing  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Well I was sick last time, and I had that operation, and I thank Fairfax County for paying for the operation, but  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: What do I, owe them my life because they got my little leg fixed?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: No, I understand.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: What's the problem here?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, no. We're - we're not worried about that right now. We're trying to work out, SSDI, go to New York, get out of here as soon as possible, be here, not the woods, be here longer than 30 days if you have to be before you get your check to get to New York. That - those are the things that are possible things I can help you with. (0:06:08.0)</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: You think I may be able to stay if the check doesn't come?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: If that's something that you want, I can work on that. I don't know for sure this second, but I want to first find out want, because I don't even know what we want. We've been talking for 10 minutes and it's still not clear, so is that what you want? SSDI check, get to New York, but if it doesn't come through in 30 days, can you stay here longer rather than go into the woods - Is that what you want me to work on?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, good. So now that's clear. Now, again, I have to do some checking to see, but at least I want to know what you want.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: You going to check with Marty? Because Marty doesn't like me. She really doesn't like me.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, okay. Well, it might be  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: And don't ask that other counselor that I had.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: The - the - the blonde lady. Don't ask her anything about me. Matter of fact, don't read anything in that chart. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: The chart you got.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: It's all lies. Every bit of it. (0:06:59.7)</p>

<p>MODERATOR: You mean Hillary? Oh, no, no. Okay, alright. No. So, you are not - so let's not - okay, so it's clear, what you don't want is to read that chart or talk to Marty. Now, I may have to talk to Marty if we have to get an extent, but let's - let's keep our eye on the prize first, because I want to know what you want, and just correct me if I'm wrong, SSDI check, get to New York as soon as possible, but if you can't get it by 30 days, is there any way to stay here longer rather than go to the woods. That's what you want.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Right. Any extension. I'd - I'd really like an extension.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, I hear you, and that sounds - that sounds reasonable. Now do you - now do you know how to get that?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: The coffee?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: The SSDI as soon as possible? No.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: My attorney - I - I paid for my attorney.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: My - I paid for him. And they're going to do that. I'm not even worried about that.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, so that's going to be done, but you're not sure it's going to be done by 30 days, so that's  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Yes, that's the problem is. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: That's the piece we have to work. Do you know how to get us to check to see if you go here longer than 30 days. I mean, I - you just want me to ask about that and see if that's a possibility, right? (0:08:06.8)</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: That is your job, isn't it?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, no, I'd be willing to do  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: That's not my job.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: No, no.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: I can't ask them  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: - because they won't even let me in their office anymore.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Because the last time I was here they said I was just bothering people.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay. And apparently you did ask them, and you got the answer - at least the initial answer was no, you can't be here longer than 30 days, right? No - and I'm - what I'm - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Well, that's what you told me yesterday.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah. Oh, I forgot that. Okay Douglas, yeah. But I'm willing to check that again, because I know we have had people here longer than 30 days before.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: And you - you really have? You - you really have?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: I - I think we have.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Okay.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: You - you yourself were here 10 months.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, so that's longer than 30 days.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: A lot longer than 30 days.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, that's longer than 30 days.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: And it's - it's some racial stuff going on up in here, too.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah. Yeah, no. Well, let's  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: It's some racial stuff going on.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: It could - could be, I don't know. But I know  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Joe Blow. He's here forever. He been here for two years.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: They don't even want me here for 30 days.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, but Douglas, you were here for 10 months, so I know it's happened before, so let's look and see if this is the same possibility. So let's - that's on my list. That's something I've got to check. (0:09:05.2)</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Okay.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: And is there anything else you could think of that might help you to stay here longer than a month if you need to? Like, for example, does the way that you get along with people make people not want you to be here longer than 30 months, or do you think there's some racial thing that you think is going on, or is anything you're doing that you have control over that might make it so that people could keep you a little longer?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Man, listen man. I'm from New York, and I think it's my New York attitude and swagger, but - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: That's who I am. I'm - I'm from New York.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well, no, I - that's fine, you can't - you know, you are who you are, but if who you are is - is obnoxious and that gets you kicked out, that's not much fun, right?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Are you calling me obnoxious?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: No, no, no. I'm saying, are we working - are we working on how you can stay here longer than 30 days if you want to, and I'm saying if you treat people so that you feel like they're - you're obnoxious, then they - they don't want you to stay, so - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: I - I heard that before. I heard that.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah. So what I'm saying is, if - let's keep on the prize. If you want to stay here longer than 30 days, let's look at what it might take to do that. Plus I'm going to check to see if that's even possible, but I'm saying stuff you have control over. If that's possible, you're going to look at what you can do to not shoot yourself in the foot about that.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Okay.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Is that fair enough?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Fair enough.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: And can - can you call the kitchen so I can get some coffee please?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: White or black? Sugars?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: That's a real client, folks. That is a real client.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: I know, so. You see, if you don't have some way to think about this, it would be so easy to get angry with him, and, you know. Well, this is just a role play and I feel like strangling him, right?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: I'm glad you say that, because that's how I feel sometimes when I'm sitting with him.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, I know. And - and the thing is that if you get into the helping professions, you can't be wanting to strangle people. That tends not to be - (0:11:03.6)</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Non-productive.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Not - not productive, right. So as Douglas - as the client, how did that go in terms of did we feel like we were fighting? Did it feel like - I mean, what? Good, bad or indifferent? How was it as Douglas?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Actually, you - you - you were very calm, and it calmed me in my whole role playing.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: And you taught me something, actually how to deal with him later on this evening when I meet with him.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: You have my blessings. Yes, well - but what did it teach you in terms of working with him?</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Just that the more hype he gets, just to keep it calm and keep him focused and bring everything back to what needs to be done, and all the other stuff kind of fits.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible at 0:11:50.4)</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: And I may just have coffee there for him already.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, but then it will be too cold. </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Yeah, so  - </p>

<p>MODERATOR: It won't be the right kind. Yeah, right.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: You're absolutely right.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: But - but you might surprise him by actually getting him some coffee, too. That might be  - </p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: That might be a good - without an argument or an attitude, you know? Sometimes a little kindness can go a long way, so - but - but the issue is  - </p>

<p>FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER: Coffee.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: The reason that - coffee, yes. The reason for having some sort of structure is not because of the magic of the structure, but it helps you to stay steady when the bombs are exploding, because what I was saying myself when I felt like saying, "Hey, you're just a clown anyway, right?" No, well I wouldn't say that, but when you feel like saying that, that's where you start, "Wait a second, I don't even know what the 'what' is yet. I'm not even sure what we have a customer for, so let me keep focused on the  - "...</p>

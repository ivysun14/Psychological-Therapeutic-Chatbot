<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, how ya doing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Had a bad, just had a really bad episode at the [DEIDENTIFIED] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it’s the first really bad one I’ve had in a long time. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know just what might have triggered that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think I’ve really been pushing it at work.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And like the day, you know, it’s Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, I was just working and a lot of times when I take the after [INAUDIBLE] days when I usually work from home, I didn’t.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And like Wednesday, I slept until two.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it kicked like that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That was which day, last Monday?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Wednesday</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> After Monday.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Last Wednesday. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But Tuesday, I was so I had so much going on at work with the different departments they had all the, a lot of the executives in and each of the departments and so it was off site with a kick off meeting.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, I was trying to re-route the calls and figuring what time they’re back and get that going and that created havoc in the service in transferring the calls to [DEIDENTIFIED]. They thought they were having problems so I’m up there running around with that and I had the claims executives from here and they had a big meeting in one of the [DEIDENTIFIED] so I had to set up the call for them about one o’clock so [INAUDIBLE] it was almost one o’clock I have to run over to that and they’re still trying to talk about the problem they thought they had and explain to them why they don’t really have a problem, its, I have to run, I’ll be right back…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh my goodness.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you don’t eat or anything. And the dogs were in because it was so cold out that day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, need to run home and let them out to the bathroom, so I’m trying to race home and get back in time to re-route the calls for [DEIDENTIFIED] and you get there by the spilt, you know, like one minute I walk in the door and the girls, yeah they’re back, running upstairs and you know, still try to get out in time for a hair appointment, but then…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Hairs are grey, I’m like, God. You know, and then get home and you still have work.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, you know, it just, that stuff’s continually, but that day it just really hit a head I think, my body’s saying, enough.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. [PATIENT NAME] when the [INAUDIBLE] hits, is it more of the pain or fatigue or both that are problematic?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, sometimes it’s one or the other, this time it was both.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, a lot of the [INAUDIBLE] pain. This one was both.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then this weekend I’m feeling better enough that I could do stuff around the house…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, then I pushed it. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Again and Saturday or, yeah, Saturday night I didn’t get to bed ‘til two o’clock, because I got on a bad organization kick and I’m trying to get caught up.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And [NAME OTHER] was on call working so by the time he got home, I want to spend time with the kids too, so I’m trying to watch them with him and he comes home and, and I was just dead and went to bed.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And the dogs get me up at seven thirty, and I lay down for a couple more hours, and that helps. And usually that would be fine for the day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I didn’t push it again, during the day at all. So, I just tried cooking and you know [NAME OTHER] helped, and that still was just like too much, I was physically ill from the pain and the nausea again…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> When I picked [NAME OTHER] up in [DEIDENTIFIED] last night. So I just, about ten to eight or something, yeah about ten to eight, and when I got home, I didn’t even get out of the car to pick him up, when I got home, I was, I had trouble driving, I should not have gone. And I was physically ill… </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> By the time I got to bed. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I didn’t even sit down and relax or anything when I got home, I just had to get to bed. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’d eaten so…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm. It’s almost like you need something you can take on those, when you have one of these episodes just to kind of keep you going without…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Except you know that [INAUDIBLE]…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Crashing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s if you know that was the question too though.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And this really, when I take something for the pain, what I find is that I just keep going more.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I push my body harder. So, I don’t want to ask for anything else.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What do you take for pain now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The Ultram, I take about four hundred milligrams a day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’m up to sixty milligrams, it was thirty milligrams and then I think it’s sixty milligrams of Kadian. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What’s that one again?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s the slow releasing morphine. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You take it once a day and then it works throughout the day. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then I have, think a 15 milligram of morphine. Little brown pills that you take as you need. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And usually about two a day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, but you said when…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> If I need to I’ll take three.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, if the problem is, when the pains worse, you take more pain medicine then you’re more tired, is that right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Hmm-mm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you seem to keep going you said and then you wear out?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But this, like I said, the first, real attack I’ve had...</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In a long time. You know, where it’s a full fledge kick my butt and you’re out for a couple days?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. There may be another option. Let’s see if we tried you on…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, and the, you questioned the Cymbalta.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> With changes in antidepressants and that helped with the energy and the best part, I haven’t been feeling so fatigued.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It has helped with the energy?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it really did. That’s the one thing I noticed with the Cymbalta, it seemed to take an edge off the pain. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It didn’t make the pain go away, but it did, it changed it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think it took the edge off of it and it also helped with the exhaustion. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] my energy. I did notice that difference on it, so I liked that change.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good. And we’re at ninety now. The maximum is a hundred and twenty which is four pills a day instead of three, so.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I wonder why [NAME OTHER], she’s been trying to change to that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And the same insurance is giving her a horrible time. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It could be tough with insurance sometimes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But it’s the same insurance.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I wonder why.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She thought it was my pain doctor that had gotten it authorized for that level. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And they’re trying to tell her that she has to have like two different prescriptions or some crazy stuff, so I had given her your name and number, but [INAUDIBLE] it’s not like a psychiatrist, but...</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] good psychiatrist [INAUDIBLE] no, it can’t be done.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, I told her, uh-uh [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, there’s one other option too that I don’t know if we ever discussed this, there’s another medication that’s being used for the exhaustion of Fibromyalgia, called Provigil, have we talked about Provigil? It’s an interesting medicine, in that it was developed originally to treat a condition called Narcolepsy, when you fall asleep during the day and can’t stay awake? And now its been also approved for a couple of other reasons, for people that have sleep apnea, where they don’t breath well at night and they’re tired during the day it helps with the energy with those folks. And it’s also been approved now for something called shift work sleep disorder for people who work night shifts? Or rotating shifts and so it throws off their sleep cycle and tired during the day. So those are the approved indications but its also being used a lot now in ADD, it has um, benefits for folks that have trouble concentrating, its been used in depression, I talked to the doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED], the [DEIDENTIFIED], they’re using it at their weight loss clinic in combination with Topamax, interestingly enough. For, for really obese people that may need like stomach stapling surgery or something and its helping them lose some weight, you don’t need to lose weight but that’s a side effect of it. It’s being used for depression, ADHD, and also Fibromyalgia. They’re doing studies now to look at it because it tends to give people energy and the good things about it are it’s not a stimulant. Like Ritalin, or something like that or Dexedrine. It’s not addictive um, you can take it as needed, not take it every day, so for some people, it really gives them a boost in energy.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, so I can take it just as needed.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just when you have an episode, you can take it that day, the only down side that I can see to for you, is insurance again, whether they’ll cover it. Since it’s what’s called an off label use, meaning its not yet indicated specifically for Fibromyalgia, they may go, we’re not going to pay for it then because its very expensive. That’s the only hurdle I’ve ran into, some insurance companies just don’t want to pay for it. But people generally really like it because it gives them more energy without feeling over stimulated. Has minimal side effects, and side effects can be like, like, less than one in ten people have some nausea or headache, nine out of ten have none. I’ve had like one out of thirty or forty people have a little insomnia with it, or a little increase in anxiety, but it can, most people sleep just as well with it as without it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Doesn’t normally increase anxiety, so what it works for, its great. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That would be awesome.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I, it might be worth trying if we can get the insurance to cover it. Now, you don’t have any of the three indications, you don’t have Narcolepsy, you don’t work nights, I don’t think, or rotating shifts. You don’t have sleep apnea, that might be our only hurdle, they may just say nope, we’re not going to approve, it’s not…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, the one thing I do have that we have not talked about, I’m glad you brought that up about the [INAUDIBLE] is…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I am starting to have problems falling asleep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> With like sitting at the computer…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ll find myself just nodding off. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> During the day?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. Or I think I’ve mentioned to you before driving home, from the kids at school.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’ll be fine during the day but when the exhaustion hits…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Is what I’m finding is it hits fast now. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I don’t know if that’s what your describing, but…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, driving home, you’ll like to, be starting to fall asleep at the, in the car?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I’m having a hard time and its not every day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But when it hits, it’s bad.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I even took my parents, if they’re in town they’re not always in town, they travel a lot. They say you should have called. Well, I didn’t know I was going to have that problem. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And, like I said, I’m sitting at the computer and all of a sudden I nodded off.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It just, what is that all about?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s a good question, I don’t know yet. So, it’s happened at the computer, when you’re driving, and other times you notice during the day, do you just feel sleepy?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I mean I’ll be working but and stuff, or just sitting there, I don’t tend to just sit and relax too much. Usually I have something to do. You know, watch TV occasionally, but you know if I get tired, then I’ll go to bed. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, if you’re home, you said?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, yes, so at home you can just take a nap but at the office, you have to kind of try to push through it. How much coffee you drinking that you try to stay awake or just in the course of the day?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> A lot.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Any guesses how many cups like that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I drink it all day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In the evenings.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Like? And how many that size cups do you think you have a day?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> An equivalent?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve rarely gone to [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But a regular…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Regular cups?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Cups?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How many cups do you estimate a day?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> If I work at the office, not as many, maybe that’s part of it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because I’m I don’t even get a chance to go down and get coffee as much. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> At home, I’ve never tried counting but I, you know, I make them by the, I make pots all day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And how many cups are in a pot that you make?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> There’s supposed to be twelve.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, you drink more than one pot a day?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Two pots? One and a half? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I mean, [NAME OTHER]’s there too, then we probably go through four or five pots together a day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, so you drink two pots by yourself?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, that’s twenty four cups.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I would say you know, part of it gets wasted and I…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> May not even drink the whole cup so, I would say I drink at least twelve cups a day myself.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, up to twelve cups a day. Okay, that’s helpful. Yeah, do you want to try the Provigil and see if we get it approved through the insurance to see if it will help you stay awake and be alert?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Especially I think [INAUDIBLE] Fibromyalgia episodes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and especially with driving is really scary. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah I don’t want you to fall asleep at the wheel.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it’s one thing when I’m driving to and from work, that’s not very far.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I spend an hour on the road going to get the kids and drive them home that’s been scaring me. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’ve tried to be real good about my sleep schedule and I’ve been doing a lot better. Remember for a while I was having trouble going to sleep?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That stuff I haven’t been having that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You say you’re getting you’re…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I guess I have been more exhausted in that way, but I’m doing better sleep wise, because I’m going to bed you know, like nine o’clock, and getting up about five fifteen, so…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And how quickly you fall asleep, if you go to bed at nine?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty quick.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, within half -fifteen minutes, half hour?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you said you getting up at five fifteen?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, you’re getting a good eight hours of sleep at night. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And that’s pretty much straight through the night, continuous?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I may get up once to go to the restroom.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> A while back it was, getting up real frequently.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But it’s more restful sleep now.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah like last night, I slept until three thirty in the same position…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm, okay so it sounds like you’re getting some deep sleep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but I woke up to go to the restroom and realized I hadn’t moved. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm. Okay, Huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then, I was asleep right away at nine thirty and when [NAME OTHER] came up at ten thirty and woke me up when he came to bed and I fell right back asleep. And that’s why I know what position I was in.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Hey [PATIENT NAME], I don’t think you’ve done a sleep study, have you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-uh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s not that we need to do right now, but it’s something we could think about. You know what sleep studies are? Basically, they have these places sleep labs or sleep clinics, where you go and you spend the night there and they hook you up to different monitors, they monitor your EEG, they monitor your eye movements, they monitor your breathing, your respiration, your pulse ox, you have a doctor examine your blood screen. They monitor your legs movements and um, they’re looking for different sleep disorders that may cause people to not sleep well. And for some people, its, that they wake up during the night, some people sleep a lot of hours, but they don’t get into the right kind of sleep, they don’t have restful, deep, restorative sleep. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It varies.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It really varies, I can tell, I can tell whether I’ve dreamed or I’ll wake myself up with a jerk, I, really bad jerking. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Since I’ve gotten the Fibro…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Since it has gotten worse.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’ll wake [NAME OTHER] up. I’ll hit the headboard, my whole legs will go flying, my whole arms, it scares the crap out of me. It’s not comfortable.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, something, you kind of twitch? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it’s not a little twitch. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You really jerk? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Your arms or your legs or both?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Both. It’s either or both. Its, and I’ll go through a series, you know, a period of time like that and then I wont have it at all. Boy did it, something like that which, depends on when you caught me like…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right now, I seem to be sleeping real peaceful…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then I’ll go through a time where I am not uh, I don’t know if part of its hormonal too with uh, like the sweats, waking up with night sweats you know, putting my hormone thing on and off with that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I got a lot of [INAUDIBLE]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, there’s a condition called periodic limb movement disorder, PLM, do you, have you heard of that? Where people have these movements with their arms and the their legs…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, make it go away.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, the challenge first would be to figure out if that’s what you got for sure or not. There are a bunch of different kinds of things that can go wrong when you’re sleeping that can cause us to not get restful sleep. Um, so its one of the things we could consider to having you do a sleep study. It’s painless, it’s just um, you go in, check in about eight o’clock at night at a sleep clinic. They have them in [DEIDENTIFIED], they have them in [DEIDENTIFIED], in [DEIDENTIFIED] and there quite a few of them now and you just again, just they hook you up to all these…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t like [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. I know with most people, when they do it, when they hear about it they oh, I’ll never sleep with them hooked up on things that, every one I’ve had do it its really not bad, you, you know, there like couple of beds and you watch TV and stuff and do your normal routine, you wake up in the morning and you go home. So, in a way you don’t have to, now at some point if we can’t get you feeling better, it might be worth considering doing that, just to see if there’s something going on that we could treat. But…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> One of the problems I have is I you know, waking up from pain. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Fibro wakes me up…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I do tend to go back to go to sleep, it’s a good thing. I rarely wake up and not go back to sleep. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So that’s very rare. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Real rare. My hip caused a lot of problems sleeping, I got that, it’s called Cuddle Ewe.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What’s that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Cuddle E-W-E.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s a company and they make a pad for your bed it’s called an under quilt.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And, the kids’ pediatrician, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] told me about it for people with Fibromyalgia. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I bought one and it made a huge difference.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, it’s a pad you put under your sheets?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You put it on top of your mattress.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And it’s made of wool.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But it’s real interesting, but it’s kind of heavy. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s got something under it that I can move around myself.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because of Fibro, you know, otherwise I wanted to do it, but um, anyway, we’ve got the most comfortable bed now. It’s really comfortable. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And it’s better than the, I tried the feather down thing, it’s not that, but yeah, if you go into their web site, cuddleewe.com, and check it out, this thing is really cool. And that helps, just huge. That and then you know, just to put a pillow between my knees…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s one thing I have to try going [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] I’m like this whole mess now. [INAUDIBLE] asleep. I’ve got my whole system down.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But, the uh, that helps a lot with the Fibro pain.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> For your legs and everything.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And so that’s been a big help. Um, and I’ve been trying to get better about doing the exercises and [INAUDIBLE] that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] had sent me for.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Physical therapy on that I need to get better on it so I know if its going to help or if I have to do worse things. There’s a problem in lower spine.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My joint.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] like right now, that worked.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, but, there are mornings when I get up, and I can hardly walk from the pain, it starts here, but I can walk it out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is it in your hips starting early?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah it goes straight across. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So where it starts in that joint, it just goes straight across. Even [INAUDIBLE] I didn’t think about what it was. So, that’s why chiropractor comes up and completely fix it, it gives me temporary relief.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s something with the joint itself. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, but anyway, they, he sent me for physical therapy and I’ve got those giant balls now that I actually do stuff on.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But it um, it does help. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] I just have to keep doing it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, see if that helps too.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because that’ll wake me up and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you do…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And that’s not medicine, I don’t have to take a pill.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, which is good? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, part of…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t need more pills.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, you can avoid it, it’s nice. So, part of it may be you’re not getting restful sleep because of the Fibromyalgia or maybe periodic limb movement disorder or something else going on. And you’re falling asleep during the day, wiped out. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Boy that’s a real violent thing when that goes off.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, its seemed to be right as I’m falling asleep, or have just fallen asleep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I wouldn’t say I do that after, in the middle of my sleep. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s when I notice it, it’ right at the beginning stages of sleep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And did you say, does it wake you up or just?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just [NAME OTHER], both of ya?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah, you don’t go off like that and not wake yourself up, scares the crap out of ya.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, hmm. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Seems to be, I don’t know what the symptoms are at that state, that’s when I notice that I do it…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, its not every night though, its just sometimes, comes in spells, kind of?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s would I would say, it’s, I think it comes in spells.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Like, I don’t think I’ve done it for a while. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, and [PATIENT NAME] its not a sensation of restlessness, you know like, like you have to keep moving your legs, uh, like they’re antsy or restless, no, okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-uh. No I don’t, from that antsy, restless…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, sometimes I’ll sit here like this, but…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, but not laying in bed, you can’t lie still because you have to move your legs anything like that? Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, Uh-uh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Nothing like that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Well…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I have enough screwed up…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, you’re just, there’s a lot that’s going on…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But uh, the challenge is, we have to figure out what it is so we can figure out how to help with it, and it sounds like a lot of it is the Fibromyalgia pain probably. Their may be other things too um…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You what neat things keep developing since then, and I’m just like wow. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I was wondering too if the fatigue could be part of the bipolar disorder. Could you be going into a depressive episodes but it…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t feel depressed in my house though.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good. And I don’t hear you having manic swings either, where you get an excessive energy, you feel high. Do you have these things like that? You do? How often?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I can [INAUDIBLE]. I do definitely get some I am getting some manicky states, I mean not out of control, </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What I’ve noticed though, is I get into spending things.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. So…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I do spend.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just spending more like, what kind of things do you buy?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, kind of anything, you know, I, I had it under control by just not going shopping.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then you know, I found the internet, so.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, so you…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You get things [INAUDIBLE] too easily?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. The UPS and FEDEX, they’ll come to my doorway, I get like…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh. Is it like cloths or things for the house?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Both.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Both, both, okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know whatever, yeah. Whatever I’m in the mood, if I get um, yeah I really have. And then I see the damage on the bills [INAUDIBLE] and it’s like oh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so you bought more than you realized? Or you didn’t kind of keep track of how much you’re spending?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t really keep, you know I think oh, okay, I can do that and then its like, oh, no, no I really, but I really like it. And then I though yeah I just don’t have any of that control still.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So it’s like impulse shopping?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I was doing real good for so long and then…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Now, during these times that you’re shopping more do you have-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I haven’t spent like two thousand dollars at a time…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But, you know, it adds up to thousands.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Okay. During those times when you’re shopping more, do you notice uh, having more energy?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> More energy. Does your sleep change during those times; do you not need as much sleep?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I haven’t noticed any of that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No changes of…?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, I can’t say. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Not sure.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Wasn’t paying attention.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. What about appetite? Do you notice that you eat less during those times? Or you’re not sure?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Wasn’t paying attention to it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Not sure. Okay. Do you get racing thoughts where your minds going faster? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. I would say yeah because sometimes [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Shopping on different web sites, okay. What about, do you become more talkative?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I can’t say because I’m on the Internet.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Whoops. Do you need a paper towel or something?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You’re getting me excited here.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What about, does your sex drive go up during those times?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I wouldn’t know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Not sure, okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> since [NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Okay. Or do you drive your car faster? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, hmm, because I’m working so hard I’m not doing that, I don’t, when I notice I’m driving faster it’s when I’m in a hurry. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I try really hard not to do that so yeah, I’m not known for going into a completely [INAUDIBLE] I know I’m not doing that…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I noticed I’m edgy.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> To see you’re kind of moving in that direction but not a full blown episode, okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I’m not going full blown, huh-uh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But I am edgy.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> At times.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m definitely real talkative at time that I can’t seem to shut up. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, now are you taking the Topamax daily?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I love the Topamax. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But yeah I’m…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now, [PATIENT NAME] again there’s one precaution I guess you know, with the Proventil, and Topamax there’s a possibility you may lose some weight. Do you know how much you’re weighing now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I weigh 150. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, what I’ve seen is not usually extreme weight loss, you know, for most people, you know, it’s, well maybe, it varies from person to person, maybe ten or twenty pounds you just have to be careful, you don’t lose too much weight. So, I don’t think you have to be concerned, if you find your weight’s starting to drop, just let me know. Okay? And you won’t be taking it every day probably either, you’ll be taking it just when you need it, so reduce the risk of excessive weight loss and then again I haven’t had anybody lose too much. But that is a possible side effect in combination. Okay, so, so we got a few things going on. The Fibromyalgia being the primary one, some mood swings a little bit, nothing extreme but a little up and down. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Nothing I feel concerned about…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. That’s been going on for quite a while.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So they’re manageable for the most part. Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> If I really [INAUDIBLE] myself, its amazing how when your medicated for as many years…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> as we’ve been doing this. As hard as we work on all this together.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I can become more aware of it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Now. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that’s good. You want to keep, helping you realize as you’re having um, problems we can do something about it, and also things are going well, so we can keep building on that. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it’s just real interesting now, looking at it and you know when other people [INAUDIBLE] asking questions and stuff or [INAUDIBLE] they try talking about their situation or where they think they were its like I’m not a psychiatrist, I can’t tell you and no two people are alike and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do they ask you for advice, you mean or, or just do they like to talk about their…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No about what their doctor’s doing and stuff and I’m like I’m not a psychiatrist and I’m not and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So you know, or, you know, sometimes it’s so far fetched you know, that just doesn’t sound anything like you know, what it was like for me or anybody I’ve heard but…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Especially when it’s braggy. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I think there’s too much guilt that goes with Bipolar, with the things you say and do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You don’t wear it proudly. You know, I still have all this guilt. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> As a mother, from [NAME OTHER]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I have trouble watching, you know, a new show somebody being abusive to a child.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The screaming and that. That‘s terrible guilt. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I kind of realized [INAUDIBLE] hard for me I remember. And…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] doesn’t hold that against me, he’s such a great person…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He’s just an awesome man, I’m so proud of who he’s become. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, we have a great relationship but yeah…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, [PATIENT NAME] one of the things…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s not something that you run around going you know, guess what, I might be Bipolar and you know you’re all like, that’s such a thrilling thing, no, it’s a terrible, it’s a terrible thing to have.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well it…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s an on-going job [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s like alcoholism or something, it’s not a good thing to have and you know, I get so angry at [NAME OTHER] because I’m, I’ve worked so hard at this, and with the Fibro and everything, I’ve worked so hard at all of this and he hasn’t worked at any of his stuff.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He makes me angry. And I don’t understand how he can know [INAUDIBLE] hurt me so badly. [INAUDIBLE] and I didn’t know it hurt you so bad and then do nothing. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> About it. I don’t get that. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Has he ever seen counselor?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm. And won’t, or?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He’s going to have to do something, I’m not going to keep going like this.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And [INAUDIBLE] I thought he was depressed or whatever, [INAUDIBLE] too upsetting for him to bring that up, I don’t know why. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, would he even discuss it with you? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I got very like scared, upset that he keeps bringing it up.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I dropped it last year but I don’t know that he’s depressed now, but he gets, needs something [INAUDIBLE] he gets very, edgy at times and but he’s such a good person and I love him dearly, it’s not all bad. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> There’s just a couple of things, you know, we all have a couple of things but it’s really hard being with him, never wants to touch you or anything and then um, you know we had that great talk about it and he’s got pills he can take, it’s like for Gods sakes, I told him, you got a pill that’ll fix you geez, I take more pills than anybody and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He won’t take them?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He hasn’t, not over a month. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Does he say why, why he won’t take them?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh you know, I’m already in bed and [INAUDIBLE] it’s just excuses. They’re excuses that I get. And that was all before we talked so now that we’ve talked, I mean it’s just, I thought [INAUDIBLE]. How that all makes sense [INAUDIBLE]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I could live with it. He just couldn’t, there was no help.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But when there are things he can do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And especially since the medication lasts for a couple of days.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm, yeah, because that will take it right down.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If you ask him, did he tell you why he’s not taking it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That he could have at least asked.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We had talked and...</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, the boys are here this week, after they’re gone, yeah I even went to um, [DEIDENTIFIED] Saturday [INAUDIBLE] Saturday and [INAUDIBLE] joking around about it. You know, having sex and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] and I thought for sure when we went home, he maybe would, you know, take something and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Now, I don’t know, maybe [INAUDIBLE] because he had to work Saturday night and you know, cause I’m sick last night, but…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Used to be, you know, I mean he’s had excuses, like we go to bed too late or you know, I even admit it, when we talked that, I asked him to read in bed because [INAUDIBLE] I had created my distance between us and you know it, accepted my part. In that…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And [INAUDIBLE] told me what he needed to tell me, so I didn’t realize it at the time. So, yeah it made him angry then.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That you were reading in bed?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I had created that distance that he’d come to bed and it was real, but you know, that’s what I told him that nothing was happening so…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That I created my own space and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, maybe it’s worth talking with him again about it do you think? See if there’s any way that you can start connecting again and kind of be on the same page and, its like you’re empty. Your interest is there and he has medicine he can take, which allows him to function normally it’s just, I was wondering if he’s had his testosterone level checked, do you know? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He has to actually go and have lab work done he doesn’t do that. He gets his uh, physical done every year for our anniversary.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I make him do that, we go in together. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But then he has to actually remember to go get his lab work done.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t want to be somebody else’s mother so much. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He has to take some accountability for this, but yeah, I thought his testosterone level has got to be low.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, and that could be…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But he doesn’t even think about it enough to take a pill.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right that could be part of the problem if his drive is way down because his levels have dropped, he may not even think about it, enter his mind.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I was reading up on the symptoms of the male menopause and testosterone and it’s like God yeah, he just fits the T. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But you know we were in there, his physical and I had mentioned that and I think it may have been one of the things on that lab work.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm, so he did have it done?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know, he hasn’t [INAUDIBLE] here yet. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, it’s ordered he…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It was ordered, he just didn’t…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We don’t know what his prostates tests are or anything because he doesn’t go in.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is he afraid to have blood drawn, or he just doesn’t want, doesn’t do it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I think he is maybe because it took forever to get him into the eye doctor even though glaucoma problems that run in his family. His brother has prostate cancer, um, my brother in law who’s younger than [NAME OTHER] has prostate cancer. And my step father just got done with prostate surgery. So, my brother in law is younger than [NAME OTHER] and my step father both have had surgery and [NAME OTHER] brother, forgot what treatment he used. And my step father was so advanced, they didn’t think it was even worth looking at, the doctor didn’t. but they couldn’t get anybody to do the surgery because his age and the surgeon he was like a nine when they got him there.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And that was just his number over the years it changed.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] and he thought well, I can wait ‘til next year. My mother thought, why wait? So she pushed it. They could have lost him it was so advanced. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, [NAME OTHER] just doesn’t…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He didn’t get it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I just [INAUDIBLE] I have five minutes for myself and I get so tired of trying to, but you know, he’s so good about, I don’t know, he’s good about a lot of things. [INAUDIBLE] I think sort of takes it away at the same time, I took [NAME OTHER] to the grocery store, but he’s turned that into, well that’s a big list, well do we need that or...</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But he does help out in other areas?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, he does a lot of the cooking, he had quit doing the cooking and then he started up again.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I think he, I don’t know, we always appreciated everything he did. He seemed to kind of take a lot of that away.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Like he was resentful or something someway.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know why. But he’s starting to do it again.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s really weird, [INAUDIBLE] we thank him for making dinner and every body thought he was a good cook and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] really like, and it’s not like it’s everybody kind of like [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But… </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, just in terms of your marriage in general, [PATIENT NAME], how do you feel like, I hear some, some good things and some things that are frustrating to you? I mean, do you feel like things are going okay with [NAME OTHER] or do you feel frustrated to the point where you feel like somethings got to change or, how are you feeling overall?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, things definitely need to improve, but over all it’s not um, in danger.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know. You know, [NAME OTHER] and I are in the long haul. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, over all things are going well, just need to work some specific areas?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I, [INAUDIBLE] it’s probably the testosterone. I don’t honestly believe he’s not attracted to me or anything, I honestly believe that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It just gets frustrating that you know he did talk to the doctor about it when he was in there and he gave him a pill. You know, it was funny, the doctor said um, so how’s it going, he said are you happy, he goes, well I am, he goes, how is she? He goes not, he goes that’s not okay. So, I’m honest with him.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean we always had good communication, we lost it there for a while but you know, [INAUDIBLE] and the cards and everything and [INAUDIBLE] we never should have survived the dating state.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Say, we’ve never had a clam state in our relationship ‘til now. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And now, it’s the aftermath of all the crap for five years. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, when you look at that God, now it’s done damage on your relationship. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm, so [NAME OTHER] has still stayed pretty settled down?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He [INAUDIBLE] things that, in the beginning would have drove us nuts, now are considered not bad.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, he tells the kids too much still. Like they know, he’s got zero in his checking account and he borrowed five hundred dollars from each of them.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And, to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] with his girlfriend over Christmas. And, that’s how they look it as, it was whatever, but, uh, he wants to take [NAME OTHER] scuba diving over spring break when they’re supposed to be with me and I thought well that’s a good idea, for [NAME OTHER] and him to do together.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] would certainly rather go skiing with his friends.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I thought that was great. And, [NAME OTHER] agreed. You know, that would just be a real ass-hole thing of me to do, to not let [NAME OTHER] go do something with his dad. It’s not like I have special plans with him. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, that would just be an ass-hole thing to do. Even though I’m not sure about the country or anything where they’re going.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, I just had questions.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And he was communicating through [NAME OTHER] which I didn’t like. And [NAME OTHER] said you need to send dad an e-mail, and I said no he needs to send me an e-mail and ask me if you can go. And I said I’ll let him know, you don’t need to be in the middle. So, all of a sudden I get an e-mail from [NAME OTHER] and it’s, I need an e-mail from you saying it’s okay for [NAME OTHER] to go. You know? So, I’m just like, whatever. So, [INAUDIBLE] replied and said, told [NAME OTHER] I thought it was a great idea for the two of you to do something together and I do have some questions. Will it be just the two of you because I’m thinking, it’s not that I care who’s with him, it’s like, going to be in another country alone?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’m kind of nervous about that, but I also have to think if it’s not on my time, he’ll do it some other time with him too. I just want to know what’s the scoop here.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And uh, what dates would you be traveling, if I don’t ask these questions up front I’ll never get the information from him. That’s the way he is.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You get it now or never.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, while you have any control over it, ask.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I haven’t heard back from him.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s only six weeks away or so probably no?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I just asked him last week, but it took me a week to get back to him, and that was just cause I, you know, I get like three hundred e-mail’s a day at work and [INAUDIBLE] didn’t get back to him and [NAME OTHER] was so cute, he kept calling me and sending me e-mails, e-mail dad to answer him because I told him if you want to remind me, it’s okay, it wont bother me. I said it’s not your job but it won’t upset me if you remind me to get back to it, so, because this is important to him and I needed to get back to him on it. But it gotten lost on the e-mail so I wasn’t seeing it when I was online.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, I wasn’t intentionally not getting back to it. And um, [INAUDIBLE] down to it again.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, he, he was so cute, so he would text me, e-mail dad. He cracks me up. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He’s a good kid.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, both of them are good kids.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But uh, anyway, that’s the kind of crap that I haven’t heard back from him, so I don’t know, if [NAME OTHER] didn’t say anything. So I’m going to ask him today that, what’s the scoop, I want to hear back from your dad. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so it sounds like it’s the same old kind of annoying stuff there’s not really flaring up and creating big…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I had the cops coming into my house…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because I took the kids to the doctor and [NAME OTHER] screaming that…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, he doesn’t know where they are, like I’ve stolen them.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Or, yeah, so no, this is nothing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Compared to that, he hasn’t switched [INAUDIBLE] without telling me and not looking at me as a parent. You know, he’s not screaming. I don’t have crazy [NAME OTHER] running out to my car screaming at me, he isn’t refusing to let them leave the house when they’re supposed to come to my house. Yeah, this is mild. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, relatively speaking.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. So no this was nothing. This is stuff everybody deals with. [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] all upset because [NAME OTHER]’s broke, he has zero dollars and has to take half of everything he has on the divorce and I said that’s not true [NAME OTHER] I said I think your hearing stories and he said he told me, I know it, he’s paying all these attorneys, that’s why there’s no money, and all this. [NAME OTHER][INAUDIBLE] that’s real black and white. I know, I divorced on that. You haven’t got a divorce you cannot get half of everything he has. Been only married a couple of years. About two years so, he says, he told me and why you, why you argue with everything I tell you? I said I don’t but I do correct you when you are mistaken. And that’s wrong. And she can’t get half of everything he had. She’s not entitled to it. Everything he had before they got married she is not entitled to. And he’s all that’s what dad said and I said, he’s mistaken. And I said she gets half of whatever they earned together or whatever else they appreciated in value after they were together but guess what, housing market went down while they were together so that’s probably not going to happen either. And she has her own house so they’ll split what they came in. Because you know, she ripped him off, she took the TV and ripped off the house so she came out pretty good in the deal.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But, [INAUDIBLE] I’m just telling you, oh he said well that’s what she’s asking for and I said well asking and getting are two different things [NAME OTHER]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m sure she is asking. That’s the kind of person she is, but I said I was entitled to half and I didn’t take half. See, there’s it’s difference, I didn’t have to have half either. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, that’s not how it works [NAME OTHER]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s kind of confusing for them because of the stories they’re hearing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yeah and that’s wrong that he’s doing. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, they shouldn’t be involved.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That he’s like a Martyr and oh look at me and another woman screwed me over, I wanted to say but I didn’t, see I did good, I wanted to say I know, and I screwed him over too. I didn’t, I did catch myself.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good, yeah, good…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> After all these years, you know, I did want to finally go I know when I screw him over too but that’s not true. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But the thing is, they’ll figure out eventually on their own without you having to tell them that their dad plays the victim [INAUDIBLE] role. You know, kids as they get older, they start to see the bigger picture. And they realize that the what they’ve heard all the time is not necessarily so. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, he knows and I know he doesn’t like his dad I know…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. That hurts.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I shouldn’t have said what I did say, but it just, they’re not going to go or anything anymore.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Not going where?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> To therapy.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Anymore. It wasn’t doing any good, they were not doing anything for them, they just can’t stand each other and so they weren’t learning anything in there.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I just need em to, every once in a while I have to tell them what the truth is; I can’t sit there and lie.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] so it’s like, enough. Your dad’s not a martyr and I hear [NAME OTHER] doing it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We’re on in two weeks, right?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think we’re all set, on a good schedule. So, let me give you this Provigil, when you take it in, if there’s a, they may approve it right off the bat, they may say it may require prior authorization, if it does, the pharmacy will call, contact me and I’ll work with the insurance, see that we get it approved, okay? If we can’t, there are some other things we could try but this was probably the safest and um, the most effective. So let’s give this a try, see if you can get it first, okay?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] sleep all the time.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah it sure would and more energy to be able to get more things done too. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know what would be nice if I wonder if I would be more productive on it, because right now I’m having a real hard time being as productive.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You might be [PATIENT NAME] and also just you know, I put on there one half to one tablet up to twice a day. So, I’d probably start with a half tablet in the morning, see if it’s enough…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> See how I react?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, and if it’s not enough, take a full one and then if it wears off too soon, you could take a second dose midday. Like around noonish?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe the two, if you need to.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Yeah, actually if you take it too late, it can, you know, if you’re sleep again, usually it doesn’t…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah you don’t need so much. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] start taking [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s no fun. All right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] All right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, thank you for [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well thanks.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, take care of yourself. Call me if you have any questions, okay? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, sounds good. Bye-bye.</P>

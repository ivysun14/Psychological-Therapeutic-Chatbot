<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session five, August 24, Client JS</p>

<p>PATIENT: His mother's in the other room with Dave. I think it's his mother. It may be his brother, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, we'll go until 7:30.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I gave a friend a friend a brochure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah? Ok, fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was on the table out here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's on the table.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I gave it to him. I wrote a check on the table.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, we'll see. Where were we? I missed last week. I hope it didn't inconvenience you by the way because I called kind of late.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it turned out I was extremely glad that you called and it turned out that it was just great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good. Where were we anyway? I was, we were some kind of pursuant to, at the last meeting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anyway the last thing we were talking about...0:01:08.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was sexual athletes but I don't want to do that now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. What did you have in mind that you wanted?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, why don't, I don't know. Anyway I think that real things that I want to start saying I'm not making very much progress in my self awareness campaign. Because the real reason why I missed last time would be because I had a little relapse in my alcoholic ways. On Monday evening, Monday? Yeah Monday evening. I didn't go to work on Tuesday. Sort of slept in. And again I went through the normal routine. But anyway there was no way possible I could get myself down here in my state and carry on this conversation without throwing myself out the window. So I thought it best to remain at home in bed. And... 0:02:10.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're kind of disappointed in after coming here that you didn't overcome that urge Monday night, or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. Kind of disappointed in myself that I haven't been able to overcome those things. I tell you one thing that these little sessions do though I think is when you do go out in the real world and talk with people you begin to see the little power, psychic kind of power currents going. I don't mean stuff like (inaudible at 0:02:41.4) But you understand the way that that people will talk. The little accents they'll put on. And there often is something I didn't recognize I think before with people where they can get competitive with you, you know. And I had remarked that with my own talking with other people but I see it now in connection with other people talking to me too. You know when you meet people. Which I am doing essentially quite a bit because of my work and my single status so and so forth.</p>

<p>And I'm thinking for example in particular when you meet people in a bar you're always....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say when I meet?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell me about when I meet, instead of when you meet? All I'm asking you to do is talk about I instead of you. Use the word I instead of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, all right. Ok, when I meet people I've begun to see I think all these things. Some of the mechanisms that are going on in my head as well as theirs. And how difficult it really is for me to talk to someone on an easy level, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels (inaudible at 0:03:51.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not that I'm more competitive than they are. It's just that I feel like going into the conversation generally I feel immediately one down, you know. And sometimes will be sort of negative towards them to get the blows in earlier, you know. And that causes a reaction, you know, to (inaudible at 0:04:10.6). I really saw that recently. It was very real to me. I'm trying to think of the exact circumstances. They're not really that important, but the tenseness that comes up and the jokes that I make. You know when you're standing around in a group and everyone is just laughing and you're trying to be funny or witty. The witty remarks that I make are generally, the person could easily take them as a put down to themselves. In fact they frequently are. I assume into making fun of them. 0:04:44.2</p>

<p>Which is horrible because it's really not what I want to do. I don't think it's what anybody really wants to do you know, just automatically put someone down. But the reason why I'm doing it is from this automatic assumption that well, I may as well get my licks in first because they're going to get their licks in later.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the new awareness that you have? That you have that urge to...0:05:04.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, since I started being aware it's a lot more vivid. Let's put it that way. I suppose I was aware of it. But I mean sometimes now in mid-sentence I can see that I'm doing it, so. And that way I guess the things that are disappointing is I thought it is very difficult to get out of that habit. You know doing things. I think that that habit is a very concrete kind of thinking that I should like to be able to, you know because it is something that you can point your finger at and say well you're doing this. Don't do that. And just stop doing it. But I find that very difficult to do because really that I'm not spontaneous with people. You know, not really spontaneous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's all lined up and it's really hard to change for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. plan it out ahead that I want to appear a certain way to you know. And insecure about that. In a way I'm not exactly sure what I, how I'm going to appear. But I sort of bumbling along though it. And defining it negatively. I don't want to appear this way. I don't want to appear that way. So on and so forth. And it's quite difficult to relate spontaneously to people like that. 0:06:13.0</p>

<p>A lot of people seem to be able to do it fairly well. But I'm always looking for that little jerk, tic in the muscle of the other person's eye where they say like, "I reject you." Or they turn away. And then I'm almost waiting for that to end. Especially with brief encounters with females. I'm always waiting for that little tic. And then I know I've lost it. And that's humiliating. And that's why I try to avoid that. I'm trying to, or I know that it's going to happen so I'm going to try and make it look better in my own eyes. Sort of psychologically tell myself well I kind of blew them off anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. It really sounds like a self defeating thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. But it doesn't sound that remarkable to you because I mean you can see that, you can see that happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, yeah. I can see it particularly with you. I don't see that in all people. 0:07:07.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, right. I don't think that's true either. Because there'd be crazy, pretty miserable people if we all did that. And we don't. Because I can see other people that don't do that. But I'm sol convinced that there's going to be this negative reaction on the other person's part that I do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would happen if you became aware of yourself. Say, a female situation sounds too threatening. Say you're talking to a buddy of yours. Somebody that you know fairly well. Not your best buddy but somebody you know fairly well. And you realize that you're putting them down first. And you caught that in mid sentence. What would happen if you say, "I'm playing a game of one-upsmanship. I'd rather not do that. Let's do something else." 0:08:02.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well see it's, I think that really, and this probably sounds, what would happen would be this. Number one that would blow the entire game and make him even more the game that you're playing with people that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is the game you're playing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know what the object of it is. But I think that the game's rules are that you do adapt a kind of stylized method of talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who told you that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's my observation. It's certainly one I do. It's my observation that other people do it too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. That would be on that game. Ok. So what if you quit playing that game?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well then I don't have very much to say to them, some of them. I mean I am so used to conversing in those terms.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're bored and lonely with that one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm certainly bored with it. Yeah, I'm probably lonely too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about trying another style of conversing with someone? 0:09:02.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. Well that's, you know right. That's the big question. How does one do that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does one do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think to some extent you have to really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say I have to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I would have to do (chuckles) sounds conditional. Would be to, you know like adopt different friends or something, or a different lifestyle. Because committed as I am to the middle class ethic as it were, you really almost would have to adopt different friends. Because then they'd become confused you know. In a certain way you see, I think the respect that, this is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like a real put down to those people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is, it is. It is a real put down, a real put down. I don't you know I don't believe in that in what I conceive to be their style as being valid. But I consider myself as worked in it, you know? 0:10:08.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but you're saying that you're the one that's recognized that in those rules you're saying that's the objective of the game. You know, who knows if those are really their rules? You say that's not what you really want to do. So I'm still wondering why you continue to play it? I know what might be why you continue to play. I have a pretty good idea why you continue to play. But I'd really like to push you into trying something else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I could do it I suppose. But, and I do want to do it. As I say I see it as a self defeating mechanism for me. And that, see here's the thing. I think that other people when they deal with one another do play within a certain universe, certain rules, certain theories hang on what they say to each other. I don't think I do that especially well. In fact I think I'm fairly inept at it. 0:11:24.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't do what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Relating to other people the way they are able to. I don't think that when people, other people talk who apparently have a fairly satisfying with others around them night after night. I don't think that they are really being sincere. I think that they are sending out signals somehow. Maybe one of the other technical signals, you know. But I think that in the first instance when they begin to talk they begin to see, "Ah, here's someone like me and who talks the way I talk." And I feel different than other people do, you know. And I don't feel like I can, to put it in the crudest possible terms, you know all I can think about to say a rah-rah type verses someone that is not a rah-rah type. Don't feel that when two rah-rahs are talking together they're probably not, they're playing certain games, you know. But they, and there are quips flying back and forth. 0:12:32.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the rah-rah type is the kind that you associate with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The kind that I associate with but I'm not like. I am not as they are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the world you want to make it in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's the world that I would like to make it in. So that is, I guess why not. And so I think that the, but obviously the satisfaction that they get from one another doesn't come from saying, "I saw the Bears at a football game." Or whatever a man and woman talk about that relates in the same fashion for them. They really aren't saying that to one another. They're saying something else behind it. They're saying that I'm like you or you're like I am when they get the same kind of response going back and forth. But I think that when I get in that conversation. So that's the kind of where the satisfaction comes from. Not what they're saying but the signals that they're sending to one another through what they're saying. When I get...0:13:26.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what? I want you to, I'd like you to, that sounds like a very involuted system that you've got figured out in your head. And I'm really curious if it works that way. You might ask somebody if that's the way it works. Or do they get satisfaction. Or what is involved in a communication. I'm not saying walk up to a stranger. It has to be someone you know and ask them about that. Because you're basing, you're putting a lot of weight on that kind of assumption. And I'd really like for you to check it out some.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I could ask someone, sure. The kind of person I'd ask, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you do that before next week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure, .I'll do a little research project. But what do you do, do you have any idea what they're going to say? 0:14:16.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I have some idea what they might say but I'm not sure at all either. But I think it's, I don't know these people that your with. But if I were you I'd find out more about how that works.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Well the reason why (inaudible at 0:14:37.6) as an explanation is because I can't see any other. Because (inaudible at 0:14:43.4) It's a, ok even it, assuming that it isn't artificial, maybe that they're, these aren't (inaudible at 0:14:49.6) mostly. Maybe they're just talking things that I don't find mutually interesting. But I know that in any event, I cannot do that. I guess a lot of things they talk about leave me cold. I guess my problem is partly that I am so (inaudible at 0:15:04.1) and so terribly self concerned that I can't talk about anything very much except as it relates specifically to me and my interests, you know and problems. 0:15:14.2</p>

<p>And it comes back to my own bias. But in any event I find it very difficult to relate to those kinds of people. So what I do instead is to devise a method to try and make them look foolish. Or communicate to them how foolish they look in my own eyes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which certainly isn't a very good way to make (inaudible at 0:15:43.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, it certainly isn't. It certainly isn't. And don't do well I must say. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like it wouldn't be too expensive to give up that game. 0:15:57.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it wouldn't. But it would really, see I get utterly confused at this point. I don't know whether that's a game or not or who's playing what game. But I don't know. I, sometimes I don't feel like if I were to, for example there was a girl that I met at a show the other night. And we began to talk. And we talked about something that interests me and we went on and on. I found myself being quite surprised at the ease with which we, I was a little stiff of course, with the ease with which I talked with her and she with me. Well I finally, the lights finally went out on me and somebody called me a taxi cab or something and I went home .0:16:55.7</p>

<p>But the reason why I am pointing it out is that it is such a rare occasion, you know. And yet and I can't relate to people on any other level except when you know. I started to say something that she agreed with. I was a little surprised that she agreed. I was a little surprised that she had very much interest in it. And we elaborated on the theme for some time. And she was reinforcing what I said and I was reinforcing and we went on to something else and found some other common ground. And I was surprised because she was a very cute attractive girl. Very conventional looking. And so we finally, as I say, finally the lights went out on whatever it was that I was talking about. But I just got the sensation that generally my little light patter isn't of much interest to other people in a certain way, you know. 0:18:04.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there is one example where you found differently.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well yeah but I say it's very rare. I just can't put my finger on it. I don't know what it is. Except to say that I automatically, the only thing I have to say in my defense about just appearing as a dull uninteresting person is that what I think I do is to try and put them off initially. And you know, send out a big brag to say listen you're not like me. I'm a hell of a lot better than you are and have better things to say than you guys are saying. You're, you know you're this kind of person and I'm not. And that lasts for about two seconds. And then the whole tic I was talking about comes out. It comes out earlier too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel? To give people the impression that they're very common person? 0:18:59.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well obviously it doesn't satisfy me in the long run. But the short run satisfies me because that way when the rejection, in my mind, when the rejection that is coming comes, I'm not as humiliated as I would be ordinarily. That's a great, great fear in my emotional life is that fear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being rejected?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably the whole mainstream of the thing is that (inaudible at 0:19:25.8) or any of that, of the consequences of things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of being rejected.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I, that's done before. And I convince them that I eminently reject the whole. I've convinced myself of that. Or I am convinced of it or something. So I automatically assume that that is what's going to happen. And as a result I take steps to insulate myself from it happening. And even bringing it on a little sooner than it might otherwise by force of habit. 0:19:57.0</p>

<p>And it, if what I'm saying is correct, it doesn't have any real relationship to what I do in the world, the social world and it is really a horrifying thing. Because it is such, it is really such a shallow response on my part that I (inaudible at 0:20:19.9) about other people because it is such a banal kind of response on my own part. But I don't really know any other way to cope with people other than to do that. This has been the way I've handled right along. And I've handled right along also by convincing myself that I don't really need other people. I've always been pretty much of a loner, you know. I've looked with envy upon the Esquire magazine type, Playboy magazine type but I don't feel I'm able to cut that in a way. So I always retreat back into myself because I don't want to be a damn, I don't want to make a fool out of myself trying and let other people see me make a fool of myself too. 0:21:08.1</p>

<p>And that short changes me a little bit and I'm not quite as bad as all that. But that's one way of saying what it's about. I just know, I just can't conceive of any other way to cope.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I want to give you some feedback in terms of the way I see you from the times that I've seen you. And I'm prejudiced against the Esquire, Playboy type to start out with but I really believe that you are potentially a very real cut above that kind of man. And it sounds like you won't accept that kind of superficiality, or don't want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't want to. 0:22:02.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want some more authenticity or genuineness in human relationships but are afraid to come out and say that that's what you want or just be that. And are ending up putting up a front that's a lot less than you are if you just be you. And I just have, how does that hit you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That hits me as marvelous. I'd like that to be the case, that that process to be the case.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, well it is the case for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I wonder, you know I wonder if it is. I also have a feeling that's really adolescent that I would like to you know, master that whole style of discourse and then throw it out. I don't want to..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so not do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Someone said one time that no one who is in society, it was back in 1890's, said no one is in society, no one doing 400 notches. Well ideally what would happen would be that one would get invited to Mrs. (inaudible at 0:23:03.0) ball and then not go, you know. Rather than end running it by not being invited and say well, I didn't want that anyway. Because that style of life has a pull on my probably immature emotional. 0:23:20.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, so there's part of you that would rather seek, it sounds like there's part of you that would rather seek what you don't want than go about seeking what you do want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just to overcome it. Just to feel that it's not an obstacle to me. And I know that that's very foolish. But just in order to feel, well, I've played their game and I don't dig it and blow it off. Becoming a new man. These people are no longer, I'm going to grow beyond them. But I've grown through them and just passed them. I can see that that's really a, if I stand back I'm going to see that that's really unrealistic number one. That anyone can do that without being utterly caught up in themself because those people aren't that unresourceful that they can't figure out ways to hold you there. And number two, it's probably really just kind of an adolescent fantasy thing. 0:24:23.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So where does that leave you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that leaves me at the point where I don't know what to, I don't know how to handle the situation obviously. I don't have any idea what to, how to do it. What I could do is I could take very concrete steps. I could for example decide that I was going to not go to McCay's or a Playboy Club or something like that. Although that isn't really a part of it. But forego a certain particular kinds of parties. But that's such a major reformation, forming all kinds of new, new friendships really. 0:25:05.5</p>

<p>Because these people don't, these people traffic in style of language and different lifestyle. And, you know that's such a long way from where I am now that it's very difficult. 0:25:24.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's very difficult to see the major reform being the next step of your life. When it's that big it's really hard to make a break. Well are there little things that you can do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I supposed one of the things you could do would be to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not what I could do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I could do. Would be forming a more or less tentative little friendships with the find of people you think you like. 0:26:05.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I think I like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I think I like. Why do I keep doing that? (chuckles) I'm trying to disassociate myself as much as possible is what it seems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's so that (inaudible at 0:26:20.0) to me like I really..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:26:22.7) what it means?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like this is an abstract thing that someone somewhere could do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that helps you, keeps you from (inaudible at 0:26:34.5) energy in the interest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it certainly doesn't make it (inaudible at 0:26:38.3) for me to do it, it's just a working hypothesis that somehow (inaudible at 0:26:42.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what does that do to your work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it leaves me right where I am. I just don't want to, you know that's, you've been brought up to deal with...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I haven't been brought up.0:27:03.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been brought up in certain ways of thinking and dealing with things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what certain ways?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In dealing with things on this level. And talking a certain way, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And talking in a certain removed way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't sound very removed right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. In a way it's like changing schools, you know. I mean it's like a high school problem child changing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you hear what I said about you didn't sound very removed right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I, no I guess I didn't hear what you said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you check out what you felt like then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't feel very alone. You're right. And I'm saying that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why didn't you acknowledge that in any way? 0:28:03.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I was just, I was still kind of thinking about what I was thinking about. But..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which was a way of being less immediate, right here and now, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, I suppose so. But you've got to keep moving on too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think that's one way that you cut down on your, offense has set in. You're enjoyment of life is rushing on looking for the attachment. And that's why I'm bothering to point it out to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well you know I started to talk about that kind of thing and a situation such as this. But when you do open yourself up even more...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When I do more. 0:29:00.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) You're like a drill sergeant at school. When I open myself up even more, then isn't it probably that if someone does slam the door on my tender shoots of my soul that it's going to be even more painful and possibly a death dealing blow in some way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very possibly, certainly, certainly. You know what's funny though? I think that I'm not as guilty of all of this as other people have been. Because I once had...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Guilty of what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Guilty of shutting other people off when they're giving a fairly open emotional response. Because, and I don't want to, I think that you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I believe you. For instance that scene with your sister.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That scene with my sister is one, yes. Another scene is a girl that I took out for a long time. I didn't really like her. She was just around. And I didn't like her for the shallowest and most superficial reasons to a considerable extent. I really took her out because she would go out with me and I knew she was there. And she was a very conventional girl. But she was, I think a lot more open than I was. I was really just taking advantage of her. You know, just because she was there. And she became a little bit more committed to things than I did. 0:30:29.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To the relationship?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. She thought it was for real. And it certainly wasn't for real. Like I said, she was handy to have around, squire around. And I think of what happened to, what might have happened to her, you know. I don't know what finally did. She told some people that, you know that she really loved me and all that stuff. And I found that to be very discomforting and embarrassing. And that was after I stopped going out with her once. I took her out again a few months later. But anyway, the point is that I've done that to other people. And I really did do it because she didn't measure up to what my expectation of what my, the woman that I was going to walk through the world of Esquire magazine and all of that. Which may be, she wasn't attractive enough. She wasn't spiffy enough. Just, I thought I could do better. Well, I couldn't. But that's really why. There were other things too. 0:31:34.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're getting a better look at how she, what you did to her or what she might have felt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I don't like her especially, you know. But I think I see how much more she had going than I did, you know. And that kind of thing. I'm not saying that just from because she liked me better than I liked her, something like that. I'm just saying that she was much more ready to commit something than I would ever dream of being. I was just trying to fool around and she was mad. And so I'm saying that it's fine to say that you should be more open and all of that with people, which I...0:32:18.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just told me that you're scared of getting your fingers shut in the door.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A lot of people get their fingers. Probably every person on earth has gotten their fingers shut in the door.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but I don't want to. No, I understand. That was frivolous. I shouldn't say anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe it's frivolous but it's very real to you. And we all feel like that at some, I've felt like that at various times. That you don't want to take a chance for fear that you're going to get your head chopped off. But I would believe that you would be capable if you knew ahead of time that such a remark is possible at various points along the way. Not everybody is going to like you. That's part of the game. And it just seems like once you accept that then you don't have to get your fingers so hurt because somebody rejected you. Because somebody is always rejected. 0:33:21.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I find it's always safer to come across for example if I'm going to make an approach to a girl to come across on a party type level, you know. It's much easier, much more graceful. Of course that can be done at a bar after the first, that would be done in any event at the first meeting. And of course my response is to try and keep it as much like that as possible so that she and I would shirk through the updated flapper type world that I live in. 0:34:03.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that sounds so finally incongruent with the relationship that you say that you want with a girl.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it is. I don't know which one I really want more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not meeting there. I mean things are clashing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know which I want more. Some advertising poster type chick on my arm or to show off or someone who really means something to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Think about it. Think about it right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I tell you the easy answer for me and the thing that I really would like is being with someone who is just a picture poster type, you know. Because it doesn't require any response on my part. I wouldn't have to exercise my emotional (inaudible at 0:35:03.6).I could go to nice little parties by my side, do all the things that you're supposed to do including hopefully going to bed with her just as a matter of routine you know. And I have done that on a limited basis. In fact that sounds very appealing to me right now. 0:35:27.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Certainly a lot easier. The problem of course is that I've been trying to do that for some time but it doesn't work because of these other things that I have got in my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because of what? Can you say what those other things are specifically right now? Just look out there. It looks like a very mean night.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it's going to be like Sunday night. Yea going home. Do you walk over here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I drive. But I didn't bring an umbrella or a coat or anything. 0:36:17.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it should be (inaudible at 0:36:22.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it will (inaudible at 0:36:25.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just looks a million times worse. You did hear a weather report.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it said it was just going to be like occasional thundershowers.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh ok. In other words not tornados.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not that I heard. But you know we'll see if it changed. Well anyway I don't really know. I think the answer, the other thing that I was referring to was the fact that I'm not, I'm really incompetent in that style of life. I prefer to do it that way. But I'm really incompetent, I'm obviously not very good at do that in my own mind. But that would be tied up with just the feeling of having the - down boy, down - that would be tied up again in this fantasy level kind of relationship where you're not really dealing with an idea and you're just looking at yourself lightly though a series of gilded rooms, you know, and watching yourself flow with the plaster. And that's part of my, I know that's a fantasy of what I want to be. Or my life, my fantasy life stopped at that point somewhere around age 12. And so. 0:37:57.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have another project for you. Which is to carry that fantasy life on a bit further and formulate something of what else you might want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're both going to get killed here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That lightening was about six feet away from the window. It doesn't (inaudible at 0:38:20.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're going to get very, very wet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So are you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have an umbrella.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you getting home? The (inaudible at 0:38:42.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:38:47.5) What's this other project that you mentioned? 0:38:54.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well just sitting down and just thinking out what's an alternative to that gilded room.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See the trouble with me is that I'm very moralistic. When I was younger I had considerations of being a, I can think of something that a pleasant alternative would be. But I had visions of working in VISTA and nothing under you know, but this is kind of the stuff that was going on. But it wouldn't be very difficult you know. Really latent new (inaudible at 0:39:32.1) or something you know. So that's really not difficult for me. The difficulty is to try and integrate all those things and make something that will work out of it. And the way I work with people now, the method by which I work with them really is utterly self defeating. But I can't say that I want to beat it. The mechanical relationships that I have with many of my men friends is one of that is really self defeating on my part because it works around things that are negative. Like for example my relationship my friend Corin. We obvious, we drink too much you know. And then we laugh a lot later. And we're laughing because in that encounter is such fine fellows as we should be you know, and also there's a certain irresponsible joy of it all. So these things are, so the relationships that I have with these people start out working right the way of normal positive growth pattern happens. So, that's that. 0:40:40.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So the storm's got, you look like you want to flee this place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Frankly, if I had the courage to go out (inaudible at 0:40:57.1) If you had the courage to go out, you'd go home. But you don't have the courage to go out so you're..0:41:01.1</p>

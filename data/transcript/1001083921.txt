<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So now we’ll start. How are you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, [NAME OTHER] is leaving tonight because I bought a cat. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, no. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He picked me up and threw me down and sprained both my ankles and my hip and the cops came. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, no. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> A couple days ago. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> A couple days ago. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because of the cat or?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] the styrofoam from his train and I thought it was no big deal and he is storing his train in the basement without the styrofoam for the last two days. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And she’s been spending money.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Again?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Oh, yeah. Let’s see she overdrawn the account in [DEIDENTIFIED], so they had to transfer, well she transferred, she took $1800 out of my business account, put $1000 into the other account or no $1800 into the [DEIDENTIFIED] account, so there was a balance of like $1008 in there and then a day later [NAME OTHER] gets a phone call she over ran the balance in the [DEIDENTIFIED] or in the [DEIDENTIFIED] checking account-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I ran the [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Shut up, I’m talking. She over ran the account in that one, not once, but twice and this just all happened since Saturday. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I over ran the account in [DEIDENTIFIED] twice because I had to buy all the kids’ medication out of it. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And now she’s going and buying a cat that costs $100 and [DEIDENTIFIED] is the place that she bought it from, called when she was still gone and said that she forgot the medication. I had no idea about this cat and we just talked about this stuff last night about spending money on animals and what does she do? Go out and buy another animal, so I’m done, I’m going to just leave her permanently I have a feeling. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Huh. What are your thoughts?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think it’s a good idea. I told him it was a few days ago, it really hurt me. And he’s not taking the kids and he’s going to call and tell me when he gets there. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Take her and [NAME OTHER] up somewhere else. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, this is based on things being out of control again though. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I had to buy the kids’ medications. It cost me $100 just for that. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but what about communication, in terms of spending money?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I told him I had to buy the kids’ medication and he wouldn’t give me the money. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> What about the trees, what about the stupid picture frame that cost you $34?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I bought some trees, that cost me $15. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah. A piece. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I got them about a month ago. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Supposedly. No, you just got them about a week or two ago. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, what about the cat then? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I wanted to get a female cat and [NAME OTHER] wouldn’t let me. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> And what does she do? Tell him. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I went to go get one today. It’s already been neutered and spayed and shots. I could have got one in [DEIDENTIFIED] for 12 dollars, So, I told him I would take the cat back. And then he’s going to sell this horse because I told him to sell his horse a long time ago, and get rid of the snake. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but I mean things are out of control and when things are out of control to make a long term life decision is not the best time to do it. You know, I think, you know since you’ve come back from the hospital you’ve been struggling. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I have been taking the medication and it’s been doing fine. My blood sugar is 170 and is probably going down right now because I haven’t been able to eat my dinner yet. And my fingers are numb and my tongue and toes are numb. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did you go back on the Geodon or you didn’t?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you’re taking Zyprexa and the Geodon?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. [INAUDIBLE] and Geodon at night. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How do you sleep?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m sleeping fine. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is she sleeping?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I have noticed the last couple days she is sleeping. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So the thing that’s most upsetting to you is the spending? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> We talk about stuff and then she does the direct opposite of what we talk about and this has been going on for quite some time and now I’m just fed up with it. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So where would you go? Your sister’s house?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Probably. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You would just stay all alone with the animals?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I don’t know if that’s the greatest idea. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Why I think [INAUDIBLE] </p>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, what if -</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well, can’t go to [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] because [NAME OTHER]’s pissed off at her right now, too. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why is he angry?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> He hasn’t talked to her since Saturday when they came over. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] told me that I wasn’t to tell [NAME OTHER] about the overdrawn accounts [INAUDIBLE] and they told me this two days ago. I would have told [NAME OTHER] about them, but they told me not to. So, they told him, why they told him, I don’t know, because they told me not to tell him. They said don’t tell [NAME OTHER] right now. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why couldn’t you stay with them?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because they won’t let me stay with them right now, according to [NAME OTHER]. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> They won’t. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What about [NAME OTHER]?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> They won’t let her either. Matter of fact we’re, [NAME OTHER] just bought tickets to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] because her relatives live in [DEIDENTIFIED] well, after [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] come over, I think it was Saturday, Friday or Saturday, I forget what day. It was Friday night, um, [NAME OTHER] said that we’re not going to [DEIDENTIFIED] now. And if we were going to [DEIDENTIFIED], [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] were going to not go to [DEIDENTIFIED] and transfer their tickets to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] instead. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because he said, my dad said that my boy can’t talk and he needed to go to speech therapy and I said bullshit, he can talk and I’ll take him to speech therapy myself. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That has nothing to do with why [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] were going to transfer their tickets. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know why [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] want to transfer their tickets, but that’s why my dad wants to transfer the tickets. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> So now we’re not going to [DEIDENTIFIED] with them because I told [NAME OTHER], I go if everyone doesn’t want to go then we just aren’t going. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What if, we could look into some kind of supportive living arrangement for you, on a temporary basis, until we can really stabilize things for you? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What kind of supportive place?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’m wondering if we can find some kind of group home setting. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I want to keep the car and I’ll get a job. I can get a job anywhere [PHYSICIAN NAME] I’m [INAUDIBLE] certified I can get a job at [DEIDENTIFIED] nursing home. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What about Social Security? You haven’t heard anything? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No, we haven’t heard anything. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, what if we do that? I mean instead of you moving to your sister’s and just leaving her all by herself in the house, maybe you know, I mean, you didn’t pick up the cat? Or do you have the cat? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well the cat is in the barn [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I will bring the cat back tomorrow. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Will they take it back?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I called and told her she’s bringing it back. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And they were okay with it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. They told me - I told them I might have to bring it back. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s what I’m thinking. Well, why don’t, I mean, you do seem a little calmer to me than last week, maybe it’s the higher Zyprexa and Geodon combination, but I’m thinking it might be better for [NAME OTHER] to stay in the house and we can find maybe a supportive setting. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe my brother.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Your brother lives with your sister. That’s not going to happen. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I haven’t talked to my brother, yet. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I’ll tell you right now, it’s not going to happen. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He lives in the basement doesn’t he?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> He lives upstairs, but there’s still access to get into [NAME OTHER]’s half of the house so that’s why it’s not going to happen. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I haven’t talk to any of my family members yet and they told me the direct opposite. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Okay, I guarantee, from when I talked to your dad, and [NAME OTHER] and your sister on Saturday and you’re not going-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s not what my mother told me when I talked to her this morning. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What did she say?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She said, I told her [INAUDIBLE], I did not tell her about the cat, she said don’t tell [NAME OTHER] right now because he’s too mad, so I just left, but I haven’t called her since. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know what, another possibility might be looking into one of these, you know, like three-week types of therapy settings, you know, they don’t have them here, but they have them on the West Coast, I know one in [DEIDENTIFIED]. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That would be fine. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, why don’t we look into something like that for her. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Will the insurance pay for it?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Probably not.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that would be a problem, cost-wise too for you, unless your mom would help out with something like that. Because I’m thinking, she does seem a little calmer, she’s sleeping a little better, you know, if we can stabilize things and stop the spending sprees, because all of this is related to the bipolar condition, you know that. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I would hate for the whole family to fall apart now because you’re just so frustrated with this behavior because part of her really can’t control all of this behavior, you know, like the spending is part of the disorder, you know, she gets out of control, she spends, but I’m thinking if we are going in the right direction with the medicine, she is beginning to stabilize and if we can get her in an environment that would make her feel more supported and more contained. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s why I am not [INAUDIBLE] leaving. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But you’d rather something like that than [NAME OTHER] move out, wouldn’t you? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m just to the point where I can’t handle it anymore myself. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME] </p>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I have got to do something. I’m going to kill myself, it is more [INAUDIBLE] then it was the last time. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been thinking about that? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Could you promise me you would call me and that’s not an option?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, yeah, why don’t we do something like this, you know, let me, the program I’m thinking is a [DEIDENTIFIED] program in [DEIDENTIFIED], there’s also one in [DEIDENTIFIED]. They are pretty costly though. The one is [DEIDENTIFIED] is a little less expensive, but it might be a good environment for her. It’s like a very- </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well right now I [INAUDIBLE] back.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I know. I know it’s got to, you look like you’ve been through the ringer. So this whole week was really tough, the whole week, huh? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Uh-huh. Last week things actually went rather well. She cleaned the house, and she cleaned it really nice. Everything but the bedroom, which is fine. Everything else, she went through the kids’ rooms and went through everything else. I was down the basement running electric and hanging drywall and stuff down there for the kids’ playroom and after her mom and dad’s visit the house is a mess again, she’s got, she had plant dirt all over the house. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I picked it up. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Kind of picked it up, but it’s a mess again, just cluttered with stuff. It probably wouldn’t take very long to clean it up again. But she like, when she puts dishes in the sink, there’s like pieces of pizza in the sink with the dishes. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He can put his own dishes in the dishwasher and do the dishes by himself if he wanted to.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> The thing is though, dear, is you don’t put dishes in a sink with food still in it piled up. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So do you, you do the same damn thing. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I do not put dishes with food in there. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> All your dishes are in the sink just as well as mine. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I mean, the tension level is just too great right now and I think we need to diffuse this and maybe one of the best ways to diffuse it is to find a good setting for you. I don’t know the hospital didn’t seem to do that much for you when you where there. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But maybe we can find a different type of environment for you. I like these therapeutic communities, they seem more supportive. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> How do we set something like that up, [PHYSICIAN NAME]?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, first of all, we have to find the right place for you and we got to make sure it’s financially doable. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What do we do for tonight?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Could you stay there tonight, and maybe you know, if she takes the cat back and just try - are you working tomorrow or?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well, I was planning on working in the basement and finishing, well, put another coat of mud on. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What if, could you do that? I mean, could you stay and just, you know like I say, we could give her a little Zyprexa tonight and hopefully she’ll sleep. You know, she’s not going to spending money tonight anyway, right? You’re not going to be going anywhere. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I can take the keys away from her again. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> For the car. Well, could you not drive?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That way she won’t spend money. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Could you not drive for a while?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have the internet at home? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Does [NAME OTHER]?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Could you call [NAME OTHER] tonight and say we want to look into these communities? I can give you the phone number for the [DEIDENTIFIED]. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> I don’t think [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] can afford that either, [PHYSICIAN NAME]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Really? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No, I don’t think you know what kind of shape their in right now. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> A little bit. Do you know they had to re-mortgage their house?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Because [NAME OTHER]’s father, they’re paying for- </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I know they’re paying for the house. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah, plus their house, so - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But I didn’t know - </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> They’re house payment is like $3000 a month right now because they’re paying for his father’s house, plus their house. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, I didn’t know that. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> So, I don’t think they have the money to send her anywhere. But I don’t know. We can talk to [NAME OTHER] about it, but- </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We have $40,000 in the account right now and it’s got to go towards taxes.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> No, we don’t. We don’t have $40,000 in there hun. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, 35, 25, whatever, but it all goes towards our taxes right now. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> We don’t have money for it either, so - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Unless we can talk about even a shorter program, maybe like a couple weeks or something to that effect. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Well, a couple weeks in the hospital didn’t help her out. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, it didn’t. You didn’t feel anything? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> It helped her out a little bit, but -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, she was so drugged when she came out of the hospital. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re not as drugged as you were, you know. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What about the racing thoughts? Do you feel your thoughts are still racing? They’re slowed down?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Uh-huh. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She seems better today, she just seems more with it than she did the last time. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> She certainly wasn’t on the way here. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She wasn’t that way? Do you see a difference now with her being?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I took my Zyprexa at five. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well, I’m okay with increasing the Zyprexa as long as you know, watch the sugar level pretty closely, maybe we can give you the 5 mg three times a day for a period of time and see if the medicine on it’s own stabilizes, but in terms of these programs, there’s no way I’m going to find a program that would be beneficial that’s going to be very inexpensive. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> They cost at least a $1000 a month, right?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, I was thinking those programs were between $7000-14000 just for the three weeks. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Holy shit!</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s what I’m thinking. The one in [DEIDENTIFIED] is about $40000 a month. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Oh, my God!</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, they’re really expensive. That’s what we need, but. Why don’t we, let me-</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Who could afford them?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it’s expensive. Unless we can find some kind of supportive home setting locally, you know, where you could stay with someone just temporarily. That’s a possibility. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I just want to stay at home [PHYSICIAN NAME] I don’t want to be with my parents right now. </p>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I know, you’re more secure at home than anywhere else. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Could we try it at home? I’ll increase the Zyprexa. You know, would you promise you call me before you spend anything? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Promise.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean we can do that too. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You can take the car keys away. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That’s what I want to do, take the car keys away because then she can’t go anywhere and if she can’t go anywhere she can’t spend money. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Alright, how about if we do that? If we take the car keys away. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t want to drive right now anyway. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, and we’ll see if the higher Zyprexa dose is going to help stabilize her a little more. We could try that and then if things get out of control, don’t wait the whole week, call me in between and we’ll try to do - I didn’t know things were so bad last week. All right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then, in terms of the animal situation - </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He can take the cat back tomorrow. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re okay with that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. I’m fine with that. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And how would you spend your time, if he stays at home and is working downstairs?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I spend it with the animals and watching him and cleaning the upstairs. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> That’s what she did all last week. Every single day she cleaned the upstairs. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you could work with the horses, too, right?</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> It’s too cold to be working with the horses </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s supposed to be cold the end of the week. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Could you watch movies or read? Or you can’t concentrate. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I can’t read, but I can watch movies. We do bible study together sometimes. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Study with who?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The Bible together sometimes. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The two of you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Could you do that with her? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I need more Zyprexa.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, all right I think I’m just going to focus on with Zyprexa increase and we’ll see what that does for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> She’s weaned off of the other thing,</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Lithium</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> The Lithium. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. I’ll put you on 5 mg of Zyprexa three times a day. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. What about my blood sugar?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that’s a problem, I mean we got to watch that, it’s a risk. You know, since you say it was 170. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It was 165 when I came here. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And how long did you eat before you took it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I haven’t been able to eat yet. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re not eating anything?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Did you have any sugar during the day while you were driving?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> What kind of stuff did you eat during the day today?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I had coffee and a spoonful of sugar and water and I came. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Any candy bars or anything?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, just Reese’s pieces. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The caffeine doesn’t upset you? </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> The Reese’s pieces could raise it up quite a bit. We checked around with her a little bit, before she ate, after she ate and all that and made sure she didn’t have stuff with sugar and it was like maybe 100-110 and that’s with no sugar or anything, except for whatever food she eats that turns into sugar. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I had a -</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Then she eats a Reese’s peanut butter cup or drinks - </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I had a Reese’s peanut butter cup yesterday at like ten when I dropped the kids off today. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, cut back on the sugar. I mean, if you have to have something sweet could you have some fruit or something? And then it wouldn’t affect it as much. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yesterday I went to the store and brought fruit and just cereal and water. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So stay away from the processed sugar and the candy, like the Reese’s peanut butter.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. I can do that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right and we’ll try just with the higher Zyprexa dose to control it. If it controls it, great, if it doesn’t then we’ll talk to [NAME OTHER] about what we might be able to do in terms of finances for her to be in a setting, other than a hospital setting that could nurture and support.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Uh-huh. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, that sounds like a good idea, ready to get going now. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How’s your weight? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s fine, about 130. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you’re stabilized, you’re not gaining any weight?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. I’m [INAUDIBLE] weight. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you’re okay with this too, staying with her? Temporarily? So before you move out or before you spend anything, you’ll call me and we’ll try to intercede and then if if we can do a week, we’ll do a week, with just 5 three times a day. I also will keep you on the Geodon at night. I’ll give you them because that will help you sleep too.</P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Is there anyway you can give her enough of Zyprexa for a week?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Probably. I guess she needs what, 3 times 7, 21. </P>
<P><B>CG:</B> Because this medicine is getting really expensive, too. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, let me see. Well, I have 10s, but let me see if I have enough 5s. Do you have any left?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I have about four. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Four of the 5 mg? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, [INAUDIBLE] up one tonight so that makes eight.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, eight, so you’ll need another, eight twelve, about thirteen or so, you know. Right? What are you going to do now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m going to go home and I’m going to probably watch television.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And eat my dinner. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good. And watch your sugar level.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. I’m going to give you the samples and we’ll meet again next week. Thank you for participating in this. </P>

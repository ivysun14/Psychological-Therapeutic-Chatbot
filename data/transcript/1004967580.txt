<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Say that again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [...] (inaudible at 00:00:04) Fred left me $40 but leave the [...] with it. [...] I'm not going to argue with you. Just for marijuana, I'm going to write what's missing. I had a big yellow candle next to the computer - that's gone. [...] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What use do you have for a candle?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To get rid of the smoke from the marijuana.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? Because it blocks the smell?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if you get the flavored, smelly candles that smell pretty, like apple cinnamon and stuff like that. She said, "Dolores (sp?) doesn't like candles." I said, "Oh, good," like I'm going to go up by Dolores's house and check. [00:01:03] So it was the candle and then it was the $10. The other day I brought a joint for Mark - what was it? Monday. He and I smoked some of it and then later on he came back and he had the rest of it with him, so he smoked some, Deborah smoked some, and then Dolores came in and she said, "Do I smell marijuana in here?" so she had a puff; but yet there was still about this much left on the roach. I put it in a pill container, put it up on a shelf. I went to get it and it was gone. "Deborah, what did you do with the rest of Mark's roach?" "Oh, did he want that?" I said, "Now, Deborah, why did you think I put it in the pill container?" "Oh, well, I smoked it." I said, "Okay. You now owe Mark a half a joint." Bad. [00:02:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Just to tell you, this would all go under - stealing, getting involved in a drug deal -</p>

<p>this would all go under the category of elder abuse. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. She threatened to beat the shit out of me yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, in front of the neighbors.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What provoked her? What evoked that to happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what brought it on. We were fighting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she just lost it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she just said - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did she say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I really love my mother. I'd really like to fucking kill her." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She said that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How often does she say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Lately, quite a bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, Friday I wound up going out to the clinic, to the eye doctor, because I have an infection in my eye. It was swollen shut. I had a black and blue eye. Saturday I sent her out. She and Dolores were going out at 9:00 in the morning. I gave them my prescription to take to the drug store, which is right up the street from my house. At 5:00 she comes running in the door to go take a pee and I said, "Do you have my medicine for me? It's only been eight hours, Deborah." "Oh, it wasn't ready." So the moment she went out the door, I called up Rite-Aid and I talked to the pharmacist that I know. I said, "Rick, did my daughter ever drop off a prescription for the antibiotic?" [00:04:08] "Yeah, she just dropped it off. I told her it would be ready in 15 minutes." So she didn't drop it off in the morning. She just dropped it off at 5:00, so she lied and then she denied it. I said, "Deborah. I called up the drug store. Greg said you just dropped it off." She said, "No, I dropped it off in the morning." I said, "Oh, okay. I believe Greg more than I believe you." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me ask you something - are you feeling safe with her? [00:04:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, more or less. I don't know. I'm not too sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. It's not a definitive yes, in other words. You're maybe leaning more that way but you're not sure at all? Okay. Has she struck you lately?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. She hasn't hit me at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about the threats? How often are the threats happening?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Lately they've been coming quite a bit. I mean, if she can remember, she will take her Abilify and then she takes the clonodine and then she takes the Zoloft, but then she goes out there and she smokes pot all day. She does Suboxone (sp?) another time, so I just don't know what else she might be on. I mean, she comes into my apartment and she's so... her eyes are so dilated and everything. [00:06:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she's been using other things? Could that account in some way for her behavior?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm thinking so. I mean I don't know what effect the Suboxone has on you, but I know it's one of my cousin, Mary's, favorite drugs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When is she more likely to be aggressive? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Lately it's all the time. I can't say anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. She doesn't necessarily need to be sober or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don't drink milk, but she does. There's no milk in the house. There's no cream in the house. There's no bread in the house. Oh, yeah, there are three loaves, but they're all moldy. There's just not a fucking thing in the house to have. You can't make toast. I can't even make a peanut butter toast. What's in the freezer is frozen. And she said to me, "Do you need anything at the store?" I said, "Deborah, you fucking live here. Don't you realize there's no milk in the refrigerator? Don't you realize there's no cream in the refrigerator or there's no bread, Deborah?" "Oh," then she goes out and doesn't come back with a fucking thing. I don't know if she - she lost her food stamps. She lost the card. She says, "Oh, okay." [00:07:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She could have sold it for some money.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She sold her nicotine patches, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think her medication itself would have much value, but who knows?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, of course, Mabel (sp?) upstairs, Dolores, they were both shopping and Dolores says, "Oh, yeah. Deborah made me buy her some roast beef for a sandwich and ham and cheese. I don't know what else I bought for her. Oh, I think I bought her turkey and then we got some fresh strawberries. And then..." [00:08:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She wants you to pay the bill?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but, you know - Deborah is eating upstairs, so why should she get [...] (inaudible at 00:08:55) ? I don't have a loaf of bread in the house? She comes home with a three package of bagels and then forgets to get the cream cheese. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has she gotten in any fights lately?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I know of. I don't know. Between her and Dian, they're out to a bar. She goes to Newton. "I'm in Newton and then we're going to go to Quincy and then we have to swing by [...] (inaudible at 00:09:34])." I said, "Well, don't call me, Deborah, if you get shot. I don't want to know about it. But make sure you're not a vegetable because I'm not taking care of you. You can stay in whatever hospital they put you in.."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah she is going to get herself in trouble.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I think Dolores is on probation for stabbing a guy in the apartment house where we live eight years ago. She stabbed her boyfriend. Deborah has warrants out for her arrest for child... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: For not paying child...? [00:10:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Social support. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm a little worried about you and your safety. How long has it been since Deborah has ever made sort of a physical attack on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really, not since Darla was up and I was living in the other apartment. She had threatened to kill me in front of Darla. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how old was Darla?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think seven, maybe older – nine or ten.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was like five years ago? The last time she was here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When was the last time she actually struck you? [00:11:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She never has.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She never has? Okay. How about getting you in legal trouble? Are you worried about her...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Living in the apartment?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, or if she gets somehow involved in a drug deal and she stashes something at your place or God knows what else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She steals my medication from my place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sells it. But she's probably not using - she's probably selling it so she can buy stuff for herself or maybe using it for something else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. She takes it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She takes it? She does take it? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, Dolores has everything. She has Valium, which she has a prescription for. She has methadone, which she has a prescription for. She does Percocets, which she has a prescription for. She has prescriptions for Oxycontin. She has prescriptions for the Fentanyl (ph?) patches. You name it, she has a prescription for it. [00:12:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have her car and in the back thrown around there are dirty Kleenexes. I was like, "Oh, there's an empty Fentanyl patch back there." Deborah said, "Yeah, it's all right because she's got a script for it." I said, "It might be all right because she's got a script for it, but I'm driving the car."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "I'm the one that will get in trouble."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said to her, "Deborah, do you have to go?" "I'm 34 years old. I can fucking go where I fucking want to go. What do you want - me in at 10:00 at night? You're just jealous because you're not here anymore and you just want me to keep you company." I said, "That ain't it because, Deborah, do you and I ever have a conversation?" "No." [00:13:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're worried about her getting herself shot or hurt or arrested.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's that the only time you know when she's safe is when she's in your apartment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, everybody in the building knows that Dolores is a drug dealer. They all know about the stabbing. I mean, it's like, "Okay. That day is going to come, Deborah," you know? [00:14:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes, Linda, I don't know how she's avoided it. I have a feeling she's pretty smart, but not when she's using drugs. If she sticks with her and they're dealing drugs, she'll get caught. I just don't want you to go down with her. But as far as you know, she's not keeping anything in your place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I keep telling her, "Get the fuck out. You like it upstairs so much? Go up there and live." "No. You throwing me out again? I said, "Deborah, you're never fucking here, so just stay there, Deborah." I said, "You think it bothers me? Because it doesn't. I like being alone." The lady next door was old and when Deborah and I were arguing, she said, "Deborah, your mother's only looking out for you." "Oh, no she's not. She's just dit dit dit..." I said, "No, Deborah. Please go there." [00:15:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What tends to provoke her into threatening you? What tends to be the thing that sets her...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I tell her to get the fuck out and go upstairs. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, that does it. Yeah, that will do it. And she'll say what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: "No. I ain't fucking going up there. And stop fucking yelling at me. I'll fucking kill you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Jesus.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The lady next door said, "Are you sure you like being alone?" I said, "I love it." She said, "You don't find it lonely?" I said, "No. I like being alone." I got stuck with her and Bennett (sp?) I don't know how many fucking times. [...] (inaudible at 00:16:09) and they'll say to me, "Why do you do it?" I say, "For my granddaughter because I don't want my granddaughter to say to me, ‘My mother is living out on park benches because you threw her out.'" [00:16:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that would make you - what? Really insensitive or cold?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't want Darla to know her mother sleeps on park benches - you know. Is doing this and doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think it's going to be like when she knows that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think she's going be very upset over it and I think that she's not going to want to have a connection with Deborah.. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't think she would?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She'd be hurt all over again knowing her mother gave her up to begin with - to Bennett and drugs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes. Almost in a way you want to protect her from that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because now she's blowing her chances again. What do I say to Darla? "Your mother is finally here in prison. Here's her address. You can write to her there." Yeah, right. That kid is going to love that. I don't know. I can see Darla in class and her friends would say, "Where's your mommy?" "She didn't want me." How do you deal with that? Feel that? This poor child that she brought into this world. It's a wonder she's done as good as she has. [00:18:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will have to say, "Mitchell, you did a good job on her," and everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Obviously they did well enough. That's a lot of responsibility for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Mark will say, "But, Louise, she's family." I said, "I know, but what do you want me to do? What if she was stabbing people or something? You want me to hide her in my apartment because she's family?" "No." I said, "I can't do it, Mark." "Well, do you tell her?" I said, "101 times a day, Mark." [00:19:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You tell her. You tell her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was in there and she and I were arguing and then she leaves so then he and I were talking & I said, "I can't do it, Mark. She threatens to kill me." He said, "Do you think she'll really do it one time?" I said, "Oh, yeah."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do? You do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was a time I was afraid to close my eyes at nighttime.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been like this since she was in elementary school. She was threatening me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When is the last time Elder Services checked in on you guys? [00:20:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably about six years ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When all that stuff was going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what did they do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They asked me if I wanted to pink-slip her and I said no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's all they said?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did they say anything else about what they offered or what they did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. All I can do is pink-slip her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the only offer? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know if I did that she'd be twice as pissed off as when she went in, you know? (pause) I've got neighbors on both sides of me that if they hear me screaming or yelling or whatever, they'd call the cops. (pause) I just don't know what to do anymore. I've already taken the keys away from her once, but then I gave them back to her. Do you know I took my Christmas tree down the day before Christmas? And the day before that I took every fucking Christmas decoration in back. [00:21:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She just pissed me off from being up there all the time. I had no way to go out and get groceries to cook Christmas dinner. She was going to go... [00:21:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? You were taking care of the...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had no vehicle. She and Dolores were going to do it Saturday. They never did it. Sunday... So I just said, "Hey, fuck it. I'm not having Christmas dinner. I'm not running out to the fucking store the day before Christmas." I just took every fucking thing down. Then she comes in the night before Christmas and she said, "What the fuck did you do? You took the fucking tree down?" I said, "Yeah." I said, "Every fucking gift that was underneath the Christmas tree, Deborah, you've already opened it and worn. So - hey - the bills ((ph?) are all over there. So what the hell do I need a Christmas tree for?" "You wonder why I'm on fucking meds," she's yelling. The door is open to the hallway. I said, "Yeah, and you wonder why I'm on fucking meds, too." She's on [...] (inaudible at 00:23:03) and I'm on [...]. I said, "Yeah but, Deborah, I've been on it a hell of a lot longer than you." [00:23:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's really got the behavior of a full-blown addict and they're not safe to be around. You don't know what they're going to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a good thing I don't leave money lying around because - you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess there are some questions about what else we can do. I do wonder how something like Elder Services could be any kind of use in this situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not at all. Not at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They won't help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not at all. It's like my word against her word. The other day she and Dolores were watching the football game in my parlor while I'm in the bedroom watching something else. I go to my room and Dolores has her head lying on Deborah's shoulder and Deborah is just rubbing her head like that. And, of course, Deborah has that damned do-rag on. I said to Mark, "I was afraid if I came out there that they might be kissing on the friggin' couch. I don't know what's going on." I can see this girl putting out all of this stuff for Deborah and not getting anything back, but Deborah denies it. But how does Deborah know what's going on if she's so god-damned drugged up and she passes out on the recliner or on the couch, you know? These drugs that they do - they don't know what's going on during the time they were passed out. Good luck to her. If that's what she wants, that's what she's got. [00:25:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the other thing, though, is that she can't be living with you and threatening you anymore. She just can't do that. If she's going to stay there, it's not fair for you, it's not safe for you, and you've got enough on your plate. You've got a number of medical things going on and all that stuff makes it worse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "Deborah, you know I'm having surgery on the 16th. Am I calling up to get an aide to come to the house and stay with me? Because I'll do it." "Oh, no. I'll take care of you." I can just hear her saying, "Yeah, I'm old enough to hire... Fine."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Duh. Yeah. You've got to get somebody that's taking care of you. When Elder Services came, they talked to Deborah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. [00:26:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They did not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And, of course, she disappeared, knowing they were coming. I don't want them going back to Housing saying that Deborah has been living there because then I lose my lease.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think they're allowed to. I think that's confidential. They're just trying to keep you safe. How would you feel if I called them to tell them what's going on, with the idea that they're out to keep you safe?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They'd want to come out to the house and I don't want to be bothered with them. I didn't want to be bothered with them before and I don't feel like going through that again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I'm hoping, though, is that they'd scare Deborah a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. They wouldn't scare her. [00:27:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because she needs to ratchet it back. I think the only thing that will do it is somebody from the outside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because she wouldn't be around, you know? Sometimes Dolores is doing something and Deborah can't go with her or something, so I say, "But, Deborah, you've got the keys to her apartment. Why don't you just sit up there and wait up there? Why do you have to come down here?" It's been good for me and Mark that she's up there. I don't know what to think with Mark but - oh, my God - he's so concerned. "Am I hurting you? Is everything all right? If I do, just tell me. You know I don't remember what I'm doing when I'm drunk, so just whack me around a couple of times. Smarten me up." I said, "Yeah, okay." He's been very attentive. I don't know what's going on in that head of his but... (chuckles) [00:29:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well. He's been sober?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He spends every night in. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you need that and I'm glad that he's been concerned about your well-being.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would really straightened Deborah out if [...] (inaudible at 00:29:52). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you've been telling him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Honestly, my thought is I'm almost worried enough to call the police and, if you want me to, I will.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because she wouldn't do anything - she threatens but I don't think she would do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you get worried you can call me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll call you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will come.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I have no problem calling them myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can tell her I did it. You can blame it on me. You can say I did it and you didn't have a say in it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know the Chief of Police and I have friends, so it wouldn't faze me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, one thing I'll say about these kinds of situations, is that it's best to have people knowing before anything happens than after; so it's actually not a bad time to alert people. I'm glad you're telling me. [00:31:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like the neighbor next door was there when Deborah threatened me and she said, "Deborah, don't even say things like that." Then she said to me, "If you need me just knock on the wall and I'll be here." Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Listen, I know you're trying to do a lot of things. You have a huge heart that makes you not just throw her out on the street and live on - because that's exactly where she'd go. At the same time, I think you're also very aware of the fact that, in a lot of ways, your life has been really, really compromised as a result. When it comes down to your safety, that's a point where you've got to keep yourself intact. [00:32:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. And I think the whole time she's been there with me it put a damper on things with me and Mark.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now, all of a sudden, it's great between us because she's not around. She's not around to instigate anything; because that's what she did was instigate and instigate and instigate. The only time she likes Mark is if Mark's got anything to smoke. Other than that, she still can't stand him. (pause) Did you keep this thing off today or have you got it going? [00:33:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? What are you thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wondered if you had it on because it looks... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's going. It just goes to black eventually. </p>

<p>CLIENT: When I talk with Mark today I'll let him know what else is going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About the threat? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Yeah, the more people that know, the better. To be honest with you, I think the better for Deborah, too; because if she's acting like that she's not in any kind of good shape. It must mean that she's in really bad shape. I mean, to bite the hand that feeds her or threaten the hand that feeds her is... [00:34:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But does she realize that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. If she's gone... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "Deborah, what do you contribute to this apartment?" "Nothing." I said, "You pay no rent. You pay no electric bill. You pay no cable bill, so what do you give? Not a fucking thing, Deborah. So don't think you're doing me any big favors by spending money with your food stamps that you just got recently because whatever you buy, you eat when you get the munchies." Like last night she slept at my place because she had to take care of the dog for her friend that she minds the dog for; and she was stoned, so she had nothing to munch on. Nothing. I said, "What's the matter, Deborah? Are you looking for something?" [...] (inaudible at 00:35:03) There's no this. "There ain't nothing, Deborah." What can I say? [00:35:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there anybody else that can help her kind of cool off?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Mary wants to try and get me into some group, but I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh - the [...] (inaudible at 00:35:51) ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tried that once before and I felt like an idiot. "Yeah, I'm afraid of my daughter. I'm afraid she's going to kill me. She threatens me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel like an idiot, huh? How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I threw my kid out and she was living on the street, you know. She was living on the streets. She looked like - I wouldn't recognize her. The hair would be out like here because it was so dirty and filthy; and she had on the same clothes for a week. Yeah, no. [00:36:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel a lot of shame about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just like I have one kid who doesn't talk to me at all, who's got money up the ass, and the other one who looks like the low-life of the earth - and I can't seem to get rid of them, you know? I must have been one hell of a rotten mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think that's what you end up feeling like. I think that's a way in which you've come to, at times, feel about the whole time. I realize it's not all the time. You can clearly see Deborah is using drugs and all of this stuff. I think there's a way you feel terrible guilt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I have the other one who, after the age of twelve, I know longer resisted. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, money wouldn't do that. I'd say, "Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what money would do." - money and then the lies from his grandfather. And, of course, that was another reason why I was depressed. My mother died the day after Christmas and so did [...] (inaudible at 00:38:00) first wife, Alice. [00:38:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, as if Christmas wouldn't bring up enough on its own. What was going on with your own daughter? She was upstairs getting high. It's a hard Christmas.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Wonderful Christmas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Terribly painful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Life goes on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. It does but... So Rebecca - what group did she recommend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some group with psychiatrist friends. It's women that have problems with their family members.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The lady was going to call me and then she called me and I think I threw out her number.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As you're saying, it wouldn't be easy for you to go to that group.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard for me to get a ride [...] (inaudible at 00:39:14) .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One thing that can really be a way to be good to yourself is to know that other people are out there going through the same thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if you ever watch Ellen Degeneres, but she has people on that are family members. Their kids will write into Ellen about "my mother lost her car," and she winds up giving them cash. I said, "Deborah, can you maybe write to Ellen Degeneres? Send in a letter maybe stating how your mother needs one because your mother has like 30 doctors' appointments in the course of a month?" I've got to depend on this and this and sometimes I'm lucky if they show up. They forget to pick me up and da da da da. "No. I'm not writing a letter to her." I said, "Okay. Let me see if my cousin, Susan will write me a letter." "Yeah, you write it out and I'll send it in." I said, "You want me to write a letter about myself and send it in?" I said, "I might as well just write it myself and send it in." [00:40:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Say it's from Deborah, yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have any friends or relatives that are really right out there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah - who've got your back, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. "Donald, write a letter into Ellen, will ya?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe I could. I think you'd win. I think you'd get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Let's talk about a plan here. I mean, first of all, if there comes a time that you really feel like something is going to happen, like can't... </p>

<p>CLIENT: You got an empty room? We could put a couch in here. I can rent it at nighttime. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it comes to that, yeah, we'll do that. We can also think of some other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't mind being - commit me, will you, please? Then we can all get some rest. I could fall for a nice vacation up to [The Plains] (ph?).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's a good idea to tell Mark and anybody else that you trust. I'm really glad you told me, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean everybody in the building is talking about how they sit in the TV room downstairs. They go in there and sit and they're licking each other's face.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I've had people come up and tell me that and tell me how rotten Dolores is. I say, "Well, don't tell me. I know."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Why don't we - if you manage to get a car for Monday. Otherwise, let's plan on talking over the phone on Monday. Are you going to be worried that you don't have any privacy? [00:43:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Is there any time that would be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because I don't know when she's going to be there and when she's not going to be there, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. What I'm going to do then, let's plan on it at 11:00 on Monday and, if you can't meet, if you don't have any privacy - when's the next time you can get the ride to take you? Is it the 18th? Not until the 18th, Friday? Or the 11th? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can get one for next Monday. I think I've got one for the following Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For the 14th? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me check.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll hold that one then. You've got that for 11:05 or here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Here, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, because then we're going to go back to 11:05.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. But that's going to be on a Friday, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we're going to have to meet in Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. I'll call when I get home and let you know what I can schedule because I didn't bring my book with me. And I'm so crazy. You know I don't remember. I just don't have the time to remember my name.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a hell of a lot going on. Okay. Give me a call when you get back and let me know what's going on. All right, Louise.</p>

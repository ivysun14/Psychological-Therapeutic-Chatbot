<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi!</p>

<p>CLIENT: What a nice lamp. Did you paint in here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just painted this wall?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it's weird. I guess I just never noticed that it was a different color than it was from the last time. So it's been like a month I guess? Like three weeks maybe since I've seen you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has it been that long?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think. Yeah. Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. We didn't meet last week because I needed to change the schedule. Were you away the week before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The week before? Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then the week before that we met?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did we meet the week before that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So yes, it's been a month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, (crosstalk and inaudible at 00:00:39)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So some stuff has happened. Like, so I applied for that job ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... in Houston and I was working on getting an interview.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a phone interview.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. You did know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I think I knew that. [00:00:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay. It went really well. I was waiting to hear back for a while. It sounded like she wanted to hear back. And then, I was like writing follow-up. I wrote a follow-up e-mail. Well, I wrote a thank you e-mail and then I wrote a follow-up e-mail a week and a half later. Then a week after that, I called and left a message. And then I got a call on Tuesday saying - like a voice mail saying blah, blah, blah, thank you so much, duh, duh, duh, we went with somebody else, etc., etc. So that was disappointing in it was disappointing in general, but I think also just, you know, I would've liked a second interview at least or - but I think it had to do with timing. It had to do with not being in Texas. It had to, you know, probably a number of things. So fine. It's fine, and I'm taking it as a positive experience anyway because it was - it was good it - it's always good to, you know, freshen up your interview skills, and now I have possible future contacts there. [00:01:46] But anyway, I think that like the prospect of maybe getting a new job elsewhere, like a bigger job in like a new city and the whole thing would kind of crowd my feelings of like kind of being stagnant in my current position and not really knowing where I'm gonna go next. And like okay, another semester of like the same events every single day, and so I was kind of able to not, you know, just concentrate on whatever I was doing. But then since now I'm definitely not getting a new job, you know, doing something else, it's like really brought back all of those feelings and like making me feel them even more. Okay, like we have the end of the year with our big event in May, and then it's gonna be this summer and it'll be slow. And then I have to start inviting people for a seminar to speak, and then I have to do open house, and then I have to do the same fucking events every day, and it's kind of like ... I like, you know, working for MIT. I like working for the center. I like doing events. But there's really nowhere else to go in my particular position or center. [00:02:56] Like there's nowhere to go ... in - in - like literally. And Franklin is making suggestions that I talk to - that my - my supervisor, to first of all tell her that I'm kind of feeling that. You know, kind of a little bit of stagnancy. And to see if she can help me, you know, if during the summer, there's more time for me to train on more development stuff and kind of just, you know, bold my scopes out a little bit more in that field. Which I really - which, like the goal was to get me to do that anyway. Like switching to like her management. Like under her management as opposed to the person who has educational services at our center. But I'm always busy doing so much shit for events that I - like when would ever be the time for me to do that? Never. And during the summer, it's going to be difficult as it is because we don't have events, but everybody travels, including Gemma (sp). She goes, you know, this place and that. I don't know how much she travels. Whatever. [00:03:49] And my assistant is already like, "Well, Trina, I don't know if I want to do events, you know, for like my career, and "Oh, I'm gonna take a journey class this summer," and "Yeah, I want to go to grad school," and "No, I think I want to be a professor," and, you know, "Nick already told me that nobody really stays in this position for more than a year, and it's like I can't be Trina's assistant forever." Like she said that to me like when she was talking to me. And like it's fine for her to like talk to me about that stuff, but to the same extent like, "Mindy, you just got out of college. Like slow your roll. Everybody has an entry level position for at least a year to - to two years." And it made me a little bit annoyed because it's like well, I can't be Trina forever. Like I can't be in this position forever. So what the fuck? Obviously, you're not gonna be my assistant forever. And I think I got a little annoyed at like her whole like "I'm taking a journey math class! Oh, like I'm 21 and going to grad school!" And I think I started to feel a little bit irritated at that. Like, just in general, and it's not fair because it's not her fault. [00:04:52] Like - and I, of course, wasn't like, "Oh, good for you," you know. Even though I had a (laughter) - I have a "Good for you! That's great!" Anyway, and then so Franklin (sp) was - I don't know, and so I'm just feeling like dissatisfied with my job. And like - and I think even like the prospect - and like okay, if I'm gonna look for jobs in the city that I think realistically, and - it would be best to look for jobs at MIT because it's just an easier transition and I think it would be good, but I think - then even thinking about that makes me think like do I even want to be looking for a new job in The city? And so that's - it's giving me a lot of frustration today. And it didn't - it didn't help that yesterday, I was feeling shitty because - well, I think just a little disappointed about the position and not getting it and whatever. And then this morning, Franklin has been at his new job, and it's been good so far or whatever. It's helped us, so it's frustrating in what it is, but it's a better job, better place, better people, fine. It's at Central Place, which is one stop away from the stop that I usually walk to, so - like to go to work. So he's been driving because there's a parking there, and he's been dropping me at Central Place where he parks. Like where his job is. [00:06:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This morning, like we were kind of in a rush. I guess he pulled up to this light that basically is this one-way street that goes from one lane into two lanes, and you can turn left from either lane or turn right. And I guess cars weren't moving. It was green. He was like, "What the hell is ...?" I'm always telling him to calm the fuck down when he's driving and stop being so fucking aggressive, but like we made a pact not to tell each other how to drive, so like I was trying not to say anything, but he's like, "What the fuck is this? Why the fuck aren't the cars fucking moving? What the fuck? It's green! What the fuck? People are fucking retarded!" And I was like, "Well, just calm down." So he decides that he's gonna try to squeeze in, and I was like, "Well, Franklin, you should wait because like then the cars will start moving, and like who cares why they're not fucking moving? It's traffic." So he attempts to squeeze in full force, hits the parked car's mirror, not damaging theirs, but breaking ours. And I - I - I was like - and like I literally was like so irr - like I was so upset that I didn't even say anything. [00:07:07] And then this off-duty fucking police guy that saw it happen. We were like pulling up, and we didn't know. We were like should we leave our number, like there's no damage, whatever, pulls up, "You're leaving the scene of an accident. City Police," you know, flashing his fucking badge. "Pull over! Pull over! Leave your number!" Yelling at us, you know, stop whatever! And Franklin, of course, being Franklin starts to - "I am, but I - I just ..." and I was like, "Just shut up and pull the fuck over." Like okay, Officer, fine. Whatever. Like, yeah, he's being an asshole, but just fucking do it. You don't want him to be like, "Fine, I'll give you a fucking ticket then." 'Cause they can 'cause they're assholes. And so he's of course getting defensive about his driving, and I said, "Franklin," and he was like, "I'm really sorry." And I was like, "Whatever. It happens." But I just am going to say that sometimes when you get frustrated when you're driving, you have tunnel vision and just are trying to get to where you want to be. "I - I swear I had room." And I was like, "You didn't. So please be careful." And he's - he's defensive - like, you know, he's trying to make like it's not his fault. And then I was just sitting there like with my jaw set like so irr - irritated. And so he was like, "I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry," and he was like genuinely sorry, and I was like, "It's fine. It happens, but please be more careful." [00:08:11] And, of course, then it's "Well, I was being careful." "Okay. Fine. It doesn't matter. Just - I don't want that ever to happen again." And it's shitty because ... like he was able to clip it back on so that like the function of the button that moves it still works. Like the wires didn't break, which is fine. But it's cracked, so I'm gonna have to get a - fixed to pass inspection for around two to three hundred bucks. Like, you know, with my five hundred dollar deductible, it's not gonna matter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that really didn't like start the day off right. And he was like, "Well, please don't let this ruin your whole day," and I was like, "Well, I don't intend to, but like I'm irritated." And then, I'm irritated at work. Like I'm just irritated. I'm irritated at work, and I think that's the biggest thing. Like I'm just ... like I'm bored. Like I like doing events and it's not that these aren't interesting events. It's just like ... I'm sick of dealing with the same thing every single freaking day, every semester, every year. [00:09:07] Like I can't do this for another year. I'll go nuts. And so I don't really know like what to do about it. Like I guess - I don't really know what to do about it. Like I don't really have any advice for myself, and my father's fucking bullshit advice is to "Get in touch with Jewish Vocational Services. They have a mentoring program. You can talk to other people who are further along in that - the same kind of career that you are, and maybe that will help you." I'm like, "Well, that would be fair if I were confused about what my career path should be. Then, fine. But like I'm not." I know that I want to do events, and I do like working in higher ed., and I think I can continue doing that, at least for another, you know, few positions, wherever it may be. That's not the issue. And I - my dad in general right now, we had a difficult dinner the other night in which he basically was asking me to explain some of the reasons why I was upset. Like what bothered me about him and what kinds of things he was doing. [00:10:07] Like at a couple of dinners recently that we were all kind of like, "Dad, calm down. Why are you so up in arms?" He asks me to tell him all this, like pour my heart out and tell him all this stuff. And then he doesn't have anything to fucking say about it. He has no response, no, you know, self - no kind of introspective view on why maybe - oh, maybe I think this and maybe. He like - I like stop saying my little monologue and it's quiet for a second. I'm thinking he's thinking of a response, and he goes, "You see that restaurant there? I used to go there all the time." And I was like, "What? " And I called him out. "Like are you fucking serious, dad?" Like - and - and - and then, he says, "Well, I don't know. I was listening. I was listening." He still has no response. He calls me the next day, "Well, again, I'm sorry about last night, but again, it's just, uh, you know, things that we'll continue to work on." It's not things that we'll continue to work on. You're the one that has to work on stuff. I told him that I - I'm at the phase of my life where I'm like - trying to please him is over. Like done. [00:11:10] I'm trying to please myself now. Like I don't care. You know? And additionally, this was - this was sparked by the fact that he made it this huge deal. You know? And was quick - so quick to be judgmental about the whole Franklin being married thing and why this was such a mistake. Told his brother. And this is why mom had the right to tell me, and I need to know and - you know, so quick to be judgmental and tell me all the things that are wrong and what I need to do and all this stuff. Then when I mentioned during our conversation at dinner that they've gone through the divorce and I mean whatever. I didn't tell him they're still in the waiting period because it's not - it's irrelevant. They have their legal separation. They're just - it's the four-month waiting period. And they accept it and (inaudible at 00:11:47) again in the mail. And so I - I meant - I say that and he's - he doesn't say - have any commentary on it. And he moves on to the next subject. I interrupt him. I said, "Dad, I'm gonna point out that it's really interesting to me that you're really quick to judge and say whatever's on your mind about this situation in terms of this marriage. You know. Well, no, I said in terms of this situation that you, you know, want to tell me what I should do about in this case, Franklin being married, but when I tell you a resolution to that situation for which you were so judgmental, you have no response. You know, there's no, "Wow, that's great! Wow, what a relief! Oh, how fantastic! Oh, that's so - are you - how do you feel about," I mean nothing. And he had no response as to why he had no response. I mean like he's just impossible. And, you know, I talked to my mom about this, and she says, "I'm really sorry that that happened to you." But she didn't have anything to say. That's why she divorced the man because she couldn't deal with that shit anymore. You know? And ... anyway, so there was that. And - and then just my job and not really knowing like what to do. Like I don't want to do it for another year. [00:12:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's difficult because I also don't want to sound like I'm like not appreciative for having a good job that I have - am being paid pretty good money for and when a lot of people don't have jobs. But to the same extent, like I think I - I have a right to like feel like I've come to the end of what I can do in a particular job. Like there's no other title that they could give me. And Franklin was suggesting, "Well, maybe you can take on some other projects and Mindy could take more responsibility?" Well, first of all, she doesn't want more responsibility, and that's just maybe - if that's gonna be the case that may be a catalyst to make her leave. And we'd have to trade - train a new person. You know, I - she already - I know she's already going to be potential leave by the fall.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So adding more responsibility to a position that she's not even interested in training for doesn't help. And additionally, what else would I do? Like what would they give me? Like we already have other positions for other stuff filled right now. [00:13:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, there's no - there's nothing else that like they could be like, "Oh, let's do this," because I'd still be the events coordinator, and I'd still be handling the bulk of what's involved with that position. You know? So I - and - and, you know, he always feels like I'm like shooting down his - his suggestions. And I was like, "I'm not shooting them down like - your suggestion about talking to Gemma and - and, you know, see if I can get some more development training in the meantime," well, I (crosstalk) really think that is great. But you know in terms of more responsibility, there's just nothing. There's nothing. You know? So, like, I don't know if my like - and so then Franklin is like, "Well, why don't you look under IT?" And this was like before like I said well, if I'm looking in The city, then I should look at MIT. And they did have a position that was like manager of conferences and special events, which looked, you know, appealing, but I - I haven't looked at MIT to see what else they have in terms of events. [00:14:41] But I don't know, maybe I'm like scared to apply to another job ... in the city because ultimately, I do want to move, but like even though I know that now it's like not necessarily the right time. Unless something else comes up that's really good, (sigh) I don't know. I'm also like - maybe this is stupid or I should just let it go, but like I'm tired of worrying about - well, people at the center will think like, "Oh, my gosh, she's leaving already? Like she's only been here a few years." Like, you know, 'cause a lot of people have been there for like years. Like seven to ten years, like a bulk of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, and I kind of feel like some of them have that expectation in terms of what I want out of the position think - and think that I love like - yes, I love doing this stuff. But do I want to do the same thing all the time? Like no. And granted that might happen in any job. [00:15:41] Okay, fine. But like I think that in a - I mean if - realistically, I am an events coordinator. I'm not a manager. I'm not, you know, a director. I don't do hugely large-scale events for anything in the university. I do little seminars. I stay late and work receptions and film screens, where we have, you know, food after. You know? Like and that's - I'm beginning to feel like it's not enough for me. And, you know, so yes. I'm kind of just struggling through that, and it's making me like not want to do any work ... like at work 'cause I'm just irritated like at everybody. [00:16:19]</p>

<p>(Laugh)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it ... it has to be related to some of the things we've talked about. Where in this case, you're getting really annoyed I think because you're like in all these places, like you're putting in the time, you're putting in the effort, you're doing your part, and ... like the other side didn't really hold up their end of the bargain. In other words, like (inaudible at 00:17:22), you know, you've worked hard at work and try to stay on top of things and be organized, like as you generally are, but it hasn't really provided you opportunities for growth or, you know, thought about ways that you can take on more responsibility. And it feels kind of unfair. Like - cause the point is in a way, if you sort of do your job and do a really good job, like that will sort of create other opportunities for you, and that's not really happening. [00:17:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean like I got a raise. Okay. Great. I earned it. I'm going to the conference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's short - it's short term. It's a short term kind of like - like, "Oh, here. You're getting to do it." And really, I'm going as the events coordinator. I'm not - I'm not going for any other reason besides to help with like foodstuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's nice to do the ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... travel, but it's not any of your responsibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. It's nothing - it's nothing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or it's not - you're gonna learn - you're not going to learn anything new.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Besides like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Besides the city or whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. Exactly. And - and that's true and I mean to be fair, maybe I'm always to be fair, you know, I'm always the devil's advocate. Whatever. But like to be fair, you know, maybe it's because there really - there isn't anything that they can give me. But like - on my - to - in my defense, like then fucking find something. [00:18:46]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I've been there for quite a while, and like I even feel nervous to talk to my direct manager about it because she's been with the center for ten years and in her position for quite a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it Gemma?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, Gemma. And so I'm like nervous to talk to her because I almost feel like then she'll feel resentment towards me for wanting more responsibility when she hasn't gotten really more responsibility in all these years or whatever. She's just - this - this - this big position, even though she does have a good position. I don't know. Like if - if she's gonna not be able to like give me that good advice or something. I don't know. Or like I don't know. I'm going to talk to her about it. I just - I don't relate on how and I'm feeling really emotional about it. [00:19:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Through here? You're feeling really emotional about talking to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, just about the whole thing in general. Like the whole job situation ... thing.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you described some of this, but the way you said it makes me think there's more. When you say emotional, how so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like - like - it like makes me want to cry to talk about it. Like - and I think it's because I - it's because I don't know what to do. And like I think I'm used to coming up with a solution.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Maybe you feel like you need some help from somebody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. [00:20:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe that's actually much more overwhelming for you than figuring out how to do it yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably. Right. But like I don't know who can help me. You know, Franklin's giving pretty good advice, but it's not really helping me. Like - and maybe - maybe Gemma can help me, but I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's making you sad is that you're not actually really getting any especially useful help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you kind of been left on your own with this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's pretty upsetting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How come it's upsetting?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:21:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess because like I want to feel like people at my job, namely my supervisor and my executive director, are interested in me di - I don't know. Like, I don't know. Like all right or - I don't know. I don't know why. I don't know why I feel this way, but ... I mean they all like - I don't - what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could it be that you feel like you've worked really hard to be there for them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yes. And what I was gonna say is that, you know - I don't - I don't want to be like micro-managed and she doesn't like micro-managing, and that's fine. But to be honest, I know that she's busy and what not, especially this time of year with advisory committee being on 11:00 to 12:00, and we're all doing preparations and really down to the wire kind of thing. But she hasn't - she doesn't like check in with me. [00:22:40] Like she doesn't ask about how event stuff is going, and is there anything that's bothersome to you about how, you know, you're able to do your job or ... you know, she hasn't really checked in on me or, you know, anything, and it's - and like well, I can do my job, you know, autonomously and it's fine. I think it would be nice if she - if I felt like she did - 'cause it does make me feel directly that she doesn't give a shit about my development. "Right. Okay, Trina's events coordinator. She's sitting in her chair, and she's fine." You know? "Oh - oh, Trina's working tonight. Okay. Fine." You know? Like to the point -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you're an actual person that she'd really be sort of thinking about, like with a future, and what would make a difference to you and that sort of stuff. [00:23:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. I mean - to the point that I wrote an e-mail to her confirming that I can take a class this summer from - that I have to leave at 3:00 for, and utilizing a union benefit that I have that's three hours of release time each week. To the point that she wrote me back telling me, "Oh, check with Ted, but I think that it's only for classes that are directly related to your position." And like I got so ang - like - and I think that just the whole thing in general has gotten me kind of on edge about everything. But I - that - that really set me. Like I was like - like, "Fuck you. Like what? No, That's not the fucking benefit. What the fuck class would I be taking that would even relate to this fucking position? Like what? You know that I'm going for a master's degree, Gemma. Like who - what are you talking about?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:24:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that like just made me feel even more like, "Wow, you're so out of touch with what the fuck I'm doing." My former supervisor, granted he was a little bit micro-managy and he didn't really follow through with his like job responsibilities, he at least checked in with me. And like once, he gave me advice on school stuff and was always making sure that, you know, I was feeling comfortable with balancing any classes and work, and how work was going and how, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you feeling any of these sorts of frustrations toward me? I mean we haven't met ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not in the least. No. I mean it's just been circumstantial.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Figure it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No. No. It's valid. I - no, and I mean I'm not feeling about Franklin really either. I'm like I've been a little more like sensitive of stuff, and so we've been arguing the last couple of days a little bit more ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... than we have been for the past three weeks, which has been great. But I think it's because I'm stressing a little bit, and I'm just extra emotional and sensitive and whatever. I was really pissed at him this morning, and it made me like really annoyed that we - that he doesn't have his own money to pay for this shit. [00:25:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know or whatever. But like it is what it is and like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess this all is making me think that this - must in some way be an old - feeling, and it reminds me of like ... I'm not trying to reduce it to this any means, but it reminds me a little - so your mother was, you know - you're having to take care of things, and you're doing things you needed to do and her not being there for you in a certain way? [00:26:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (inaudible at 00:26:06) I think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I guess I need that to say that what would probably be the somewhat difficult situation at work anyway has that cast to it (inaudible at 00:26:19)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Just 'cause it's hard to have those friends slowing you down. They're in my life. Yeah, I think definitely. And I think that, you know, it also links to my father and him being so interested - I mean we met up on whatever, Tuesday night, and he was like coming back from some fucking lecture from some producer I don't fucking know. And for the first 15 to 20 minutes that we're like together walking, he's purely talking about this thing he just went to and why it's so interesting, and why I should be interested, and maybe Jesse would like to go, and oh, this guy's such an innovator without one word of how are you. Like stopped in the middle of the street to say he - this guy walked backwards and like is it - giving me the example. Walking backwards. Walked backwards, filmed himself walking backwards, then ran the film backwards, so it looked like he walking forwards. Genius! I was like I'm pretty sure that's been done before, like ... he says not the way that - you know, and he's just like so self-serving. And so I think it also links to that and him being so uninterested in like the reality of my life. [00:27:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also you were saying - what you were saying before about his asking you sort of serious questions about how you feel about him, and how you feel he's been with you, your, you know, I think you said pouring your heart out in answer to him, and then his having nothing really to say about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Not the - right. Exactly. And it's just, you know. Yes, I think it also links, you know, to that and - and feelings of, you know, not really being able to count on him for any kind of advice or direction. Yeah. I mean I think that ultimately, that I'm gonna have to just ... not after that, I'm going to want to start at my other jobs because ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like that may be true, but it sounds like there's also something going on with talking to Gemma about it that's making you like anxious and upset. [00:28:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the thing you said before was you were concerned that it would make her feel bad essentially.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Well, and in turn, make me feel bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For making her feel bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Or maybe that she starts feeling bad inside, and so that kind of says to me well, why - well, if you left, then blah, blah, blah. Or I don't know what . Maybe I'm just kind of making these things up just out of like being nervous. But I think that also part of it is - well, I mean and maybe this is a good thing. I think it will, you know, in turn make her feel like, "Wow, how come I didn't know about any of these feelings" that you were having. And it's "Well, because you don't fucking check in and see what the fuck's going on." 'Cause I'd like "Are you okay? Is it 5:00? Am I being a bad boss?" Like when you're running by my office on the way to smoke a cigarette to ask me that, I'm not going to be like, "Wow, actually." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It sounds like that feels a lot more like it's looking for reassurance than to asking (crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Which is why I have this feeling of - you know what I think - I don't know. Because like that's exactly right. She's looking for reassurances. [00:29:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I - so that's what you're - how you're worried about upsetting her ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...is by saying something that will make her feel upset or undermined or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When she seems often to be looking more for reassurance or ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... confidence boosting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And I think it's 'cause she has her own issues that she's dealing with, which is fine, and I - and I kind of know some things just like on a friend level that we've spoken. But I think that a manager should have whoever they're supervising's best career interest in mind. Whether it's with the sa - with the same department or not. I mean, you know, when Mindy talks to me about this stuff, yes, I like joke around to people afterwards and say like, "Fucking little bitch," or whatever, you know. Not really, but. (sigh) When I'm actually talking to her about it, it's, "Wow, that sounds really great, Mindy." And, you know, of course, no, you don't have to be interested in - in events. You know, this is a - you know, I talk to her very seriously about it, and, you know, let her know that if she needs any advice, and, you know, I've - what I've done and how I've - you know. And I - and I - and I - I - I'm thinking about those things for her obviously, you know, if I'm - if I'm supervising her currently. And I don't feel like I'm getting that. I think that everybody just feels like, like I said, you know, Trina, Public Relations Assistant. Like send the request to her. [00:30:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just give it to her. She'll take care of everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's her chair. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's really annoying. I just sat in a two-hour training on the new database system we're going to use today. And it doesn't do anything that I would actually use it for in my position. And I sat there for two hours listening to everybody's questions about how do you put this information in, and for our students, and for our grants recipients, and blah, blah, blah. And then at the end, when I finally get to get - have a word in edgewise, I ask about one function because they said it's going to replace these other things, and it doesn't even do it. And I was like hmm, that's nice. My fix.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess that sums it up in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. Right. So right. So I think that honestly, and like - well, no. So I think that I have to make attempt to dispute the - but here's the other thing. This is really not something that I can think about talking to her about before advisory committee is over. There's just no point. It's just not - it's just not good timing. She's so busy. She also has to have a tooth removed because her crown fell out and the root - and now it's infected. I mean - and that's this week. And then, you know, we have advisory committee like - [00:32:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I think maybe you are pretty worried about like finding out things you don't want to know about her fragility. Or maybe like as much or more so being really disappointed by her. I guess I imagined it might feel like a risk for you to take these kinds of things up with her because it would make you - you might find out that she's there even less for you ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... than you think.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And especially if I'm feeling interested in, you know, being elsewhere or, you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... talking about my next move.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That either because she's sort of insecure in some way or because she doesn't care that you're actually even more on your own and less likely to get help than you're already feeling ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Upsetting as that is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think absolutely that's true, and - and - and - and something that I thought of actually on the way over here was that perhaps a best first step and kind of more immediate step that that's, you know - will be - will help that I - will actually help me is to talk to my former supervisor, Matt, and have a conversation with him about it. [00:33:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. I'm kind of stuck there. That might be more objective also.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think this also is an issue for you if you - I think you do things to sort of protect yourself from feeling disappointed in him or by him. I know that there's a lot that you load on him and that he's great and really there for you in a lot of ways, but I also get the sense that when there is a way he isn't there for you, you kind of make an excuse for him or you I think can be pretty quick to explain it away sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What are you thinking of in this situation? [00:34:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what examples?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like - like what - how - how is it like do you feel that it's linked?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, like with his trying to give you help, and he had one good suggestion out of a few. Or like with money and knowing that, you know, at the end of the day when there's an extra expense or something happens, it comes out of your pocket.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like our but I mean for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And I'm not even sort of exactly thinking about the dollars and cents of it or how much he happens to know about your field, you know. But ... I think you - I think you feel it, that there are ways that you're there for him that he isn't or can't be for you. And it - I think it matters a lot to you. I - I think you try to sometimes look away from that a bit. I think you're worried about sort of feeling upset or feeling like you're gonna start to question the relationship if you think too much about those things. For my part, I'm definitely not questioning the relationship. I'm saying I think there are times where you feel disappointed and then don't want to think about it because ... [00:35:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it - I'm afraid it will make me ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... it worries and upsets you. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... question this. You know, that's absolutely true. You know, just - that's kind of why I was like silent after the whole incident this morning because I was like in shock. Like if I were dating somebody that like had a savings, or like needed more money, or whatever, then I could just say, "Well, that's fine. You pay for it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but we've ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think instead you feel like he's dating someone like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He is, but you're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And, you know, honestly, like it's not like this was forced upon me though. I chose to like involve all of our finances together and ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that was a conscious decision of mine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. That doesn't mean you don't have any feelings about it, you know, but you don't want anybody to just come up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But no, I do think that yeah - I - I - that's certainly true in terms of sometimes avoiding things because it'll make me worry that, you know. When I'm not, I don't question our relationship. Like when I - when I look at it, like oh, when these kinds of things happen and I look at our relationship overall, I don't have - I don't question it. And I know I want to be with him and I do want to marry him and all this stuff. But when little things come up, like we have talked about before, I don't know how to like seriously address them with him directly, and so that's when my mind goes to well, then we're probably just gonna break up or - or whatever - this is - I'm just going to live with it or, you know, whatever. Like that's all they're gonna think about. [00:37:29]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... well, very - sort of two methods of dealing with it. One is with him, and the other is with yourself. I mean ...</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean like the issue of money, just as a hypothetical to kind of drive the point. So let's say you always make more money than he does, and you sort of relatedly feel like he never financially takes care of you in the way that you financially take care of him. Like I'm not sure there's an issue there to hash out between the two of you, but there is something there that you might have ideally wanted that you're not getting, and that is upsetting to you and resonates with other things from your life and may not in any way be a reason to not be with him, but it still sucks. [00:38:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So something that to think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's kind of what I have in mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT : Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean there are three other things. Two definite is what I'm saying. Otherwise, but ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. In that situation, you're right. I mean like - yes, ideally, I would like somebody that makes the same or more than me, you know, and, you know, take care of in that sense. It - but it's not a criteria for me in terms of, you know, my perfect match. I mean it's not - it's never been on my list of - it's not been high on my list. High on my lists have been things like, you know, compatibility or - or - or you know, we get along (crosstalk) ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the issue of like feeling taken care of more broadly I think is a big issue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't mean it - something that would necessarily call the relationship into question, but I think it's something that like this is one front of that issue and there are others. Do you know what I mean? [00:39:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that there's also like a disparity - disparity?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like in - with that whole issue between me and Franklin because - like granted, like I've grown up in a family where like I had my issues with being taken care of in terms of emotional support from my dad. My mom with the drinking. All that stuff. I mean generally speaking, yes, I was very well taken care of. Franklin has not had anything in terms of being taken care of ever. So that's why that, you know, the - that - I think that creates a problem within a problem because I may have these underlying feelings of wanting to be taken care of overall and all this stuff, you know, and he may not be able to ever like comprehend that or - or provide that because he's - his mindset is purely independent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like you have in mind something that ... (inaudible at 00:40:37) kind of like a neighborhood that you could see from where you grew up but wasn't where you lived, and for him, it's like too far away to even see it 'cause it's just so different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly right. So that I think creates more issues for me in terms of bringing it up and addressing it. I mean I think that I'm gonna start in terms of - the job's been treating me fairly - start by trying - I am going to ask Matt if I can talk to him. I think that would be a wise move on my part. I mean he's been there for a while, and he has had his share of, you know, job stuff going on and whatever. And I think that will be a good start. I feel fairly, you know, comfortable in terms of being open with him, which is good. I trust, you know, that I can, you know, that I have confidence with him and whatever. But I - I think that - I - I do think that I would like to find a new position doing events within the university or a different university. I think that that is clear. You know, I love working for the cent - for the center, and if a different position opened up, great, I'd probably take it, but it's not - it's - it's - it's no position that I would be interested in or - or even have the experience for is - is gonna open up anytime soon, and I just know that. You know? But that's certainly been what's on my mind, you know, the past couple of days, and I don't know. Maybe - maybe over the week - maybe if I can talk to Matt before the weekend, and maybe I can kind of have a fresher start on Monday. This week has been a complete wash. I have e-mails I haven't responded to. I have stuff I haven't done. I have stuff - stuff I've done and will do today and tomorrow. But a lot of stuff I've just been like, "You can go fuck yourself until I'm ready to respond to you." That's like how I felt about it. Yeah. So ...just a difficult time, and I think the whole thing was just ... you know, I wasn't like depending on getting that job in Houston, but I was hoping for a second interview, and I think that again, just like kind of the idea of it ... [00:42:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're excited about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the idea of it really was able to make me kind of forget that I was having any feelings of boredom at my job. And then, as soon as I didn't get it or I didn't get a second interview, it just came rushing back. Like okay, I'm really fucking bored. Like I really can't do this any longer. You know? And I did most of those - those feelings were replaced with worries about if I did get the job, how I would tell them, and when I would start, and how it would feel leaving, and, you know, the feelings of boredom are replaced with that, and now it's like completely the opposite.<br></p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, I guess - again, I'm still sort of thinking that this is your feeling or not feeling taken care of, and how I think your response tends to be to get pissed off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. For sure, that's always been there. I know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think it's harder just to feel like - it's hard to talk about is a reason that you like can't necessary talk about it with the person who's doing it. [00:43:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But then like you're stuck either way. I know you're really angry or I think as often not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. So ... well, so we'll see. I'm hopeful that, you know, having at least a conversation with somebody who works in the center with me is able to understand exactly where I'm coming from. He's actually worked my position before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and hopefully that will help. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will kind of provide me with a little bit more clarity ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... on what I might want to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I guess I'll go from there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe we should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so - did we schedule something for next week? No, not yet. Right? [00:44:24]</p>

<p>(Rustling papers)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could actually do - maybe this time again if you like. I could also do the Friday time at 12:30. Whichever - so Thursday at 12:45 or Friday at 12:30, if either of those is good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably ... I don't have my phone. I'll just e-mail you my calendar. Probably Friday at 12:30 would be better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if for any reason that doesn't work, can I e-mail you like when I get back to my office?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I forgot my phone at home today, so ... okie dokie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good. It stopped raining.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. So I'll see you next week. I'll e-mail you if anything changes though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. See you later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. I'll talk to you next week.</p>

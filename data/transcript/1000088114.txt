<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Client Julie. Testing, testing.

</p><p>PATIENT: After I (inaudible at 00:24) I was very unwilling to talk to Charlie and, you know, we had made plans to meet with some friends. By the time the evening was over it was really kind of - but it was like just stuck there, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So the deadline (inaudible at 00:43)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. So the rest of the week I just kept like gnawing on it. And every time the opportunity would present itself I just couldn't bring myself to really sit down and talk to him. And I guess really what I wanted to do was just lay it on the line and maybe that's why I couldn't do it, because it was like - it was going to be such a big step for me to really, really get at him, our sexual life, and how I felt that it was affecting everything else where I was concerned and that it was just like ruining our marriage. 

</p><p>And so this thing just kept like - it was really getting to me but I just couldn't do anything. And so I think it was Friday night we went to visit my friend. And he had this pornographic book that he had bought at work and he asked Charlie if he wanted to see it, so Charlie said okay. So he looked at it in the living room because their little girl was in the kitchen. And so they brought it in, and they asked me if I wanted to look at it and I said - like I really did want to look at it, but I didn't want to look at it in front of anybody. [2:06] 

</p><p>And so when we got home it was really funny because like I didn't even want to look at it in front of Charlie. You know, it was like a really weird feeling. And so I don't know how it really all came about, but anyway, there was a point where I was alone and I glanced through it and everything, and it like really turned me on, but I couldn't - it was like it turned me on but it made me sick at the same time, you know, that I should be able to look at something like that and get excited, I guess, which is really stupid, but anyway I  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it was more like reading it after Charlie embedded (ph) in the whole situation. Is that what you're saying?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, but see, things like that really bother me anyway because it's like I just - I think that I realized after this weekend more than ever that I really have such an unhealthy attitude towards sex. It's like I have so many hang-ups that I don't even realize. And then like when something like this happens, it's all blocked out. And in the past I used to just brush it aside, but now I really think about it. And I thought - well, one thing that disturbed me a lot was the fact that I couldn't even look at it in front of my own husband, because I guess that I was afraid that I was going to show some kind of reaction to it. And so rather than take that chance, I like snuck to look at it in privacy.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Some reaction that put you in the mood (ph), or just a reaction?

</p><p>PATIENT: Just a reaction.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That it would be kind of awful to have somebody see you have that reaction. [4:01] 

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. And so the really terrible thing was I mean it was like I just - I couldn't even relay to him how I felt about this and it was like I just couldn't wait to get to bed so that I could masturbate. I mean that's how it really did excite me, and then afterwards I felt really, really bad. 

</p><p>But the really - for me, the really climactic thing of the whole business was that I was laying in bed, and the way I was even situated there's like a glass bookcase. And I don't know what made me look, but from the angle of the bed I could look into the bookcase, you know, and I saw Charlie masturbating, and it really made me sick. I mean I just wanted to vomit all over the bedroom because I thought, my God, it's like come to this, you know, like we have to sneak around in the closets to do things. And it just all seemed so filthy and dirty and I just - you know, like I just wanted to scream.

</p><p>And when he came to bed, I like just propped myself up against the wall because I didn't want him to touch me. And it really, really did upset me. And it was funny because I had the funniest feeling that he knew that something was wrong and he didn't really quite know what it was. And so the next day you know  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The feeling you had then was that it was so dirty that both of you were masturbating?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, and I mean it was like all of a sudden it was just like we were in two separate worlds, like we couldn't - there was absolutely no way that we could come together on this at all, because it was so funny I mean. [5:58] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it was like - it was like a kind of horror or something. You were so separated and so  - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I know it was real funny when my friend was telling us about the book. He said that - he was joking around and he said that he and Lily had looked at it but they couldn't do anything because she was nine months' pregnant. And I mean they were making jokes about it and it was like - it was apparent that they, outwardly anyway, seemed to have some type of a mutual agreement. And it was like we just couldn't get together at all and it was like the book was just a symbol that it's like both of us are just like so frustrated inwardly and that there's absolutely no way at all that we can relax around each other and let any type of emotion come out.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's like two boxes, two wound up in boxes.

</p><p>PATIENT: And so then Saturday I just - I really, really - I mean that was like, in a way, the breaking point, because I really wanted to talk to him. I thought now I've really got a good excuse, I've got a lead way, but it just never came. And it was like - I don't know, I can't explain it, but it was like - I just couldn't get it out of my mind. And I just kept thinking about that book and about everything that we've been through, and I just really thought to myself that there'd be never any way that we could have any kind of a normal act together. It seems like it's really reached the point where it's like a dead-end.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You've gone so far that there's nothing to do there. [7:58]

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. I mean it's like, really, it's something that we don't even talk about anymore, we don't even mention. And the thing that I kind of - I kind of get the idea or the feeling anyway that Charlie is sort of like just biding his time waiting for something to happen so that he'll have some kind of an excuse to escape the whole thing. And I don't really know what that something is, whether it would be an involvement with another person or what, I don't know, but it's just like - it just upset me so much. And I just hated that book, but I just kept looking at it. I just kept like trying to like add on some questions about different things, and he would just like completely like shut me out and it was like  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: About the book thing?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. He didn't even want to talk to me about it. And I was - I remember that like my mother used to just hate those books with a passion and my father used to hide them all over the house then, and that's I guess exactly what it felt like; you know, like a kid trying to sneak at something without getting caught. And I don't know. Then I start thinking along the lines, like, so much of my feelings about sex I think revolve simply around the fact that I just can't accept it in any kind of a way that I can identify with it all. And I was sure that, you know, that instance, part of the reason for this loneliness is because it's like - [10:25] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: By not having sex  - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because it's like nothing means - I mean like I just really - I mean I - Charlie and I talked about this and it's like nothing just really ever turns me on. You know, I'm sure that a lot of it is because I just simply cannot relax and there is just no way that I can relax. And I'm always reading articles and things that talk about I mean you should do this and you should do that. And I know that's not an answer, but some of it really rings true, because I really know that I'm not that way at all. I'm just so cold and it's so frustrating, because I can't release my emotions in any other way than when I'm alone.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So when you're with him you just turn off. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not that you don't get turned on at all, but it only lasts when you're with him, right?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess, it's sort of like that, and it's sort of like - I don't know. Maybe it's because now it's supposed to be accepted. Now you're supposed to be able to do things and not suffer any guilt or worry about being caught or anything like that. But it's like, well, I don't think we ever really worked at our sex life in any way, even when it really first started to become apparent that we were having problems. [12:19]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So first you were saying now it's supposed to be okay, now you're married, it should be okay, but on the other hand you never really worked on it. Is that what you're saying?

</p><p>PATIENT:  In myself, I mean I realize that I brought all these hang-ups into the marriage and that it's been true in the past that I've tried to talk to Charlie about it and he's shut me out. But I always wonder how hard I pushed at it, and did I try to make the thing sound so gross that it was only normal for him to say, "No, I don't want to hear about it." Like I would build up what I was going to say to the point that it just basically frightened him to death. I think that, like, the sound of things - it's just like for him to say to me that he doesn't like to do this, that he doesn't like to do that because he did all of it, I guess that in some ways I feel really like cheated. Because it's like I never really gave it any serious thought about whether it would make any difference or not, like, if the man I would marry would be sexually experienced or not, but I think in my particular case it was bad. Because I really guess I needed someone who was inquisitive about it as I was, and yet, you know, standoffish enough that we could be sympathetic with each other. But - [14:16]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So there's something you need to get, some kind of explanation or something you really need to do that you've never been able to do with Charlie.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think that's why, like, I don't show any emotion, because it's so - even when it wasn't matter of fact, it was, if you know what I mean. There were - really I guess now, when I think back even to like before we were married, even then it was matter of fact with him. It was like something that you just naturally did with someone that you were dating or involved with and it's sort of like  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You weren't into it, you're saying.

</p><p>PATIENT: Pardon?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You weren't into it exactly. It was something to do.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I mean like I was into it, but he wasn't. It was like just an everyday occurrence with him, and it meant more to me than that, and I couldn't seem to get this across to him without finally being prudish, which really turned him off. And it was like I couldn't make him understand that this was new to me and I needed help with it. I didn't - and I never could get this point across because I just didn't know how to say it because I really can't talk about it that much.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you've never really been able to ask for the help you need. [15:52]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like I guess I really do need help, because it's like it's not something that you can just talk to anybody about. And I feel that the only person that I should have to talk to about it is my husband. And if he won't talk about it, then it's sort of like we'd be in a dead-end. And I can't - I don't really understand why he won't talk about it. That's like his problem and I can't relate to that. I mean it bothers me that he won't let me talk about it and that we can't work this out together, because I mean in many ways, even though the problems are completely separated, I think they're mutual, and I think that there are problems on his part.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So where you are is you really need help and you can't get anything from him.

</p><p>PATIENT: I can't get any kind of understanding from him at all, and he gets very upset and like he just doesn't really talk about it. I guess it's because like maybe he thought - never gave it any thought, since it was always something so easy for him to do and that he had done it with different people that evidently had never posed any kind of problem to him; that now that he's married, it's sort of like it drops all its importance and it doesn't really mean anything to him. But I can't accept the fact that I have to go through life like this. I just can't visualize like even what the next year is going to have for me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like that's just too much to take. [18:00]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like something that - I mean you wonder when you're going to be leading a satisfied existence.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 18:16) it almost seems like that's all going to end.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like I'd just love to wake up one morning and not have it be one of the first things that pops into my mind. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Such a heavy thing to have it all the time.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, there's no release for it at all. It's like just something that I think about. And I think the reason that I become so preoccupied with it is because it is - I have faced the fact that it is a very serious problem.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you feel like there's no way to get out. It's almost like a trap.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. And then there are so many things that go with it. I begin to wonder if it would have been that way if I married someone else or  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like maybe it's partly your fault and you would have gone (inaudible at 19:13).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm sure that would have gone with me, but the only thing that I wonder about is that if I had been handled differently, if I would - you know like I might have had the ability (ph), the inquisitiveness and all of that. But it's sort of like I guess I expected that when the marriage came up, all of that would go out the window because it would no longer be that important. And I just can't accept the fact that it has become so important and why it just never goes away. It's just with me all the time and I can't - [20:02]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: At first you were saying that maybe if you'd married somebody else it would have been better, it would have helped you somehow, and you could have had the inquisitiveness and been more satisfied somehow.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think though - because it's like when I really get particularly close to a person, I don't find it that difficult to release my inward thoughts. I mean I can - I've known very few people that I've ever really been able to talk to, but unfortunately, Charlie wasn't one of them. He never was from the first time we started dating.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's always like something between.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think it - I can't really blame him for it, but it was just a feeling that I had, that I was always afraid to just be natural around him and say what I thought and did. And it was always like a wall.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A very cared for wall that he just left all alone.

</p><p>PATIENT: And it was all - it wasn't only about sex, but it was a lot of things. But of course the sexual thing has become the big hang-up in our marriage, and that's why now I realize that unless something happens to break that between us, that there really isn't - there really won't be much of a life for us. Because I can't - I can talk to him about a lot of non-incidental things, but about anything that really affects me personally I can't let myself go and be emotional about it. You know, it's like - [22:03]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're saying it's always been that way. You've always been blocked off with him. Never felt free or able to accept yourself.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. There was always some kind of a fear or something. I don't know what it - whether he would reject me... Maybe it's because he can drive the thing so deeply, that that frightens me. He thinks too much.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you're afraid to let him see you as something. Is he too strong?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's like he has a way about himself that is like it can put me down so fast without even a word, and particularly about something that he just doesn't care to go into or something that he thinks is silly. I think that's it right there. You know, I think different things are important to different people, and if he isn't interested he shows no enthusiasm, so that immediately turns me off. And I can't - that's why I think I can't talk to him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like you don't know what to say or what will be right to say.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'm okay until he starts to show this lack of interest, and then I just - I can't talk then. I mean I really get turned off. I can't  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You know it's bad, and then if it's important to you you can't get it out because he's turned off and then you're turned off. [23:45]

</p><p>PATIENT: See, it's really - I can see these things now which I couldn't see back then, because he just wanted (inaudible at 23:57) there because I was single and I didn't think about things the way that I do now. And I realize that it's like if you can't talk to someone - it's so funny because Charlie has just always bragged about the way we can communicate with one another, but we really don't.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: As far as you're concerned, there's very little of it at all, not that there's any at all.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean like we might have an argument and settled it within two hours. I mean we've never gone through this business of not talking to each other for two days. And see, in Charlie's eyes this is communicating, if you can settle a difference, but that's not that difficult to do, because that's something that's just like there at that time and you just talk it over and say "I'm sorry" and that's it, but that's where it stops. It never goes any deeper. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like that's really frustrating.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Because it's like I really get hung up about different things, like about my parents and about this and about that, and I can't talk to him about that because it's like he doesn't have those feelings and so he can't appreciate them in someone else. And I don't know if it's like... 

</p><p>It was even like after the first time that we ever had sex. That would be something that I would be thinking now that would like really draw two people into some type of a mutual feeling for each other, like something that wasn't just a fly-by-night type of a deal. But it was like I wanted to talk to him about it, because it was something to talk about. I mean it wasn't just something that you wake up the next morning and forget, and he didn't want to talk about it. It was like he didn't say "I don't want to talk about it," but it was just his attitude. I could see that it really - it wasn't that it didn't mean anything to him, but it was nothing earth shaking. It was like it wasn't adult or something. [26:45]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [To the bottom] (ph) you're saying Charlie [didn't think it was as important for him] (ph) that it was for you. And on the other side of the (inaudible at 26:51) there you were, lost again, with something that was important to you and you couldn't get it across to him.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I guess that even then there were things that were apparent to me about it simply because I had something to compare it to and it was - I had been seeing this other fella and had never really broken off our friendship, even though we quit dating. 

</p><p>And it was really funny because when I really get down and really needed someone to talk to, I would call him and go over to his place and spend three or four hours just talking, and Charlie, he never knew about it. I don't think he could ever understand it, because I don't think he's ever been able to be close like that with someone, where you could like just go and talk to someone and really be emotionally involved with them and appreciate - [28:14] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like that was a pretty thing for you.

</p><p>PATIENT: It really was. It was really great. And it's terrible because like Charlie really resents him. I mean I guess I could appreciate that, but it was something that at the whole time I had to compare, and I could never understand why Charlie couldn't be the way he was. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean the other guy was?

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Because it was like he was so understanding, and he could just pick out something and point it out to me, or he could just pick up a mood or anything. And even to this day I wonder why I didn't end up with him, because there was just such a mutual feeling there. And I kept telling myself even later that the reason I couldn't have ever gotten married to him was because we were too close, which I realize now is silly. You know, Charlie can never be too close. 

</p><p>I was able to talk to him about a lot of things that I've never talked about to any stranger, let alone a man. And whenever we would have any type of sexual encounter, it was always so different than it was with Charlie. Because it was like he'd call me at 10 o'clock the next morning and say, "How do you feel," or something like that, and not even have to mention anything about what we had done or said or anything from the night before, but it was a response. Because he knew that I was really uptight about these things and that I would really have to be in another world, so to speak, to let myself go when we'd go to bed. But he could understand this and Charlie never could. [30:23]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And just he cared enough about you to call.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. But it was just - I think what it was really is just the circumstances at the time, and I just kept leaning towards Charlie, and I really, to this day, you know, I can't figure out why.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But at least now you know and you had that good thing before.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you know what it is to have a good relationship with someone and it really contrasts with Charlie.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. That was really probably the best relationship I ever had with anyone. I mean it was really the most natural, and a lot of it was due partially to him. In fact, Charlie probably got what he got because of him, in terms of me as a person.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He really gave a lot to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. And he brought out a lot in me that no one else had ever been able to bring out, no one, folks or anybody along the line.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Seems like you have quite a lot of feelings for him too.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I do, I really do, and it's something that I don't think about any more. I dwelled a lot on it about the first year of our marriage. In fact, it became like an obsession with me and I was really upset about it, because this fear of having done something that you feel you're going to regret, it's very frightening. 

</p><p>And I have seen him twice since we've been married, neither of times, which Charlie knows about, and there were not physical contacts at all. But it was really just a very warm feeling, and this was something that we were always able to throw to each other. [32:17]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's so different from the way you feel with Charlie. I mean it's warm (inaudible at 32:24). With Charlie you're just kind of closed off, all by yourself.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, because I think too with Charlie that I'm forced into the opposite role too, which I can't accept. And it's sort of like I'm the one that's doing the protecting, and I can't do that, because it's not me. I find satisfaction in it to a point, but I get tired of it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You need something from Charlie and you're not getting it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: There's a void that is just - I don't really even understand it myself, because people warm up to you so easily. With this other fellow, they never did - no one in my family particularly cared for him. I mean they didn't dislike him, but they just didn't get that warmed up with him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that's so strange because he was so good for you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and yet with Charlie it's like instant, you know, popularity, and everyone just really accepted him and it was... And he can be gracious with people. That's so much different than being warm with people. [33:57]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think the popularity is everybody accepts you.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think he desperately tried to become the affectionate loving person that he thought you should be as a husband, and I think in many ways he has very strong feelings for me inside the threat of anything happening to me, or even I think the thought of my loss in [elements even] (ph) threatens him a great deal, but I don't know if he really identifies that with me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 34:50)

</p><p>PATIENT: Or as just a person. Someone that he has become so dependent on, and it's sort of like - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like he doesn't even see you. He just needs someone to be dependent on.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'm confident that there are many times that he doesn't see me. I mean it's just something that I can sense. Because it's like there are days that he comes home from work and I'm really down and I really need something to get me back into the groove of things, and it's like he just doesn't even see it. And  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you'd really like him to.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because it's sort of like there was just a small portion where it was that way, where he - I don't think that he's not capable. I think he's very capable if he would - [36:10]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you really think he's trying and he really does seem to care somehow, then you might be able to do it, but on the other hand, if he really isn't, then it's not really (ph) what you want.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think there's a fear too; that it's sort of like when you become so involved with someone and you've like given of yourself totally to this person, that there's a fear (ph) that it's going to be taken away from you or that the person is going to turn on you, and I don't feel that I've ever done that to him. I've never  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're afraid if this doesn't happen (inaudible at 36:52), or you're afraid of (inaudible at 36:53)?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't have any feelings. I mean I don't - I recently - I only developed it simply because the marriage is so threatened; things like he's not going to come home at night or something like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's just that he feels bad about you.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think he feels like that constantly. It's something - it's like - it was hard for me to become emotionally involved with anyone because of the fact that I was never this way even with my parents. I was never capable or able to show emotions to them and warmth, I still can't. I've never felt this way towards other people. I mean I could be very close to someone if I really felt there was something to be close to. [38:06] 

</p><p>I think that maybe that's why I did become so involved with Charlie, because there was so much, like, there that I didn't understand that appeared at the time to be sort of like mysterious. But there were still the feelings and hostilities there that had been built up for years that I took as being kind of different, you know. And I could respond to him in a different way than I did with the other fellow. 

</p><p>But I don't know. I can't really explain it, because there was always something there that was the greater attraction, and I don't know what it was; whether it was just his way or the way that... It was like I could depend on him in some respects, you know, like he never would let me down or wouldn't call or anything like that, but there was still something there that I couldn't grasp, and that's probably what made me just go after it that much more and really pursue it, and I feel like I still can't grasp it. 

</p><p>And it's very hard for me - this is what I was trying to say before - it's very hard for me to show emotion to someone, it's equally hard for Charlie, and that's why neither of us can be much good for the other. [40:26]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Not both different, then, in that way] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm, because in so many ways we're being complete strangers.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He seems so far away to you, you know, and in some ways you can't see how he's doing. He's just hanging on to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because there's - like there's so many things that I have said that I would love to be able to talk to him about, and yet, I realize that it's the same on his part. I'm constantly finding out new things about him or his home life that I never, ever knew existed. And I'm not finding it out from him. I'm finding it out from mutual friends of ours now that knew him when he was young. And they have opened up to me about different things, and I'm like really shocked when they tell me these things. And I can see why it's so difficult for him to talk about it. It's like it means as much to him as my problems mean to me, but he just can't relax enough to sit down with a cup of coffee or a cigarette and just let loose. It's just - it's beyond him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And now you can see all that, but you also see that you kind of mirror each other, you really are the same, and neither one of you can (inaudible at 42:02). 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, there is no way. As long as I can [use an interpreter] (ph), like someone else, a third party, you know, that would poke and probe at both of us and get us out, there's no way for the two of us to reach that point. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So I sort get the whole story is about the books. What happened afterwards is, like, that's the whole thing. You're so isolated from each other and always are true (inaudible at 42:47).

</p><p>PATIENT: I think that - as much as the book upset me, I think that in the same ways it's the same thing to him, but I don't know why. I couldn't even begin to understand why it did, whether it was just the whole thing, you know, put together, if that disturbed him, or it's the thought of, you know, going through a marriage the rest of your life that way, if that bothered him. I don't know what it was. 

</p><p>But if we could have at least talked about it, or if I could have brought myself to the point - I mean as upset as I was, I couldn't bring myself to talk about it. I was racking my brain to figure out whom I could call to talk about it. That's like really stupid, because who could you ever tell that to? You know, you could never tell that to a friend or anybody; they'd be in a state of shock. [44:02] 

</p><p>And I think that's what so frustrating about it. It's just that if it were any other kind And I think that's what so frustrating about it. It's just that if it were any other kind of problem that I could turn to somebody else, really, when something like that happens right at that point and let off steam about it, maybe it wouldn't appear to be such a problem, but it's not something you can call your friend and talk about, or I can't anyway. I don't really have anyone that I would even feel that close to that I could talk to, and so it just builds up. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you would like to tell it to Charlie.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really would. I mean and I even think that if there were a third party that I could go to, that it might break the ice enough for me that I could go to him and talk without thinking about him in the terms that I do right after it happens. But it's just a hopeless subject. I mean it's not - it would be better if he were having help (ph) with someone, because that I could bring my... But see, the terrible thing is that it's like if I ever try to talk to anyone about it, I would have to talk about myself, and I could do that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Some other (inaudible at 45:35). When you say it's a hopeless subject, it's like you know it won't get anywhere unless you bring it up?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I just feel it won't get anywhere. There's no way that we can cross that bridge together. [45:57]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So I guess in all of what you're saying is can you do anything about this marriage or is it even possible to save (inaudible at 46:09).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I keep thinking there is, and sometimes wonder really why. I'm really just so determined to make it work.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And yet you feel it's hopeless.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really do. I mean, that I feel it's just - it's so hopeless in itself that it's tearing everything up, because I have become so resentful of so many things that never, ever bothered me; like I've never been an openly jealous person, and emotions like that are coming out now, simply because I'm being threatened by something that I can't handle.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: In a way you feel really helpless. Seems like you're really immobilized and you can't move. You can't say anything, you can't leave, you can't decide maybe it will work, maybe it won't, but it's hopeless and you're stuck.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. That's exactly the way I feel. Because I just - like to walk out now, I just can't, and I don't know why, but I can't. And yet, I definitely feel that like... He's supposed to go away for a week this summer and I'm so happy, because that something's going to happen in that week. Now, I don't know what it is. I don't know if something's going to happen to him or to me or to what, but it's like I'm actually afraid to be separated from him. [48:09] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because then you might really have to separate (ph). What do you think would happen?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I mean it's like an involvement with someone else. I guess that I feel more strongly that it's going to happen to him than to me, simply because I've been through it once and I don't want it. You know, I don't want to lead my life that way, and I can't, I'm not strong enough. I just let things like that get the better of me, and I just can't see why I shouldn't put that kind of punishment on myself. But with him I think the opportunity will be there, and I think that he may very well take advantage of it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How are your feelings about that?

</p><p>PATIENT: I didn't think it would really upset me. I think that I would only be upset because it came to that, but I won't think that - I mean I could understand why it happened.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Seems like it all seems allusive (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. I think that I always expected something like that. I don't know. It was sort of like, I guess, maybe because he talks about other girls so much, that when he was in school I worried about it a lot because our lives were so separated, but it seems like we were closer then than we are now. It really wasn't a threat like I thought it was then. [50:12] 

</p><p>But now that he doesn't seem to be into that type of situation where he's constantly encountering women his own age that are a constant or anything like that, it's no longer a threat, so I don't really think about it. But I think he realizes this, I'm sure of it, because he's just showing too much excitement about going. It's just a feeling I have. Because I personally think that it's going to happen, because before, he never - he could never do that. He would be too worried about me. I mean that's where that business where his security and my leaving would be too much for him. He would be afraid that I would go out and have a good time. He still does worry about that and it really bothers him. He just can't stand it when I go anywhere by myself.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But then you feel like you're going to lose him first. [51:52] 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's not even a fear of losing, because I don't - I mean - [never one in a week's time] (ph) you can't build up any type of long-lasting relationship. That's not really what upsets me. It's the fact that if you're in a situation like this and you do something about it, then something is really wrong with your marriage. That's what upsets me. It's like a cat and dog game, yeah. I mean.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To be staring that in the face, and then like the final looking at it, he's having an affair with somebody else.

</p><p>PATIENT: See, I'm sure that there was a point where he didn't like me to go out because I think it just genuinely bothered him, but I think now the fear is that I am with someone else, or that I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing, and that's where the separation is starting to just go into everything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So to the beginning, you're saying.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean like he's even accused me of doing things with my brother-in-law, which was so absurd. I think I told you that. I mean that's before  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't think you told me that, no. [53:34]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's gotten to the point now where I don't go anywhere near my brother-in-law, because it's just there's that much tension there when we're together. And my brother-in-law is - see, he's very cute, and he is very attracted to women, or attractive to women. And he just practically came out and said that I was carrying on with him. I don't know, he didn't go into detail, but it was very, very strange. It was like three months before we started coming here. And now he gets really uptight about it, and it's things like that that it's like - it's so unusual. I can't honestly believe sometimes that these things are happening.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What I hear you saying today is that it's just incredibly painful to be with him, incredibly painful so that you can't really see a way for you...

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean, really, it would be anything. Even - it wouldn't be that he'd have to walk out or anything, but even if he would say, "Look, you know, I think we should sit down and talk the situation over," I think I really would prefer if he would do it. I'm tired of being the one to push the situa - I've been pushing from the beginning, and I'm really tired of it. I don't want to be the one to initiate, you know. 

</p><p>As badly as I want to talk to him about it, I can't, because I don't want to be the one to initiate it. I feel that if it came from him, it would mean more to me, because it would prove to me that he really is interested in solving the problems. And I feel that if he would be the one to start it, that he would be ready to talk. [56:02]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But if you're going to do anything about the marriage, you're probably the one that decides if you can go on [and try] (ph) here.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm, and he won't talk. It ends up that I will be rambling on for two hours and nothing comes of it, because he has to give too. I can't just be sitting there, blabbing away about my feelings and everything, if he just sits there and doesn't respond to it. And the only way that he can respond is to talk back and he won't. And I just  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That means you should accept getting that angry.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. I never feel like anything's ever been accomplished. Even at the time I mean I guess I threw it away because (inaudible at 56:53) my, you know, frustrations to a point but  - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But he hasn't done anything.

</p><p>PATIENT: He hasn't done anything, and he can't.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You say he can't and he won't, anyway.

</p><p>PATIENT: I honestly don't think he can, and that's really what is even more frustrating, because I think that was - well, that's another subject that's not even brought up in therapy. Because I really do think that if he walked out simply because he couldn't give, there was no way, it was the same thing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that makes you want to give up.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. See, that was really a blow to me, because I really thought that like if he could do these things, that we could start working together, but when he walked out, it was sort of like he didn't care. I mean that's the way I took it, and he kept telling me that that wasn't it, that wasn't it, but it was; there's no other way to look at it. Because he knew how much it meant to me that he had really, as far as I was concerned, had failed me. He didn't live up to what he said he was going to do. And it was supposed to be a mutual thing from the beginning. And it's sort of like - he didn't tell me, well, you're the sick one, but that's sort of the feeling that I got from him, you know. By him saying - [58:38]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you feel that he couldn't make it in therapy because he's the sick one.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Well, I [don't be] (ph) denying my problems, but I felt that he was denying his, and that's why I became so angry about it and really hostile. I was just so outrageous with anger over it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like he's doing that all over the place. Why does he keep doing that, you know? You've been to therapy, it sounds like you're really the one that has the problem and he won't talk, you can't get him to do anything, and there it is.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I can't - the only way that I sometimes can deal with some of this in my mind is that we had (ph) never been seeing each other, and that's not good. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really weren't meant to be with each other. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Because there are so many other hostile feelings that are there, but I've never really spoken about them, and it's a lot of things. It's lifestyle and interests and just so many other things that like we have never met on a common ground about, and I don't know. I keep telling myself that maybe if I were to show a little bit more interest in certain things, that maybe he would feel so happy about it that he would be able to relax and be more capable of opening up to me, because he would feel like I were a friend as well as a wife. [60:36]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But then again, it's just another solution that you just explore, and you have to decide, when you feel like there really must be some way we can make it with each other, but then the other side of it is still come on.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think of a lot of solutions, but I need to follow through with them, and I blame myself for that really, not because that it should be all on me. But it's just that I feel there are certain things that I know are important to him and I haven't even made an effort to show the least bit of enthusiasm. But that, you know, in it, isn't the answer. Because if I was really that ready to make that kind of move, I guess I would really - I could honestly say that I was doing something to dissolve the marriage, but I'm not. I just - I think about it, but that's as far as it goes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 62:57) Or if it's okay to call me if you ever have a need to, make sure you're all right (inaudible at 62:51).

</p><p>PATIENT: What, and I would just call here?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, (inaudible at 63:02). Or if you want to call and make another session, you know (inaudible at 63:05).

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay, we'll see ya.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay, we'll see ya on Friday.

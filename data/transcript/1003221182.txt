<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So Ann, thank you so much for coming in today. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I�m glad to be here.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: If it�s okay, I�d like to tell you what I hope to accomplish today. And then I�d like to see whether you want to add anything to that. So one of the first things I�m going to do is to get just a short few sentences about your diet history. And then I�m going to ask you what a really typical kind of good day of eating is like for you. And then I�m going to ask you the opposite; what kind of a bad day of eating is like for you. </p>

<p>And then what I�d like to do is to spend the rest of the time teaching you some skills, some kind of pre-dieting skills. Because it�s going to be very important that you master these skills before you actually try to do very much to change your eating. And I want you to know that it�s not your fault if you�ve had trouble in the past losing weight. My guess is that nobody ever taught you how to do it. </p>

<p>For example, did anyone ever teach you how to motivate yourself every day? Did anyone ever teach you how to get right back on track when you make a mistake? Did anyone ever teach you how to eat everything sitting down slowly and enjoying every bite? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. Well that�s good. That�s good because if you know those things then I wouldn�t be teaching you anything new. But it�s not your fault; you just didn�t really know how to diet before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. That�s perfect. But I want you to know that you don�t have to memorize anything we�re talking about today. You can go back to the books and you�ll have the notes. This is a consultation so I�m going to try to accomplish a lot today much more so than if I were going to see you say 10 or 12 times on an ongoing basis. So, we�ll cover a lot but you�ll have resources to go back to. [0:01:10.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: All right. So can you tell me maybe in about four or five sentences about your diet history?</p>

<p>CLIENT: History starting from childhood?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had, let�s say, a challenging childhood. And, through being adopted and put in an orphanage and then into adoption and then living with a family that was really expecting me to earn my keep, I found myself hungry a lot. And really even having to steal -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To get food. [0:01:59.8]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it was quite a precious commodity.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And through then into high school when I became more outside of the home, I found that I would have some outrageous diet practices like dill pickle and -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know just you know I�m going to lose 10 pounds in two weeks and this kind of thing.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just the rollercoaster.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But battling the diet. And then in places where I could be well fed is like or can I hold onto - get the little extra because I don�t - that old story of will there be enough?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is there going to be a time (inaudible at 0:02:50.9)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Is that still in your head now, do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It pops up. I recognize it from time to time.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will there be enough? [0:02:57.6]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So one of the things I�d like to talk about today is hunger and, looking at it in a different way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That�s another thing the hunger.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: One time - it�s important in all this, this has been an ongoing challenge to maintain. It�s been up and down and up and down.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But one period of time I discovered - I realized for myself that I wasn�t hungry. So I decided to stop eating. I felt myself not very disciplined about the whole thing. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And shame on me. So I just well I�m going to stop eating until I�m hungry again. I went 15 days without food.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With just water.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s really something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And tea. And I still wasn�t hungry. But, my spirit -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: But you lost weight.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, I lost 25 pounds.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And then you put it back on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, not right away but yes. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It all came back and more. [0:03:59.9]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. So how about - how many times in your life do you think you�ve dieted?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh Lord. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Tens of times. Dozens of times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dozens of times.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Dozens of times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. And -</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it�s been like a marathon when I do. Okay. I�m going to lose this.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then not have the way to maintain and not to do it with balance.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. So have you had the idea while I�ll diet in kind of a strict way and then I�ll lose weight and it�ll only be for a period of time and then I�ll be able to eat more?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very much for a lot of years it was that I�m going to get down and then I�ll be able to eat.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a - or I won�t have to sacrifice that -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dessert or then I�ll be able to have it back.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Well let me -</p>

<p>CLIENT: More recently there�s - it�s been a little more no, I really have to change my lifestyle.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Do it in a balanced way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because it�s not -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh, I�m so glad that you discovered that. [0:05:00.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It�s not going to work anymore.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So now I�m doing something a little bit different. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: You know if you think about it, if let�s say you lose weight at 2,000 calories and then you start to maintain your weight. You�ve maintained your weight for months at 2,000 calories. The minute you go up to 2,100 calories is the minute you start to gain weight back. So if you lose at a certain calorie level and you want to maintain your weight, you have to always eat at that level. Just I don�t know if that had ever kind of occurred to you before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh sure.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. It won�t stay.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. Exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So, one of the really important things to do is to figure out how you can eat, what foods, what quantities that you can eat that you can keep up for the whole rest of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you�ve also hit on another very important point for me. I�ve never been willing to count calories.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Numbers just don�t work for me. So I�ll say I can have a half of cup of this.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I can have one of those. And I can exercise more. [0:06:01.9]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can stop eating but after 7:00 p.m.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can do those things and not have to count calories.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right. And in fact, counting calories doesn�t work for everybody. And in the Complete Beck Diet for Life, I have a diet in there where you - it�s very straight forward. You choose a protein from column A and a vegetable from column B and things like that. And at first, you do have to measure your food so that you can make sure you have the right portions. But you never have to count the calories.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That�s great. I will measure cups and I�ll just -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know that sort of thing.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: The other important thing about the diet is that it says you should have at least one of your favorite foods every single day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I like that.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So for examples, a lot of people like candy. And they have candy, about 250 calories worth or something like that every single night. Now that�s the only junk food they have during the day. But all through the day, they can say to themselves no, I think I won�t have those cookies that someone brought into the school because I would much rather be able to eat my candy bar tonight. [0:07:09.3]</p>

<p>So whatever diet that you end up with, you�re right, it has to be well balanced. But it also has to have your favorite foods.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like that.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. Now before I ask you about a typical day, I�d like to point out to you that it�s not your faults that you�ve had trouble losing weight or keeping weight off in the past. You just never knew how. I mean did anyone ever teach you how to motivate yourself every day? How to get yourself to eat everything slowly and enjoying every bit? How to stick to your plan? How to get right back on your plan if you make a mistake? What to do when you�re craving? What to do when you�re hungry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Nobody ever taught you that. And that�s - these are the skills that I have in the Beck Diet Solution. And a really important part of the book is learning all of these how to diet skills before you ever really change your eating very much. It�s too hard to follow a diet and to learn all of these skills at the same time. [0:08:11.1]</p>

<p>So at the beginning, for example one of the things you�re going to learn to do is to motivate yourself every day. And you�re going to master that skill before you move onto the second skill which is eating everything sitting down. And you�re going to master that skill before you move onto the third skill which is learning how to give yourself credit for these things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can already hear the hard one, sitting down. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So we�ll get -</p>

<p>CLIENT: My life is so full. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: We�re going to get to that then. Definitely we�re going to talk about sitting down to eat. But you learn all of these skills before you change your eating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What a great idea.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never thought of it that way.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And it�s not your fault you�ve had trouble. No one ever taught you these skills before. So.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That�s true.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. Can you tell me very briefly what a typical good day of eating is like for you? [0:09:01.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually not skipping breakfast.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. And what would you have for breakfast then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Typically the quick and easy for me is a portion of a nonfat yogurt.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And have a cup of blueberries.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. Anything else for breakfast?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And then do you have a - on a good day, do you have a snack between breakfast and lunch?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don�t usually.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That�s something along the ways that I shouldn�t snack.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: (inaudible at 0:09:36.9) we�ll talk about that later. It�s quite possible that you should snack. Okay. How about -?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a trainer who said I should have five small meals a day.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I could just never fit them in because I�m in the classroom and I�m not going to eat in front of the children.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Well we have to figure out what works with -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Lifestyle too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Now how about -?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then lunch would -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Lunch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A good day would be my husband will treat me to a spinach salad with grilled chicken. [0:10:03.0]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Get that -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And what else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For me. Just that.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Just that. Okay. And then do you eat between lunch and dinner? Okay. And on a good day, what�s dinner like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On a good day, there�s - well our favorite restaurant in town has salmon and steamed broccoli and either half of a baked potato or I just double broccoli and a cup of vegetable soup. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that�s it.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And then on a good day -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually water.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. On a good day, what do you eat after dinner?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually don�t -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On a good day.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. That was great. So now a very brief description of a bad day of eating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That day no breakfast.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes no lunch.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then really, really hungry at night. [0:11:01.2]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then eating too later and too much.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And so what�s a typical dinner like on kind of a bad day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, fast food like -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And what would you eat beside the fast food? Would you eat until you went to sleep?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I�ve gone through periods of depression, I will - popcorn or -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ice cream is my downfall.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don�t have it now because I know -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I�ll probably want to eat it. You know the little cups?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I�ll eat the whole thing myself.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Instead of sharing it.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That�s my weakness is ice cream.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And so in the long run, what I�d like you to be able to do is after you�ve mastered these skills and after you�ve started to change your eating, is to bring in single serving portions of ice cream into your house and have one every single night if you want. [0:12:06.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: It might mean, if you can�t find the single serving portions that are just one -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just make it. Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Is either make it yourself or go to the grocery store, buy the box, throw out all of them except for one and just bring one home if you think that you�d be too tempted to eat more than one. But then you gradually will learn how to be able to have ice cream at home and be able to limit yourself. But that�s kind of a later skill. </p>

<p>Okay. So, you�re on a good day of eating. It looks to me as if you�re probably not having enough calories.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Since the thought is you have to have less calories if you�re going to lose.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: You do have to eat fewer calories. That�s true. But what I�d like you to do is to start with as many calories as you possibly can and still lose on average about half a pound a week. Now it�s different for everyone but for you, it might be 2,400 calories a day. And this certainly doesn�t look like 2,400. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That seems like so much. I know there were times when I was counting calories and I could go down to 500 calories a day. [0:13:09.8]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And still not lose weight.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes. And -</p>

<p>CLIENT: And still not lose.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And was - and for how many days did you keep up 500 calories?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two or three weeks.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before it would start, I�d start to lose. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And before it would kick in. So 2,400 may be too high for you. On the other hand, if you have 2,400 calories or let�s say 2,200 or 2,000 calories but you do it day after day after day, month after month after month. Then what I�m hoping is that you�ll see this very, very slow but steady weight lose. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That - yeah. I would certainly need to work on patience.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. Yes. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no patience. If I�m going to lose, I want - now I - the program I put myself on on November 1st, I�ve lost nine pounds. [0:13:57.9]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Hey.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I�m bicycling five to seven miles a day five - five to six days out of seven. But the more exercise - the being sedentary -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Has been really difficult. Before I was very active and more muscle mass.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it was like in - for my 60th birthday, I climbed Mount Whitney in one day.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Wow. Fantastic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I trained for it and I focused on it. And I was eating the way the trainer said and everything.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it hit the goal and then don�t maintain the -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Program. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So, what I wrote down for you and what I�m writing down are notes that I�d like you to read every single morning. And perhaps every single afternoon, we�ll talk about that later. Losing weight should be slow. Losing quickly has never worked for me. Is that true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It�s true. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So, if you keep on trying to lose quickly, what�s likely to happen? [0:15:01.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It�ll keep coming back.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: It will just keep coming back. Right. So we already know that doesn�t work. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Got to try something different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there�s this thing about you keep doing the same thing and expecting different results. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. Exactly. Okay. And the other thing I said was exercise every day at least a five minute walk. I want you to have in -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And are you already exercising every day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I say I�m bicycling five days out - five or six days out of seven.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I live up 17 steps. So I -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Wow. That�s great. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Force - you know force. I tell myself to take them as aggressively as possible.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Terrific. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know so use the steps. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. In addition to that, I�d like you to have a lifelong habit of at least taking a five minute walk every day if you�re not already bicycling or doing some other exercise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it - if at least.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: At least five minutes. And that�s fine. It�s just to have in your mindset that exercise is essential and you need to do it every day. Even if it�s only five minutes, you need to do it every day. [0:16:01.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And I think that helps people get away from the all or nothing exercise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Well I didn�t exercise today so I�ll have to start again tomorrow. And then tomorrow is when I don�t kind of feel like it today or whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So we get you in this lifetime habit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The habit. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is the thing, isn�t it?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: The habit is the whole thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you�ve actually hit on something important because I�ll think oh, if it�s not a half an hour, it�s not enough.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don�t do the five minutes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Got it.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So this gives you that permission at least a five minute walk every day. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Great. And five minutes is so much better than zero minutes. Not in terms of losing weight and not necessarily in terms of -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or cardio (inaudible at 0:16:47.2)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Or cardio or anything like that but in terms of establishing the lifelong habit. So I better add that to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: To establish the lifelong habit. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And we keep going back to that. It�s really to find something that becoming so habitual that it is my lifestyle. [0:17:03.7]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. Exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. So let�s start talking about the first skill which is all the reasons you have for losing weight. So can you rattle off some to me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well to be more vital, more energetic. I believe with weight lose -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I�ll be more comfortable in my body. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: More presentable.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have work to do that I really need to get out in the public to do. And, it�s - that would be a benefit to just feel better in my body.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. So benefit my work. Now -</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I also know that it�s harder on the organs (inaudible at 0:17:43.7) I really want to live comfortably for as long as possible.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. So that�s be healthier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Live as long as possible in a healthy way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The quality of life.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. With good quality of life. Are there some situations that you now avoid doing? [0:18:04.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: For example?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Swimming.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. What else do you avoid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well wearing sleeveless clothes. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So certain styles that I might want to but -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. Certain styles of clothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I�m - kind of hide in my clothes. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Are there some situations in which you feel self conscious because of your weight?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would say yes. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: For example?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I am doing even exercise or going to the gym and - [0:19:02.4]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know the little girls in there. You know size 0s and (inaudible at 0:19:05.9)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yep. So, less self conscious when exercising at the gym. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, generally being in public like going to a party or something. I find myself looking around to see if I�m the biggest one in the room. You know? (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yep. So not noticing if I�m the biggest one in the room. Okay. This is a great list to start. And what I�d like you to do is to continue this list at home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And think of as many reasons as you possibly can to lose weight. The other thing I�d like you to do is to break down big reasons like I�ll more energetic and ask yourself well if I were more energetic, what would I be doing differently? Or a big one is be less self conscious as we were talking about so if you were less self con - in what kind of situations would you feel less self conscious? [0:19:59.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There�s things that I won�t give myself. I don�t buy new clothes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right. So you�ll be able to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I have to -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s another one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Get to a certain size before -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I�ll buy new clothes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Well I�d like you to start buying clothes this minute. As long as you�re starting this program of reading this list every single day then you deserve to and you really need to feel good about yourself along the way. Because it takes a lot of psychic energy really to do this. Well I can see the little tears in your eyes. Yeah. You have a hard time being good to yourself sometimes? Yeah. </p>

<p>Okay. So buy new clothes. I�m going to put this as a homework assignment. Be good to yourself. Buy new clothes now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I�ll tell you what.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: To feel good about yourself along the way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I get down to a certain size, I want to get leathers. My husband and I have his and hers Harleys.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have not been willing to buy myself leathers because I want to be (inaudible at 0:21:01.2)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sharp looking in it. [0:21:03.0]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Buy new clothes now to feel good about myself all along the way. Can get rid of clothes when they get too big. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Big closet.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All those - (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: But I - it�s okay. I mean I�d like you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I�ve got the small clothes that I�m going to get back into.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I always liked but -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: See I�d like you to have the formula that once you are mastering these skills and using them every day then that�s the point to buy yourself new clothes. Don�t wait for the weight loss. Let�s concentrate on the behaviors.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah. I need a tissue.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh sure. Do we have a tissue? I mean you know what, I-? Yes, I probably do. Let me run and get one. [0:21:53.6]</p>

<p>(Background conversation)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So Ann, I�m writing down that I want you to be good to yourself. And what I�d like you to do is to buy new clothes now and not to wait. Because it�s going to be really important that you feel good about yourself along the way. And in fact, what I�d like you to do is to start mastering these skills we�re talking about like reading this list of reasons every single day to motivate yourself. And as you�re mastering the skills, that�s when you buy the new clothes. You don�t wait to lose weight. You give yourself credit for learning the behaviors. And that�s going to be so important. How does that sound to you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That�s the hard part. [0:24:58.4]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: It is the hard part. Do you think you�d be able to? Let�s - maybe we�ll talk about a few behaviors that you could learn. Do you think that once you mastered these behaviors you could go out and get the leathers that you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I would. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Would you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s great. So it�s not going to be determined on the number on the scale. It�s going to be learning the behaviors. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It�s always been I have to earn that treat or that (inaudible at 0:25:32.1)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Well I would like you to treat yourself but we�re still talking about earning it. We�re talking about earning it by doing the behaviors.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. This is a whole different way of looking at it. It�s just really very interesting.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Well that�s good because if I was telling you to do all of the things that you�ve already done your whole life then I would say well, gee, I�m not sure that this way would help. But it does sound like these are some new things to think about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Great. Okay. So we have this great list - starting list - of reasons to lose weight. Now do you think you could read it every morning? [0:26:01.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I can.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. So how are you going to remember to read it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would put it out the night before right by my bed. So like the first thing I do when I get up -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. Now -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before I go off to do everything else.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And make it a first.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. That sounds great. What might happen that would prevent you from reading it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Forgetting to set the alarm or just running suddenly late or an emergency but other than that, there�d be -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There should be - I can�t think of a reason not to.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Well, one of the things I�d like you to do, after you make the list, is to read it and to time yourself to see how long it takes to read. My guess is it will take while under a minute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So, what I�d like you to have in your mind is even if I�m running late, this is - [0:27:01.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I�ve got a minute.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: This is so important. Right. I�ve got a minute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I�ve got a minute.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And so if I�m a minute later so what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right? Okay. So, are you a hundred percent sure that you�ll read this every morning?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Now a lot of people have an interfering thought which is I don�t have to read it because I know what�s on the list. Do you think you might have that thought?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I get to the point where I feel like I�d memorized it.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. So let�s talk about that for a minute. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: One of the things that you can do is to take the list and put each reason on a 3 x 5 card or on a business size card. You can get blank business size cards at the office supply store. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And then you can shuffle them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:27:51.5)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And so then they�re in different order. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. [0:27:53.2]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And there are other things that you can do. And this is in the Complete Beck Diet for Life. Other things that you can do are to go through the deck and pick out the three most compelling reasons to you that day and put them on top. So as you going through you have to think to yourself well how compelling is this one? How compelling is this one? It really makes you think about it. [0:28:11.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And there are a number of other strategies in there so that you can try to keep the list fresh for yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I like those ideas.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. So now, usually it�s helpful for people to read this list at least twice a day. Is there a time of day when it�s - you think it�s going to be the most difficult for you to stick to an eating plan? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well, yeah, I know exactly when that is.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: When is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right at the end of the day when I make the transition from take off the administrative hat -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And start to come home. Then is when I go back into okay, am I going to eat something before dinner?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My problem isn�t after dinner so much as -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right. [0:29:00.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eating - already eating before dinner. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know because I�m hungry. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. I have two solutions. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:29:06.5) So right then would be the time it�s -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So it�s while you�re still -</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:29:09.3)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: At work then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually live in the same -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh. Oh. I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Place where I�m working.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So -</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it�s that 17 step commute and then -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I�m by the refrigerator. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So every morning and as soon as I enter the kitchen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I complete the day.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh. Or maybe it should -</p>

<p>CLIENT: As soon as I complete the day.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Should it be as soon as you enter the kitchen or should it be before you go up the 17 steps that you read this list?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually before I start up the steps.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I keep them in - I should keep them in my office.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yep. And -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because then I�ve already made the decision before -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: At end of -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I go.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. At end of work day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That�s smart. [0:29:55.5]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Before I go upstairs. Okay. Now, what I want you to do though is to have in mind exactly what snack you�re going to have when you go upstairs. You�re hungry. You should have a snack. Do you have any ideas of what snack you�d like to have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I�d like to have? I do have a favorite other than ice cream.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Not before dinner.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even me, no, not before dinner.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They�re sweet and salty trail bars.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. So you�re going to have a trail bar. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And I would like to have you have it like an optional fruit. Do you like fruit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like fruit. I�ve been told with my type that I should min - eat minimal fruit.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just stick more to vegetables and -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. How -? [0:30:59.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And do you like raw vegetables?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like carrots and -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So, plan a snack to have immediately when I go upstairs. </p>

<p>CLIENT: May I ask a question though?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The office also, there�s a kitchen area in the facility. I could do that before I go over.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Absolutely. Whichever one you think works best so I�m going to put -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my stumbling block is I get up there and I go okay, now. While I�m thinking about fixing something or -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Waiting until we�re going to go out and have a - have dinner. And right there so if I avoid that -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So I�m going to put experiment with having the snack downstairs verses upstairs. And just see -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Which works better for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. The other thing is you have to have the snack ready though. [0:31:59.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So can you get the snack ready every morning or every night for the next day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it would be waiting. Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So I�m going to put snack must be ready. Okay. Now you don�t have to make this change in your eating right away if you don�t want to because I really want you to focus on the skill of motivating yourself every day - of reading this list of reasons. If you want to institute this change right away, you can but you don�t have to. The more important thing are the behavioral skills.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well let me ask you this. Since the inconsistency has been my downfall -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My concern here is that my - I felt in myself, I�d say okay - </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to start. Well what if then I don�t continue?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes. So I�m going to say -</p>

<p>CLIENT: So -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Don�t make this change until I�ve mastered the skills. [0:33:00.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And how will I know that I�ve mastered them?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: In -</p>

<p>CLIENT: How will I know when it�s time for me to start?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: In the - both in the Beck Diet Solution and there�s a workbook that goes along with that or the Complete Beck Diet for Life, there are daily checklists that list all of the skills. And so after you�ve been able to learn all of the skills and you are practicing them faithfully for a week so you�re now practicing every skill for a week. Then you�ll know you�re ready to start making some changes in your food. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. It doesn�t have to be a long time to - just give myself a week to do the skills.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh. It�s going to take - it�s going to take you at least a couple of months to learn all these skills.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So you may not make any changes in your eating for quite a long time. Some people it takes a couple of months to learn all these skills. Some people it can take -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Many months to learn all of these skills. The important thing is to really master them before you change your eating so that what - the changes you do make in your eating, you can make them very consistently. [0:34:00.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that�s -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. That�s really the key. So I�m going to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: The key is consistency.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So don�t make this change until I�ve mastered the skills. I�m going to say see checklists -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: At the back of the book. And this is repeatedly in the book too. Okay. So, we talked about making this list of reasons. We talked about reading it every morning. We talked about reading it before you go upstairs. Even -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I�m going to keep it in two different places.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: You�re going to keep it in two different places. Do you want - should I have - write that down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yeah. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So keep -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I plan it that way, make two sets. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: List of reasons. Did you say in the office you�re going to keep that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Reasons in the office. And I�m going to see book for how to keep list fresh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. And this change with the snack you�re not going to make until you�ve mastered the skills. So that once you do change, you can make it really consistent. [0:35:02.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: (inaudible at 0:35:02.9) Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It sounds like the things here are - they�re safeguards kind of to keep me from having to fall back on oh, I wasn�t ready for this or I don�t have the time.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It�s make it so easy.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because yeah, I�ve got a minute.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right. That�s right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s it exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I�m always well I haven�t got a half an hour or I don�t have an hour to go ride. Or I don�t have an - you know? So, but something you can do that�s a minute -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To make this big of a change.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My goodness.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. I want to - the next skill really is learning how to eat everything sitting down. But I also want to get to hunger. And, well maybe we�ll try to get both of those in. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hunger is, as I said, that I�ve struggled with I wasn�t hungry this morning.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I�ll make myself eat it. Because once I�m eating it then I realize oh, there is a feeling there. [0:36:05.8]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I�ve got myself into believing that the hunger was here not here.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that I shouldn�t eat when the hunger is in my head. I should not eat. I�m not -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hungry until the stomach is growling.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. And how well has that been working for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It�s left me in confusion actually.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. So let me -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I�m so confused.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Let me relieve your mind. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: What I�ve found is that most people never get really good at telling the difference between hunger and non hunger. We tend to call everything hungry. Even I mix it up so I know -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I want something then I�m hungry for it.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? No. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Even I mix it up so I might have a really nice dinner and have my snack. And then half an hour later, I might think well I�m hungry for ice cream. And then I have to think to myself how does your stomach really feel? And I have to really consciously think of that. And I - [0:37:05.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And when -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my taste buds want it -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the stomach -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: If it�s coming from your mouth or throat, that�s just - that�s the desire to eat. That�s not hunger. So because people - most people with a weight problem will never get good at differentiating those two things, that�s why it�s going to be important to learn how to just eat on a regular basis. And -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. And then the other thing I did want to put in was my husband and I will - we�ll go out and I - dessert just once a week. And so we�ll split.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We�ll with two forks and we�ll split -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: His favorite, chocolate cream pie or something.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that I�m having less of it.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That way I still get a treat.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: What a good idea. So that can be your treat for that night might be that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: But if you really like that kind of dessert, again you could plan to have it every single night if you wanted in a smaller - in a reasonable portion. [0:38:02.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A smaller amount. Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So I don�t want there ever to be foods that are completely off your list. They can be but you just have to plan them in advance. Okay. So what most people - what works for most people - we�ll have to talk about the timing of this - is to start out with breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack. It might not work for you. And what you find that you might need to do is breakfast, lunch, snack after work, dinner -</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Snack. </p>

<p>CLIENT: An after dinner snack?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: I think it�s really important for many people - not for everybody but for most people -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I won�t feel like I�m dieting if I do that. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s it exactly. You know you can have a treat every single night. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: For the rest of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So it�s the art of the possible. What some people do which I don�t think will work for you, is breakfast, lunch and dinner and then have two snacks or even three snacks after dinner. But I think you really need one before dinner. [0:39:05.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. Let�s talk about hunger for a minute. Now most people are really concerned with being hungry. Even if they have no background like the one that you�ve had, they�re concerned about being hungry. And what I have them do, just for one day if it�s okay with their doctor, is go from breakfast to dinner without eating. So if I say that to you, does that - but you skip breakfast and lunch sometimes, right? So you - so it doesn�t sound like you have a fear of hunger.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not a fear of being - of hunger.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not so much. I know that I was - as a child, I was stealing food because -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hoarding.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you could. But I don�t feel the hunger.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Now because you mix up, because you�re like everybody else, hunger and desire to eat - [0:40:01.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: You might sometimes have the thought oh; I�m really hungry for this. I have to have it. And what might be helpful for you to remind yourself is hunger is never an emergency. You know unless you have a medical condition.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, the going through and somebody has sent in goodies for the teachers.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I want that.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I want - but I want it here.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. And so -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I recognize that.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: What you might want to do is to take it and wrap it up really well and save it to eat for your nighttime snack.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: You can always do that. That�s what I do. People bring stuff into our kitchenette too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And if there�s something that I really like better than the candy I have waiting for me at home, I just take it with me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can have it just not right this moment.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. That�s it exactly. So I�m going to say save treats for end of day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So instead of just denying myself, I could just say yeah, I can have it. I just (inaudible at 0:40:57.3)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s right. Just not now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [0:40:58.5]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So, but this is for later. This is for once you start changing your eating. You don�t have to focus on that now. Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There�s this impatient me that wants to go do it now because it sounds like such a good idea. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh. No. Well you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: You can but you have to remind yourself I may not be able to do this consistently. And that�s okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: I don�t - my goal is not necessarily to do it consistently until I get to that point. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to be clear about that because I -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I would be hard on myself -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I mess up. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don�t do it.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh. I better put down I should make mistakes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Because I�m human. And I�ve gotten pretty good at this whole dieting thing and I still make mistakes. So you should make mistakes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That�s very freeing.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: But one of the skills that you need to learn is how to limit a mistake. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It�s not - [0:41:57.8]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And how to get yourself right back on track when you make a mistake. So you�ll be reading about that in the book.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because when making a mistake feels like failure.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right. Exactly. Instead of just -</p>

<p>CLIENT: That�s devastating.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Instead of just humanity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. You�re going to make lots of mistakes in your eating. You�re going to make lots of mistakes in learning these behaviors. Because how could you otherwise? I give people the example of if you wanted to learn how to play the piano and you�d never played the piano before, you wouldn�t expect yourself to sit down and be able to play a beautiful piece of music right away, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: You�d know that you had to take lessons.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Practice.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And you�d have to practice. And you�d have to make mistakes. And you�d learn from those mistakes. And eventually you�d be able to move onto the next harder thing and the next harder thing and the next harder thing. It�s exactly the same thing with dieting. There�s this set of skills that you need to learn. And of course, you�re going to make mistakes along the way. [0:42:55.5]</p>

<p>But you�re going to learn one skill like learning how to read your - the reasons to lose weight every single day until you�ve mastered it. Until it�s easy to get yourself to read it twice a day. Then you�re going to move on to the next skill which is eating everything sitting down. And you�re going to learn that skill and get really good at that before you then move onto the following skill. </p>

<p>And if you want to make some changes in your eating right now, that�s fine. But I�m going to write down something you have to read. If I make changes in my eating now, don�t expect to be perfect. Don�t expect to be 100 perfect consistent until I�ve mastered all the - we�ll called them pre-dieting skills.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the things that I have learned in other arenas is to set myself up to win. [0:44:02.5]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Meaning rather than I�m going to do this seven days a week. And then if I ever don�t do it, I�ve failed. I haven�t kept my word.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if I say six days out of seven, I�ve given myself space to be human.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And make mistakes without feeling that I�ve failed.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And I�d like you to see it a slightly different way because the skills that I�m teaching you are skills that I do want you to do seven days a week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: But, when you make a mistake -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Is for you to say, this isn�t failure. This is human nature. And I�ll start it - you know I�ll start right now to get back on track. So.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So there are things that I do want you to have the overall goal of seven days a week. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: But allow yourself to make mistakes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And then learn how to recover from them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [0:44:56.5]</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Okay. So let me summarize some of the things that we talked about today. We talked about in terms of eating that you�re not going to make lifelong commitments in changing your eating until you�ve mastered the basic skills. You can try to make some changes now if you�d like but you�re also going to practice the skill of talking back to your thoughts that say oh, I�m a failure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: I�m a failure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So maybe I better write that down. If I have the thought I�m a failure, tell myself that�s not true. I just made a mistake. You know what; doesn�t this sound a little bit like Montessori (sp?) where you work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (inaudible at 0:45:52.8)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Mastering the skill.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You did a mistake, do a retake. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: I love that. I may steal that from you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Feel free.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Mistake - [0:46:00.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do a retake.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Do a retake. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:46:02.1)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don�t want it - I really don�t want -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh. I�m going to blog about that one. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don�t want to focus on what wrong here -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But what did you learn and where do you go from here?</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s exactly the essence of my book. That is it -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. That is it exactly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I teach it to the children. Now I need to get myself positioned to -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Just to apply it. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Live it myself.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And you did - and you�re going to have to practice it. Now I�ve written down a number of things for you here. And I�ll give you the notes. And I�d like you to read these notes every single day for a very long time. Because what we have to do is to set you up for the difficult times. And that�s why; again, we don�t change our eating right away. We�re not on a large scale basis because we want you to master these skills. Now you don�t need to read all of the reasons to lose weight necessarily every single day but we don�t know what days you�re going to need it and what days you�re not. [0:46:57.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So that�s why you have to read them every single day for a very long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:47:03.7) when you set into your day, you don�t know what it�s going to be like. (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. Exactly. So you have to prepare yourself. Today could be a difficult day so I better practice my skills. I better read these notes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:47:14.0) mental muscles. You know? (Laughs)</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s it exactly. It is. It�s developing the mental muscles.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s it. So, one of the things you�re going to do is to read this list of reasons twice a day. Another thing you�re going to do is to read these notes twice a day. Another thing that you�re going to do is to be gracious to yourself about making mistakes. You�re also going to work on being good to yourself. So as you�re mastering the skills that�s when you�re going to start buying yourself new clothes. And there are a number of other skills that you�ll see in one of the books. And you�re just going to do one skill, master it before you move on to the next. And when you make a mistake, you�re going to take a retake.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: How does that sound?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like it.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So is there anything we talked about today that doesn�t sit right with you? [0:48:02.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The only place where I felt that anxiety of moving towards something that feels really good and then having that just a little bit of concern. Just that what you�ve been very good about picking up on -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I shouldn�t set myself up to have to do it perfectly -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For it to work. Because it - moving in that direction even if I have some mishaps along the way -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could still get there as long as I don�t quit.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. So you might think to yourself what would I tell my kids?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And then apply that to you. And you�re going to make some mistakes along the way because sometimes you might forget to that or it might be hard to do that just like your kids. But what happens with them? They practice day after day after day. [0:49:03.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And then eventually some things become automatic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: And this will for you too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like the little ones you see that just learning to walk and -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They fall down. They get up.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They fall down. They get up.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don�t quit.</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Exactly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they just have that drive. But there�s enough of the right reasons -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can keep me focused -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: That�s right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On moving in that direction. And, it seems to me and I�m looking forward to reading your book and getting further -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Clarity of about exactly how to go through the steps and the checklists. But it seems like this approach is kinder to myself -</p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh. Absolutely. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Than other things that I�ve tried many time. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Yeah. Right. And I think that�s one of the problems you�ve had in the past. And again, it�s not your fault that you�ve had these problems. You just didn�t know the formula.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: So, anyway I�m so glad you came in today. [0:50:01.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you so much. </p>

<p>DR. JUDITH BECK: Oh. My pleasure.</p>

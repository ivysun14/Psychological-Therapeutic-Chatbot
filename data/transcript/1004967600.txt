<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: She went to DCS before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Did she say she was homeless, in a Section 8?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So now it's just a wait. How do you think that will be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it - I mean, it would be a lot better for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? I mean let's face it, how the hell can you have sex when she's in the next room?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, I want my freedom back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want your freedom back, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where can you go in two rooms if you're not speaking to one person? Lock yourself in your bedroom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she kind of hunkers down in your place and won't kind of leave. [0:01:00.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She'll sit outside all day, just so she can sit and watch Robin. I mean he knows she's got the hots for him, you know? She's even told him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Boy, she's forgotten about Bennett, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no. If he called her on the phone...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She'd be gone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She'd be gone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he's done with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long has that been, since they even talked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She calls him every Sunday at work and then hangs up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She did call though, two Sundays ago, I think it was his birthday, and she wished him a happy birthday and then hung up. I got one of the taxis one day, to go to the grocery store, and I said oh, does Bennett still work there? He says, "Yeah, you know Bennett?" And I says, "Yeah, he dated my daughter for 10 years, so I know him." He goes, "Cheap bastard ain't he?" And he says oh, if you want to know. Ah-huh. So I says, "Is he working today?" Oh no, they changed his hours because he can't get up during the daytime, so he's on nights. I said oh, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about that? [0:02:33.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But he's with this girl and you know, he can't handle the ride. It's too much for him, so they put him on nights.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about that? But he's out - he's dating somebody himself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, he's living with her. She's got two kids, she's on Section 8, so he's not paying any rent or anything but yet he has no money. I says oh shit you know, what's he doing with the money, you know? Buying his usual drugs?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey, know what movie to go watch, "I, Alex Cross."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a movie by James Patterson, it's out, Alex Cross. [0:03:33.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the detective in all his books?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's a movie?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, they made a movie out of it already.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you liked it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, Tyler Perry was playing the lead and his partner that should be black is now white. You know, there's a few changes but yeah, it's good. I got three of his books in a week and I read all three.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you really like those.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I'm going crazy until the next shipment comes. I mean, I've got to have another one, I've got to have my fix. I've got to have my Alex Cross.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The murder mysteries.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Now I want to go see Denzel Washington in "The Flight." Arlington Theater, you get there before 6:00, it's only six dollars for your tickets. After 6:00 it's eight dollars. [0:04:35.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you like that Alex Cross stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, ah-huh. He wrote also, "Along Came a Spider."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Kiss the Girls Goodbye." That have been made into movies.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, what do you like about this? What do you like about them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ooh, it gets - I don't know, it's the - I mean the killer starts at the very beginning of the book and it goes right until the very end, when Alex Cross finally captures him, kills him. Each chapter is more exciting than the chapter before. But I will say, his chapters, some of them are two pages and some might be three pages. His chapters aren't like you know, 20 pages long, so you really go from one right - oh, yeah. [0:05:37.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like from one scene to the next.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. There's only one book that I got - I belong to the James Patterson Book Club. He just wrote a book recently, "Zoo." It came out a couple of months ago and the book, it just didn't interest me at all. He writes books and they're not all like the Alex Cross series or anything, and this one was about - it was called "Zoo." And it's about how there's something in the air that's changing the atmosphere and the animals in the zoo now have the human scent and they go after people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, they attack humans?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And um, the guy that's telling the story has a monkey and the monkey was fine, but then the guy had to go somewhere, over to Africa and you know, something like that, and the monkey slept in the apartment. He sends a friend over to feed the monkey and the monkey winds up killing her and eating her and ripping her all the fuck up. It just didn't - [0:06:50.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Didn't do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it didn't interest me at all. If it wasn't a human killing a human, nah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, not a human killing a human.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I couldn't - I mean I went from Chapter 1 to Chapter 6 and I just, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. It sounds like the fascinating part is the killer trying to plan, scheme something, and get away with it, and Alex Cross catching him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. He's threatening Alex Cross's life, his wife, his kids, his grandmother, his partner, oh yeah. Go see it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go see it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who was the star in it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tyler Perry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, sorry, Tyler Perry. Who was the other lead?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't - I don't even remember, but yeah, the theater.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Six bucks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. [0:07:54.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before 6:00. Quite the deal, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So my girlfriend, Rebecca, I got her into Alex and James Patterson. She drives, she's got the car, she comes to pick me up. Out we go, go to supper and then go see the movie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Making do without the wheels yourself, huh?</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I'll mention that, uhm, next Thursday and Friday and the following Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, ah, I'll not be able to see you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Is there time that you're closed around New Year's too?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah, yeah, the Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday including New Year's.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So that's the Christmas week, Monday Tuesday and Wednesday and also the New Year's week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm.  (4-minute silence) There are really several things on my mind.  And I was just lying here trying to make a choice on which one to start with and I suppose in a way trying to see if there were any connection.  But it's more things that have happened or about to happen and reactions I'm having.  The thing I was thinking of first was the fact that I'll be giving a test tomorrow for the, uhm, private schools, the standardized test.  And I had, I had not counted on having to give it but the person who was going to is sick.  And last year I was just a proctor at it and had realized there were lots of questions that are asked of the administrator that I didn't know the answers to.  So it's made me feel very fearful to have to administer it because I, even though I've read a manual I didn't have last year to read, I st—, I still have this feeling that there'll be questions and I won't know how to answer them.</p>

<p>And then I was thinking of the reaction I had to the puppet show yesterday.  And I think in both cases, well, certainly with the puppet show when I stopped thinking about being afraid, or wouldn't let myself and just thought about what we were doing, then I was alright.  But as soon as I started thinking about feeling silly or embarrassed or what was I going to do next then I found I just couldn't do anything.  And there seems to be something the same in my reaction to giving this test, that as soon as I start thinking about what I'm not going to know and won't be able to do then I just get nervous and I can't even think about the things I'm supposed to remember. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I hadn't wanted to give this test in the room I have to.  There were 2 rooms and if I had really tried I could have probably given the test in the smaller of the rooms but I'm, I, I think I'm sort of using this fear as another reason not to do it.  But I'm afraid that I won't be able to talk loud enough so that everybody can hear in the gym, which is where I'm giving it, or that I won't be able to control the group being so large.  And yet I'm kind of glad in a way to be giving it because I found being a proctor very boring, boring but relaxing because I didn't have to worry about any of these things. (Silence)</p>

<p>I suppose it comes down to just a matter of being self-conscious or not.  And it made me think that it was a similar type of feeling that I had when I reacted to another thing that was on my mind.  I was talking to MSCZ today on the phone and I was in the nurse's office.  So she was right there and could hear.  And I had noticed that "Gone with the wind"  was playing near us at home and had, I've only seen part of it once so I've always wanted to see the whole thing.  But when I was talking to him on the phone, I found for some reason that I couldn't tell him that I wanted to see that film because then I would be overheard.  And it, I just couldn't make myself do it.  I don't know why.  I was surprised when I reacted that way but again, it was almost as if it were too intimate a detail to let somebody listen in on and overhear.  Or maybe I'm sort of embarrassed about wanting to see "Gone with the Wind," I don't know which it is.  And then I felt so self-conscious that anything I said seemed to be something I didn't want to be saying in front of this other person.  And after, I don't know, after a while I was after I'd got—, left school, I was thinking about it and being sort of surprised that I reacted that way.  And then it occurred to me that she might have been able to hear what MSCZ was saying.  And I don't know whether that would be at all possible, but it, then I just felt terribly embarrassed.  And it was just a little incident of a few minutes but it really bothered me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And it seems hard to make sense of it in its own terms.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, because I can't understand why I couldn't just tell him I wanted to see that movie.  And I didn't, you know, I can't see when I'm thinking about it now how, what could it matter if she heard what film I'd like to see.  So the only other thing would be that I was afraid that I shouldn't be wanting to see a film like that and that she would think less of me for wanting to.  It's sort of light and romantic — (said simultaneously with ANALYST:'s question.)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What's your idea of what the film is?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It's sort of light and romantic, I guess.  And when I read the book, I remember this was in high school, I had the same feeling that it was an acceptable book to read in a way but in another way it didn't have enough substance.  And so I was kind of wasting my time reading it.  And I never felt I wanted to hide it but I still felt sort of guilty that I was even reading it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I suppose it's possible that, eh, your finding yourself concerned there is a substitute for some other concern about feeling overheard or feeling embarrassed or feeling there are things you can't say or don't want to say because you feel you would be overheard or listened in to here.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't think I understa—, you mean I reacted this way then because of what —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah, yes.  I wonder if maybe you're saying that you're concerned about ah, being overheard here.  Because it hasn't been very long but what you felt this openly.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I imagine that there is that connection but I always react this way about talking on the telephone.  I always, if I think somebody can hear me when I'm talking with MSCZ, get very cryptic and secretive in what I'm saying.  And I'm always worried, too, that the phone I usually use, which is on my floor, might be listened in on.  Because there is an extension in a, office on another floor and then there's the switchboard, which can always be listened in on if the person wanted to.  And, and I'm always aware of this when I'm talking to MSCZ or making any kind of a personal call, however open it is, I mean, however much it wouldn't matter if it were overheard, I never say anything that I just felt would be too private to have the chance of it being overheard.  But even if I'm saying nothing of importance I still feel self-conscious about it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you're really saying it preceded your concern about the recording.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  In fact, I rarely will call MSCZ at all from school.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are you aware now of feeling any similar inhibition here?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I don't really know.  Sometimes I suppose I am because I want to think about what I'm going to say before I say it so I can edit it or select my words carefully.  But then other times I'm more concerned with trying to get at what I am thinking and it's more just trying to understand what is in my mind and I'm not, and getting it out into words.  And I felt sort of funny about saying that, telling that incident when I was on the phone because it just seemed so ridiculous.  And it was a temptation to just say to myself, well, that was kind of a silly thing, it's not important.  I also feel that way to some extent about the other thing that was on my mind after I got here.  Wasn't, I wasn't thinking about it before I came in and I don't know quite why I thought about this too.  But today in, and yesterday I think, only more so today, I was aware of it more today, the children were working with some glitter, which can get all over the place and get all mixed up and it can be very easily spilled and lost before it's really been used.  And I've always been very strict about how it's to be used and when it is out, I find that I can't stay away from controlling its use, even if the children are being careful.</p>

<p>And yesterday I had it out in a way that was hard to — or maybe it wasn't yesterday.  One of the past few days I had it out in a way that was difficult for it be used.  And it was hard on the children and it was hard on me.  But I set it up today so that the children fairly easily could handle it without my being around that much.  And I still found I had to stay there and dictate to them the whole time and if they weren't doing it exactly right, exactly the way I thought it should be done or the way I knew I'd do it, I couldn't not say something.  And it just made me feel very harassed and it made them very annoyed to be constantly bothered by me.  And I realized it was very bad for many reasons and I also realized that it shouldn't be that important to me.  But somehow I just couldn't stop myself.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What was it the children were doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It's glitter.  It's just little pieces of metallic things that you can put into paste and it'll stick on —</p>

<p>ANALYST: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Something they've made.  They were making Christmas tree ornaments and decorating it with this.  So you sprinkle it on and it, it's hard to handle and usually the children end up getting it all over the floor and, and, ah, very little on what they're doing.  And then you don't have it again for somebody else to use.  And I also realized that they were being very careful today in what they were doing and I was still nagging them.  I suppose that's really what it was.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And, and you say that you were aware that you, when you thought of this here, you felt, ah —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Sort of embarrassed.</p>

<p>ANALYST: That you didn't want to say it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I knew I would.  It's — well of course, I don't know.  Now when I was thinking about the fact there were all these things on my mind, I, now it makes me wonder if I might not have gathered up a lot of things so then I could say to myself, well, if I start out with all these things then I won't pursue any one so I'd better select which one to start out with and, and then maybe I won't go to the others.  Because that did occur to me.  And perhaps that was why I wanted to do it that way, so then I wouldn't end up having to say it.  Although, on the other hand I told myself that, well, of course I was going to say it if it came up.  But I did feel embarrassment at thinking of it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And what's the embarrassing part especially, that you were nagging, you mean or —?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  And that I, that something like that would be so important to me.  And I can't figure out why.  Because you can always go out and buy more.  It's not that expensive.  And the children, if they're going to use it, should be free to use it so they enjoy using it.  And I didn't make it any kind of an enjoyable experience for them.  And it doesn't really matter if the colors get mixed up a little bit.  And even though I know all this, I was so rigid in how I thought it should be done and these other thoughts didn't seem to matter at all.  And it's (laughs) sort of funny.  I, the one time I relaxed the whole time they were using this, after all this business about their being careful and nagging them I walked through a narrow place at one point, helping a boy, and my skirt knocked over one of the boxes full of this glitter.  It didn't spill out very much but it was lucky, I could have spilled the whole thing.  And so in a way they were being far more careful than I was.  And it just occurred to me right now that this is exactly the same way my father used to be when we'd have accidents at home and break something or spill something.  I associate this around dinner time.  But then he could go off clowning into the kitchen carrying things and putting on a show of how much he could carry.  And if he dropped them, then it would be alright even if they broke or spilled, that didn't matter but if we accidentally spilled something or broke something then it was just a horrible offense.  And that was really what I was doing today. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think the two things that bothered me the most about being that way were, knowing that I shouldn't be that important, that it still was and also that I knew I was in the wrong and that I was upsetting the children by being that way.  I, I suppose very often I'm still upset even if I think I'm right when I upset the children but I found more often now, if I'm, if I do feel I acted in the right way or for the right reason, even if it was upsetting to a child and makes him temporarily dislike me, then it doesn't bother me so much any longer.  But it did upset me today to know that I was not acting for the right reason at all.</p>

<p>And in fact this whole week I've been trying to think what basically have I been doing with them.  Because I'm not sure if it's exactly the same as what I do other weeks when I'm feeling kind of harassed or somehow unable to keep my temper.  And, and this week it seems that I've just always finding fault with them and belittling them.  I don't know how much I actually am doing it but I have this feeling as if that's all I'm doing.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Does any reason occur to you why this week should be more so, why you would have this week, especially, feel that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I have thought about it and well, the obvious came to my mind that I dislike so much buying presents that, now, that having to buy a lot because of Christmas bothers me.  And I haven't bought too many because I always put it off till the very last minute and then I have to make a choice.  And then at school there are so many things just for them to have as gifts and cards and lots of Christmas projects that they like doing, or at least I tell myself that they probably like doing them, that I'm feeling sort of frantic to fit all that in.  And then I was still doing the test with them, which — and as soon as I see some of them not doing very well, it immediately puts, makes me become more critical.  And on top of that, there's a certain point I want to get by Christmas, just in their academic work and, which, and this sometimes means really pushing them.  And it wouldn't this year except for the fact that we're testing at the same time.  So it, again, I think I'm at fault and instead of just saying, well, some things can't be done before Christmas, I'm trying to do it all.  So as well as pushing them I'm having to push myself terrifically.  And it just leaves me kind of in a bad temper the whole time.  Or sort of, I can't lose a minute of control because if I do then I'll lose time and we might not get something done that I had wanted to get done. (Pause)</p>

<p>But that feeling of pushing came partly, aside from the test, this other feeling of pushing came partly when I realized that the headmaster wanted the children reading in the first few weeks of school.  And the 2 years I've had the class myself I've been inclined to start very slowly and then in the middle of the year move more rapidly.  And since he had expressed something that might not have even been disapproval but I took it as that, I immediately felt I had to increase the pace.  So in a way, ever since I've known that I've felt somewhat this way.  (Pause) And sometimes I've felt that thoughts I'm thinking here are disturbing me enough so that I just feel generally disturbed.  And if I feel that way then I will lash out at somebody else.  And it's always people who are less able to defend themselves so it would mean the students or my assistant.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And when I was thinking of the word, "belittling" the children and what I've been doing lately, it made me think of the fact that for a long time after we were married, that's pretty much what I did with MSCZ too.  Because I was always asking him to do things a certain way and telling him he hadn't and again being very rigid on how things should be.  And it just seemed that he was being very inconsiderate of me if he didn't do them that way.  I couldn't see that there might just not be any reason for it or that it would matter if he did it another way, whatever it was.  It just was about everything that he would do.  But now I'm most ofe—, often inclined to realize I'm doing that, if I am.  And he's much less apt to just take it so I'm less apt to do it.</p>

<p>But something happened last night that — well, I didn't realize till I'd done it but very often on Thursdays, by the time I get home it's too late to really prepare a supper.  And so if we're both going to be home to eat we'll go out.  But at that late hour I don't like eating a heavy meal and so I always want to go to a, one, one of the 2 places nearby that you can just get something light but he, where he could get something heavier, since generally he hasn't eaten much all day.  And it just has become sort of an issue between us because he'll claim he wants a full meal and he hasn't eaten and so he won't want to go to these places.  And the other part of it is that very often he works late at night but it, it isn't true, I don't think, if I counted them up, but it always seems as if Thursday night is the one night he can come home early.  So that he's home long before I even get home.  And I always feel there's an implied criticism there, too, that I'm not home when he is.  Because he used to resent the idea of my not being there and he didn't want me to take any courses this year.  Because then I woul—, might not be able to be home or I might have papers I had to do or something.  And I wouldn't be able to stop and cook a meal or whatever he wanted to do.  And so last night when I saw he was home ahead of me I just came in being very defensive and before he'd said much of anything I just stated I wasn't going to go anywhere but one of these places to eat if he wanted to go out.  I mean, he broached the subject, it wasn't quite that bad.  But still, I was essentially prepared to fight when I came in.  And, I don't know, it just surprised me.  I didn't realize it until I'd done it and then I, I must feel guilty about some part of it so that just —</p>

<p>Because I think the thing that bothered first was the fact that, well, this last week he's worked until 1 or 2 o'clock every night until last night and then all of a sudden he can come home early the one night he knows I won't be there.  And I think somehow that was the part that bothered me the most and I can't quite see why.  Except I must feel guilty about something to do with it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I gather, then, you go from here to your class and then home, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And it was almost, my attitude was almost that he would do this on purpose so he could sit there and then be annoyed at me because I wasn't there, even though he knew, he knew I wasn't going to be and that he would then suggest eating out somewhere where he knew I didn't want to go just to tease me and to create an issue.  And all these things I know came across my mind before I even saw him.  So that if, even if he wasn't ready for having a fight, I was.  (Pause) But no matter how much I assumed he took part in setting the situation up, I was, I felt practically completely guilty about it after it happened because I felt that I was the one that had to apologize and however much I told myself that he had something to do with it too I still didn't really believe it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And this is true always, I think, when we've ever had any arguments about anything or disagreements on just about anything.  No matter how much I tell myself he's contributing to it, I don't really believe that.  I really believe that it's just me.  And I, I can remember once after he began to go to analysis and he realized certain attitudes he'd had toward me when we first got married and toward our having intercourse and how he had made the situation worse.  And I'd always told myself that that was true during the time but when he said something to the effect that he now believed it too I really was amazed.  And more amazed because then I thought well, maybe I was right.  Obviously I didn't really believe I'd been right.  Or just sort of amazed that, well, maybe I wasn't completely at fault after all.  And it makes me think, too, that very often if I spend a lot of time either nagging or belittling my class or if things just haven't gone well I will feel underneath always that it's completely my fault even if I try to think that there might have been other contributions to the situation, I, I don't really believe them.  I always feel essentially it was just me. (Pause)</p>

<p>In fact, I began to do that just after the puppet show last night, which was more enjoyable than I had anticipated except it went pretty much as I had thought it might, that I would find it more enjoyable once I was in it.  And, I don't know, I think things went pretty well and I think professor set it up well for us so that it was not that difficult.  But afterwards I began to pick it all apart and — because there were lots of groups and each group did one.  And I think basically I came to the conclusion that everybody else was better than me and my particular group and that I sort of was the dead weight.  (Clicking noise, pause)</p>

<p>Hearing that noise just made me think again about something I've often thought of when I've been here not saying anything on how sensitive I am to noises, when I'm in here partly probably because it is so quiet.  But there's something more because a noise like that or sometimes when you speak after I've been quiet for a, a while, I'll jump.  And I don't know if it's exactly that, well, startling me or, I don't know, sometimes I've had the mixed feeling, if you're about to say something, that I know what you're going to say and I'm glad you're going to say it.  And yet I don't want you to say it so I'm dreading it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Does an instance come to mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean when you've said something and I reacted that way?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Or that you thought, you know, right, that you anticipated what I would say didn't want me to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I know there've been several but I just can't think what I was talking about.  And the feeling I have right now when I'm trying to think of it is the same feeling I often have when I'm trying to remember just what I said the day before, when it seems like, well, why can't I remember.  (Pause) Because when I try to think about it I can recall the feeling I had of jumping and everything and practically hear your voice but I can't remember the words.  (Pause) And I, it does, when I think about it, just feel as if I am just making it a blank on purpose, or some part of me is.  And yet very often if I've tried to recall something that happened here that I know gave me some kind of a feeling of temporary relief at having finally thought it in the terms that I did, I can't understand why I can't recall it, why would I want to make it a blank again?  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

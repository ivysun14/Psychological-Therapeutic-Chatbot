<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) When I first came in I was thinking about the fact that I was late.  And I don't know whether I was thinking about it because I thought I should say something.  Or, if for some reason I was late on purpose.  It seemed like I was late because I just didn't leave enough time for the trains to be slower.  But I'm not really sure, because I was home working on reports and I did h—, sort of have the feeling that I'll just do one more thing and then I'll go. </p>

<p>But as soon as I started thinking about whether or not I should say anything because I was late, then immediately I thought of something that (Sniff) every once in a while has occurred to me, since MSCZ and I made definite plans to go to PWN over my spring vacation.  And usually it's some form of being sure something will happen and our plane will crash.  Or thinking that, other people have made it, so I don't know why I'm worried that I won't.  But, I mean it's almost as if I'm trying to imagine how I will accept the fact that the plane is going to crash when we're on the way. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I, I don't know, I was trying to think when I do think of it.  And sometimes when I think of it, it — first I'll think about the fact that I'm glad this winter we are taking a vacation because we never have before.  And, I don't know, I guess people always would enjoy a vacation in the wintertime, but I've been feeling more so that I would lately.  And last winter especially, I would have loved one.  So this time I'm particularly glad, and I think I start thinking how nice it will be and just feeling happy about it.  And then I'll think of this thing of crashing. (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, so quite literally, you think about crashing in connection with  not being here today, and specifically being late, in regard to this plane.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I d— n't, I have this feeling I don't want to think about what you've just said.  Although I can see where having those fantasies is like a punishment for anticipating the fact I won't come here.  But I'm not sure exactly what's involved.  And when I start asking about it, it's almost as if either I don't want to think about it or else there's already something else I'd prefer to think about.  And I can't tell which it is.  I was beginning to think about something else, but I'm not sure, I don't know whether I was feeling reluctant to talk about it or whether that wasn't something I was particularly interested in talking about, either. </p>

<p>ANALYST: But why should you feel you have to punish yourself if you're not here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, I think of it in 2 ways if I start asking myself that.  And perhaps both of them are part of it.  Maybe one is more so.  I think about the fact that, then I'm deserting you, to—, in fact, which is what I'm afraid you'd do to me.  And it would make me angry if you did it to me.  And then the other, other thing is, I, I don't know, I think this is where it's my rationalizing or try, trying to justify how I feel, or something.  But it isn't really the thing of, I'm shirking a responsibility.  And I put that particular attitude of shirking a responsibility in with a lot of things that end up making it very unclear to me what really is my feeling of what is really involved.  And I, I sometimes feel as if I'm adding that here, too.  Because it's the way I do.  But that it's really something connected with deserting you.  And my feelings about being deserted.</p>

<p>But beyond that, too, I know I thought of the fantasy right after thinking I was late.  But I've always had fantasies like that, to some extent, connected with flying.  Although they've been getting worse when I've thought of flying way ahead of the trip.  Used to be more that they'd happen while I was in the plane.  That I'd be afraid of something going wrong. (Pause)</p>

<p>And, and to always to have that fear how, whether they're getting worse or not, makes me wonder, or just my whole attitude about death.  And the fact that I have sort of a morbid interest in the death of others, because I'm so afraid of it for myself.  It's almost as if I'm expecting it because I've done something wrong.  And I don't, I don't know what I think I've done wrong. (Pause)</p>

<p>Except that it must have something to do with being a woman, because I start — I recall now, something that happened this morning on the way to work.  And I remembered it when I first came in here.  But it was almost as if I remembered it that, well here's something that I thought I might be bringing up here.  And then I forgot it until now, which was somebody was reading — I don't know whether it was a magazine or a newspaper —  near me, and I just happened to look at it at one time.  I don't even think I was trying to read it, but just didn't have much of anything interesting to look at, so I glanced at that.  And I saw the word menstruation, or menstruating, something anyway connected.  And yet, I knew it wasn't there and I looked again, and it, there wasn't even anything like it there. (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: This was on your way to school?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhum.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What do you make of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's a funny situation, because so often I'm thinking of things, but forge—, but then I'll say I don't, I can't get at how I feel.  And this particular time, it was almost as if I, I understood it then.  But I can't intellectualize it at all and therefore, put it into words.  And, I don't know, it almost is as if somehow, well I wasn't surprised in a way, that I had done that.  It was almost as if, well of course, I am interested in myself as a woman.  And that might happen.  But I know that r—, isn't the full of it. (Silence)</p>

<p>I keep thinking now about something that, what had occurred to me when you mentioned that I thought of the plane accident after thinking of being late.  And, but I've thought of, uh, of this particular thing now in a new way.  Because before I was just thinking, on Saturday night, MSCZ and I smoked marijuana for the first time.  And I knew I had a reaction to the whole incident.  But before when I thought of it, I was just thinking about it in terms of the fact that it's illegal, and I wasn't sure how I'd reacted to the fact that I'd done something essentially illegal. </p>

<p>And then, now I'm thinking about it more in terms of something that I was aware was bothering me while it was happening.  Because, I didn't feel the way I might feel when I get high on liquor.  But I definitely was more relaxed and, I don't know, many things were similar to the way I re—, will react when I've had a couple of drinks.  And I've always liked the way — usually it's men who already have known me — respond to me when I start that way.  Because they enjoy my being more relaxed and so forth.  But sometimes it's almost like they're playing with a little girl.  And I've always liked that. </p>

<p>And last Saturday when we were smoking the marijuana, I think it, I was still enjoying that, and the fact that different people there were enjoying me being more relaxed and so forth.  But I don't know, I don't know which bothered me; the fact that I was afraid I wouldn't be responsible about how much I smoked.  Almost as if it was the same as liquor and you had to stop at a certain point.  Or whether it bothered me because I enjoyed this reaction to me as if I were a little girl, or just what it was.  But, it was something disturbing that, I don't think it ever disturbed me before when I drank.  And I think it, it had something to do with my being responsible, but not necessarily reserved and stiff and all.  But there was something about the way I was doing it that wasn't responsible.  Because I didn't want to be responsible.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What fantasies did you have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well I, I don't know — I don't know if I understand that, because what I think is that I didn't have any. (Silence)  But that's not true too, because when I think about — this is true whether I'm drinking or whether — this particular time when we were smoking marijuana — that when I start becoming high, I start thinking that people all find me attractive and amusing, fun to be with, and all that kind of thing.  And then I do relax and to a certain extent, people do find me more so than they do when I'm very tightly controlled.  But it's almost as if well, I'm thinking, naturally I will be now.  And so then I go under that assumption. (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>Then the (Mumbled), the other thing I, I'm just not sure, right now, if I had a fantasy — this way, I suppose in a way it would be — but, uh this party was given for a roommate of MSCZ's from college who's right now, out in the PCR.  And he was in PKW for about a week.  And he's somebody that, there's something about him, I don't know exactly what it is, that I've always found attractive.  And I've always wanted him to find me attractive.  And I don't know whether part of it is that I'd find him attractive anyway, but that he's also unavailable and I am, that makes it more attractive it or not.  But I think that night, I was very aware of wanting his attention.  And he was one of the ones who, particularly, was enjoying the fact that I was high.  And it might have been that I was afraid of responding to him in a way that I didn't want to respond to him as, because it would mean lacking control. </p>

<p>ANALYST: How do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not sure except that somehow, showing that I found him attractive. (Silence) 
 
And I don't, I don't know, I was just trying to compare how I feel toward him as opposed to other men I found attractive, or situations like the time when we were at FBS's house for dinner, and I had the reaction I did to her husband.  And it seems that this particular person is different.  And, it's that I, it's almost as if I find him attractive, but the, it's not even that I'm afraid that something sexual might occur between us, but that I don't really feel the need for us, any to occur between us.  And it's almost more that I want to have sort of a brother-sister relationship with him.  But maybe that's just a way to hide how I really feel.  I don't know. </p>

<p>But it seems like MSCZ doesn't diminish in attractiveness to me.  Or, I mean sometimes I know I will then turn to MSCZ, because I feel guilty that I found somebody else attractive.  But it doesn't seem in this particular, with this particular person that that's so, either. </p>

<p>And I suppose in a way what's puzzling me is the thought that I do find him attractive.  And if I find somebody attractive like that, I've, I guess I've always assumed that it means I'm sexually attractive, and that I want something to hap—, attracted, and I want something to happen.   And, so either I am suspicious that I really do in this particular case, or else I can't understand that it's possible to feel the way I do and not want something to happen. </p>

<p>But it is true, I suppose, I do want him to find me attractive as a female. (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know how much this has to do with it, either.  But I don't think he's really that happily married.  I think he'll always stay married to the girl he's married to.  But, I don't think he's really that happy.  And neither MSCZ nor I, I mean we get along with his wife but, sh—, I, she's just sort of boring after a while, I guess.  And, he said things to MSCZ a long time ago that — because he dated this girl in college — that led MSCZ to kind of feel, too, that he kind of got in the situation and then felt he couldn't not marry her, although he didn't have to marry her.</p>

<p>So it's hard to tell, maybe he's as happy as he would, would be with anyone.  But, it's almost as if I think there's not really any competition there with her.  And I'm not sure exactly, she's very pretty, so I don't know quite how I feel there's no, no competition there.  And, I don't know whether that makes me feel that I want to attract him more, or what. (Silence)</p>

<p>Or actually what it is, is it's almost as if — when I say there's no competition there, I, in a way I feel I guess, I feel very competitive with her.  Or simply that, I want to appear more attractive to him than she does.  And perhaps I feel this way with a lot of people.  But, since I feel more secure in this particular case, then I admit it.  Because I, when I think of another good friend of ours that I know I want to appear attractive to, just so I'd appear attractive to him, I don't have any other wish, except just simply I'll known then I was attractive to him.  But I don't feel the same way about his wife, because she's quite sharp, and a lot a fun.  And, I don't know, somehow I feel she's a lot more competition and I might not be able to compete.  And so I might, I guess I just don't admit that part to myself.</p>

<p>In fact, with that couple I'm always very aware of doing little things that make me appear more feminine.  Because it always does get the attention from this girl's husband.  And this particular girl, I don't know exactly what it is, but there's, there's always something missing about the way she dresses or looks that — so I can compete in that particular area, and that's where I try to. </p>

<p>And that just, all this just leaves me with the feeling that I must be extremely competitive with every single woman I've ever met.  It almost (Mumbled) makes me think of seeing menstruation or menstruating or something, on that newspaper.  And I don't —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are you menstruating?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.  But there, I don't know, again, when I saw that word this morning, or thought I saw it, I think it made sense to me too, because somehow, there's something about that that's been on my mind a lot lately.  Enough so that I've been aware that it's be—, or, at least on a conscious enough level, so somehow I've known that it has been on my mind.  And I, sometimes I think I've given it far more in terms of — I know I can't become pregnant for 3 months, and I suddenly become very aware, "Am I going to get my period the next time?" and that kind of thing.  When there's really no reason to be more aware than ever before, because I'm just continuing to do the same thing I've always done — taking the pills.  And —</p>

<p>ANALYST: So it all really has to do with your thinking about getting pregnant?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Sigh, Pause)  But then I don't know what to make of thinking, making of what I've been thinking about being pregnant.  And when I say that, I, I'm referring to things I've said here, more than anything I've been thinking outside of here.  And also, I was just thinking too, of a feeling that I know I have, that I want to become pregnant because somehow I'll prove myself, too. </p>

<p>And that also makes me think of something  — it might have even been Friday, that I was talking about — in thinking I'm only productive when I'm getting out of the house and being with people.  And how I can't s—, somehow really feel right now, that I would be productive if I were just raising children.  And it wouldn't lead to the kind of getting out of the house that, right now I think I need in order to feel satisfied.  And, I was just thinking too that, whenever it was that night, I was saying something about it to MSCZ, because it kept on being on my mind.  But, when I talked to MSCZ about it, it was almost, I did it in a very aggressive way, as if I were picking a fight with him, and just was waiting for him to say something.  And then I'd say either, "You don't understand," or "You're saying the wrong thing," or something. </p>

<p>But also, I think I wanted him somehow, to give me the answer to whatever this problem was that I couldn't seem to solve for myself.  But I really knew he couldn't, so I'd end up rejecting anything he said. (Silence)</p>

<p>And, I don't know, right now it seems that it's all based on the fact that I don't have confidence I can function as a woman.  So I've made up this very narrow way that a person can be productive.  Because I just don't think I can be productive any other way. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

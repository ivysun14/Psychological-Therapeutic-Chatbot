<p><b>DR:</b>	That long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right down there.  That's awesome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it is.  And, um, but it was the worse long term pain I've ever been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I laid your chart down out there.  I'm sorry, I'll be right back.  [LAUGHING].  I get distracted.  The worst long term pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tell me about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well, it, okay, well, what happened like Monday, it was Sunday night and the [INAUDIBLE] I told my mom Monday morning to look at, well, yeah, it was Monday morning I woke up in pain.  And then, um, like in complete pain.  And so like, have you ever had your appendix out?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like, it's like right up here and then on the side.  That's where it starts.  I even, I even went on a [INAUDIBLE].  So, um, [INAUDIBLE] any of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just kind of like, it, it hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then, uh, and then so, I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] on Tuesday.  I couldn't make it through the full day and the pediatrician, um, like, well, when they prep around here it did hurt [INAUDIBLE] hurt, but when they pressed right here like down there on the right side—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did that get your attention?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, then like, well, once it like goes, it really, really hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, so yours had, uh, ruptured?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it hadn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It must have been awfully inflamed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it, uh, but once you do that, it didn't hurt, once you do that on, on this side also, it just [INAUDIBLE].  Uh, it hurt there.  And so the [INAUDIBLE] thought, uh, he thought they might, he might [INAUDIBLE] and so anyways—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ectopic pregnancy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Like he was [INAUDIBLE].  I cannot convince [INAUDIBLE].  So we, we just, I can't win with pediatricians.  They take all sorts of patients in there.  But, um, so [INAUDIBLE] and the rushed me to the ER.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the CT scan was positive, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	CT scan showed—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, actually I think it was the pediatrician.  I, I think, but some, somebody called him.  I think it was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did have a CT scan done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that was, uh, not normal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I guess not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, but I cried.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you have fever?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Vomiting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It just really, really hurt, but it, it kind of hurt even more like they put me on so much meds and morphine, it hurt even more afterwards, after the surgery.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It hurt again.  Like the incision [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long were you in the hospital for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, 3 or 4 days [INAUDIBLE].  Three days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who did your surgery?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]  I like him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually, I, I, um, I didn't realize [INAUDIBLE].  I didn't realize that until I went to the clinic for a check up yesterday [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We were at [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  So you lost a lot of weight, didn't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Being sick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, uh, I guess.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's see.  [INAUDIBLE], is your appetite back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you didn't eat too much for a little while there.  Yeah, I assume, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm glad you got through that okay.  Now you don't have to worry about your appendix.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm still like bloated there [INAUDIBLE].  I probably, I'll probably [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think so.  My guess she's on [INAUDIBLE] couple pounds [INAUDIBLE] clothes.  Had you been eating okay up until the time you got sick?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now had you been getting sick for a while?  Like your stomach been sort of bothering you here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  Just like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kind of like appendix.  Yeah, you can get a lot of different kind of symptoms.  They can fool you.  I'm glad it didn't rupture though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually when you get rebound tenderness like you were describing, it's ruptured.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The said it was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It must have been pretty, pretty inflamed I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it was actually a really, it was really, you know, [INAUDIBLE], it was a really cool experience because [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so it was really neat [INAUDIBLE], um, like I've never been, it's like [INAUDIBLE] surgery.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Behind the scenes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so I got to go to a, uh, you know, see like [INAUDIBLE] things that happen.  So it's really interesting [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What floor were you on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fourth floor.  In the, um, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  It's pretty nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The, um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  See now you've got something you can do, uh, in your off time.  You can go over there and donate some time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Actually, they're, um, they're, they have [INAUDIBLE], um, I was, I was [INAUDIBLE].  But, um, well my nurses came and like I started to, it was like a day after my surgery like the morning after my surgery [INAUDIBLE].  But anyway he came like I just started crying.  [LAUGHING],  [INAUDIBLE] and something [INAUDIBLE], but, yeah, but that, that's the thing.  Um, there was a guy that came [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], um, something [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not, not [INAUDIBLE], um, like a, something else [INAUDIBLE] I think, but he—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you had a little heart therapy, you had some pet therapy, and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and then there was the, uh, lady that came at the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Music therapy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you might like to be part of all that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was cool.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you left that experience thinking I want to be part of the healthcare team.  Where do I, where would I fit in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]  I have to, I mean [INAUDIBLE], um, good question.  Um, I just know that I don't, I just know that I really do like healthcare a lot, but I, the health, I really like the, uh, what was, what am I trying to say?  Um, but I do [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  You'll have to think about what kind of work you want to do I guess in that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In that system.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] major in psychology and [INAUDIBLE].  [INAUDIBLE] change their mind [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]  Uh, I don't know.  I have [INAUDIBLE].  I don't think I want to be a surgeon.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't want to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't know.  I talked to, to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know, I, I guess just [INAUDIBLE], it's, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who do you hear it from though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, no, no, no, just, just, you know, you hear a surgeon, you're like cutting people, I, I don't know.  But then I think, I mean it's a very important job.  I mean, but what, you know, you go through however many years of medical school.  I think [INAUDIBLE] do your best ability.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, a lot of people don't know even in medical school what specialty they're going to go into until they're exposed to those things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you have lots of time.  But I like the idea, you know, shadowing people and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], but right now just trying to get into college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I understand, but, you know, you go meet people that do speech therapy and you, you know, hang around them for a day or 2.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, worrying about college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It takes up a lot of your time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many hours of day do you spend worrying about college?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I would say [INAUDIBLE] it just, it just, it generally comes to my mind everyday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's not [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not [INAUDIBLE], right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did that confuse you more going to so many?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, a little bit.  Sometimes I'm like, hum, I, I actually remember something.  I'm like at this school or at this school, but I am a little bit, not a lot, but I am very good at, when I go to colleges, I always have a, um, [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and always bring my camera and take pictures so I can try and like [INAUDIBLE] put things together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you come up with that on your own?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know if I came up with it.  I think, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you taken time to look at your pictures and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're considering a lot of different factors.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, and I'm just wondering, you know, just, uh, instinct.  If you had to decide like right now for some reason, you could go anywhere you want and you got to pick instantly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just wouldn't pick?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably.  I, I've got to be honest—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, if you're going to wait until the last minute then, what, what would happen—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want to wait until the last minute.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If every one of these schools had a different deadline.  In other words, if you had to let them know at, by a certain date, but every one of them was a different date, one was later than the other and later than the other like that, what would you, would you want to tend to kind of let those dates pass and the deadlines make the decision for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably.  Uh, at this point, I just [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] would be like you're going here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, your parents would be glad to decide for you I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, my parents are saying they won't decide for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, they, they—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE],  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, uh, if it comes down to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, but you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I mean they, they, they don't, they, they both tell me now, they go we can't afford such and such.  You got 3 scholarships here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], but they go, I mean and as long, as, as long as it's not in the way of budget, [INAUDIBLE] going to be like, no, you need [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if it doesn't really matter, well, just pick the cheapest one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is where you're going.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean if that's, if they're, if, if—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If they're all the same.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, I mean I wouldn't, I wouldn't mind.  I mean I like [INAUDIBLE].  I like [INAUDIBLE] a lot.  I mean I'd be fine at [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'd be happy at anywhere I go, I'd be happy, it's just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just, it's just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  [LAUGHING]  I like them all.  And, and [DEIDENTIFIED], okay, all right.  Here's [INAUDIBLE] how I think of each one.  All right, [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], if I get in, uh, [INAUDIBLE].  Um, I'm probably not going to be able to afford it.  I, I mean I'm [INAUDIBLE] scholarship there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I was going to take the SAT when I was [INAUDIBLE] out—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That weekend.  So I know, don't know if I'll have another chance to take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Last weekend that was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  And I, I messed up all the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But there's a time in December, isn't there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but they have their, well, yeah, it, the scholarship money, yeah.  But, um, but not for [INAUDIBLE].  That's it.  But, um, [INAUDIBLE] I, I feel [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have any applications completed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Turned any in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All but [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'm pretty sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have them all turned in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm pretty sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Any of them have secondary applications?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes they, you turn in the application and they send you back a, they want more information.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] turned in, like they, they don't actually look at them until November.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's [INAUDIBLE] and you don't actually hear back from these places until like January.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You going to do an early admission anywhere?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], um, but [INAUDIBLE] all that.  But [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED]'s kind of, I should have [INAUDIBLE].  And [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED] is [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know.  [INAUDIBLE]  I mean I can get in, but I can't, won't be able to afford it [INAUDIBLE].  See I really like [INAUDIBLE].  It, yeah, it has the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It has, but at the same time [INAUDIBLE] just a relaxing place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] about the same with [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I [INAUDIBLE].  Well, see, it's because I was, this [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know.  So, um, I mean if, if you put my ACT scores together, I [INAUDIBLE], but they don't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They won't do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They won't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Considering you were sick?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]  I didn't ask that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could, you could ask.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]  They don't, they don't care.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know, you might be surprised.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], uh, [INAUDIBLE] [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED]'s cool.  [LAUGHING].  But [DEIDENTIFIED]'s pretty cool too.  I like [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you think about at [DEIDENTIFIED] home though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't like that.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's what you have to think about too.  Where are you going to show comfortable in terms of distance from home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would not [INAUDIBLE], but I mean [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe it'd be good for you you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if it's not what you felt, uh, good about, then that's not, I mean maybe it'd be a good idea if we sent you to California to go to school.  I don't know, may be, but that's not what you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You wouldn't feel good about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually, I wouldn't really care.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, you would.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you were in California?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It, it, right now you're going to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I see if somebody else is making that decision.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'd be, okay, cool.  [INAUDIBLE] oh, this is good, cool.  [INAUDIBLE], that'd be good.  I'd be happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You say that you want, uh, it would be good if someone else was making these decisions for you and just told you, but at the same time, you hate it when people tell you what to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hm.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't like being bossed around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mood been good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You seem pretty happy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Other than when you're tormenting yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mentioned friends earlier.  You spend a fair amount of time with them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got new friends this year or the same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Got the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You seeing anybody?  You dating?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And are things around the house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You and your parents okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're not driving you crazy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just my mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  It's not worse because of all this college stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see you kind of waited to get your applications in?  It sounds like you got them in early.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Was this a conflict with you and your mom getting them in or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So she wasn't on your case too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very good.  Cause most kids have a problem with that with their parents, you know?  Not doing it on a timely basis.  So your both mom and dad are okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean my mom, my mom's helped me out all along.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, she's good at that kind of thing.  She's very organized.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You and dad are okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So what are your thoughts about, uh, not being at home in a year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A little nervous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't know.  I'm ready.  I mean I'm going to miss my family, but I just, I'm ready.  [INAUDIBLE]  It'll be cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So you got a car?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hmm, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you got, dad brought you here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, but, uh, like I drive, I drive to school, um, [INAUDIBLE], but, um, it's my dad's car and my mom and dad work close to each other so they just, uh, both go in mom's car, but I [INAUDIBLE], but I don't have another car, but I drive to school.  And, and [INAUDIBLE] I drive my dad's car.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he doesn't drive it too much I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, actually, actually, that car [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're kind of slowly taking over that car?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, um, [INAUDIBLE] dad's car?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Making it yours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I wish.  [INAUDIBLE] car until like my sophomore year in college.  Which I mean, I, I really think that I need a car and I'm not just saying that.  What if, I mean anywhere I go, even, even if I like [DEIDENTIFIED], but let's, let's say my [INAUDIBLE].  I don't want to have to be going in [INAUDIBLE] every single time or [INAUDIBLE] every single time I want to go to town.  Like if it's an emergency I want to be able to go home.  If I want to [INAUDIBLE].  I don't want to have to be waiting on people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You see that's your personality.  I was saying earlier that you are saying that you, it'd be nice if somebody would just tell you what school to go to, but at the same time, you hate being told what to do.  You hate being, having someone else over you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it depends, it depends on what it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It depends what it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You like your independence.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You like being able to do what you want to be doing—going to the store, go home, have an emergency—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not have to be depending on anyone else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, I don't, I don't like to, I don't, [INAUDIBLE], but it's, but you know, but, and what [INAUDIBLE] I mean somewhere that you can't exactly walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean [INAUDIBLE] having a car—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, instead of having to bum a ride.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It'd be, it'd be, it'd be, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So again your, your, your idea of life is to autonomist.  To be more independent then.  Maybe some people are more comfortable being—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, yeah.  [INAUDIBLE], yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which is why you have to make that decision.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What decision?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any that have to do with you.  Whether at school, where you live—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All of it.  And—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I like [DEIDENTIFIED].  [INAUDIBLE] cause I'd be fine anywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  You will be fine anywhere.  It's nice to hear.  You have a real, your sense of, uh, your self confidence is, obviously, very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it wasn't always.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just say, I'm just saying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it always wasn't, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, I mean [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're going to do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're going to be successful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] really, now this is annoying, this is annoying.  [PATIENT NAME], you flunk out of college, [INAUDIBLE].  [PATIENT NAME], you, you're never going, [INAUDIBLE].  Cause right now, like, like, for example, my alarm clock, I don't understand my alarm clock, I just don't.  I, I [INAUDIBLE] alarm clock [INAUDIBLE] go up to [DEIDENTIFIED] and the [DEIDENTIFIED] girls [INAUDIBLE] me an alarm clock.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] because one night, uh, one morning, uh, [INAUDIBLE] and they were all trying to turn it off.  [INAUDIBLE], but I know, I, I, but, but, but at [DEIDENTIFIED], at [DEIDENTIFIED] you have to always wake up.  I just [INAUDIBLE] one morning to the, but I set it too early.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I woke up [INAUDIBLE], [PATIENT NAME], get up, you got to get up.  [INAUDIBLE] I'm like it's not, I mean other places I get up.  I'm going to get up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So your parents need to work on letting you get up on your own?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause you might not, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's all I'm saying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause something—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], you know, but in the back of my mind, I get up in the morning [INAUDIBLE].  Well, then I'm going to do that.  It's not, you know, [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not [INAUDIBLE] or my dad especially is like, [INAUDIBLE] like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Do you sometime doubt though that you'll be able to do it because they doubt it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't, I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they don't put doubt in your head?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think they're ridiculous.  They need to get over it.  It's all [INAUDIBLE].  They don't talk about [INAUDIBLE], they just talk about [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sleeping so much.  You sleep after school now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not everyday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not everyday.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  But, you know, you used to be you'd sleep everyday a few hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's not like it used to be?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'd used to be everyday you'd sleep after school for, you know, 4 hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].  I never slept after school for 4 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you'd sleep pretty long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're pretty organized it sounds like.  I mean you know what has to be done, you're getting things turned in on time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I am a procrastinator.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	College, yeah, college [INAUDIBLE] done, turn it in on time, but [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what do you do in that time that, that you're procrastinating, you're putting things off?  Are you doing nothing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It depends, usually nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if something's due—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not something, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you're not doing what has to be done by a time.  You wait until the last minute to do what, all—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not what you did with your college applications though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, well, that's, that's cause, [INAUDIBLE] I mean what, what—and we were doing it together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It wasn't like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that would be a concern maybe that, uh, your mom would have and maybe you have.  How you going to do your work without her being there and bugging you to get it done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, because [INAUDIBLE] I do on my own [INAUDIBLE] college applications [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, but you just said you wait until the last minute to get it done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause if you wait until the last minute, you're not going, that's not going to be your best work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what to do.  Cut it out, right?  It's easy.  Just stop doing that.  Do what you did like the year college, uh, application process, a little bit at a time.  Just like what you did taking the pictures and, you know, making notes about the colleges you went to being organized.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause college isn't that hard.  School's not that hard if you just have a system that works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	School's not that hard.  We make it hard because we wait, like you said, put things off, don't go to class, stay up at night, try to cram for tests, keeping them good habits.  But if you have good habits, it'll be fine.  And you go to college and you treat it like a fulltime job.  Just, uh, go to classes, all your classes, and study.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Come up to about 40 hours a week.  You'll have all As and you won't have to study in the evenings and the weekends.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you busy enough now to where you're not bored?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you're not feeling bored often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, well, I don't know.  I don't know.  I guess, I guess I'm kind of bored.  I'm ready for college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, you don't sound like it, a year ago, you were like, yeah, I'm bored like all the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, everything feels old, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like everything, it wouldn't be such boredom [INAUDIBLE].  So that way I'm bored.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], but I'm not, I don't know, I'm, I'm not actually saying anything, I'm bored, but I'm not, but I guess I am.  But it just is like everything's so [INAUDIBLE] wake up every morning and you're still yourself—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE], but seriously you think about it and it's like [INAUDIBLE] this worries me.  Um, [INAUDIBLE] professional like a doctor, but when somebody tells me a story—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or if I [INAUDIBLE], I feel like I've been there.  But I feel [INAUDIBLE] been there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]  Like been there and done it [INAUDIBLE].  Not, not, not quite—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But kind of.  And I'm trying [INAUDIBLE] go to college and like, like my friends say [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]  I know I haven't, but I feel like I have.  [INAUDIBLE] like a psychiatrist.  Like, you, you can't, you can't do that.  You, you, you can't, it gets to be too much, you know?  Feeling like [INAUDIBLE].  Am I making any sense?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That makes sense.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It [INAUDIBLE] but that's okay [INAUDIBLE].  Um, but, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And does that scare you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, it doesn't scare me.  I'm just worried about, not worried.  [INAUDIBLE] but as far as a profession as being a doctor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That can't be good.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it might be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it may not be good for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know.  You recognize it anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not as if you tell people I was in Spain because somebody tells me—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wouldn't do that.  I just, I just like, I mean I don't actually sit there for hours thinking of this.  It just, it just kind of complicates, I just know like, you know, everything [INAUDIBLE].  Um, but, no [INAUDIBLE], but, but like I feel old—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because, not old, [INAUDIBLE].  I'm really bad [INAUDIBLE].  Um, not old, but, um, [INAUDIBLE] make me feel old and not so carefree [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know, I, I just, I really felt like that the past 2 or 3 years—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I felt that.  It's like just [INAUDIBLE].  And I haven't [INAUDIBLE] know I haven't.  I, I'm not saying [INAUDIBLE], I'm not saying that, but I feel like I have.  [INAUDIBLE] repeat a story [INAUDIBLE], I feel like I've done it and I really like [INAUDIBLE] to die the next day—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Go, no, no, no, I'm not ready, I'm not ready, but like [INAUDIBLE], but I was to die today, I'd be fine with it.  I mean I wouldn't be fine with it.  I would be fine with it because I want to be, I want to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] cause I'm fine with it.  I mean [INAUDIBLE] privileged that I've had a good life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It doesn't scare you as much as it did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it doesn't.  What do you think of that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that change, you're handling in general much better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your change.  There's a time when you couldn't handle really much change at all in your environment, in yourself, anything.  You wanted things always to be as you anticipated them to be.  Right.  And in your, in your head you would have things planned out the way it's going to go—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then when it wouldn't go that way, you would have a meltdown.  You'd become very distraught.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Honestly, I honestly don't remember [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you can relate to how you still have the, you still like to know what's going to happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't like surprises.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not so much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, unless you know it's going to be a good surprise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then it's not a surprise though.  You'd rather know ahead of time and part of wanting to know ahead of time is trying to control things, trying to control variables involved so that you will know [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, like [INAUDIBLE], [LAUGHING], or some, I don't know, it's something and like, like [INAUDIBLE].  I think it [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You would what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what be the first thing you'd think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would, I wouldn't change anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You wouldn't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What would be the point [INAUDIBLE] past?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Haven't you already learned that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, go back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't want to go into the future because I don't want to ruin anything.  I don't want to, I mean I, I, the point being I don't want to know everything [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING],  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to be in some control of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As opposed to just winging it.  That's not you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  So you like not knowing exactly how things are going to be, but you do have more of a need to control what's going to happen than most people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I don't think like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's your personality.  Your personality it's like that you do obsess about things.  You do have the same part of your brain that repeats it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  And you have compulsive behaviors and things that you have to do a certain way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, whatever it is.  There's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And people that tend to be obsessive, compulsive need to, they try to, they try to control things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] compulsive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a, that's a personality characteristic that you have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As a personality characteristic, not as a disorder.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  That's not good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's not bad, it just is.  Many professionals have obsessive, compulsive personalities and it's important a lot of times to be thorough and to double check things.  The, the thing now is you can't just be listening to that voice in your head that tells you to doubt things that don't need doubted to make, to be able to make decisions and, you know, make a mistake, learn from it, not repeat it, and move on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's hard for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  That's the repetitive obsessive stuff.  But you've made so much progress, [PATIENT NAME], that even though [INAUDIBLE] the last few years you really have.  Now you're ready to make a bigger decision than this—where are you going to go live for 4 years?  And, and, you know, you can decide and then, uh, you go there and it's, doesn't pan out to be what you had hoped it could be or how they presented it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hum?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can, you can transfer, exactly.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I really, I really want [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know you'd like that because that would be easier, but, uh, don't know.  But you do have to trust your instincts.  That's why I keep, that's why I said where'd you feel comfortable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have a hard time with that one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, uh, maybe if you go back and look at your pictures and just sort of let your mind go and go, yeah, that felt good there.  Then you can make your decision to go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See that doubt?  It keeps coming back in and making you go, you're kind of leaning this way and maybe I'll, yeah, but maybe—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but doubt stuff is [INAUDIBLE] and every time you  have that doubt, then you have to say to yourself, I know what that is and forget it because it doesn't help you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but [INAUDIBLE] because, um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that may be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because like [INAUDIBLE], [LAUGHING], [INAUDIBLE] different, but to be [INAUDIBLE] go away and having new scenery, oh, I mean [INAUDIBLE].  And also, also I have, I have like [INAUDIBLE] and that wouldn't be good.  I mean that's not, that's not a reason, but like, like one, one of the guys I know like [INAUDIBLE], but it just, [INAUDIBLE] I'm going to probably go to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't know.  I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.  And I'm also telling you not to take so many factors into consideration.  You can do the pros and cons list to the point of absurdity.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And letting deadlines come and go is a decision to not make a decision—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I would strongly encourage you to make a decision.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What medicine are you taking in the morning now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It hasn't changed any, has it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You appear well.  You really do.  You have matured so much in the time I've known you.  You've come a long ways.  Your brother driving you nuts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is he doing good in school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.  Probably not too many, uh, girls that show that way about their younger brother, are there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] in my family always [INAUDIBLE] my brother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but how many girls do you know of that have the same feelings about their younger brother like you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hmm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not many.  Most of them can't stand their younger brothers, et cetera.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] which is, which is cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like we, I've never gone [INAUDIBLE] I mean we usually fight like na, na, na, you know, but never like a, you know, [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm mad kind of fight.  Nothing like that.  It's like we never, but [INAUDIBLE] unbelievable [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what are you going to do the rest of the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I have a lot of makeup work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The appendix surgery [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They didn't let you off the hook with any of it, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm going to go with my dad up, I, I [INAUDIBLE] one and a half months/2 months [INAUDIBLE].  So anyway I'm going to go with him and watch [INAUDIBLE] right now and [INAUDIBLE] and then I'll go home and be at home the rest of the day doing work [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm glad you got through your, your adventure, your hospital [INAUDIBLE].  Good to see you.  Better get lunch before you go stand in line because it's pretty long I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.  Uh, [INAUDIBLE], um, I want to go, but I [INAUDIBLE] there'll be a line.  There's going to be a line.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the gal at the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was late coming in because of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause he keeps on saying like, um, I mean I don't [INAUDIBLE] huge line.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He, he says that [INAUDIBLE] because there won't be a lunch break and there won't be, it'll be kind of early in the morning.  He thinks it's going to be a good time.  But I can't, I've really got to get home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take something to read.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause you got all this, you got all this makeup work.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Client 0518-014, Client 0518-014. This is Therapist Thompson, Session Number 2, Therapist Thompson, Session Number 2, and the date today is December 18th, today's date, December 18th.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I stayed up all night, studied for a test and took speed and I'd never taken it before and I just crashed right in the middle of the exam and blundered through it and I just couldn't stay awake any longer for the rest of the day, so I just went home and went to sleep. How are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. A little frantic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you have stuff to do too, student type stuff?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've been involved in planning something so I've been running around a little and being nervous and hyper.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just finished up a take-home exam and I sounded like you and I was running furiously and it was supposed to be due at 12 and I was running until now and I went down to this office and he had just left so I was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've been running like crazy too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, but I feel okay. I just... A rather good exam is what it was. Do you mind if I take off my shoes? Hot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of warm in here too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This room is real - it seems real familiar in this funny way. I mean my room at home is like - for some reason like I had a - one of these kind of carpets and mostly green plants in it, books and kind of [cut it in] (ph). It looks real familiar. </p>

<p>Anyway, where should I begin now? I really don't know at all how to go about getting into what I want to get into. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Usually the best thing is just to start off with whatever is sort of hot on your mind. 0:02:26.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess what's on my mind is just I feel so weird about my partner.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that whole thing and that was kind of closer like. Before it was like tenth weekend I wouldn't, couldn't - wasn't really expected to think about moving out too much. (Inaudible at 3:11) was to consider it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because you sort of shut it out of your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I shut it out because it was some (ph) weekend and to have to deal with it and now to think it's getting over and here comes Christmas vacation, and then next quarter is going to start and it's going to have to be whether I'm going to live there next quarter or not and I'll have to like face them. There's this funny thing that I don't want to move but - and I can't understand why - I start getting upset because I don't want to move and I think like if I think about it intellectually through all these people and I'm getting all sorts of negative energy from them and I'm sitting there laughing it up. 0:03:59.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you want to cling to them. You want to cling to them; you don't want to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the thing is I'm not clinging now really, and I feel a lot more independent, but still there's some - that doesn't make sense in some way because I'm really still there. I mean I feel - like it doesn't get me all upset if Diane is really a bitch to me in the morning and leaves the house before I walk to school with her. I mean that doesn't bother me at all. It's getting to the point where in some way I'm unhappy enough about all the encounters so that I'd rather not encounter them that much, but it's something directly contradictory to that in living there and I still want to live there. I mean so far I haven't separated it in my head. And every...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have the perspective of wanting to live there and the perspective that I'd like to get away from you people and dealing with you people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Let me see. I guess what I mean is in some abstract way I want to live there, but something in my gut that doesn't want to move anywhere that wants to come home there... But on the other hand, since in all the encounters I've had have been icky I can spend more time away from there. I used to have to come home all the time and like I didn't want to go over to his house as much as I wanted to go back there, just to make sure that I knew what was going on, and now I feel fine about - I don't feel as compelled to be there or know what's happening to everybody there, but I still miss the funny way. I just won't have that my base, have...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean more separate from it but still...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, more separate from it but still... 0:06:13.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wanting to keep a connection.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but the thing is I think that somehow I mean that would be okay if it was okay with them. That's the other thing is I feel like when I realize that I really do want to stay there, I run into realizing that the reason I was going to leave was more because they wanted me to leave and not because of me. And it was still - it was the same old story.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was a clinging, but in an opposite way. It was clinging to what they thought I should do. Yeah, so I don't know whether I should do what I intellectually think would be the right thing to do, which is hunt for another place to live or whether I should follow how I'm really feeling about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know which way I'm going to be more miserable, which is basically what I don't want to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. This kind of feel about it is it's crappy but you want to stay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I also in some real way just can't give up the feeling that will we be able to work it out. I guess because in my family, whatever has happened, we've always worked it out and we're always really close, no matter what any of us have gone through, and that's like a real solid [thing in a bottle] (ph) where our family is to working stuff out and I can't... </p>

<p>And somehow - you know, both of Colin and Georgia said that they thought it would be easier working it out with me and I wasn't living there, and that sounds theoretically true maybe because then they wouldn't have to deal with me all the time and they wouldn't have to be just [day to day] (ph) annoyed, you know, or whatever it is that they feel that they get. 0:08:15.5</p>

<p>That's the other thing, though, that's really crappy is that we're in a social situation where we're with a bunch of people who I know and who are friends of mine or who are people who like me, they're really nice. They just turn all sugary and sweet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gollen (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's gollen (ph) how sugary they turn.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, they get really angry because I mean I understand the game they're playing. I mean if they don't like me then it shouldn't be this blanket thing, but they shouldn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of all of a sudden start treating you nice because people are around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I mean there's a real dishonest, that I can't handle that, but at the same time I don't feel like I have the nerve to tell them about that, to say "Fuck you then," which is...</p>

<p>When the whole thing began, I mean like this whole started ten weeks ago, and that's when I was really upset because there was nothing that I couldn't handle and I was constantly talking about it and crying and having nightmares and stuff, and now I feel less immediately upset by it, but it just is basically untogether thing that I have to deal with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it was making me feel pretty crazy at points, and I have dreams about conversations and not knowing whether they happened or not, you know, and I'd act like they did and then realize that they hadn't or it had all been something that I thought would happen, and I was really dealing with it. I mean I was like losing that difference between what was and what - I mean what had happened and what hadn't happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's like there's some kind of tie that goes deeper than whether you're getting along or whether they're being shitty to you or anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I might be the only one who feels that, which is a scary thing about it, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scary because...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just because I'll be caring for them and risking more in my care than they'll be feeling about me, so my investment's a whole bunch bigger and that's always scary if there's a potential...</p>

<p>And the other thing is I feel like I'm being used as a scapegoat in a lot of ways. Because one day Jen and I will have a really fine time, and then later that night I'll come home and she'll just, without having had any other interchange but a really nice one during the day, she'll just be really shitty. And it's kind of like if anything's wrong in the apartment, if somebody drank up all the milk, everybody comes screaming out, "Was it you," and it wasn't; I've been real conscientious. And I'm a good like - you know, I'm a really responsible member of the household when it comes to like shopping and cleaning up and washing dishes, but somehow I'm the one who is - I mean the blame just automatically shifts in my direction. I can say this all now but I can't say it to them. 0:12:08.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What stops you there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of - whenever I do talk to them it's really hard for me to hold onto how I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like how they see it sort of washes over you or colors what you're feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Also, some of it is just because there are three of them and one of me and their three arguments are three points to my one and when they - the last talk we had was good. And if I'm at the top line to one, I'm fine, because then none of them can call me, but somehow it's a whole apartment entity, then I just feel picked on, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's when three of them are turning on you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And at one-to-one I'm fine with each of them and I've had really honest talks where I've been able to tell them that I'm angry and tell them why and them being able to deal with it, you know, instead of being defensive or instead of me being timid or whatever. </p>

<p>And Tanya just doesn't even say anything to me anymore. She'll walk in the door and I'll say hello and she won't say anything, all day long, you know. Like I was sitting there yesterday; she'd be in the apartment and not say anything and I'm really scared to ask her, why aren't you treating me like a person? I mean she wouldn't do that to anybody. You know, you don't ignore someone's total existence, especially if you're in the same house with them, and she's not even pleasant in a superficial way. 0:13:57.6</p>

<p>I think the thing that happened that washes over is that I start getting more timid with everybody. Like I have other friends outside of that whole group. But my friend Holly caught me the other day; she said something about - I don't know what it was, but at some point I like asked if I could come over, you know, kind of asked it kind of timidly would it be okay if I came over, which is how we deal with each other or friends. We just, "Hey, you want to come over?" "Sure, I'll be over at 8." And she comes and like "What are you doing?" And I realized that I'd been getting a whole much more insecure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You weren't sure that you were welcome with anyone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I guess it's really hard because it just comes out to being really hard to get some idea of who I am, because some people have - I mean what I feel seems different as I come on to them. It seems different just as I come on to my other friends, and real different than how my parents feel and really different than... 0:16:37.7</p>

<p>Like my sister called up. Yesterday when I was feeling shitty she called from California, and all the point (ph) last night I was feeling really down, and she called just then and she gave me this whole rap about what... I had just written her a letter a week ago or something when I was in a really good mood and I wrote a really nice letter. And she called up to tell me that I was just the closest person in the world to her and one of the most incredible women she knew and just this really spirit loving... </p>

<p>It made me feel warm in a basic way in that I was, you know, getting this really close relationship with her. You know, we've had troubles because we've been rivals and stuff like that, and we don't feel that kind of competition anymore, but on the other hand, I couldn't fit it in to how I was feeling, because there was this person saying I was all these great things while I was sitting in this puddle of people telling me I was a shit, you know, and it was really confusing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would almost make more sense if she told you that you were a shit, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I don't know if I'd like it. You know, in some way I'm glad she didn't but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Perhaps it's almost like an additional pressure, because like if she feels you're not a shit, well, then you want to be sort of stronger in the face of the other people who do. 0:18:10.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah. It all comes down to I want it really bad. I mean I want to move out of the situation. Not literally move out, I guess, but I want to like have it change, and I don't know how to do that fast, and somehow I want somebody to tell me is somebody up there, or somebody who is a (inaudible at 18:41) and he knows what's going on or would have some kind of idea than I do to tell me what would be the right thing to do to get what it is that I want, you know, which I guess can't be done but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what you want is to sort of work it out so that you have the best relationship with them possible. Well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's the thing I keep on running into? I was trying to figure out if I wanted to be with them more than have a good relationship with them, I mean if I wanted to live with them in a kind of - oh, I don't know. I guess I can't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was just the... (inaudible at 19:51) and still sort of keep some kind of sense of your own self or something and not as in to let them make you insecure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can you do that? I mean that's the thing that I run into is - no, I guess they're just (inaudible at 20:16) always this continuum, you know, of this self-definition and some people I mean like you can - I don't know. I'm obviously not defining myself or am letting them do it, because I'm around them, I feel more shitty. I don't know. 0:20:49.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And feeling like you shouldn't or something like, like that's crappy and you want to be strong enough not to. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, that's huge. That's a huge part of it, but I don't know how to get to that place where they don't affect me very much, because on the other hand, like... At least it has something to do with getting your center more inside than outside, but I don't know how you - I don't know how you can try to do that. I mean I've always been really involved with how other people saw me, other directive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's obviously not a comfortable place to be, because then I feel really volatile around them or around some people and I feel really good about myself when I'm around other people and then I feel lousy about myself. And I think... And that's getting less true. Like I'm getting harder, I'm feeling less bad at home when they're shitty to me, but I don't know if I'm really dealing with that. I think I'm just like building up walls, you know. 0:22:30.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't want to be a wall builder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you want to be centered in yourself but still open.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think somehow I would like to be in a group therapy thing with them if they're going to make that come out of me. That's flashes that I would like to... I would like all of us to be in some kind of therapy in a recestoration (ph) so I could see what was going on with them, because lots of times I think, you know, how I've - what they say is like colored by my own paranoia, you know, like I just get really paranoid so I say something and I interpret it to be something worse than it is. And I think that they do really just ridiculous things to me sometimes, and it would be really nice to have somebody else besides me point it out to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? So they wouldn't just say, well, and that's just because you're whoever you are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because you get dismissed and you get brushed off. They don't pay any attention to what you say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But then I don't think they'd care enough to do that; that's the other half of it. 0:24:03.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that hurts you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you'd like them to care about you very much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And somehow I guess connected to living there is making them care about me, although rationally it doesn't do that, you know. All it does is makes them angry at me. Maybe living there - well, maybe why I was scared and not living there is because they won't deal with me at all. I'll just be like a somewhat bad memory from first quarter. But somehow living there they can't dismiss me when I have to be a constant prowl - I mean I have to be at least a constant something for them to deal with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's a problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 25:22) cutting them off entirely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When someone's okay, good about myself, and they were being shitty to me (inaudible at 25:38). I don't understand. I guess I should have brought my notebook with me. I wrote it down just fine and then how I felt it. I try to figure out how they can - I don't know. Maybe this will sound funny, but how they can like live without me or something, you know, because they're so important to me I kind of wonder how they can be... 0:26:14.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think maybe I'm getting what you're saying, that it couldn't be so one-sided. It doesn't seem right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess the other thing is I just feel like it sometimes grows into this disproportionate thing, like my carrying for them, like somehow... 0:28:20.0</p>

<p>Well, I know it's true with Jen, like somehow that when she doesn't like me she's a whole bunch more important to me. That's not true with Diane, because there's something basically real fine I think (inaudible at 28:34) like there's something honest and good and healthy, or at least there was. But with (inaudible at 28:43)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want it when you've got it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, it's not true. I'm real glad when I have it and it turns out to be friendly with somebody and do stuff and interested in her life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not - [for her this is] (ph) a big deal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But when she's icky it just grows and I mean she like - it becomes super important for me, for it not to be that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I have to start wondering about it, because then just like my reasons [for the group] (ph) being close to her are wrong reasons, because she's more important to me than when she doesn't like me than when she does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the icky there. I mean it's just not very much - something real egocentric and not enough having to do with her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was just thinking how much you'd like to be taking in. That would be just wonderful. 0:30:23.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, they keep on hoping I'll all of a sudden come back after Christmas vacation, and I feel like basically I'm not that icky, so that my ickiness is mostly a reaction to their thinking I'm icky and then I get into this insecure thing and then I do act icky. So I'm thinking if they came home with this sort of non-icky feeling about me in their gut and they just like started treating me like they used to or just regularly or not hostilely, then everything would be fine, I mean, but that's another thing and it totally depends on them instead of me. And it's totally that if they... I mean they're not master of my fate anymore. They're the ones who are saying...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I also don't want to live my life that way, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you hadn't really (inaudible at 31:38).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then another just - I don't know. I've one really good friend whose name is John, and he's like one really good thing and he's - I just got to be friends with him this quarter and he's somebody that I think is just really insightful and just a super fine person. He's not a friend of theirs at all. And it's one of the first good relationships that I've had with a guy that's - I mean I'm friends with him and I'm really friends and it's not... Because usually it's either sexual and there are lots of, I don't know. 0:32:39.7 </p>

<p>I don't know, but he just told me yesterday. I had [doing some med at all] (ph) night that his mother just committed suicide and his mother's not in the hospital with a nerve thingie; he doesn't really recall his name, and somehow that really affected me, that he didn't remember John at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was his mother. And somehow I woke up and thought that had to do with Diane.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How could she forget me when we've had all this? What we've had was the kind of thing that can't be broken.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's like a father and a son.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I don't feel like that's the type of relationship it was, but I mean just the closeness and happiness between fathers and sons. 0:33:46.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's all of a sudden you're losing a time that seemed sort of deep and lasting and permanent and inquiring.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Each one of those words are exactly right, the emis (ph). The thing is I can't reconcile how different my head and my gut feel about it, I mean how far (inaudible at 35:13) together, how much I really want to live there and how really stupid it is if I'm going to sell - seem to keep anything with them. And I guess what I keep on asking is for somebody to tell me that I should (inaudible at 35:31).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Maybe it's not so stupid, you know? Like maybe you're right, that like you're (inaudible at 35:41) completely if you're going to move out, you know. There won't be a real move.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now what do I do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It looked like it made you really wince to think about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I can't - I mean it's almost incomprehensible. I mean I can't imagine being in New York - I mean I live in New York and I don't know why that's not an immediate reaction, but my immediate reaction is if that was true I would just leave. 0:36:14.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like something - kind of death or something xx.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, just a kind of death all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it isn't true. That was exactly right when I said it, and that there's something right around there somewhere. I don't know what else to say about it more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what comes to me on it is, no, I won't stand that, no. Like I get that as I believe she [complimented him] (ph). 0:38:06.7 </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's really like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were desperate and frantic and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's something that's something even quieter and harder than that, too, underneath the desperate and franticness or be just this feeling of lack of trust or something in people then. If the person that I felt closest to for so long could just do that, they'd like cancel me a peruniverse (ph) like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like I got that you were saying softly, and I must never trust anyone, I guess I can't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that's probably one of the scariest things that's riding underneath the whole thing. 0:39:58.7</p>

<p>What's that?</p>

<p>I guess what compounds it and makes it worse, makes you think of the (inaudible at 41:58) is - actually I work real hard to put it out of my head - is the one guy that I've lived with in my life, a boy named John, different John - I always pick John so... That boy I lived with last year this time, I mean right around this time of the year in the fall intermer (ph), he's having like - well, it's not an engagement party, but there's a party for him and his girl that he's going to marry and it's today in Washington (inaudible at 43:37) and he was my - he's been my other best friend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:43:49.4 </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just found out about it over the political (ph) break. I went to the corridor (ph) to visit. And it's always been really uncertain whether - say I left him in the springtime, right before spring last year and came back to school, because I was getting scared because he was too important to me. So my reaction to that was just to leave and go back to Diane, which for some reason wasn't so scary, and it really was to go back to Diane.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's okay maybe then to go back to Diane, but now not to have anyone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's really funny how jealous I am of friendships and when I - and real aware of them too. Not jealous in an icky way, but not jealous terribly, horribly, excruciatingly, but just kind of like how much I want that and when I see other people have it this time it's hang (ph), well, I really want it too. 0:45:45.6</p>

<p>It's really funny. I put John completely out of my head for the past couple... I guess I just saw him about six weeks ago or seven weeks ago, and it was... Except for he hasn't rejected me in the same way Diane has because he really loves me and I knew that. But still in a way I've lost him the same, you know... Also, because his wife doesn't like me at all, his last wife.</p>

<p>And the other - and a third person in my life that I've been closest to, a boy who's still here, his name is Marco, who is my closest friend; we were never lovers but he is my closest friend. We just stay away from each other. It's kind of an expressed understanding that we can't do it with each other or something. So it's just like the three most important people are kind of all involved because they can't deal with me or something or I don't know. I don't know if I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you do to lose them all or something? It's almost as if you're asking yourself that or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the other thing is that I - somewhere in me there's this [stillness remanent] (ph) of this confident feeling about who I am, you know? But then all the reaction to me I've been getting would make that seem just this totally false idea I have of myself. 0:48:30.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't wait until I'm not adolescent anymore or whatever this whole thing is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Until you get out of this and feel sort of firm and strong and confident and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. When will that happen, goddamn it? My 20th birthday is in a month.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you talk it sounds like some kind of - something that you're rebelling against. Like this isn't the way it should be, this isn't the way it ought to be, when is it going to right itself. 0:50:11.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, yeah. I don't... For me this is something that's like super permanent and I'm always going to be unhappy or always going to be feeling that way.</p>

<p>It's the [caring stuff] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like when I come down with a cold sometimes and it's an annoying intrusion and when is it going to go away. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's been that for a couple of years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, feeling insecure you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's funny because I won't... If I was like to... It's like walking into completely unknown situation, I'm really fine. Like I always travel a lot; that's what I've been doing. I took time off school last year and I spent all the summers, since I was 15, traveling alone. 0:52:01.7 </p>

<p>And I really - and I'm very confident entering group for the first time or walking into a situation or going to a new city where I don't know anybody, which is so contradictory because it's - I guess it's one side of like - and because I guess I connect with people that I don't - like the people that I don't have so much of an investment in and people that I don't care as much about. I'm just a whole bunch more honest, just because it doesn't cost so much to me or I haven't invested anything already in it and I'm... Because I'd be like the [scrounge is a gregarious] (ph) person, but when I'm around my house with the people feeling the way they do about me I mean any ugarousness (ph) I have is really hollow and it's obviously hollow, or I just get really uptight and it's just... And I guess that I'm all worried about the people that I'm worried about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And also the situation is botched up already; you're not starting from scratch.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Also somewhere I want to know if it's my fault or their fault, you know? And I know it can't really be either. I mean I know it's got to be from all my Heidiger (ph) and whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's like it would be a relief to know and not like you would say they botched me up in my home or something, or they botched me up and ah, what a shame, or even I didn't not work on that. There's something about umm...0:54:19.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should go. Where are you going for Christmas?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kansas City.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you going on vacation too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but only for a week. I leave and go to Washington, D.C. tomorrow I think and visit my friend Holly, because I was hearing she wanted me to see her world in Washington, D.C. where she came from and just be a real nice thing to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll be back by the 26th.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I won't be back until the 30th. We could try and fit two appointments in that week, or we could just do one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When is the 30th?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a Wednesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why don't we see then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or is your schedule real full?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a friend from out of town who is going to be leaving late Wednesday afternoon so I'm going to spend a lot of Wednesday day with him I think, but I could probably see you later in the afternoon or (inaudible at 55:56) call you and see what's what if you'd like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if he's leaving why don't we do it after he's gone?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that way you won't feel - I mean otherwise you'll feel like you'd rather, of course, be like doing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, sure, no. We can make it Thursday, probably.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to get in touch then or do you want to make a time now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why don't we make a time now and that can be subject to change?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, okay, good. Well, how about 3:30?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. 0:56:32.4 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Do you have my phone number?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not (inaudible at 56:40). Where do you live?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 48th and Westminster.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see obviously my other appointment slipped past.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somehow you really remind me of somebody, but I don't know who he is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've been keeping around Central Park a lot of time. I think I pick up some general Central Park girl characteristics so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You think bright and absent-minded?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if that's a general Central Park girl characteristic but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did you make these?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I did do (inaudible at 57:42).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, far out. That's one of the things that I really want to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 57:50)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, they're really nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thanks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did you do the glazes too?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I put them on. Somebody else (inaudible at 58:02) them up because they had the recipes and stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you can just write it down. I don't know why, it may sound off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, it makes a difference with the second coat. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're right. I can tell him myself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Did you make this one too?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I didn't make that.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. (inaudible at 00:00:09) Well actually, yeah. That's a lie. So I got in touch with the other therapist, for couple's, and I have to, she said that, well she's out of network too so like I have to change everything anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that she'd be willing to meet with us and get started anyway and that's fine. Like I explained to her the open enrollment thing and so I'm going to do that and told her about you and you agreed or whatever and I'm, I'm like feeling like nervous about because I'm not really sure what to expect. I don't want it to turn into a tattle tale session and I don't want it to turn into like, I feel more comfortable saying something in that scenario that maybe I haven't said to him before and then afterwards it's like, "I can't believe you haven't told me that before. Da, da, da, da, da." You know? [00:00:59]</p>

<p>So I'm just going to have to like play it by ear and like... Like I'm not even sure like... I mean, I guess she would probably help lead it like, you know, like. Because like I wouldn't even know where to start. (LAUGHTER) Like, "Why are you here?" Well, let me count the ways. So we'll be doing that at some point, hopefully next week. I have to call her back today to make an appointment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me... I may talk to her...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...in the next week or so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want me to give her a little background or do you want to wait and give that to her yourselves when you're there? I mean, it's up to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you can. I think it might be helpful in terms of... Just in case like I'm not, I don't explain it or like... I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess really what I'm asking for is like permission to talk to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. Obviously. No I think yes. That would be good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I mean I'm going to talk to her about some other things (inaudible at 00:01:53).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I think it would be important for her not to necessarily mention, "So, by the way, Trina's (ph) therapist told me, 'blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,' so I already know this." But like it might help her... [00:02:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:02:03) I wouldn't do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) ...in terms of hearing our story. Yeah, I think would like make (inaudible at 00:02:07) feel really uncomfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:02:10)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So okay, we're going to do that. Like his behavior is just typical like of just how he keeps acting and he had made a plan to go grocery shopping together this weekend because we both need to grocery shop and like it would be helpful for him because he doesn't have a car and he can buy more groceries or whatever. And he had said it to me and framed it like... And, you know, we had always had a nice time shopping together. Which is true like we enjoy doing grocery shopping together. And so I was like, "Okay. That sounds good." Then today I'm like, "Hey. Is it okay if we do grocery shopping tomorrow instead of Sunday?" Like, blah, blah, blah, whatever. And he was like, "Yeah," and then he was like, "I might just, I might just do it after work. I would just go after work." And I was like, "Alright. Like, alright. Like, okay." And then he was like, "Well. I don't know." [00:02:57]</p>

<p>And then I was like, "I mean, you know, like you said, like I just thought it would be nice. Like you could get more stuff. Like, it'd be some, you know, a way to spend some time together." And then he says that doesn't want that to be the way that we're spending time together and that he doesn't want to be like doing errands and so unless we're like actually making a plan then like he doesn't want that to be thought of as spending time together. Which is so stupid. Because like it's still spending time together. Like, it doesn't fucking... Like nobody's saying, "This is in lieu of like a date for the next month." Like... So... And then he was like, "Well, no, I still really..." And then he like gets this, puts a sad face and he's like, "I'd still really like to go tomorrow." I'm like, "Okay. Psycho." And then he's like, "We'll talk about this issue in therapy." Like... So I'm like, "Alright. That's fine." (LAUGHTER) Good. (PAUSE) In the meantime, I spoke to my mother this morning and she's been sick like kind of similar to what I'd been sick with. [00:04:01]</p>

<p>So she's been sick for quite a while now too. She's also sick with my brother living at our house and being just a complete mess. He started dating this girl. Dating, I don't know. Seeing. Who's like, who's my age, I guess. And they probably met at like the bar that they both go to. And then they were going to, she was going to be a roommate in the apartment then it didn't work out. Whatever. He moved in with my mom. She had to move out of her apartment. So she ended up moving in with this, some guy, some 47 year old like professor who she like knows from the bar and who she used to live with or date or something, who's like a drug addict alcoholic. And Michael's (ph) heartbroken. She's still stringing him along. Like, he's all depressed and has his mental health issues and his addictions and all that stuff. And then I guess the other night, my mom was sleeping during all this but he told her after. Well no, first, first he got admitted to or admitted himself to a dual day program for addiction and mental health at the whatever. [00:05:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like the insurance is covering it. Great. You know? It's a two week program. Okay. So he like went already a couple days I guess it just started. And then this thing happens with this girl the other night where she calls him and she's depressed and she's going to kill herself and she's going to take overdose of her Xanax and her sleeping pills. She has these medications. She's at the guy's house like with the guy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I guess they get off the phone, something, my brother can't reach her. He goes to the apartment to come into the guy drunk and high off his ass, naked, like, "She's fine." She's unconscious with like barely a pulse. Apparently, like she had gone ahead and taken these pills. And so he had to call the ambulance and they did CPR and she was in the ICU. Like he saved this girl's life. So, not only... I mean, it's traumatic on like so many levels for this guy. [00:05:59]</p>

<p>Like, not only does he have his own issues, so like now, and then he's dealing with this. He's already like, you know, like falling for this girl but she's like not really there. She has her own mental health issues. He shouldn't be messing with somebody like that. And then, he almost witnessed like somebody that he cared about death and had to be there for the whole thing went to the hospital and everything. Right? So, I guess, yesterday he spent the whole day like weeping and just being awful. Like just feeling horrible and didn't go to the program and then last night, my mom, he was like had diarrhea or something all night, he said to my mom. And so he was in bed this morning, not at the program. And it's literally... She lives on the east side. Like it's across the street.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I know where that is. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (SIGH) So, and then I was like... She was like, " But, you know, you have your own problems so I don't want you to worry about this." And I'm like, "Well, that's true. But to the same extent, like, it's really upsetting."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really, really upsetting. I mean, like, okay, if we're going to go ahead with he has like, he has mental health, like more severe than we really knew or than they ever were. [00:07:03]</p>

<p>Then okay. But like, he's messing with this awful girl. I mean, whatever, not awful, but, you know, whatever, poor thing. But like, a girl with issues. He has his own issues. He had to save her life like... This is, I mean, he's, he's on the brink of doing something stupid like that like... To be dealing with somebody that goes ahead and just tries it, and this guy... I mean, the whole... I can't even imagine what a nightmarish like scenario that is to come into, you know, and he's drunk and, "Oh. She's fine. She's just sleeping." She's unconscious. Like, hardly a pulse. So, that's upsetting me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:07:41)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's hard to know what to say to my mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You must be really worried and upset for both of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah exactly. And you know, he did even like an inpatient thing. Like a little while, like maybe six months ago or something. And like that didn't seem to stick and like he's still smoking pot. He's still drinking. He's still smoking cigarettes. He says that the pot will be that last to go when really it should be the cigarettes. [0:08:03]</p>

<p>But, okay, we all know how addicts are with their cigarettes. And, like the drinking I guess is what I guess they're, he'd doing the AA and the individual and the group and whatever in the program supposed to be. And, but I just feel like it's just so tiring and my mom is so tired and she wants her life back and her son back. And it, I wish like I could do something. And I just feel really powerless. And then I said to (inaudible at 00:08:29), "Oh. I just got off the phone with my mom and Michael is doing really, really badly and it's, it's very upsetting." And he literally responds, "That sucks." That was his response and that was it. No questions about what happened...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...how are you feeling...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...what's going on?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What kinds of things? Nothing. And, like I was... I mean, I just don't understand like why he wouldn't care to like say anything further or like think that it would matter. [00:09:07]</p>

<p>Like, that's fucked up. Whenever he has any fucking issue, like his back hurts, I'm like, "Oh, that's really... I'm really sorry. Like I feel bad. Like oh... You know, have you tried this? Have you tried that?" Like or whatever, an issue with a friend or whatever. I mean... And he can't even give me the time of day? And I'm talking about my brother and he knows the back story and how upsetting this thing is for our whole family. And it kind if just felt like a big "fuck you." Like you're the one holding me, you know, taking all this time and decision so like I can't act however I want basically. So, like it just kind of added to the like being upset. Like I was hoping that he could maybe...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...he could be comforting, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that's like what he should be there for, I think...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...if he wants to have a relationship with me and he just wasn't. So it kind of told me a lot more than... [00:10:01]</p>

<p>It just added to the many things that I'm kind of realizing or like stepping out of, you know, denial about or whatever. And yeah. And then like, in thinking about the couples therapy, I just don't... I'm, I'm concerned about like... I'm just concerned about saying stuff. Like, for instance, if I bring that up, like, "It really upset me when you..." Like, I just don't know... It's just all about not knowing if things are really going to ever change. Like I think that's like the main reasons I'm like nervous about this. Like is it going to be like fruitless? Is it going to be like almost wasted effort? Which it is looking like it might be. But like I still feel inclined to do it. And... Or like telling him that I was upset that he friended some girl that requested him and then was chatting with her and accepted an offer to go to drinks. [00:11:03]</p>

<p>Like... I don't know. (PAUSE) It's just very, it's just a lot to deal with and then like talking about the fucking groceries and, "I don't want to spend time like that together." Like really? Like, he was the one that said it. Like, "Oh. I used to love going grocery shopping with you. Maybe that's something we can still do together." Like... I mean, grocery shopping is like a good two hours out of your day, like all round trip. Like, that's like longer than some dates that we go on, you know? But he was like, "No. It doesn't count." Like it's just like, he's like, "Well, no. That's not your get out of jail free, okay hang out with me and the next a couple of days ticket." Like... Which is like so ridiculous because that's not how I was looking at it. Now I'm like, "I don't want to go on a date with you any time soon after that because you're an ass and you're acting like an ass," and that's what he... (PAUSE) [00:12:07]</p>

<p>I went, I went to my friend Becka's house last night for dinner and wine and we were talking about this whole situation and she's like, you know, like, "Obviously you have to do what you have to do but like all these things, Trina that we've..." And she, okay Becka and I used to work with at the hotel and she was the other sales manager along with me. (inaudible at 00:12:41) So she saw this relationship developing from the very beginning because I started dating Franklin when I started there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Working with Becka. And so she was there for like the whole Angelina stuff in the beginning and, you know, dealing with girls on his Facebook page and stuff. She knew all of this. That was from the beginning. [00:13:01]</p>

<p>And so her thing is, "Like, you know, you've tried so hard for how long now and like, we now how it started." Like... She saw that I like, was like upset about stuff from the beginning and is like, "Honestly? He is still doing that shit. Like he, how can you, how can I think he'll ever stop? Like..." And I'm like, "I know. Like, I know all this. Like, I know it." It's just like taking that leap, I guess, that's so difficult. And, you know, the cats like aren't really sure what the... I don't know. It's very tiring to deal with this man. (PAUSE) I just don't understand his thinking. Like I just don't... I don't understand his brain, how it works that he thinks it's okay to do the things that he does and say the things that he does and... I don't know. (PAUSE) [00:14:07]</p>

<p>And like so this weekend I have like literally my whole weekend is filled up with plans. Like today I'm having dinner with my family then going out for drinks with my friend Stephanie. Then tomorrow we're grocery shopping together. Fine. And then I have like a bunch of errands and homework to do. And then I'm going out to dinner with my friend Sandra (ph) at night. And I might go out for drinks, blah, blah, blah. All this stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like just know that I'm going to like hear guilt trips. Like, "Oh I just wish I could see you." Like instead of respecting the fact that I have a full weekend and like, being like, "That's awesome. Enjoy hanging out with your friends." And I guess... So yeah I guess he went to therapy on Wednesday night and he had a good session and he's going to keep seeing the guy once a week and whatever. But it seems like the things that he like says that he's says that he's talking about with him are like working on his friendship stuff and like working on like being more social and all that. [00:15:14]</p>

<p>And, but like, I don't understand because like then he's still, when he's talking to me it's, "I don't want to hang out with anybody. I'm just going to go home. I don't want to do anything. You know, I'll... You know, I'm not going to whatever." I don't know. I don't know what his, what the like... And he says like, "Oh. When we were talking about our relationship and..." But I just don't know what he's talking about because clearly like things are not really changing all that much in terms of his behavior and how he treats me. I think I'm just pissed. Like it was the kicker this morning with the "that sucks" comment about my brother. Like it's really insensitive. You know? He didn't just... And like I'm sure if I bring it up, it'll probably be like, "Well, I mean, you didn't give, say anything else about it so I just figured you didn't want to talk about it." [00:16:09]</p>

<p>And like but that's not the point. That's not the point. The point is that you could have said, like, "Do you want to talk about it?" And I could have said no. And then we could have dropped it. But to just say, "That sucks," and leave it at that... And like so I responded. I was like, "Yeah. It does." It just really made me upset. (PAUSE) Like people I don't even know would care more like than that. Like my office mate kind of heard the conversation and was like, "Is everything okay?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, "How's your brother?" You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't even know him or my mom or anything. (PAUSE) Meanwhile like... I don't know if I mentioned that there's something that like my cat's lost a lot of blood and (inaudible) kind of... [00:17:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Is that the one you're taking in for an expensive visit of some kind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I made the decision. I spoke to my mom about the echocardiogram (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We decided that I'm not going to do that right now. Because, you know, she has had more experience with pets than I have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's like, "They can really guilt you into doing these expensive procedures because it is precautionary. But, you know, if you don't have the money for it right now like you... And, you know there's nothing like, he's not seizing or he's not..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. "Then I would say to hold off." And so I took her advice because (inaudible) then they say, "Well his heart murmur is fine and everything looks fine. But you should give him this medicine once a week because it'll help with the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." And then there's another fifty dollars a week or whatever it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that's what I'm going to do is I'm going to load up on good pet food, like good cat food and get some like light cat food for the fatty because she's gained a ton of weight. [00:18:05]</p>

<p>Like she's a little fat girl. And get her the diet food, keep feeding them separately. I mean it's, it's more work than... Like some people that have multiple cats can just like put the food out...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and like nobody fights over food and they eat their food and that's it. But like, it's now like more, like I have to be, like I can't just put the food and leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to be there because I have to lock one up in a room and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and give the guy more food and give him like the fatty food. Yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like, so that's what I'm going to do and I'm a little nervous about the decision just because like God forbid something is really wrong. But I think that if I give it a few weeks and weigh him and see that he's gaining a little bit...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you'll be good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...then I'll feel better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Because like on my scale, he was twelve pounds when, when I weighed him before I went to the vet. They have the same weight but like she's so much fatter. Like I don't, I think she has smaller frame, maybe, like smaller boned.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:19:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was just funny. They're the same exact weight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she has like this huge stomach. (inaudible) (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean like, it does feel a little better not to have to think about like that expense and how to get that money and whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially after the $200 vet appointment. And now I'm just going to hope that he'll start gaining weight and, and... I mean, even in the last couple days I've been feeding him a little bit more and he's like not been begging for food as much and not like as like agitated when I come in the door like to get fed right away. Even left some like little crumbs, which is another issue because then it's like I have to be throwing out some cat food because I can't leave that because then she'll go eat it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I can't leave it for him to eat later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have to throw out whatever's left over. I can't like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I supposed I could store it in the fridge with like Saran Wrap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know, hopefully he'll gain weight and then I won't have to do this expensive procedure and, you know, whatever. [00:20:01]</p>

<p>And if he doesn't, then I will and, you know, I want to make sure that I take care of the things that I can. But, you know... And, and oh. Did I tell you? This is another thing that I was telling Becka. Like, so I had told him on Monday... I don't know if I mentioned this, about the Weight Watchers, about like doing well on my Weight Watchers? Okay. So me and Amanda (ph) decided on Monday... Amanda is like my best friend (inaudible). She is also on Weight Watchers now. Although she gets like double the points because she's breast feeding. I'm like, "Okay. I guess that's how it works." And so we said okay. We, got, we didn't lose, I guess we both gained a pound like last week. So we were like, "Okay, teamwork." Like, not, don't use weekly points at all. Just use your daily points. Like and you know, if you use weeklies, use only a couple. So, I then like got depressed on Monday after this like big think about (inaudible) him telling me like he's starting not to miss me and that whole thing. [00:21:00]</p>

<p>And, like ate everything in the world. Right? So like I ate all my weekly. Like done. Because like there was an event. There was empanadas and I had pizza. Like it was just not good. So then on Tuesday, he like came over after practice and he was, he was hungry so I like gave him some leftover empanadas and some cheese and crackers or whatever. And then he like finished one of the empanadas and he was like, "Oh, I can't eat this other half. Do you want it?" ? I can't. I ate like all my... I like did so much eating today." And he was like, "Aww." And I'm like, "What?" And he's like, "Well, you failed. I don't want you to fail." And I was like, "Um thanks?" Like... I obviously wasn't like, "I ate all of my week! Like!" I was like, "I overate." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like so it's like, "What?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Was that supposed to be supporting? Is that the idea?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that doesn't. Like, that's not the kind of support I'm looking for. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Oh, you failed." Like, well I didn't fail. I just didn't achieve that one goal. Like, I could still lose weight. Like if I... Like, "Really dude?" Like, "Oh, you failed." And then I was like, "Hmm. Should I list the things that you're failing in? Like do we want to talk about the things that you failed?" I don't think he started studying for anything. Like it's all the same shit. It's like the same shit, different day. I don't know what he's going to, what's going to come out in this couples therapy, whatever, how many sessions we do. And I don't know what he's going to bring up that maybe I don't know about. I, there are some things I can't even bring up because it's just like, "So, I hate your family." He can't do anything about that. A therapist can't help us with that. Like, she can help us deal, if we decide to move forward, help, help us deal with it together. Not with my. I can't be like, "Oh, I'm afraid like he's never going to make enough money." Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:23:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I mean like yes, I'll do the shopping with him tomorrow, that's fine. But then after that, I am looking forward to just kind of going through my weekend and doing my thing, and, you know, not, it not being a big deal. Although at this point I'm really tempted to cancel the shopping like, "Fuck this." (inaudible at 00:23:25) Which I probably. Well, no. I don't know. Whatever. I do need groceries. But I almost feel like he doesn't deserve to like spend time with me like after acting like a jerk this whole week basically. (SIGH) And like even last night, he says that, you know, that he went out for drinks with his crew and then some other people met them there at a bar and like I'm thinking, I wonder, I don't even believe him like, I'm, of course like thinking that maybe he did go through with the plan with the random high school girl... [00:24:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...or whatever. Like. And I can't even like trust that. (PAUSE) And like I what's also frustrating is like I talk and talk and talk about this whether it's here, whether it's to my friends, whether it's in my own head, I talk, talk, talk, talk, talk to (inaudible), tried to be like supportive or upbeat or whatever. But like I'm not feeling any different like in terms of feeling better about things and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you feel kind of stuck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Right. (PAUSE) And like I don't really know how to, I don't know, manage that. (PAUSE) [00:25:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, here I guess I, I wonder if (PAUSE) you're hoping for some insight because that would be a crazy thing to hope for from therapy. But, you know, in fact, you kind of have all the cards in your hand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I kind of wonder if you're sort of saying all this hoping something new will come out of it or you'll have a new way to look at it or you'll be aware of new ways that you feel about it. When maybe it's not really an issue so much as (inaudible) look away from what you actually already know. Or hope that you'll not have to deal with what you actually already know about... [00:26:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...how remarkable this is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also how (PAUSE) I suspect devastating it would be to end it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and, you know, like in the same breath that like I think about... I'll think about these things like the good things about our relationship and then I'll get sad because I would miss that and then I think about the, and then like almost immediately like all the bad stuff comes rushing back and I'm like, "Well fuck that." You know, like screw him, you know? But then, when I do think about the things I would miss, like it's really difficult. It's really painful to think about things like... And then like be worried about, you know, what's going to be ruined because like that I used to enjoy with him and maybe I can't enjoy by myself or feel sad when I watch certain shows or see certain commercials that both made us both laugh or, you know, things like that and, you know, like thinking about the cats how like one of us is going to lose out like. I can't see like joint custody of cats being a healthy thing for like... [00:27:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...anybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:27:27)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I don't think it's not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not so much. Not children.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, that's sad too because, you know, if he wants the cats then I am not going to separate them and I'll, you know, if he really wants them, then I'll give them. But then, you know, if he says, "No, no," then I'm going to sad for him that he misses his cats because he really loves them. Like just all these things I think are what makes it so hard for me to really deal with the reality of how I feel about the relationship. [00:28:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm, I'm not sure how to work through that at this point. Like I've never really had to deal with like such a like, like with breaking up a relationship that's been this long or this intense and, you know, involved. So... So exactly, yeah. I mean, and there really isn't anything else, like you said, like there really aren't... Like I do know everything like that I think I would need to know. I just don't know how to like make that actual decision, I guess and... And then, I mean, I think that, you know, I'm hoping that as we go to couples therapy, maybe it'll even become clearer to him, like to us both that like there's just a lot of stuff that we're not on the same page about and, and possibly never will be. [00:29:00]</p>

<p>So, I mean like while the best scenario would be that it helps us actually work through some things and we realize, "Oh my God, we can." You know, any other case I guess it would just be talking about things, you know, if we talk about something and realize we can't like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, hard for you to imagine that, you know, with things like the (inaudible) and for these other things that you guys haven't been able to work it out and individual therapy doesn't seem to be helping and he doesn't express any sort of commitment to making those changes that couples therapy going (PAUSE) make a difference. I mean, in other words, couples therapy is very helpful, don't get me wrong, and could help the two of you sort out a lot of things between you but... [00:30:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Might not change the constants.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah there are things that, at least the best you can tell, are sort of clearly, clearly his own behaviors that, you know, you have both agreed at some times that he will work to change and he just doesn't. I don't think couples therapy is going to fix that. My point isn't that couples therapy won't help but...</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't seem like... It sounds to me like maybe you are. And I don't feel like you need me to tell you this because you don't know (inaudible) couples therapy. I think it's more like it would be really awesome if you went to couples therapy and he stopped doing these things or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [00:31:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...actually expressed a consistent interest in stopping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean, you know, because it, the way that I'm also looking at it is like, "Okay, I could go to couples therapy and I could said that, "It really made me upset that you refriended this woman I asked you to unfriend and then didn't and then made it, 'Oh not a big deal. You're making a bigger deal.'"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "And it upset me that you accepted a friend request from somebody you haven't seen in, you know ten, eleven, twelve years that you don't know and then even went as far as having a conversation and accepting an offer for a drink." You know, I don't think that me saying that to him in a setting with, you know, a therapist or, you know, somebody to kind of be a middle, a mediator of sorts. I don't think it will make him... (PAUSE) [00:32:00]</p>

<p>Like he's already done it. Like he's already done it after we've had the initial of how that kind of things makes me feel and why I don't want him to do it anymore. So to to repeat it again is not... I just can't understand why (inaudible) not like, "Oh. I forgot." Like, you know. And like I said, if I bring up the thing about the insensitive comment about my brother I promise you that he'll, you know, say, "Well, you didn't say anything else about it. Like, how am I supposed to know?" And I can't like change somebody's personality.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So... I mean (inaudible) I am curious to see like what it would be like and whatever and if it would be something that's worth it but I think that like I'm just inching closer and closer to just not being able to do this anymore and you know, making the decision to have to move on, however painful it's going to be. [00:33:05]</p>

<p>Like it just, I just can't see this working anymore. (PAUSE) It's like all depressed about separating the bills. Like... (PAUSE) And like I don't know why he has to act like, like, "Oh, I'm just going to go home or whatever. Like, I don't really want to do anything." And I'll even say to him like, "Oh really? Even if people are going out after practice like you don't?" And he's like, "No, no." But then he does and I'm really sure that he's not out like, "I really hate being here." Like he's smiling, he's laughing, he's flirting, he's dancing, he's chilling, like drinking. [00:34:0</p>

<p>And, and so like, is it just to make me feel bad? Is it just to make me feel bad for him, make me feel bad that I have my own plans and he's just going to go home. Like I don't... It's weird behavior to me. I mean, I don't think it's weird in terms of characteristic of him but like it's just more and more like, like, like I can't, I'm not less and less sympathetic to it, less and less, you know, compassionate towards those kinds of reactions and more, more just trying to like brush it off. Like, "Oh, that sounds fun." Like, "Hope you have a good night." Like... Instead of, you know, my, what I have done for the longest time which is, you know, like, "Well, what do you mean? What's the matter and are you okay? Like, well let's hang out then." You know? Because I think it's manipulative behavior on his part even if he doesn't know that he's doing it. [00:35:03]</p>

<p>Which I like have a sense that he does know that he's doing it. So yeah, I think that, you know, there is like of course like a little hope that maybe I will have a new insight. But at the end of the day, I have my own insights like every day that are just the same as, or similar to what I already have been thinking about and it's just pushing me more and more in the other direction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) I mean I (inaudible) I don't think those are insights. I think those are new reminders, you know, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Red flags, like kind of, I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like same thing you've been saying for months again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Years. (PAUSE) [00:35:57]</p>

<p>And it would be our three year anniversary in November. I will be visiting Mandy (ph) that weekend because it's Veteran's Day weekend. And like I just feel like if we're still trying to do like the therapy thing and working things out it's going to like be a little awkward. Because like I don't know if I really want to celebrate that like... But then he'll probably be all depressed if I didn't. I don't know. Like I'm sick of catering to him, you know? Like I do a lot of that, catering to his feelings, catering to his, like what he wants like and, you know, the support that he needs and, you know, stuff. And then his way of catering to me is telling me, "Oh, you failed." And, "Oh, that sucks that your brother like is on the verge of like being a homeless person with mental illness on the street. That sucks." (PAUSE) [00:37:00]</p>

<p>I mean, to be honest though, if, if, if, if I do continue to kind of be not as characteristic of how I've always been with him in terms of reacting to his little, you know, jabs or whatever he's trying to do in terms of his way of speaking to me, like this may just work itself out because he may just be like, "You know what. I don't think you're doing the right thing for me and blah, blah, blah. I can't do this anymore." Like I could really see that happening. And at that point, I would be like, "Well then okay." Because I really am, am... I can't do this whole catering thing to him thing anymore. It's really like too much. Like, I, if I don't want to hang out because I want to spend the whole week doing nothing by myself, then like... (PAUSE) [00:38:00]</p>

<p>And like, if he's like acting all like sullen and, you know, like melancholy or whatever around me, like I'm not going to be one to like, "Well, what's the matter? Can I help? Can I cheer you up? What do you need? What do you want to do?" Like if tomorrow I go grocery shopping with him and he's acting like a little bitch, like I'm like zero tolerance, like I have zero tolerance for this kind of behavior at this point. Like I just, the same as I've been doing on gchat. Like I've just been... Like this morning, when he changed his mind about the shopping, I was like, "Alright. No worries. Like if that's, you know, how you feel, that's fine. We'll go on a date some other time and we'll go shopping by ourselves, you know?" And then, instead of, "Well why? Well, why do you feel that way? And no, of course I don't think that," you know. And if I continue to behave like this, he may feel like, you know, whatever. "Well this is... I can't... You obviously don't care about this relationship." [00:39:03]</p>

<p>Which is not the case but I also care about my mental health. Like... (PAUSE) So I'm hoping that it's at least amicable tomorrow when we do our plan and we can each enjoy our weekends. And hopefully, I'll be able to make an appointment with Tammy for next week. So... And then see where I go from there because I can only, you know, I can only push myself. I don't know. I just can't... Like I'm not going to call him and be like, "It's over." Like I just can't, even though I'm feeling like that, you know? (PAUSE) I'm not, you know, able to do that yet. I am able to back off in terms of, you know, kind of feeding into his, his, his bullshit basically. [00:40:00]</p>

<p>I mean, I promise he'll get sad about, "Well, I didn't get to stay over this weekend and we didn't hardly get to see each other." And like, my reaction is going to have to be like, "Well, I understand that but, you know, I have been making plans with my friends and enjoying some time to myself." And if he can't accept that then like tough shit. "I'll be happy to ask you about your weekend and happy to tell you about mine but I'm not going to sit here and apologize for it." And that's what he expects from me. He expects me to apologize for not wanting to see him or talk to him as much. When, like really? You should just be happy that I'm talking to you at all at this point and it's just... I think again, kind of similar to what I realized, I think, you know, maybe a month or two ago like the whole, you know, phase of him like feeling so bad and like wanting to win me back and do anything really passed very quickly and now it's more about him and less about me, you know. [00:41:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. We'll stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well this was helpful. So I'll see you Friday. I have to reschedule next Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have a big conference going on Thursday and Friday and I can't. I will have no (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

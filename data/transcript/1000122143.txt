<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 6. </p>

<p>CLIENT: All set.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I get all sorts of things in my head. Several observations but I think the most. Well, I think, where do I start? The first thing is that I think we should be. I think you are probably aware, whether it's a circumstance or whether it's you, it's this tremendous power that you have over my life right now. I don't know whether it's. Since Monday I've been thinking about Thursday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Spending a lot of time. A lot of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like I've come up with anything. I've only come up with about two minutes worth of stuff but nevertheless, it so far. Certainly I've almost decided to open up an entire new branch of everything, that is the relationship with my roommates. I think they could fit in but it seems to. I'm not prepared for that today but that's because I haven't thought about it that much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Since last time I talked to June after Monday. I guess I phoned her up on the phone and we talked about me. And last night I went over to her house and we talked about me in general. And I told you before I was 90 percent, a couple of weeks ago or something like a week or so ago. Well, I went to 99 percent last night. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know. The last 1 percent was. It's not really an important percent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was. The mood was all taken care of and it would just have made everything more severe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's all over. I mean, I was honest enough to tell her the truth and she was very, very rational and took that and we talked all night. And so if I fall asleep, that's what that's about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And well, she gave me time to get home to make some notes. But, the last 1 percent was, would have been the crowning blow that I think didn't, wouldn't have made me any, would have made me more honest with her but it wouldn't have accomplished for me anything and the only thing it would have done was maybe hurt her more. And that was to tell her to the extent of to what, the extent to which she had become a joke amongst. I also became quite aware last night that I don't really like the people that I'm around. I think I told you that she said and I kind of agree, that I surround myself with people that I consider inferiors in the things that I value.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the more I think of it, the more I think that the people that I am around now, I just keep going around. With one or two exceptions and because of those one or two exceptions, I want to talk maybe next time. Maybe this time if I feel like it, about roommates. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But last night was definitely important. Very important and very, very honest and I don't think I was dishonest in leaving that last 1 percent out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, the effect of it. Before I tell you what transpired is for me it was unexpected.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Minimal. I'm not really. I don't feel depressed. I don't feel that much better about it. That much worse about it. It's just that now instead of the, knowing what I felt, she knows it too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was really zapped by it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean really zapped. I mean. She's not the type that would cry. But, she, she's taking a trip to Washington next week. She decided she's going to Washington. She's going to be gone for a week. And she said, well, maybe I'll stay. Wow, you know. I mean, she's 30 years old. She's got a job and she, today, she intimated that she was making $20,000 and she wouldn't have any reason to lie. She's a well-established nurse in a hospital here, in a big hospital and she's got a real good thing going for her and she is thinking about dropping out. And so I think the most important thing that I feel is remorse that I've done this to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's, I don't think it's going to happen so I don't think that it's real deep.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think she's really going to pick herself up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the funny thing about it is, she was completely honest with me and when she said that. And, she has a, friends and family that she enjoys and I think she was really honestly contemplating it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. But I hope that saner heads will prevail. I asked her when I left it was at all possible for us to continue talking because I don't think we are all talked out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she said, yeah, probably. And we made a date for Saturday night. I'll call her and talk to her. But as far as anything else, I think that it's pretty much kaput.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Well. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, well, that's how I feel about it. Now what happened. It's kind of funny. I mean, I mean to talk like this. I started taking notes. I had to and she said all right, fine. It didn't bother her at all. Before I go on with that, well, okay. So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, explain to me before you go into it. Why is your telling me what happened going to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because this is. Well, first of all. Many of the observations were not made between us but were made about me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you'll see that when I start to admit them. I mean, it was a talk about me more basically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was very little about us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. There were one or two things that I think that came up that don't fit at all. This was, well, first of all. The reason it happened is because I guess I'm coming here, it sounds like an entirely different problem. But it's not, you see. Because last night was really about me and well, for example, we didn't start talking about us until about 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I went to that last 99 percent but until then it was all about me so it was all. It's about lying. The whole talk was about lying and honesty. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What I want to get straight is why you are telling it to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's really an odd question. I've told you everything. Why shouldn't I tell you this? This is important and it is about me and it's about how I look at life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. So, it's like telling me more about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. This is about me. It's not about. It's not like. All right, I had this big affair and now I'm telling you about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is just the circumstances around the way that I found out a lot about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it's that you are going to hear the same stuff over and over again. And a lot of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's giving me all kinds of like information that you saw to help me really understand you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm really amazed at this question of yours because it seems to me about what, this is no different than any other thing that I've told you about. I've told you about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. Okay. Um, what I'm. The reason that I'm asking is, I'm trying to figure out why, well, how does it help you to tell me this. That's what I want to get straight.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because we are discussing me. I mean, if, if, and if you weren't here, I mean I could do all this stuff for myself and sit home alone but you are here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you are the one with whom I am discussing me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In hopes of helping me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So you are laying it out for me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why? Excuse me for asking a question but why would this be any different than any other thing that I've tried to bring up?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um. Well, I think this is different because it's something you already know about yourself that you have all written out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. I took notes before. Last time before and about three or four things on here are observations that she made. But then, I want to talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you want to talk about. Well that makes it very clear to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This isn't like something that I wrote down all she said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have eight or nine ideas here and eight or nine things that she pointed out, I think two of which had to do with our relationship and all the rest had to do with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you see, where I didn't want to be is like a computer to which information about you has just been fed in. Do you see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. As a matter of fact, there are one or two major. I think, I happen to think that they are major insights. I really think I've hit on something, okay?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In other words, the nature of this information is not much different than what we've been talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there is one major. Okay. All right. One analogy that we used and you'll have to forgive me for using analogies continually but in high school I had English teachers that liked analogies in papers so I kept writing those.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: However, we have come across one that rather worked in talking about things because then you can make reference to the analogy much easier than reference to self. That is the fact that I had myself, and around myself I built fences. Because I was so insistent about keeping good fences and protecting myself or that she used and I didn't, but it seems to be right, in protecting myself, protecting my house inside this fence, that I spent all my time mending the fences and never inside the house. To the point of actually tearing the lumber out of the house to build the fences. Okay, so now, I've been alone for awhile and I haven't had to tend the fences. There's no reason to. There's no real interaction. So, I come back and the house is gone. And all I've got left is the fences. Okay. That's an analogy that I had. All right. Now, three things we talked about and something that June really sort of made fit all together, they seemed to fit together. Number one, if you remember, my father and his temper. Now, he has a temper and I've seen it and I don't. I have just the opposite. I can reasonably be mad at someone and not be. Now, there are exceptions to this. When I, the one or two times maybe in a year when I get mad at someone and lose my temper, I really am vehement.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really rant and rave. I lose all reason and all sense. Okay. So that's a trait, losing my temper. The possessor of that trait, my father and myself. Well, my father does, he loses it. What I do, I do just the opposite. I control it beyond any reasonable steps. Now, let's take another thing. Let's take my mother. She never admits a mistake. I had that quality for awhile. I saw it. I didn't like it. So what do I do? I, if I am right and I am arguing with someone and they are wrong, to avoid the argument sometimes, I'll say all right, I'll admit I'm wrong when I'm not wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm. Just the opposite.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just the opposite.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To the other extreme.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just the opposite. So both of those things are dishonest. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I were really honest, if those few times when I deserve to be mad and irate at someone, I should be that way. That is really the honest thing to do. It is certainly not often, but there are times that you should be mad and there are times that I should have been mad. There are times that I should argue if I'm right. But I don't. So it is counteracting. These two traits that I see in myself that I saw in my parents. Now let's take a trait that only I have or at least only I seem to have. And that is the building of the fences. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, what did we talk about last time? We talked about going inward.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not interacting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is just not. That is now, there's a trait in my father, there's a trait in my mother and a trait in me. Both of which I'm thinking of my reaction to my reaction will be just the opposite. Right? And it's dishonest. For me to be inward is to be dishonest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, I think that's important and, therefore, I cannot really say that that's the answer to all of this. Living alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Staying away from people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's not the answer. That's as dishonest as what I'm doing now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now that I've gotten that. Sorry to bring up things that June said because that's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wanted to point out. That, that I thought was really cool. She noticed that and it's true. It really is. So now, what is there to talk about, that we see a similarity in my life. My behavior. Maybe the reason that I'm disturbed about the fences might just be the fact that I don't build them as good as I can. In other words, I make these mistakes at times. You see, I was going along fine all the way through college and everything when I could. I wouldn't be disturbed about how I behaved with girls. But when I realized these fences exist now I am disturbed and I have been disturbed lately.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe it's just that I'm not as good at lying as I used to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Yes. So maybe what you want to do is get better at lying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, that maybe the case but I don't like that at all. That just doesn't appeal to my rational self. It just doesn't make sense. That could be the case. Had I been better at lying I probably wouldn't be here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think my life would be. Most certainly my life would be worse. Maybe not the way I would feel about it but certainly the way, if I look back on it when I'm 94 years old and say, wow, what a rotten life. So, what does this leave me with? Well, maybe the following. Maybe a realization that there is no house inside those fences. That I am only fences. And, that if I wanted to build a lasting relationship with someone, they are going to have to realize that. That, for instance, if I am with someone in a new encounter and I project some image, I didn't know that person, I should explain that to this person, that I am this way. That what you see is not necessarily all sides of me. And then, take that person with me to another encounter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Show them more sides.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. June has seen other sides. That's why she is such a great observer of my character. She has been with me in different circles of friends. And maybe that's the answer. Maybe the answer is to say all right, you lie. It's a benign sort of lie. It's not, as she said, it's not so much lying as avoiding telling the truth of your feelings. But now maybe there is no truth in my feelings. There is no house inside the parameter. So the truth is the fence. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't get that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the fact that I don't have a self. I have never analyzed myself. I don't. I've torn down anything that was there. Maybe I've never built it. But I've continued to build these fences around and now just to realize that may be true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm. Um hm. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not a very. I'm certain there are people with just tremendous edifices. That are really, I mean, I know many that are. Not many, well, I know four or five people that I, I think I really know and they are not pretentious at all. They are just honest all the way across the board. They can be that way. Maybe I'm just a tremendous fence builder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you are just a pretender?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And, that indeed, could be honesty. Now there's only one thing wrong with that and that is to be honest with everyone, I would have to show them all sides of me. So, I would have the choice then of leaving a person at a certain point in my life and that part of behavior. To leave them with, even my parents, even with my circle of older friends. Or to take that person completely in my confidence in saying look, I've told you all sorts of lies. But, that's the problem that because I've done this for so long that I think that maybe it's the only hope. That there is no possible way for me to behave differently. This is the way I behave.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does that make sense?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I see what you are saying. Yeah, that makes sense but what makes sense is to accept the fact that you really have no self.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. That's what I'm saying. That doesn't make sense to do that. I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean make sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it a viable thing for a person. Well, you see, it's quite a paradox.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, some way or other, it's like many, I can't figure this out. Many people think they have no self and they are totally upset by that but you seem to be, not totally upset by that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no, you see. Here, let me explain. It's really. It's really a paradox. Well, I don't want to go into it. It was a close one. The Greeks were great with paradox. But this seems to be a real, well. Shoot, there's a really good physics analogy here but I don't want to bore you. But, it takes too long to describe and it's an analogy. Can't I just talk. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Laughter]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What is self. How does one behave? If one is, if I just simply don't behave as a self, and I only behave as an interacting self.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then that isn't self.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see what you're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The lack thereof. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what you're saying, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The analogy I was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stop looking for something else. Stop trying to create something extra.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because that's not. Just by the way I have lived my entire life up to now, there is nothing. There is just me. And there is only. Well, the only me. Me is the ability to assimilate into the group that I'm in and to behave so maybe it's just to get better at that. To be more perceptive to people. To see what they like and to realize well, I can't do something then just not do it. For instance, remember the book with the girl at the airport. Just at that point, not lying about that but, I don't know. You know, I still have to lie. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you have to lie?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, to develop an interest in that book. To please her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that interest would not be mine. That interest would be the fact that she's interested.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, anyhow, that's. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, would that be a fence then? Would that be part of the fence to pretend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, you see. Because, because it is a part from me. It's not what I feel about anything. You know, it's. Well, it's what. There are so few people in the world capable of original thought. I just don't think I'm one of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And is that a crime? I mean, is that horrible? To realize that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow I think there is something about the words you are using that are confusing me because, I just. It's almost funny. I mean, I can't help laughing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can see that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something about the way you are putting it. It's like, somebody coming in and saying I'm nothing, you know. I'm just nothing and that's fine. Now wait, I just.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I'm sorry. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me, and then you explain to me what I'm missing here. But it's almost like you are saying I'm nothing and that's really great. I've just discovered that I'm absolutely nothing. [laughter] Except a bunch of pretenses. Isn't that marvelous? Or is that okay. Now you see, that's what it sounds like to me. And that's why. And of course, you know, there is something. You obviously mean something different by that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I. You know. I just don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or maybe it's something that it's a relief to find out that you are not some huge thing that you thought you were. Maybe it's that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think it's the joy in knowledge.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't think it's a distasteful joy in knowledge. It really isn't. Now, you may look at this as being something horrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I've only thought about it for like one day now. So I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, no. I mean I realize that it isn't something horrible to you and so it's obvious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You qualify it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it's not even horrible to me. See, no, look.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm fine. It's got to be to you. You're talking about self [inaudible] right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doesn't it seem like some of us are oh, boy, I'm nothing. Doesn't right true, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's very true. There's something very strange about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Now are you finished because I want to pursue something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not saying, okay, you're turn, my turn but I just.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you see, I have known very, very few really honest people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In any one given time say that, say what is them because they have put that thing in there. That's why we have newspaper columnists or politics. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. There are very people who say what.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See, you are just regurgitating what other people say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, no one, the amount of original thinking in the universe is negligible. Practically nil.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay, I see that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. So, it's the same thing with interaction. There is nothing that's really, really, um, you see. I can, I may contend that 99.9999999 percent of the people are like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are just pretentious. And haven't really figured themselves out and indeed have no self. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, maybe I'm one of the few that realize this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if I can take some joy in that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. That you realize that. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Does that, maybe well, I'm not right but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see what, I see what you're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why there can be joy in it. You see, if it's a malady that afflicts everyone and I am one of the few, you see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's the joy of being one of the people who discovered it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You were probably more amused at the fact. Is it right that you were more amused at the fact that this is something that if someone comes in, when someone comes in your office and says I have no self and says it with a glee in his voice, that you find disturbing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. I do not find it disturbing. I find it amusing because it's the same way that I would feel or you might feel if somebody came to you and said to you, I have just discovered that I'm an absolute nincompoop. I don't know anything about physics. I don't know anything. I am a total nincompoop and I have just discovered that and you know, isn't that wonderful that I've discovered that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm not disturbed. It's just that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Has anyone ever come in and admitted it and said wow, I have no self isn't that groovy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [laughter] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I could see where. I can see where that would be amusing. Maybe, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But wait. I see what you are saying now because I see what you are saying is like, look all these people think they have uniqueness and individuality and creative thinking but really, for me to discover that I don't is really a discovery.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And realizing my limitation of not being able to have, you know, I hate to use original thought. To be a real self, a well-examined self.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Defines itself. You see, maybe we are using yourself wrong. Or differently. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we are. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because my idea of self is a, is a self-motivating self. That is my motivations are, are mine and mine alone and I feel that because I alone feel that way. That isn't the case, you see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what you mean. There's a kind of freedom in realizing that you don't have to pretend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I once thought I had my life down to what I call the first principle approach and the reason that I. And I hate to do it this way because it's so much like geometry but you know geometry is a step [inaudible]. We're going to get beyond the definitions and postulates that exist in our natural world and we just assume they exist. They cannot be proven or disproven. Well, now, what about a life. Shouldn't a life have a well developed principle? That one can either deny or you can't prove it or disprove it. But once you develop those principles in your own mind then your life should be consistent about those principles, right? I mean, if that's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, if that's the way you want to say that, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So, that, you know, for awhile I thought that was really groovy, a consistent approach. That's fine. Um, but, the problem with that is, who determines what those principles are?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you don't. One doesn't. I don't think. I think very few people do for themselves. That it's everyone else and what they read, what they hear, what they see, how they interact.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's what determines those principles and, therefore, those principles. Now, I would say that most people don't have that, have the first principles approach. Let's say any given action is, they say, like that's based on this action. They don't have their lives that well ordered. However, there was a point when I thought I did. And I had these principles well defined and then said I did that because which was kind of comforting. But now we are at the point of saying what are these principles. They are not determined by me. And, indeed, they may change from encounter to encounter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, now the problem is, what does one do? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Knowing that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Now, do I mean do I just practice lying? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will this change my feeling about what, well, the big number one that I came in here for or that not liking myself. The distaste for myself after an interaction where I've lied.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What will it do to that? Will that problem ever go away? Or should I, well, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or should you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or should I realize when I start to get to that point in a relationship or an encounter, at that point, that you can't build a fence so don't try. I don't, the analogy falls down here so let's forget the analogy. Maybe I should, when I get to that point, not continue to lie. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And let, then, a non-entity project itself rather than a false entity.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Rather than turning myself into a entity all the time, to keep on lying all the time, all the time. When I see a point when I'm lying, in such a way that is completely distasteful to me. To these first principles perhaps. Wow, this might be really inconsistent. But, then that is the point to stop lying. So it's sort of the point of kind of a happy medium between realizing that I'm going to lie and that I'm going to interact that way and that my social encounters will be such that they won't be me projecting but what those people want to see. Until it gets to the point where I'm, where, I'm reacting in such a way that I'll later regret and that's the point where I'll stop lying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stop lying. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not stop lying by telling the truth but stop lying by [inaudible]. That's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because that is the truth at that point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's all very confusing, isn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's, you know, I hope that I'm. I don't know. You see, I come in here and I think I've got something figured out and then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you leave and nothing's figured out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes yeah. Sometimes. And sometimes a lot happens between Monday and Thursday. Is it going to be definitely Thursday all the time now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That extra day really helps. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well okay. What I'm not clear about here, is you were talking about you. There's nothing of you that isn't what you are taking in, what you read, etc., etc. Really. Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very nearly. Very nearly. Well, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you are saying that when you get in situations is that I am the way people want me to please them and that's a lie. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's almost like you are saying there are only two ways I can act. One of them is to please other people and to lie and one of them, the other one is, I guess to do, to do nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. Not interact.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But those are the only two possibilities.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see. The only reason I came in here was when the line started to break down and I couldn't do it because I got to a point where a lie would be distasteful to me. I wasn't good at it at some point. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sounds like maybe both of those things were becoming to be true. But you were, you were doing it too well. And also, the distaste, the distaste, what's that like? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I just. Well, I would just walk out of an encounter and say hey, for being such an ass, really hating the way I behaved and saying at that time, well that's not me. Realizing now that maybe there is no me to project. Oh, wow. Doesn't make any sense at all, does it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think. I think the sense it makes is something about. Well, I think there is a difference in like you are saying you've been trying to please them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or the only other alternative is to do nothing but what about the alternative? It sounds like what was distasteful to you was that you were never doing anything to please yourself in those situations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I think the more I look at it. I think I just got being good at it. It was only that when I wasn't good at it that I didn't like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I would walk away because then I would, and be mad because they would see that I was lying. Which is really egocentric. I mean, oh, I'm getting along fine as long as I can, you know, fool them but the minute that I can't fool them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Would you be happy right now if suddenly you really knew that you could be an excellent liar and fool them all? Would that be satisfying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, I. Um, I don't know. No, maybe satisfying if I were to realize that that would be me. I would be an excellent liar and that was my. That was it. That was everything that existed to me and that if I ever got really honest with someone, I would explain that to her. They would understand it. And once they saw all sides of me they would say, wow, you are a great liar. And that's the way, I really think he's lying. I could see where that would not be displeasing to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because there is nothing really bad about that. To please people you are with. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would say most people I know like me. There are very few people who don't, and it's not just necessarily because I've spoken what I've felt. Well, one thing. I've spoken what they like to hear. Sometimes things that are important to my nature, whatever my nature is. Is that so bad? I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's really wrong with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you see. As long as I'm never going to get caught. I don't see one side against the other. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. I mean I've got some friends that are like super radicals that think I'm right on the border of joining SDS and I have some redneck uncles that think I'm abhorred with campus reactionary or campus violence. Now if those two ever meet together, those two people, I think they would almost kill each other. They are both vehement and both violent. And I get along with either one. Both of them realize I'm not quite where they are so the only thing wrong with behaving that way is the fear of getting caught balancing one side against the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So if there is no fear, you would really be very happy to live that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um. That's really hard. I can't answer that. I can't. I would say it doesn't seem to be an impossibility, no. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You find that particularly distasteful don't you? I mean, I just kind of have that feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have the feeling that I find that distasteful. Tell me what.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you just seem, you seem like wow, here's a guy whose going to lie for the rest of his life, whose going to base his life on lies and it seems like he really means it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not what you're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it's just because we've used the word lie and I have so many bad connotations. You see, I, I'm right now, I'm interested in the paradox and I'm trying to resolve the paradox of if a fa�ade can be a self. If the fact that I reflect what you want to see is me. In that sense, then, then we are using the word lie wrongly and it's not a lie. It's not true. The most important thing to me is to be pleasing in your eyes. Therefore, I behave this way. That is the truth. Now when I'm with someone else, that's saying the same truth still prevails. The important thing to me is to be pleasing in your eyes. Therefore, I behave this way. That is the truth. That is because those two behaviors are different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That might be the truth rather than a lie. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it, I could see. I don't know but I've got to think a lot more. But I could see where, yeah, yeah, I could live that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The fear is that would be an unusual way to live. I mean, it wouldn't be an unusual way to live, it would be unusual to recognize it and admit it and that would be displeasing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm. What would be, what you are saying then is, I'm a person to whom it is very important to please everyone or almost everyone that I'm with and that is the truth and, therefore, I'm going to act in such a way as to always do that. And that in a sense is leaving out who I really am although it's a lie in the sense that they might think that I feel certain things that I don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. And, in fact, this will constitute lying. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will have to say to my uncle, you know, well, I'm not sure I'll vote for Nixon or not and I will have to say to other people that I know that I am going to vote for Gregory and that's hardly going to be the case but that's just one. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It will involve that type of lie. But ultimately that maybe is the truth about me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The truth is that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I am most concerned with pleasing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: One of these first principles that I had and I don't remember that it's a bad first principle, I think it's one of the things that I tried to remember but a standard for one's existence could be what if everyone behaved that way. Just visualize if everyone behaved that way. What would happen? If what you see is a pleasing world behaved that way? If it's not don't behave that way. What would such a world be like?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Strange.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Strange. You know really strange. It's hard to imagine anyone but me behaving that way. But I don't think it would be bad. I think if one had to say is it, geez we're using this word too often, but is it a honest or a dishonest world? I think one would say that it is an honestly, it is honestly admitting lies, honestly admitting dishonesty. So in a sense it is a very honest world built on lies. If everyone were that way. But fortunately everyone isn't so we don't have that paradox. That's just a paradox. We have me and that's. Now the problem is, what makes me think that I'm going to now be better, even better at lying or that I'm going to be comfortable in this type of life. I don't know. You know, there is one real problem here and that is that I'm not interacting. I can't test these premises. Which is sad. Another sad part is we've got to hurry. We've got to get done by June. And it, you know, with this test and it's so. Well, my basic life is concerned with now, is that I study 90 percent of the time and the other 10 percent of the time I spend thinking about what I'm going to say when I come in here which gives me no time to interact. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are very crowded. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's, let's make it 99 percent and 1 percent of the time doing crossword puzzles which I have gotten into. I don't know why I mentioned that. Yeah, I don't know how I feel 100 percent about it. I would have to use this principle of what if the whole world were that way. Although it's hard to realize in this case.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something to think about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's sort of like real. I come up with all these great physics analogies that I just, I would have to spend two minutes explaining and then it would lose all of its immediacy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know a little physics.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, that's right. I shouldn't. It's sort of like, you see, it's hard to visualize an electromagnetic world with only one kind of charge.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because we have a world with two kinds of charge.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How would everything act if everything were repulsive. And that's similar because that's like you are against someone rather than with someone. And well. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. You see, I'm interacting. What this person has and what I have is, I'm setting up a defense, everyone sets up a defense against each other. We'd never get close. We would interact only against each other, rather than with. I would see what you want and you would see what I want and. I don't know. There would be nothing left over there. There would be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, part of what you are saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why I would try to conceive of a world like this because all I am worried about is the world with one person like that in it and that's me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Well, it sounds like one thing to know exactly what you are saying. You are saying that one consequence of this is that it separates you from people so that you can never really be close to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. The other analogy that I thought of and I might as well say it. You see, a sphere charge, [inaudible] is not involved in a sphere, a hollow sphere. From an exterior point it's impossible to tell whether that is a sphere or if all of that charge is concentrated at the origin, at the center of that sphere. So, that's what I was going to use earlier, with that as myself. Maybe that sphere is indeed me. The center of the. And from the outside that's exactly what it looks like. There's no way of knowing. It's just when you get inside that sphere that you see no charges. You see no charge at all inside the sphere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you never can tell.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you never know. So maybe that is the self. That's when I thought of that analogy and I think it's a good one. It's not too bad. Thinking about.</p>

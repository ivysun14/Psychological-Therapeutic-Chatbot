<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're woozy from having just taken it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: From withdrawal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel kind of dizzy and out of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Withdrawal is not that much fun, as I have had occasion to learn because I cannot remember to refill it. I really should renew my prescriptions to a pharmacy that's open all the time. But that will happen when it will. Yeah, so I'm way less woozy than I was half an hour ago, like it's just starting to kick in. And if I get tired in the middle of the session that will probably also be explained by having not taken.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) But I seem to have developed enough of a tolerance to it that it doesn't work anymore at the dose that I take so I'm going to taper off of it because it doesn't, I almost never take it for anxiety and so, I don't really need it for anxiety as much and it's not working as a sleeping thing anymore and the Depakote which helps me sleep and so. [00:01:16] (Pause, sighs) I had breakfast this morning with my friend Candace (sp?) and her boyfriend who I got to meet. It's very funny, they've been dating for like eight or nine months now and I haven't seen, the last time I saw Candace (sp?) was the first weekend after he'd asked her out, like the first week after she had gone on the first date. So her being really excited about this new guy and then she didn't go away so I think it was for real, probably a good thing. And now they've been dating long enough that it's like they have the same facial expressions (laughs) he's like picked up on a couple of her facial expressions and she's picked up on a couple of his and it's very funny. I like it so that seems good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:2:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah, she (pause) dated a man from, who was in the Master's program with us while I was living with her. That ended poorly so it is (inaudible at 00:02:32)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To see her with somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And she was, I think, dating around before that and having a good time with it. She's in Texas now. That's a very specific social scene, like you pretty much have to like to talk about politics in order to live in Texas (Laughs) And I don't like to talk about politics, but Candace (sp?) does so it's good. (Pause) Still not doing so well, but what do we do? I mean, that was a rhetorical question (laughs). [00:03:13] Yeah (pause) I'm having trouble in talking with James (pause) balancing (pause) you know (pause) really how to talk to him (pause). It's rare that half of my mind isn't on being sad or whatever. [00:03:50] (Pause) And I can't just talk about that with him. It wears him out. He tries not to say that (inaudible at 00:04:02) and then he tries not to show it, but it wears him out. So again what do we do? [00:04:12]</p>

<p>(Pause) It's funny, I feel, I don't know how this is, but I feel like I am both somebody who, like I'm constantly, I feel like I get in conversations and I talk way too much about myself, but I also feel like it's very very easy for me to, particularly with people that I'm very close to, to have conversations be almost entirely about the other person. I just noticed, yesterday I talked to both my mom and my dad for like, you know, twenty minutes each kind of by chance, it was the first time I've talked to my mom in a while. And both conversations were entirely about them. [00:06:35] (Pause) Which, you know, doesn't make me feel great, but also does make me feel good that I like to hear about them and I don't like when I feel like I monopolize conversations. Which happens way more often when I'm in, kind of, social situations and I'm a little more revved up. I don't know, I'm not good at the balance thing it feels like. But I also put way too much weigh on (pause) like the dynamics of a conversation. Like I think I pay way more attention to that than anybody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Overlapping conversation, inaudible at 00:06:32)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry? Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, like feeling like people are going to be really bothered by me kind of, you know I do that thing where somebody tells a story and I'm like, oh! I have a story that's kind of like that and then I tell that story, which drives me nuts in myself and in other people. You know and it comes from a, like I really try to build connections with people very fast, like I really am trying to find, yeah places of contact but it's hard to keep that at the appropriate level. [00:07:17] (Pause) My mom did ask whether I had a job yet, she remembered. And then she talked about the power outages in Texas which, to be fair, that would be a story that I would want to tell (laughs). That would have been a mess, alright I think it was a mess for a lot of people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She has to buy a new refrigerator because when the power came back on it killed her refrigerator. (Pause) I don't know. [00:08:17] (Pause) Sometimes I'm like, guys you're my parents this should be about me a little more (laughs). (Pause) And in a sense it is (pause), you know with mom pretty much all the conversations go like that but my dad is not that way. But (pause) I don't know, I think it's just hard for people that are close to me but that I don't talk to all the time to remember that I'm not doing well. And so I feel like I don't want to keep constantly reminding people. (Pause, crying) And it's like, it's going to get boring (laughs) but, I wish people remembered. [00:09:25] (Pause) And then James has told me that when I talk about it I talk about it in a tone of voice that indicates that I don't want to talk about it anymore, which is probably true. I mean almost certainly true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You say this almost as if you couldn't want it both ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah. I want most things both ways. (Pause) Yeah because I both, I wish people remembered and I don't want people to have to deal with it, and so. [00:10:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I'm thinking of it as you want to be taken care of but you also don't want to have to (pause) worry about (pause)what this does to the other person or feeling guilty or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When I am the one who brings it up it's much easier to feel like I am being selfish in that way or that I am being a drain on the other person, that I am exhausting them. And part of it with my dad is he's constantly saying things like 'I don't want to pry. I don't want to pry'. Which is really nice that he has that much respect for my emotional space, I recognize that I am very lucky in having my primary parent be that way, having enough friends with parents who don't understand the concept of space. But it's hard for me to say in a way that he will hear 'no you will never be prying on this subject. I want you to ask. I want to be talking about it'. [00:11:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you trying at the moment in a way in here as well to find a way of talking about how bad you've been feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems like it, yeah. Not (pause), yeah. I don't, there's not really much new to say on it. I mean, I still just feel like crap. You know not all of the time, but enough of the time. (Pause) And I (pause) I don't know how useful it is for me to just constantly repeat myself (laughs). (Pause) You know I still cut myself, still worried about suicide and have to cut myself to (groans). [00:13:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what happened? When did you cut yourself? What was going on? What, I mean, yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Crying) I umm, it was I guess three to six days ago and for two nights in a row so I guess three and four days ago. I don't remember any more actually. (Pause) Yeah. I think one of the nights, the first time, was the last time I called you. so that was four days ago? I don't remember. (Pause) Yeah I (pause) it's one of those I (pause) have again this tension between not wanting to be doing this, wanting to stop, but also this is in a lot, you know this is better than the alternative in some ways, you know continuing to feel really bad and worrying about doing more damage to myself. [00:14:40] (Pause) And just wanting to have control, wanting to feel like I can do something that will make me feel better. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) And there, yeah there's also part of it (pause) I don't know, I think part of me wants to mark how bad this is in some way. [[00:15:54] (Pause) I'm not sure why. Maybe because as soon as I feel better I forget what it's like to feel so bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) What is it like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause, exhales) Umm, (pause) yeah it's not consistently that horrible, or it's not always that horrible but it is consistently getting, it gets that horrible. (Pause) I just (pause) I'm just scared that I don't have a job, I have an apartment, I told you about the apartment right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said you had looked at an apartment with some guys?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I took it so I feel good about that. [00:17:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's in the Square so, so much closer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This side of the river, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes! It's like five minutes to the train and then one train stop so ten to fifteen minutes. And if I walk it's only twenty minutes. And it's a nice walk so I'll probably try to do that as much as I can because that's the only exercise I get so probably should do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) Yeah I agree with the (inaudible at 00:17:45) exercise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah they told me that. But I also have been told that, you know, the studies are based on walking thirty minutes a day three times a week so I figure that's good enough (laughs) yeah. Also the breathing (inaudible at 00:18:08) (laughs). [00:18:10] (Pause) I (pause) it's like it doesn't (pause) it doesn't get any less bad, but I've come to expect it to be that bad and so I know that I'll get through it. And so I'm less likely to reach out during it. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah. I'm thinking well I can do this on my own, I'm going to be okay. (Pause) Yeah it's (pause) it's pretty confusing. I don't, it's hard for me to tell like how, it's hard for me to predict when things will be bad and when they won't. [00:19:23] (Pause) And (pause) I also just have this really strong like pushing back against it, you know like trying not to get worked up and then pushing back against that because then I, you know, start to feel like I'm losing my soul and so I don't want that and (pause) yeah and it feels like a dream in some ways. In that it's like everyone else is living in this different world, and I know they're not all actually living in a different world, I know that there's a lot of really sad people out there. But I can't really (pause) it's hard for me to look outward. [00:20:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Voices overlapping, inaudible at 00:20:46)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is the worst part. That it's just so selfish. It just demands that I be so selfish. I can't, it's hard for me to think outside of myself right now, I hate that. (Pause) So yeah. (Pause) I made it down to church yesterday, on very wobbly legs, (laughs) yeah I just looked straight ahead and focused on not running into things. But, I don't know, the priest recognized me but couldn't remember my name, which is typical, I mean (inaudible at 00:22:03) he recognized me. [00:22:05] And it's a huge parish, like five thousand people, which I really like because it's like, kind of a priest's kid a little anonymity in the church is a good thing. And he said 'how are you?' And I kind of said 'I'm okay'. And as soon as I said it I realized that I was, I clearly wanted him to know that I was not okay and I clearly wanted him not to have to say anything about it, but wanted to just keep going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) You wanted to kind of be able to allude to it but not talk about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess so. (Pause) Yeah. [00:23:06] (Pause) You know, if I, it's the end of the day, it was really hot, there's no air conditioning in the church so that it's like fancy historical buildings, famous architecture or whatever. I think it's really ugly actually, which is good (laughs). And (pause) it's like I really want people to help me but I don't want it to be hard for them. And I don't see how it's not hard for them. And I don't actually quite know why I just want to tell everyone about this because it's not like talking about it necessarily makes me feel better, sometimes it makes me feel better sometimes it makes me feel worse. [00:24:17] (Pause) I don't know, I (pause) I sometimes don't know why I can't just keep my mouth shut.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) Yeah I think in this hour you're kind of, it seems to me, struggling pretty intensely with how much you want to talk about how you've been feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I imagine (pause) that it is mostly for worries about how it could affect me. [00:25:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Mmm. Maybe, but not necessarily.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I just (pause) I just don't want to waste time, which I realize is a fairly silly thing to say (laughs). And I don't really know what to say about it. I don't (pause) I don't know how to talk about it, how to describe it. (Pause) But yeah, I mean there is only so many times you can say the same thing over and over again, even if it's still true. [00:26:35] (Pause) And have it be, you know, bearable to hear. (Pause, sighs) I'm not dizzy anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) I have to remember to take my prescriptions. It doesn't help that I live, you know, forty-five minutes away from the pharmacy. (Pause) Yeah I just, I don't know what to say. [00:27:46] (Pause) I'm not sure (pause) as I see it this therapy is all about kind of, you know, collecting data. The same way that everything is all about collecting data, you know every kind of puzzle is about finding all of the pieces you can and putting them together in a way that makes sense. And so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. I didn't necessarily see it that way. But I realize that I have said that (pause) I think that's something that will happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:28:48] And it's a lot of, a lot of it is less what you have said and more the way I think about problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't know that it (pause) is (pause), so it's hard for me to think of it as useful to say the same things over and over again, you know? (Pause) Especially when it can pretty much be taken as a given.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause, clears throat) Umm. [00:29:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The data in my mind gives it a very vague word. (Laughs) And I'm a researcher so I think -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You probably already know I'm not going to buy that (both laugh).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know. But I kind of feel like I'm using different terminology to talk about what you've already talked about, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Both laugh) And this that like (pause), you know I think of every (pause) interpersonal interaction, every idea, every way of phrasing things, like it's all, it just (pause). I mean I guess my model of how people solve problems is just that they look and then they figure things out, what they see. And the point is that you need to see as much of what's out there as possible in order to get a clear idea. [00:31:29] And particularly with human emotions which have way too many variables to deal with, like I have to do (chuckles). Maybe you haven't figured out but (both laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Overlapping voices, inaudible at 00:31:47).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Exhales) I don't know where I'm going with this. (Pause) Yeah you're probably not going to buy it (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're so scared to be as upset as you really are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) And I don't have time for. I really (pause) I don't (pause, crying) when I'm as upset as I am I don't know how to function. (Pause, crying) You know, I can't move. Or I, well I can usually move, but I certainly don't do the dishes (laughs). And I'll do my work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For a while. [00:33:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) But mostly it feels like you know, I get up and start doing the things that I need to do because I have decided that it's time for me to stop being sad. (Pause) I mean maybe that is just a pattern that comes from my deciding not to be sad so much of the time. I just feel like I couldn't keep up with my life if I (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I feel like you're engaging in a lot of argumentation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I'm pretty combative today. You know Candace (sp?) does that to me sometimes (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't mean it that way, I mean maybe you feel that way or being that way, I mean like (pause) that you're making various cases. [00:34:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to think through it. And the way that I usually think through things is stating that I believe this to be the case and then seeing what kind of case I come up with as I talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah I guess (pause, chuckles) so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It drives James insane. He figures out what he wants to say and then he says it (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You go a different route.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And actually it doesn't irritate him anymore, I think. It just took him a couple years to realize that that was genuinely the way that I thought best and roll with it. Just as I've learned to become comfortable with long silences while he figures out what he wants to say. It has taken me a while (chuckles). Especially when we're having a fight. [00:35:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I guess (pause) I'm going to say something similar to what I said before, which is I sort of have the feeling that I've become the one who's kind of standing up for how you feel. And you're kind of (pause) lawyering me a bit into why I need to be quiet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Oh gosh (laughs). I'm sorry. I think part of it -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why are you sorry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't like lawyering people into anything. (Pause) I don't like the idea of it. [00:36:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright maybe I used too pejorative a term, I guess I didn't mean it so pejoratively, I meant that in the sense of kind of, you know, making cases and various kinds of reasons, arguments (pause) or (pause) kind of why I should be quiet about the dealing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know that I want you to be quiet about them. I think part of this is because I'm genuinely not convinced and part of it is because I don't know how to start, like I don't (pause) I don't know how to change the way I deal with emotions and so it's easier to come up with reasons why I shouldn't change them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah to me feelings, especially strong ones, generally kind of cry out. You know? [00:37:43] (Pause) And (pause) it's sort of something of a fantasy to imagine one has that much control over them. I can understand (pause) wanting to be in control of how and when you express them, it's a good question. But the utility of talking about them (pause), to me it seems more like the act of reasoning it out is an act of stepping away from them rather than a, kind of, more scientific exploration. In other words, I guess that's why I used the word lawyering because there's a clear implication that there's an agenda rather than an exploration. [00:39:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You're absolutely right on all of those things (laughs). Yeah. (Pause, crying) I just feel like I'll lose people. (Pause) I feel like I'm not the person that they think they know anymore. And I don't have (pause, crying) and sometimes it still comes naturally to me to step up for the occasion, you know, to say 'okay I am meeting my friend and her boyfriend this morning, I am going to be cheerful'. That is easy for me to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:40:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) I just don't know what my life would look like if I didn't try to manage my feelings. I mean I haven't ever had a life in which I didn't feel it was of utmost importance to manage my feelings pretty strictly. (Pause, crying) I haven't (pause). Part of this is from, you know if I dwell on feeling bad I feel worse. And there's so much what may or may not be crap about the power of positive thinking and just put good thoughts in your head and you'll feel better, and I don't know how to process that. [00:41:34] (Pause) And (pause) I find that I can't deal with people who are sad all the time. I find that I can't, I have to step away from them for my own, you know, self-preservation. And so what am I going to do when the people in my life suddenly start stepping away from me? (Pause) I just genuinely do not know how to disconnect that says no, now it's time to put your game face on. Like, okay that's enough crying, now you have to go do this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: We'll talk more on Wednesday.</p>

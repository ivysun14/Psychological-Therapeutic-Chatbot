<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So let's see, last month I guess you were still waiting for something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I forgot to bring the piece of paper about the Lamictal last month, but this month I had to call and get them to send out a new one because it had like a date on it that I didn't realize it was time sensitive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, oh, oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I had to get a new one sent out to me so I haven't got that yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then we tried the Chantix and yeah.  That was a bad idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bad idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh well.  My grandma just ended up coming downstairs and taking it.  She was not happy with the way I was acting when I was taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, ah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bizarre?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Bizarre and then it affected my motor skills which didn't make any sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?  No kidding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No kidding.  I fell through a glass table, cut up my leg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Holy moly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I fell clean through a glass table.  It played with my motor skills.  It's not like I'm the most stable individual.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It tore up my motor skills and, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you have to go to the ER for—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No didn't go to the ER.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just a bunch of Band—Aids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Did you do anything else like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of Neosporin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As far as, you know, trying to, as far as it working to like slow down my smoking, things like that, it was doing that fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long were you on it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just the side effects were just horrible.  A little over a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, what, I mean what besides the motor?  Did it give you any mental?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not that I've noticed but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean if my grandmother couldn't stand me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She said that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, something's going on.  All right, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I mean like when I first got on the, ah, Xanax well that, that takes a few days for my body to adjust being on that medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she said, "Well it made you seem like you were a retard for a couple of days."  Okay well that's fine.  It doesn't make me feel like, seem like a retard now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, ah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that was just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well something, you know, something—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The first couple of days of getting on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Something to keep in mind then is if you're ever off it more than a few days, don't start on a whole one.  Go back, do like a third or a quarter or a half or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and then, ah, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I kind of changed how I was taking the pills.  Instead of taking 1 in the morning and 1 at night, I started taking 1 in the morning and then breaking up the one that I take at night and taking 1 like, half of it at midday and half of it at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the whole one in the morning's okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That doesn't impair you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it, it did for the first couple of days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But after that, no.  And that's just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's why I tell people—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's just getting on those type of medications that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean Chantix is different.  That, I've never heard, this I have to check into.  That's kind of strange.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean the only other medications I'm on is the Xanax and the Lyrica, and neither one of those were on the, ah, warning list for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long you been on Lyrica?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, a couple of months.  It doesn't seem to be that effective.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  Who put you on that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, how much are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, you know I don't, I don't remember how much the mg is.  I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, you were on that before you started the Chantix?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's right cause we, I had to rewrite it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And next, okay.  You didn't start until the end of June.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, but you didn't like, it didn't make you like hallucinate or, the Chantix or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not that I know of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Get paranoid and stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm naturally paranoid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not super paranoid but I'm looking out my window and things like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just naturally have paranoid thoughts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Like what kind of things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just worry about nothing really, you know.  My mind goes 100 miles a minute.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I see somebody doing something odd and think about it for like a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how it's related to you maybe or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"How it's related to me and just what was going on and end up just sitting there and analyzing it.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Did anything, do you ever take help with that medicine wise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's been some things that made it worse but there's never, I've never—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've never tried to take something for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What made it worse [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, it was before I got on the Lexapro and the Lamictal.  I was on a different combination of drugs and that made the paranoia worse.  Ah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What was it?  I can't remember the name of it for some reason.  The only thing that comes to mind is Zoloft and I don't think I ever took Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right but, ah, Lamictal and Lexapro combo made it nothing.  It just didn't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Didn't affect it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  All right.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I said I'm just kind of naturally paranoid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably because I've been in trouble with the law and things like that so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm always worried that there's something I don't know that's going to happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, um, cause sometimes things do that.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well my life, my life is something different.  Like, ah, I got 2 middle names.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So when I first moved out here we were trying to get me an ID.  Okay well they want a copy of your birth certificate.  They want social security card.  They want all this type of stuff, and everything but my social card, don't ask me why the social security card didn't have my second middle name on it, but my birth certificate, my mail, everything has both of my middle names on it or at least my 2 initials.  And then, and I go down there with the card—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Social security card did not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With the social security card and it, it was because I had to get a new one, and the person that typed it up didn't put on my second middle name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, the original one did have it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah the original one did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Jesus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So when, when he gave it to me to sign to say that it was right I said, "Look that, that's not my full name" and everything and he was like, "Well I'm going to have to do this, this, that, and this, this, this" and everything like that and made it seem like it was going to be like some huge hassle if I didn't just take it with just my one middle name on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's crazy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I, I was like all right.  So I signed it and got it mailed to me, went to go get the Maryland ID.  They say, "Well everything has [PATIENT NAME] on it and this doesn't have, this only has [PATIENT NAME] on it.  So I can't give you the ID."  So I go back down to the Social Security office.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Get a different guy this time, explained to him my problem.  He said, "Well I'm going to need to see a copy of your birth certificate."  So like, "Here."  Pulled it out because I had just come—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	From the license place so I had it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you did all this the same day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I had it all on me and the license place said, "Well if you can bring this card back and have a letter from the Social Security office saying that they're changing your social security card, I can give you the ID."  Come to find out I can't have my social security card back because it's not the right social security card.  So they can't give me back the social security card.  So I have to wait another 2 weeks for it to be mailed to me.  And then when I go to get the ID, all right I give them the Washington state ID—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Jesus God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they tell me they're going to have to mail me the Maryland ID.  They just can't give it to me even though they just printed it out and everything.  They can't, they won't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just give it to me across the counter.  I don't know.  All right so I'm sitting there talking to him.  I'm like, "Look I got to be on a plane in less than a week.  I've got to go back up to Washington state in less than a week" cause I had a court date—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Out there for my leg.  So I got to go back out there.  "What do you mean you can't just give me the ID?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you couldn't use the Washington state one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They took it.  They couldn't give it back because they made a new Maryland ID, and then they said that they had to mail me the Maryland ID.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	God.  Oh, oh my God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, so we're going back and forth and finally the lady says something because one of the questions was, ah, do you qualify for the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which I do because of my leg so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said okay and she just happened to think of that and she went and asked her boss, and her boss was like, "Oh well if he qualifies for that, go ahead and give it to him."  It took like 30 minutes of arguing and hassling to, I was like, "Look either you got to give me the Maryland ID or you got to give me back the Washington state ID.  I don't care which.  I got to get on a plane."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So if you're involved in my life—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The oddest happens and it's inexplicable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm, ah, all right as long as, um, yeah but that's like bureaucracy.  What did I have to do?  I had to wait 3 months once for DC to send a form in verifying that I had a license, and I knew they didn't send it in cause I kept looking and they hadn't cashed the check.  They, they finally, they later outsourced it to somebody or some other agency or some private group to do.  It was crazy.  Ah, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That is crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, you know, for about 2 weeks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My sleep, I, I can't sleep more than 3 or 4 hours a night.  There for the last week if I'm up 12 hours, I'm ready to go to bed, and I've just been passing out here this last week.  It's definitely different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm, I don't know but for like the 2 weeks before and this last week—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were you tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Couldn't, couldn't get to sleep for nothing whether I was tired, whether—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but, but if you didn't sleep more than 3 or 4 hours you were tired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  I felt like I was run over by a truck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just couldn't go to sleep.  Jesus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I felt like I was run over by a truck for the last week of it.  I just couldn't, couldn't get any sleep, couldn't stay asleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I said this last week it's been extremely odd that I've just been going to sleep without a problem as soon as I lay down in the bed now days at least for this last week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Knock on wood.  I hope it stays that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You and me both.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's, not being able to fall asleep is horrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But then when you do fall asleep, just sleeping for a couple of hours doesn't help either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Ah, I slept Wednesday, getting on the bus.  I don't even remember getting out of the parking lot.  I remember somebody telling me they were closing the window cause it was raining.  Somebody else telling me we were at a rest stop, to get up and go to the bathroom, and then somebody else telling me to get up cause we're on my street.  By that time it was 3:30 in the morning.  I went up to New York.  I, I mean I don't remember anything.  I was out.  I was tired.  It's like, you know, I'm curled up on these 2 seats and my legs are across the aisle on the other seat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At least it wasn't a packed bus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That sure wouldn't have been fun if you're trying to sleep on a full bus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  This was, you know, we rented a, this bus a bunch of us, went to see, ah, 1:00 or 1:05 Yankees game, Yankee Stadium and a 7:10 Mets game at Shea Stadium.  God am I tired.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hey that works out, though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're both, they're both getting closed down this year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Never seen either one so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah I've never seen either one either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know.  That was—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I only saw the Astrodome once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, I never saw that.  That was something I heard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well the Astrodome was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did it take, like 2, an hour and a half to open or close the thing?  Did that have a retract, that had, no that wasn't the one then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Dome never had a retractable roof.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, someplace did.  It must've been the first one after that that had a retractable roof that took like a long time to open and close it so.  All right well you're, um, you're off the, um, Chantix.  You're still taking melatonin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I haven't for this last week.  Like I said and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Been super tired, though.  It made me go to sleep.  Haven't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Haven't needed it.  So I haven't taken any of it this last week.  Um, I might have a problem seeing you in August cause I'm going out of town to go see my mom before school starts and then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The first week of school is the last week of August and that's pretty much running around with a chick, like a chicken with your head cut off trying to get all that stuff taken care of the first week of school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I don't know at this point in time my grandmother might go out of town the first 2 weeks of September because my older brother might get, ah, sent away for his reserves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she'll need to go down there and watch my niece while his wife's at work so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For 2 weeks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two weeks so it might be the middle of September before I can get back to see you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So where are we now?  End of July.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	End of July.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right that's fine.  I'll just give you a refill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On the Xanax and, ah, hopefully, we'll get those forms, um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh I should have the forms back in by then.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I didn't notice that it was date sensitive, and then the last time when I forgot it, I just plain didn't have a chance to get back out here with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause we went out to the commissary to go do the grocery shopping and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just got [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where did you go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The commissary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where, [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I think it's [DEIDENTIFIED], Army base.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's it like?  I've never been there.  Is it nice?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's all right.  They, they have their little like, ah, military mall complex.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah I never—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the BX and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The, the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The commissary right next to each other and then they have like a bunch of shops in between.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They had stuff on sale sometimes was amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The, the dairy products were always much cheaper but otherwise—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Food wise—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not that much cheaper, some.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Food, food wise the commissary is where you want to go shopping.  Um, and, you know, there, there might be deals around town.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At specific stores if you want to run all over town—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you can find—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Store to store—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes they'll have—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Getting a deal here or a deal there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, going out to the commissary hot dogs are like a dollar a pack cheaper.  Bologna is like a dollar a pack cheaper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I mean just so much of it is just is only incrementally cheaper but that incrementally adds up especially when you're spending like $200 at the commissary.  It'd probably be like 3, 350 at Safeway or Giant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I don't know.  This was a number of years ago but milk was, and milk and eggs and stuff like that but then they'd have stuff on sale that like they'd have, you know, big jars of Peter Pan peanut butter or something that was like I don't know $2.50 less than in the store.  I mean [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A lot of them.  My wife didn't like that but.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The NEX is, ah, the place that, well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's the BX out here.  It's not the naval exchange.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's the Base Exchange.  I always forget terminology and switching it back from Navy to Army to Air Force.  It's all confusing but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just the Navy that's the BX, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No it's NEX.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Navy is NEX.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	NEX.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Army is the BX.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Air Force—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Air Force is the, ah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well the Air Force is BX I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	BX?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It may be the BX also because it's Army/Air Force.  They do something.  It's together.  Like the Army and Air Force I think are run the same.  It used to be I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It used to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but I have no idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that, but they changed that after WWII where they made the Air Force the Air Force and left Army—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No but it, but it was like the, um, the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe it's the same—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	AA, you know, the AA whatever, Army, AAFEX, some initials.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was the Army and Air Force exchange or some, something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	May, I know what the Air Force calls it.  The Air Force calls it the PX.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that, that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Army calls it the BX which is the Base Exchange.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh the, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	NEX, NEX.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the food part, the commissary is different.  The commissary I think was run together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think all commissaries are run together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really?  Well maybe that's true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because the Navy doesn't call it anything different than the commissary.  The Air Force calls it the commissary and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's the commissary out there on the Army base too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's true.  It was the PX.  I don't, I'd never, I used to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] Air Force base cause I worked near there.  They had more vegetables and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was like My God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You go into the commissary it's like going into a warehouse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Except the one at [DEIDENTIFIED] was, it's got, it, when I first started going there, it was pretty pathetic but it got better, a lot better.  Then they started opening more and yeah it was all right.  Ah, but I don't know.  All right so do you know like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well to me I figure safe than sorry.  It's just, ah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It's spelled different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No I know.  I can't remember.  I know, I know I remember it's different.  All right so it's going to be somewhere like towards 7 or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mid September.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Seven weeks maybe?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah somewhere like 7 weeks, 8 weeks.  Ah, it shouldn't be 8 weeks but it should be 7.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well if you're not and something comes up, then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Call.</p>

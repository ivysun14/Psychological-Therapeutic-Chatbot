<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With all that advisor stuff, I wasn't even thinking about, uh, anything else.  I totally forgot I had one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't that in your agenda, your, uh, daytimer, which is where?  That's around somewhere, isn't it?  Where do you keep track of things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mostly my phone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you?  Well what if you lose it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] on there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.  [INAUDIBLE] or something.  These cards, I had to get a new faculty card at [DEIDENTIFIED].  These are kind of cool, these, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] cards.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, you can like buy stuff with them I guess.  You put money on them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, you put money on them and then use them for the printers and drink machines, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that's what you need to get in everywhere, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You need that to get in the library.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A game or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] game over there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's kind of cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  I'm not going to put any money on it, but, uh, I'll need it to get in the library or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or get in certain places, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're changing at end of the year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Everybody has to get new ones.  I went last week and they said do you want to get them now because you still have to get another one at the end of the year.  I think they use the same picture.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're changing it all out because it will be improved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'll be to their advantage.  How is school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's going good.  It's going good so far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your grades?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As far as you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not struggling with anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the only class I'm really, I think I'm doing pretty good in all of them so far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you?  What's your lowest do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, uh, psychology is probably my lowest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Which one is that?  Which psyche class?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, psychology of a vision.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that a lot of writing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We don't really ever, they don't ever really teach anything in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He just, uh, talks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  He tells a lot of stories and stuff, and then he puts a lot of random stuff on tests and he's got a basically [INAUDIBLE] figure out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there a book?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that where the stuff, if you know the book, you do okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there a psychologist that's teaching it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I believe so.  Can't think of his name.  I can't even remember his name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'd know, so it's a little bit out there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is one of your humanities?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  We've actually had about 5 different books for the class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there a textbook?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's not a textbook, 5 different novels.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I guess he wants us to read those.  There's basically no reason even going to class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just read a book.  And have you been doing that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.  I'm struggling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you have in there you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably got a C.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Getting a low C probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the, the test questions are, uh, essay or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's got like a fill in the blank type deal and then you got 2 essays at the end which you have to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The essays they count like 25 points apiece.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the rest of is 50.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have a lot of tests?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, we've had 2 so far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're not reading novels?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you buy the novels?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not going to read them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I, I looked over them, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I hear you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  They're pretty bad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He wanted us to read a whole book in like 2 days.  It wasn't going to happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You go online, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Spark notes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I tried.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And there wasn't any, not much on them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  Which books are they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Zorba the Greek.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.  I would think there'd be notes on that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I couldn't find any.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of them you have to pay for the, the website.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's just a bunch of like little segments that was like journals from like the [INAUDIBLE] and another one's called, uh, it's by Carl Jung, Jung.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it's called Dream Reflections, Memories or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's no synopsis there in that book?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  He, he wrote that one I think too, but we don't have any test information on it to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll get to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your other classes are okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  All the others one are fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you register, uh, when, next week or so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think starting [DATE].  Maybe the next week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  You know what you're taking already?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] get the advisement thing done yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You looked at the classes.  They got what you need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got a plan?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got, I know what I probably need.  I'm thinking about the [INAUDIBLE] advisement and just getting them to sign off on it.  It's just taking too long, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  I'm not sure how helpful the advisors often are though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they have a disclaimer in there if you've ever noticed that.  It says something like though we have advisors, uh, ultimately it's your responsibility—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was getting frustrated with trying to get it done like that, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's up to you to know your requirements and, it's kind of like the graduation thing.  You're supposed to tell them I think a semester ahead if you're going to graduate.  You have to fill out a form or something telling them you're going to graduate, you intend to graduate, and if you don't, then [INAUDIBLE] or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It seems kind of odd too, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Putting responsibility on you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm changing out of chemistry to, to retail management.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's why it's kind of aggravating right now because the chemistry advisors don't know anything about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then the other ones won't do it because I'm not in that school [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll be looked at, uh, what classes are you taking now, right now?  Are you taking the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I've got—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Psyche, what else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got analytical chemistry, um, sociology, an English class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your analytical chemistry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's going good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it?  You enjoy that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why are you leaving chemistry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mainly because of math.  Just can't get the calculus, the calculus 2 class you have to take.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, I feel like I'm too far that I, I can't remember anything for the previous ones.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I already tried to take that one like 3 times, and each time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The second level of calculus?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that, is that it for math then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think there's 1 more after that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's probably totally different than calculus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it's like vector calculus maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I just can't remember how to, how to do, I basically have to start with like trigonometry again and go from there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now those classes are not your major, your math.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're, they're, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Prerequisites.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a prerequisite, but you have to take them to have the major.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But since it's not a major, you don't have to take the class here.  You could, uh, take it someplace else, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean do you really need to know that to do the chemistry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What would you want to do with chemistry if you, if you graduated with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was hoping to be, be a chemist or [INAUDIBLE] as opposed to [INAUDIBLE].  That's what I've been wanting to do.  I'm just getting aggravated with the whole math thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where's your determination?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your, your life would be so much different if you were a chemist as opposed to retail.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean where's your heart?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I want to do chemistry, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then that's what you have to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've tried it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what you have to do [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have to do chemistry then [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's just going to kill my GPA if I keep—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, do you have to, uh, pass it?  I mean do you have a C or a B in math?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You got to have, uh, like a C.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  You do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or do you just have to pass it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think you got to have a C.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because if it's not part of your major, I wouldn't think you'd have to.  Are you, aren't you allowed to take a couple of classes pass, fail?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, you think outside the box.  [LAUGHING].  Work with me.  You think different.  Those are things to check out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One thing about dealing with a bureaucracy like these universities, you got to know the rules.  If you know the rules, then, you know, it's kind of like this ID card, you know.  You got to get it, and you got to do things a certain way and then, you know, but if you, but there's always, you know, some other way to do things and you just have to figure out the back door.  So if you could take the, the math, uh, pass fail, you could pass it, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably.  This one that I was in, I withdraw, just withdrew from the class—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before the deadline or whatever, but, uh, it was just taking a lot of time and I couldn't, I couldn't do that and everything else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you take it in the summer.  Take it in the summer when you take nothing else, or take it at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They have, uh, you know, uh, ways it can, uh, accelerate the class into a smaller period of time.  They do that at [DEIDENTIFIED] too you know, like, uh, you know, mini masters, stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They may offer calculus then, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I did, the, uh, after I withdrew from that one, that's what I picked, that English class just to fill in and get more hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because in 3 weeks, uh, it's pretty intense, but that's it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's easier I think, don't you?  Just like summer school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm liking that English class right now because we're already like a quarter or a third of the way done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Was this a half semester—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Class.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's from like 5:30 to 8:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just for—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On 2 nights a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For 8 weeks instead of 16 or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they have, and that's at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they have, but they have classes like say at [DEIDENTIFIED] too you could take fast track, and they have, um, what about online?  [DEIDENTIFIED]'s got online classes.  Could just take it online?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And could you take it, uh, at, uh, the [DEIDENTIFIED] and transfer it.  There's a lot of other schools around that have online classes.  Like in the state, they got [DEIDENTIFIED].  You can do your whole degree online.  So could you take those classes online and, uh, take 6 months to do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because if that were the case, you'd pass.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's a lot of the online stuff also is set up so that you can't really proceed until you've, um, done okay in this area.  So you learn this and you prove you've learned that.  Then you can go to the next one, and if you don't, you got to keep going over it and over it until you get it, and then you move on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  There's just so much stuff that I can't remember and it's just a lot of memorization really in that calculus [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  But you'd only have to remember it for a short period of time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pass the test, move on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  That was probably my problem.  I didn't, I didn't retain it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, but I'm saying—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now that I need it, it's messing me up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I mean once I get through all the math then, you know, you don't need that for calculus—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For chemistry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean if I, if I had to tell you how many times I had to memorize the Creb cycle, the citric [INAUDIBLE] you know what that is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The citric acid cycle, the Creb cycle.  You've heard of that I'm sure in science somewhere.  I mean the things I've had to memorize so many times over and over and over.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I couldn't tell you what they are now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And every time I have to learn for biology, then they made me learn for chemistry and, uh, made me learn it in physiology I think too.  It's, uh, every time, it's like oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I heard of that, now let's learn it again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And pass the stupid test and then move on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, um, I hate to see you giving up on what you really want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, me too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because there are, I'm sure there's other ways.  You just have to think outside the box a bit and figure out how you're going to get it.  If you look on your, if you look in your, um, your catalog, the [INAUDIBLE] book, it'll tell you how many classes, what, what are the requirements to be allowed to transfer a class in, what, what, you know, what levels they can be any whatever, how many you can transfer to [DEIDENTIFIED].  Get it approved ahead of time.  Tell them that's what you're going to do because you're working.  You got to take it online.  Take it at [DEIDENTIFIED] or wherever on, over a longer period of time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You think you could do that, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I could, yeah.  If I could figure out how to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean there's, you know, correspondence class or something.  You just have to kind of do a little bit of research.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I could figure out how to do it at tech, then that'd probably be—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tech has the classes.  I don't know if they have the other one, the second one you need, but they certainly have, um, the first one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I mean that the only thing that was holding me back from that, but I've already tried it 3 times, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'd give up that easy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the thing about it is [PATIENT NAME] is that you're, when you say you tried it 3 times, you tried it 3 times the same way, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I tried it once at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, same class though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Basically.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Except it was, it was a lot different than this one.  It was weird.  This one here you have to, you got like a lab.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On Friday.  We had a lab on Fridays where it was just a, a computer program that you had to, um, use a lot of different problems on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This one over here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then there'd be homework for that one, and there'd also be homework for the class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that homework for that one was taking me like 2 and 3 hours to do, and the homework for the class was taking that long, and so I was staying up like all night every, every, uh, Wednesday and Thursday trying to do that before, before it was due.  I just couldn't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I understand that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I couldn't do it anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I think if you plan it.  That's something that you got to work on is your planning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, when you take these classes.  I mean you used to have to have them done I guess if they're not prerequisites, done by the time you graduate then.  Is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I got to check that out too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, if they're prerequisites, but I would, I would think you can, they'd be other ways to do this, but I wouldn't count on your advisor being able to tell you how to do it.  You're going to have to figure that out.  You're going to have to do some research—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On your own, and, you know, you can go to the [DEIDENTIFIED] site and they'll give you a list of classes that they have where you can go to the class, or you can take them online there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the difference, uh, from doing what you want to do in your life and not, from doing what is sort of okay can be a huge difference in the quality of your life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Plus, um, and from what I heard, chemists are employable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Retail might not be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We don't have near enough chemists.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huge shortages.  Plus don't you get more money on your scholarships being a, a science major?  What's your grade, grade point now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I lost that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Scholarship.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can you get it back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think if I, if I got, uh, after this semester, or after this year, maybe.  I'll have over a 3.0 and I can get it back, but after that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you've had your 8 semesters—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or something.  When, when would you graduate if you were, if you stayed chemistry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, probably the end of next, probably after next June, then probably one more semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about, um, summer?  Are you going next summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wasn't planning on it, but I might have to because I just keep changing my mind back and forth is what I'm doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Look, if you did your, if you stayed chemistry though.  You couldn't, couldn't you take your math in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably could, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now don't agree with me if you don't mean it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I just hate to see you giving up on all you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because I know there's a lot of ways to take calculus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hadn't really thought about the summer thing yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Summer, online, correspondence.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I'm going to be over here and not doing anything, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, if you took it online, they probably have it online at [DEIDENTIFIED] and, you know, take it over a period of time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] since we don't have school and I don't work either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you kind of cram it in and take the test and then forget it, and then just move on, but look on, look on there first and see how many classes you can take pass fail.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What exactly is, I have never heard of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you don't get an A or a B.  You get a pass or fail grade.  Most universities allow you to take a certain number of classes on a pass fail basis, and they do that just like auditing classes where you don't get a real grade.  And they do that, pass fail you get a credit.  Audit you don't, and they, they do the pass fail thing to encourage, uh, you, for instance, to take, uh, a class in religion, which you wouldn't take ordinarily.  I mean, you know, or a class in, you know, uh, bird watching or something, you know, ornithology or some biology class that you wouldn't take.  You just want to take ecology for, for your own and, uh, but you don't want to be, you know, have to worry about getting an A or something.  Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they encourage people to take classes outside their discipline by letting you take pass fail.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  I've got a lot of those random classes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you have A's and B's in them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've got [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean do you have classes, you don't have pass, you haven't, you haven't elected to take anything pass fail.  I think you can.  I mean you can check and see if you could take those 2 math classes pass fail, and if you can, then, um, and, and your department will, will allow that, then, then you're set.  Just take it here if you could pass it.  That's all you have to do.  And like I say, most people, uh, you know, people that are in, uh, business a lot of times they'll take their hard classes like their microeconomics or their accounting class at [DEIDENTIFIED] in the summer and then transfer it to [DEIDENTIFIED] because it's too hard to take there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	People do that all the time.  People that have gone to, uh, have to take chemistry for med school, they'll take intensive chemistry during the summer because they can get it out of the way and just focus on that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because if you take—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I could, if I could, uh, just take less hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  If that's all you were taking next summer is math, you could do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I could.  I was doing about 13, 14 or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and working full.  You work a lot.  There's ways.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just have to look at the, you have to get your, your, all your information out and look at it and see how long the classes are, how many weeks they are and when they meet.  Like you said, you like the ones that are in the evenings and they move along.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think, in fact, [DEIDENTIFIED], um, is a, is a school that promotes, um, taking class one at a time so that you take, instead of taking 4 classes at once, you'll take, let's say, one class for 3 weeks, and you're done with it.  Another class for 3 weeks and then you're done with it.  So that's pretty much how they have it set up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they have all the classes, um, set up online too.  They got a campus here in town up on [DEIDENTIFIED] I think where you can go and, uh, take a class usually in the evenings, and, um, be done with it.  You know, to get your calculus done in 3 weeks or something might be nice.  You could do that over break.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, over your winter break.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You guys got a month off.  You could have your calculus done then.  Did you already switch your major?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then think about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, the difference between doing what you want, doing what you don't want, especially in your case, doing a job where you could actually get paid when you get out of school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To a job where you're going to have to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you'll be working.  I would assume that if you graduate in retail, you'd stay, you'd keep working where you're at.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And try to move up to store manager or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does that look good for you in 5 years?  Is that what you want to be doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're going, you're going to be a store manager in 5 years.  [INAUDIBLE] you're already doing that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean how much more are they doing that you can't already do today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nothing, except make more money.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, uh, think about it.  If I can help you somehow, let me know because, you know, I've been through this many times.  You know there are other ways to, are your medicines okay?  Now what did you run out of last week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I ran out of Provigil.  [INAUDIBLE] it was my last, last one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much are you taking now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A day, a day or 2 I guess.  I got the 70 and the 30.  That's working out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can, I can tell now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's called Vyvanse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Vyvanse, that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not Provigil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you get your testing done with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can you get me a copy of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think I got that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So he gave you a copy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're going to get accommodations?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And did they tell you what you get for that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can be full time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Briefly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can be full time at 9 hours.  You can, you can have preferential scheduling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'm not going to make that in time I don't think since I was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can put it, in the future, whatever you can get scheduling ahead of everybody else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can get the notes.  You can get tutoring.  You can get extended time on tests.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've used that.  I use that on the, my chemistry test this week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can take the test in a separate area where it's going to be more quiet, and I think that's important to do take advantage of all that.  How many credit hours do you have now, this June?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This June, uh, I got about 15 since I didn't take that English class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, your other medicine's okay, your Prozac?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, we have confirmed you're on 60?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were on 40 and then we went up last, a month ago, right, yeah.  So now you're on 60.  Has that made a difference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What have you noticed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.  Um, I haven't really noticed a whole lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In terms of recurring thoughts or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's still going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it any better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kind, kind of.  It's kind of hard to pinpoint.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's, that's [INAUDIBLE] though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you think about it, not long ago you could pinpoint it pretty easy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How you doing sleeping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm getting a lot more [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is, is that cramming or is that, are you just being overly thorough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably a little bit of both.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it?  You're really starting to work some more on your organization, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  The biggest problem with all that scheduling stuff, I'll sit down and try to start [INAUDIBLE] advising information and then I'll just start doing something else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See, that's the one thing that the people in the disability office can help you with.  I mean if you can get stuff together like I'm telling you about, and, uh, make an appointment with them and go sit down with them, they can help sort it out with you.  And that's what they're there for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's why you went to get all that testing and got all that done.  Are you taking both the Vyvanse in the morning, the 70 and the 30?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It lasts pretty much all day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See, if you're studying late at night like that, your medicine isn't working.  You're not being real efficient.  Um, you really need to try to figure out ways to study when your medicine is working.  If you're going to be working at, uh, the store, the working at the store should be done when you're not so, you know, focused.  I mean you could do that automatic.  You don't need to be on medicine then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I can try and split it up a little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Split what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I kind of need it at night when I'm in school too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I agree.  Yeah, I agree, and.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I can definitely notice a difference when I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many hours does it last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, about I start class about 9:00 and then I get off around like 4:00, 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you having trouble sleeping at night too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never.  Not really.  Once I lay down I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're pretty good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] on here, see how you do.  Look into those things though.</p>

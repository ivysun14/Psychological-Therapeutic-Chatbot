<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it—- well, first of all, I assume you were at work yesterday and you're here today that it—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm okay-ish. I think there's just some soft tissue that's tender from sleeping funny. Nothing too bad. But unfortunately, those kind of things I apparently really can't tell for quite a while. So if there's nothing broken, you just wait. But there's an enormous amount of red tape revolving around the accident. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened? I mean, we haven't talked about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, it's not a big deal. There was a girl behind us who nearly hit us once, and she was doing something. She was glancing very intently at her lap, and about a minute later she hits. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>[00:54.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty sure she was texting, basically. She kind of gave us a bunch of stuff that wasn't actually real in terms of insurance. That's what the problem was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or something like that. Either that or the company went under and there was somebody else. We had to track down her real insurance, which is why it got really complicated. On top of it, I was really really shaken up. I've actually never been in a car accident before. My car has been hit, but it was parked. So to me at the time, it was pretty traumatic even though it was really low speed. (pause)</p>

<p>[01:56.1]</p>

<p>Like I said, I was just very—- how can I explain it—- disoriented for the day of, that kind of thing. (pause) [I have to work] because to me, it was something that had never happened to me before. We were planning to sell the car that day. We are selling it to a dealer who is going to basically assess the damages and file the stuff for us, just so we don't have to worry about it anymore, then get that set up and then basically take part of it off the cost of the car and then we'll get the money. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then be reimbursed by her insurance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that's going to make it a lot easier. If it had been somebody else, they probably wouldn't have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, like an individual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But at the same time, selling it to a dealer is a lot more expensive for me because I don't get as much as it's worth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>[02:57.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's just going to be nice to not have to worry about it for a while. It's been a lot of stress. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really I just want to cut out all the things in my life that just cause me lots of stress. (pause) I'm kind of emotionally shutting down on that level. (pause) If I don't really need to do something, I won't deal with it anymore, just because of the stress levels of everything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry. A logistical thing just popped into my head which I had forgotten I need to ask you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is that I need to make a change to our Tuesday time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you meet at 3:45 instead of 3:00?</p>

<p>[04:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Forever or just tomorrow—- I mean, next week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it's not good, I could try to—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Quite likely I can. I do not have my iPad with me, so if you wouldn't mind, if you could send me something or—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let me do it now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or write it down or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think actually that would be really helpful for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's a very narrow window for me if I don't catch the bus right after work on Tuesdays, I make it extremely late here. (pause) So it actually works out to be better. I just need to make sure I have it because I don't have much of my stuff with me here today. </p>

<p>[04:57.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so what I wrote was "Could you confirm that Tuesdays at 3:45 rather than 3:00, starting on 9/18, works. Thanks."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just to be clear, I'm not giving away your time to somebody else. It's just sort of the time when I eat lunch and take a break.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, it's not a big deal. Even if you were, it wouldn't—- you know what? It's easier for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really have a possession thing like "This is my time," in terms of that, you know? So it's not—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pardon me for just a moment. I need to make sure everything is okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I got a text message.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that's your—- yeah. It's that kind of day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sorry, you were saying that your—- (voices overlapping)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically that I'm really wiped out. If there's something I don't need to do, I really don't do it.</p>

<p>[06:01.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially in terms of dealing with complicated situations. (pause) And so—- yeah. (chuckles) It's just easier for me to either avoid it or find some other work-around. Like "Don't feel like going into store because this place is hard to get into and hard to park, so I will mail back this thing." You know, that kind of thing. I don't think I'm avoiding life. I think I'm just trying to prioritize where to put my energy towards. Now this may be the world's biggest rationalization, I don't know, but I have—- I'm exhausted. I'm about to go into a really big launch again. You know, I've just had a lot of stress in my life. I've been in an enormous amount of pain. I do have to kind of prioritize what I can and can't do. </p>

<p>[07:14.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't think what you're describing is mostly neurotic. I think it's mostly being totally worn out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it's not like I'm not going out in public. I work with the public for a living. I just don't feel like going to the store to get ramen, so I get it off of Amazon. It's not like I have a terror. My mother was actually grilling me on this, this is why I'm thinking this way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I don't think you're agoraphobic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. But she—- the reason why apparently is that—- and she told me why she's doing this, not that she's specifically trying to project this onto me. But when she was young and very cosmopolitan and she was dealing with living in places in very different times that she didn't want to do, it was very easy for her to withdraw and she wanted to make sure that I didn't fall into the same pitfall.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>[08:06.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like "No, this is more like grocery shopping, that kind of stuff." Dealing with having to have an argument with somebody over whether it's the right cable for something when I know it is, that kind of stuff, is not like I'm afraid of people. I just don't feel like dealing with dumb people. Like I said, we talked about it and she wasn't super-concerned, but she did ask me quite a few questions about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I imagine you want to avoid dumb people because it's sort of tiring being frustrated with people, and you're probably feeling pretty thin-skinned with everything that's been going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so it just isn't worth it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you don't have the resources for it the way that, though you might not be thrilled to do it, you would have more resources for it [if things were easier].</p>

<p>[08:57.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I'm just stacking the deck in my favor right now. And I think—- she did point out that for a long time I used to be sort of a favorite customer with many shop people, shop girls. Yeah, cause I would go out and she pointed out "You're so loquacious and you would do things like bring them brownies and things like that." So apparently when she went out to the local organic market there, they remembered her as being my mom and they asked how I was doing. She was like "Oh, have you made friends with the girls there?" and I was like "No." She was a little concerned about that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not so much that as much as the fact that right now, I sort of have to prioritize my energy in terms of this. I used to be one of those people that after I was in an area of the store and I had time, I'd stop in and chat with people that I knew. I didn't know them outside of the store really. But I just did it. (pause)</p>

<p>[10:02.3]</p>

<p>Maybe I am, you know, withdrawing from that a little bit, but right now also there's a difference once you head further south, once you get in the mid-Atlantic, you do have a friendlier aspect to it. So it's not really entirely just that, you know? It's not like mid-West friendly like "Hey, do you need a ride home whenever I leave?" But it's still—- you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. It's not uptight and cranky like you get around here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's also just the affect makes it sound crankier than they are up here. But like I said, it's sort of a weird thing. But it's not quite that, like I said, but she was a little concerned. </p>

<p>[10:57.2]</p>

<p>So it's something that, if I do see myself withdrawing specifically because I don't want to be around people, not just dumb people but people, then that's something to be concerned about. As opposed to having an argument with somebody over whether or not I need to buy this kind of shoe and like "Well, I know, because I'm going to be putting orthotics in it." Like having this argument with somebody over whether they're selling me the right size shoe, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>But, I don't know. I'm just looking forward to simplifying my life. It may be slightly more complicated without a car, I don't know. But at least I don't have to worry about the car. I don't have to worry about my neighbors hating my car. I don't have to worry about anyone hitting my car, amongst other things like that. I've gotten to know most of the neighbors at this point, but there's a couple of people who seem to think I'm faking being handicapped. </p>

<p>[12:01.8]</p>

<p>I think I told you I've gotten some nasty notes, that kind of thing. And fortunately, I've never had that trouble with that before. I think it's the equating Mercedes with handicapped tags. I think they see that as being privileged.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I get it. It's just nuts. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's stupid and they need to be spending more time thinking about their own lives than somebody else's, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've never had that experience until I moved up here, and I've lived in some pretty cranky towns. At one point I was living in Maryland and had no problem. But at some point up here, everybody is in my business. I get nasty notes about recycling. It's like I get nasty notes all the freaking time. I even got one from my landlord about my dog's poop.</p>

<p>[12:54.8]</p>

<p>So I'm just kind of like whatever I can do to reduce the amount of stress that I have, I'm totally up for. I'm going to try to get some physical therapy enough so that I can bike.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We'll see. I had trouble getting my doctor to get me some physical therapy because he explained that that's not really the scope of physical therapy. It's basically supposed to be if you have an injury to be fixed, not to rehabilitate for a disease, which is very strange because I actually had physical therapy—- what's it called—- occupational therapy to learn how to use my hands so I wouldn't get my arms screwed up again. So I thought that was kind of weird that it was true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it was preventative?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I also had it before I had surgery, not to specifically try to fix and try to prevent the surgery, but actually to build up the muscles around the area.</p>

<p>[14:00.3]</p>

<p>They basically had to build up the triceps to support the weight of the replacement. So this is not official stuff, this was groundbreaking. They realized if they build up that area—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —- then when the weight was in there and all this other stuff, the growth would be great. And actually it was. It was significantly better than the first one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Basically preparatory physical therapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And the only thing I can't—- I mean, I still have trouble, but the only thing I could do before the surgery and can't do afterwards is use chopsticks, which is—- I know. This is not—- I mean, if I lived in San Francisco, that might be a hardship. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But not here. But I've regained—- it's painful sometimes, but I've regained a lot of the stuff. So it's really weird not to have a doctor who is onboard with trying to increase my quality of life.</p>

<p>[15:06.7]</p>

<p>So what I want to do is talk to my rheumatologist and see if she can trump him on that one, and say "You know what? I want to see if there's anything I can do to be able to try to use this." Also if there's anyone I can speak with—- I don't mind, I mean, I don't have a whole lot of money, but if there's something I could do to get a bike that's adaptive so the stride is different or something like that, it would be easier. That would be fine too. I just want to be able to get around if I need to. So, I don't know. We'll see. (pause) I'm just sick and tired of limping through my 30s, you know? My 20s were a lot better. But I guess, such is life.</p>

<p>[16:00.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, these things sound less like red flags about your mental health and more just [really unfortunate.]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I understand. My mom isn't around to see me and to get a temperature for it, so she has to ask a lot of questions. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh sure, absolutely. I don't mean to—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. I'm just saying that, you know. A little bit is projecting for her because she was depressed (inaudible at 16:32.2). But it's more about trying to adapt again. I signed up to become an affiliate of the Lab at the university, so we'll see what happens.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. What does that mean?</p>

<p>[16:55.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like their—- how do I explain it? It's like their little think tank. Instead of being like an institute—- instead of being an institute purely on these complex ideas, this is more like taking these new innovations and trying to find applications for them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, sort of like tech transfer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't really know because I haven't been to one of the things yet, but we'll see. It just looked interesting. It seems to be a little bit chaotic in that it's everything from 3D printing to like, you know—- it seems a little bit like a bunch of mad scientists, but it would be kind of interesting. I was really sad to see that they don't have a Hacker Dojo here. </p>

<p>[18:05.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a really common thing out on the other coast. You see it at other places too. It's kind of like an office space where they teach people how to do things like building things, wiring stuff up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You called it a Hacker Dojo?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's called Hacker Dojo, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really what it's called. It's basically kind of like a machine shop but for people in electronics. They don't have one here, which I'm shocked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's amazing they don't have one here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or maybe they do, it's just called [inaudible]. (chuckles) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's usually separate from that too, because this one is down the street but it's not like—- it's something separate. It's something you pay a membership to and you have access to stuff that you—- that kind of stuff. It's interesting but they don't have anything like that so far I've been looking for. </p>

<p>[19:00.1]</p>

<p>But I'm still going to start asking people if they've heard about something like that here, because it would be nice to—- it's not just, for me, the access to the equipment because I have a lot of the equipment. It's more the social aspect of it, like "Hey, what are you working on? Oh, nothing big, I'm just fixing this lamp, however I am thinking about this type of a circuit board design," blah blah blah. That's the kind of social interaction that I need. I don't need the grocery store socialization. That sounds terrible but, you know. I'm just exhausted. I need to be around things that give me energy as opposed to the other way around. But I guess we'll see where it's going.</p>

<p>[19:59.9]</p>

<p>I did something I almost never do. We had a big store meeting last Sunday. Some people that I briefly know but have almost never done anything with at all—- this is so unlike me. They wanted to go get drunk before the meeting. I did not get drunk before the meeting. However, I did go out and had a drink with them before the meeting because it was in between being done with work and the meeting and stuff like that. Just going and spending time and being silly with people was kind of nice. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sort of perceived as not being a whole lot of fun. It's more that I really don't have the desire to go out drinking. It's further out. Like if they want to come in, I'm fine. I just don't want to go all the way out there to do that kind of thing.</p>

<p>[20:58.4]</p>

<p>It's not that I'm not any fun as much as it's locational. So that definitely helped because it was a meeting in which it was sort of filled with a lot of insincerity and therefore, you know, having been with people sort of at one point or another made it a little easier to bear. (pause)</p>

<p>But, I don't know. I'm just trying to keep going, I guess, which is pretty much the big thing. (pause) I don't like being non-active. I know I can't do anything about my disease per se, so I just try and do something to keep myself occupied because otherwise it's a lot to think about, you know?</p>

<p>[22:05.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. No, I imagine it's balancing out, not wanting to physically or emotionally [balance yourself on one side] and wanting to be engaged and stimulated enough to help yourself feel better to the extent that you can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to feel productive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, part of it is just picking battles and also realizing there are certain activities that have more of an emotional drag than the benefit of them. I feel like a complete and total jerk for doing a cost/benefit analysis on most of my interactions with people, but you know what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. When you only have so much energy, I guess it becomes important. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How often will the think tank group meet?</p>

<p>[23:02.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It looks like they have one major thing once a month, but I don't know what happens aside from that because they don't post everything on the webpage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: From what I can understand, the Institution is in great need of somebody who is an information designer because they have lots of very beautiful pages with lots of information, some of which overlaps. Like the Venn diagram of where everything is does not make sense. Like you have to navigate to this, this, this and this and you may find this out there. It's really hard to find everything out. (pause) But I think I kind of need to see what happens to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It could be nothing at all. Like it's one of those things where it could very well be something that doesn't interest me, but I want to try it. That's something I'm willing to take a gamble on.</p>

<p>[24:06.5]</p>

<p>That kind of thing, yeah. I just need to be around the right people to make me feel energized. Things that will make me mentally stimulated. (pause) I've just been very exhausted, anxious, all that kind of stuff. (pause) Not for any really good reason, just because, you know? (pause) </p>

<p>[25:03.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, for a lot of good reasons. A lot of really unfortunate reasons, but really legitimate reasons. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Legitimate reasons, yeah. (pause) Yeah. I just don't want to give up yet. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, in terms of like trying to find a way to fit in here, that kind of thing. Find something that is going to bring me happiness, that kind of thing. Pardon me for just a minute.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's see if that's—- no, it's just a new thing saying it three times. Okay. Who knows. My text messaging is extremely weird. </p>

<p>[26:03.7]</p>

<p>But yeah, the other thing that is just really exhausting obviously is I have a husband who has a lot of problems, so it's like—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How has that been? You continue to be able to get out of the house with the [new arrangement]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. Getting out of the house, I know he's exhausted. (pause) He's got a lot of aches and pains lately too, and I think that he's realizing also that he needs to stop eating so much, I guess, is part of it too. Like eating junk food, that kind of thing, but also getting out and about. I don't think—- to be honest, I've been so focused I haven't really been asking questions, but I don't think his sobriety is especially great. </p>

<p>[26:57.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you guys going to have sort of a date night last Friday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We were thinking about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how I would've gotten away for that. (pause) I didn't go over last Friday at all. Hmmm. There had to be something valid. (pause) There was something going on, I just can't remember for the life of me what it was. But yeah, I think we were going to try and do something, but it just didn't pan out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were saying your impression is that his sobriety hasn't been great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I think, but I can't really get—- you know. (pause) It's really hard because it's like I really really want to connect with him, and sometimes he's so off in his own world that it's not really possible. (pause)</p>

<p>[28:16.1]</p>

<p>I just think that—- I don't know. I think it's been good for him to get out of the house. He's starting to finally get to know people at work, but I think that he's also just mostly overwhelmed. He claims he doesn't care about certain things, but I know he does. (pause) Like he claims that it hasn't bothered him that his mom hasn't like called him since he said the whole thing of "I really need you to act like you care about me" kind of thing. "When I seem depressed, don't change the subject and don't like get off the phone."</p>

<p>[28:58.7]</p>

<p>Like, yeah. She called him halfway on vacation somewhere and hasn't called him since. She's like "I don't know what to say." I'm like—- it's so funny when I was telling him about this, I was like "Well, you know, you can probably put into Google 'what you say to a depressed child' or something like that. There's probably at least some things, like an article saying things to say and things to not say." He said he doesn't care about it, but I know he does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just—- (pause) It bothers me a lot because—- (pause) when he has to sort of push those feelings down, I think that he withdraws from a lot of people in terms of caring what they think and feel and being connected with other people, you know? When he has to start cutting that off, I think it's very hard for him to cut off just one person. I think he starts to get numb for everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Including you?</p>

<p>[30:09.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. I think he has to become numb. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there moments where you feel close to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely are. It's just—- (pause) It's very difficult sometimes because I spent so many years being an effective communicator and not getting anywhere that not only have I gotten bad habits now, but I'm mostly just bitter. It's like yeah, I towed the line in terms of this. I'm the person who did all the things right and I didn't get anywhere, so what is there for me?</p>

<p>[30:59.2]</p>

<p>I mean, it sounds ridiculous feeling that way, but you know. (pause) But it's just one of those things that's really painful sometimes. Especially because I can't easily divide out what is hormonal and what is behavioral with that kind of thing. (pause) He's just being withdrawn, that kind of thing. He's never been really good at doing anything every day, so therefore he's not really all that great about doing his testosterone every day either. (pause) </p>

<p>[32:06.1]</p>

<p>I used to make jokes about the fact that for someone who has OCD that he has exactly zero rituals that I know about. Okay, how in the world can that be? Not that I know anything about it, but it's just kind of funny. (pause) Yeah. (pause) He just gets so off in another world that sometimes it's really—- and it's not always like that. I mean, often he isn't but—- (pause) He tries, he really does. Just sometimes he's not successful. (pause)</p>

<p>[33:22.0]</p>

<p>I just wish it—- (pause) I just wish we could get resolution to situations, you know? (pause) It's really hard when you can't get resolution. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like with family, that kind of thing. They always put everything at arm's length so you never really feel like anything is ever resolved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even when things are supposedly resolved, they're never really resolved, that kind of thing. (pause) That's really frustrating. </p>

<p>[34:15.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [How much is left hanging with stuff.]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, how much trying to make contact really doesn't work. (pause) One of the biggest things that's really hard for me about this is if it were—- the type of dysfunction in his family is something that is not very easy to talk to friends about, to dump on, because it's something that's so foreign to most people in terms of how in-laws behave or this or that, that even for people who were abandoned, they don't like—- I have a couple of friends whose parents ran off and left them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just so weird that it's not something that most people can even remotely relate to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see that. A lot of people I see have more or less functionality in parents. There are some people that I see who had parents who really are not or really have not been.</p>

<p>[35:19.8]</p>

<p>One of the real problems with that is that it's alienating because people generally don't imagine parents could be that way, like so neglectful and so cruel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or at least it doesn't fit into one of the archetypes like, you know, "My mom was a drug addict," you know what I mean? Like something that makes sense for that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I see your point. Yeah. It's just like—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, like "My mom is a well-educated person."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "But couldn't give a shit if I'm depressed."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "And isn't going to call me or ask me about anything."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. "They haven't seen me in almost a decade."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like people tend to either sort of want to somehow make it a better story, like there must be some good reason for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some good reason or something like that.</p>

<p>[36:14.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or there must be something you could do about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. It's very—- and the thing is what's even harder right now is that, you know, my parents try very—- they do. They have a reasonably good relationship with Mike, but sometimes he, because he's so used to being neglected, that it kind of spooks him. Like my mom called him the night after the accident just to sort of like say "Hey, I know that you had some time to have some downtime, how are things going?" And he's like "Uh, if there were something wrong, I would've called you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He just sort of doesn't get that they're acting like reasonable, caring parents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's certainly—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the difficulty with having the parents that he had is that, in addition to being alienating, it's very difficult because when somebody treats you well or is caring—- not always, but sometimes—- it can just feel weird or scary or disconcerting.</p>

<p>[37:21.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Actually it's funny because I sort of picked up a little bit of the habit from him. Whenever anyone just genuinely liked him for no—- like just because they had good chemistry and they think you're pretty great, that kind of thing—- it makes him feel very awkward because he's like "I haven't done anything to deserve that. Why does anyone like me?" </p>

<p>I usually break out of it pretty well, but it's very easy to fall into that trap of that too. But yeah, it's very hard for him to imagine why anybody would want to—- you know. And it's easier for him on some level to be quasi-adopted by my best friend Bryant's mother than my own mother. (chuckles) One, because she's a doctor and therefore she knows how to approach him in a way of like talking about things that make it easier.</p>

<p>[38:17.6]</p>

<p>But also it's because of the fact that like—- I think just in general that it's more distanced in terms of that. She's like a universal mom to everybody in terms of that kind of thing. She takes care of a lot of stuff, that kind of thing. So it's easier for him to do that. But it's still very hard for him to really want to connect with people. He cried so darn hard. He did everything in the book that someone who's young—- and now that he's grown up, he's not doing it. Quite frankly, for many years he tried to make them want to have contact with him.</p>

<p>[39:09.0]</p>

<p>His dad isn't entirely neglectful but isn't exactly there for him either. He's definitely more interested in Mike now that he's graduated and is at the university. But it's not like he picks up the phone to call all that much. But he's just not that kind of guy. But it's definitely kind of—- Mike calls him Dad. He's like a favorite uncle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the best it's ever going to get too. And quite frankly, I call it a win if he's just like an uncle, you know? (pause) But it does make me worry—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if it's a win, it's still like you—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a loss.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- lost.</p>

<p>[39:58.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It is. But—- (pause) I really feel like, and maybe this is silly, that this kind of stuff really enforces my feelings on why it is that I like to—- (pause) keep things traditional, I guess is probably the best way of saying it. (pause) Seeing how screwed up things could become because of not really going by the way that rules should be kind of thing—- does that make sense? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thinking about how his parents have been with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How his parents have been with him in general, that kind of stuff. (pause) It is easier to—- for example, like the whole thing of like "Okay, we'll pay for the Club and we'll ask you for money later." You know what? No more of that because it's too awkward to ask for money later, you know what I mean? It is so much easier just to do—- specifically like, you know, because we took them to dinner or breakfast for Mother's Day. It is much easier just to—- because they have such an inability to talk about money, talk about this, talk about that, to inform about anything—- it is much easier just not to—- not just not rely upon them, but it's like—- (pause) It's definitely an example of how failures can really screw things up, that kind of thing. (pause) </p>

<p>[42:20.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because he (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Letting children make their own decisions is, I think, the big thing. And that's hard for me to say this because I was a kid who could make my own decisions, though occasionally I was picked up and turned around like a toddler and pointed to the right thing. The kinds of things that they let their kids make their own decisions on is just outrageous. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Of course. It's like giving your kid some independence or some freedom when you've paid enough attention to know that they could handle it in the way you're giving it to them and you can rely on them. And there's being horribly neglectful and calling it something else. But they're two very different things.</p>

<p>[43:23.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I will see you Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At 3:45.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 3:45. That's great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thank you.</p>

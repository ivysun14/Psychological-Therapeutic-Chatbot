<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) I haven't decided yet but I feel like the extra hours are becoming sort of a diminishing returns for me in terms of the amount of exhaustion I'm getting and I think the side effects, but I'm not certain. It's just like it's coincided with it. So, I'm kind of...right now it's crunching numbers and seeing that kind of stuff, ya know? Cuz it's pretty much (inaudible at 00:00:56].8) sleep again, ya know, and it's hard, but I um (pause) about half the time I come in here I have no idea what to talk about...at all. Like, there's like...because I'm so tired I have exactly zero in my life. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I spend um pretty much (inaudible at 00:01:24].6) trying to think about what I'm going to talk about. It's still early. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, if I can make a suggestion?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh (pause) you could just talk about like literally whatever pops into your head at the moment, even if it seems unimportant, irrelevant, inappropriate, whatever. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ya know, um, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Being put on the spot for that's kind of rough. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I, I, I understand. It's always...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:01:59.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... a hard thing to do in practice, but, um, at least from where I sit that's perfectly fine. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well, (pause) I've been sort of thinking about the fact that I'm just fairly sure of getting to know the city a little bit and figuring out where things are and all of a sudden I feel like I'm on a slow track of doing that. That most people are like oh, you've been here like a long time. And I'm like not really. I still have boxes full of stuff and I still don't know how to get from one place to another, and I really haven't done much, um...and that's okay I think. But the thing is, is that I'm already screwed up in my head trying to figure out how to get out of here and get somewhere else. I don't know how. Um, ya know. It might be that, ya know...to be honest I really feel like a lot of things I did about him actually trying to pick up a tenure faculty position right now because I don't think he has the skills to be able to put together like a strategy of what he wants to do and all that. Ya know what I'm talking about? He still needs to be told what to do more or less...at least to some extent, and, um, but at the same time there's ya know...I know that he doesn't...neither one of us really like it here either and so we're sort of trying to find some way to get out of here for a bit, but I don't know how ya know. I just...thinking about as winter is approaching, thinking of the dread of having...well last winter wasn't bad...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but the winter before was really bad, ya know, and I just...I don't know. (pause) So, kind of just figuring out how to get out of here ya know. And I just feel really guilty (pause). We just, ya know, (pause) we're not really helping (pause). (whispers) Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, my allergies are bothering me, my eyes, but yeah just...and I feel so silly feeling this way. I really do because it's not that much work, but to me it's exhausting and so having to be like (sighs) you know sort of zombie walking is just really frustrating I guess is the easiest way (inaudible at 00:04:59].1), ya know. I feel like um...I have to have a whole lot of systems in place to make sure I don't forget things, that kind of stuff. Cuz it's very easy for me to do, so I've been trying to get a lot of sleep and, ya know (pause). It's just (sighs)...everything seems to be so damned difficult and exhausting to do, ya know? And not worth it. And um I'm sick of it. (pause) I don't know if it's just my attitude or, ya know, physical limitations...maybe a little bit of both. Um (pause) ya know in my head I see it as a weakness of (pause). ya know, motivation (pause) but (inaudible at 00:06:21].4) really bad either, ya know. I don't know what it is. (pause) I um, but it's just everything's so exhausting. Like trying to drive...and I say over and over to myself I cannot call off work today. I cannot call off work today. I must be at work today. Ya know. Specifically to make myself go. And it wasn't really...like I mean I was sore this morning. I wasn't as sore as yesterday but, um, it was just (pause), I'm just exhausted, ya know. And so...and um, frustrated because what we're going through is something that not many people understand around me, and I'm so sick of it being the focus of most of my life, ya know? And um, it's hard not to have it be the focus of one's life when you have to say okay well I can't do this. I can't do that. That kind of thing. But I am hopefully just...I have a boss that, now that she is no longer my direct sup...not direct but related supervisor, um, I haven't seen her that much and so we're trying to schedule something so we can do something together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just to get out of the house and do something fun. She seemed extremely enthusiastic about it, so just going to because I feel like I need to spend some time with somebody from work but I don't really want to go out cuz it's kind of a drag to make it all the way back home, ya know? It sounds I know stupid but it's, ya know it's just (inaudible at 00:08:14].7) to get back home so (sighs), so that's been pretty much, ya know. I just...(pause)...I had been feeling like the past couple of weeks the things that I normally can get done during the week aren't getting done, ya know, and I'm not really beating myself up about it, but I am concerned that if...ya know it's cuz I've done this for 2 weeks now with the longer hours, or 3 weeks or something like that, and I am getting concerned that it's going to start...if I don't start getting used to it then it's going to be like this permanently and so I have to sort of do the trade off of, ya know, what's gonna be, ya know, better for me in terms of, ya know, longer hours, that kind of thing. So I guess we'll see where that goes. It's just (pause) (sighs) I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:09:17.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) That's pretty much the...pretty much the long and short of almost all of it. Um, I think I talked quite a bit before about how like my job is... my job and what happens at work is changing a lot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot like very, very quickly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because there's new senior management in retail and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The head of retail, new guy, and um, a lot of changes have been going through and they've sort of been trickling down to us and it just really...certain things are very frustrating. Things we could do before we can't do now, ya know? And um (pause) it is really hard because I'm also spending more time with customers you have to deal with. Normally I used to spend the great majority of my time doing training of some sort where I would be training employees, working in training ya know customers. That kind of thing. But there's been an increased amount of training on...that I've been doing...not training but actually doing iPhone repairs and swaps and things like that, and um, it's getting really, really frustrating because it's like before I had the power to do certain things if necessary. Um, now I can't. Um, in terms of things that, ya know, and it seems like right now it has just been just...I don't know. I'm just sick of the pushback. I'm sick of everything ya know. And I'm not even sick of the customers. I mean yes, it is frustrating that they for some reason think that if they break something that, ya know, that it should be covered under the warranty and all. I don't understand, but there's no other warranty in the world where I could drop something or like call warranty, whatever, if you break it that it gets a replacement free, but ya know. But it's even more than that. Like I need to tell people that there are parts that aren't around any more. Like it's very hard to get a hold of this. I don't know when it's coming in. Um, ya know, this isn't covered. I can't, ya know, I can't do this, I can't do that, and it's like I feel like (pause)...it's not just me being bullied by the customers. I feel like I can't...I don't have the leverage to do my job the way I should, ya know. Like it used to be that like if someone had a problem with some device and it was documented as being a problem and then they went out of warranty, ya know, I was able to do some leverage to cover it, ya know, because they said oh, we've been trying to troubleshoot it for the past month and it's still not working. I can't do that any more. And I'm just extremely, ya know, frustrated because I can't do my job the way I want to. Um, I'm not one of those people that simply just hates customers. We got a lot of bad press over at this one store recently. Um, if you're ever...if you just look up evil genius and Microsoft and you'll see it. They apparently had things like one of the managers used to have highly discounted computers for free plastic surgery and like that, a shrine to the customers they all hated and like yeah. All kinds of stuff. It was really bad. It's making the news right now because it's like well ya know. For most of the stuff I mean I know...what they said I know absolutely has to be true because they have real information for it. But I also know that the information that they're giving is probably 5 years old or 4 years old cuz the procedure they're describing is pretty old. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's getting us a lot of really bad...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...press and that makes it difficult when you are trying to get a customer to trust you with something and they hear oh, yeah I heard that like when you were mad you went in the back and peed on my phone and things like that. And it was like oh God, no, we don't do that, ya know. I don't really have a value...like I...it just make it very complicated to have to make excuses for something that that specifically I have no way of validating and I would never think to...nobody in my store would ever think to do that kind of stuff, ya know. So, but it's just...it's exhausting. It's really, really exhausting being me and I'm sick of being exhausted. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:14:00.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just want to find a way. I don't care how much hard work it would take but if there is something I could do, somehow they could follow to just get...have things get easier for me in terms of like not feeling as exhausted or feeling like, ya know, what I'm doing (inaudible at 00:14:17].1) is going somewhere. I really feel like I'd be more than willing to do it. It's just a matter of (pause) trying to carve out that piece and figure out how and what I need to do, ya know. Cuz it's killing me, ya know? (sighs) (pause) The having-Dave-leave-in-the-morning thing has definitely been good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Though he's been...between everything else he's just having breakdown over the littlest things and I feel tremendously bad for him because he's just not coping with it well. But I think he's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he's doing things where there's some consequence if he doesn't leave in the mor...like some consequences...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Two hours of community service or some sort of voluntary, yeah. I mean I'm glad but God. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, so he's calling every morning ya know before (inaudible at 00:15:14].1) at work whatever blah, blah, blah, and if there is some reason that he can't um...like because he's taking care of me I call in and say that that, ya know, that is true, and um like, ya know, the other day like as we were getting (inaudible at 00:15:31].4) the car, ya know, is having problems again and this and that, and it's just...he just shuts down really easily. He gets so frustrated. It's like well, you know here's the belt problem again. Like well why don't you call the mechanic, and he says but I can't get it in today. I'm like yeah, call the mechanic and find out if you can drop it off like tonight and they can look at it in the morning, ya know. But he's just...and I understand. Trust me there's a lot of it that's really frustrating. I had to figure out to FedEx a check to Cincinnati before Friday...and not just me FedExing the check but also (inaudible at 00:16:09].0) for the people on the other end actually being able to process and find it, which is actually like it's a credit union so they're not as worried about getting everything, yeah. So I was like already stressing out about that and just...these are not hard things. They're really not. But they seem to...you know and I'm sort of picking up his like low tolerance for frustration ya know? Kind of...I mean I feel like in general I've picked up all his bad habits. [0:16:42.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, (pause) you're in such a passive role in so much of what you're talking about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, (pause) and I think that's really disturbing for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's also the fact that, ya know, having to...having to anticipate ahead of time what could go wrong and what I can do to mitigate it. I don't want to have to think about that with everything I do. But right now it's just that things are so hard that I have to worry about things before they even happen. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, it's very hard to be this passive for me, ya know? And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's nothing you can really do about your health. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nothing you can really do about your energy. There's not a whole lot you can really do about your finances. There's not a whole lot you can really do about your husband. [0:17:41.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. (pause) There's very little I have control over, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I do think you want somebody (inaudible at 00:17:58].7) somebody and I know you know this (inaudible at 00:18:01].0) but I don't think that matters (chuckles). I'd hate to tell you look, here's what you can do. Here are the 17 steps to getting yourself...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...out of this mess and making things better. Um, you know no matter how many cartwheels and back flips and loop de loops...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There have been situations in my life where it's been very complicated but I have been able to sort of figure out okay so first I have to do this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then these two things have to happen simultaneously, ya know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But right now I just am just in a waiting game. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's um, ya know we see whether or not things get better or worse and (inaudible at 00:18:38].3) we go forward ya know. I (pause) think that's part of the reason why I go out of my way to do other things for people is because it gets me distracted from my own issues and thinking about them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my mom was kind of giving me a little bit of flack about the fact that there's a guy I work with who he um, ya know, basically is having...like he's worked for Microsoft off and on a lot but he needs to have a real steady real income blah, blah, blah, and I was explaining that Amazon was...you know that they actually had all these articles of how they actually prefer people from the military that used to be (because he's a Marine) and like this and that, and so I was like stop taking care of him. Start taking care of you. Like, yeah, I can't like say that...you know I can't put the effort into finding the fact that Amazon likes people who are reserve Marines and go to the Square and this, ya know. That actually makes me feel like I'm a tool that can be used and, ya know what I mean? It's something that I can do and I know and he's grateful for. Um, ya know? But I don't have any...anything that I can do to try and concentrate on me, so it's also kind of a nice distraction, ya know, and it makes me feel like I'm at least useful. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [0:20:00.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? And...that's just one example of many things like that. It's like I can do things for other people, um, I'm just not very good about doing anything for myself right now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's mostly because of the fact that I am not in the...you know I do know the knowledge base or I do have the power to do so, and that makes it very, very, ya know...and I don't like that kind of stuff. And that'd be okay if it was one or two things but there's very little power in my life. I get to choose what color I'm wearing that day and that's about it. And ya know that's (sighs) ya know (pause) it's hard not having that, ya know? (pause) I, um, have a lot of self-esteem issues also related to my parents which is I feel really shallow even talking about this. Um, no matter what I seem to do I cannot...I have gained...I've lost...okay...I gained 80 pounds from steroids. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [0:21:12.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I lost some of it a while back. I have gained quite a bit of it back. I seem to be gaining it no matter what I do. Like I have done the whole writing down what I'm eating and all this other crap. I think that there's probably some sort of thyroid something going on that's not right, but who knows. Um, but it's just like I already feel extremely, extremely unattractive and just in general just I don't know. It's just very (pause) I don't feel very good about myself and this is especially one of the, ya know, in terms of that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:21:50].7) important thing for people. I don't think that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...makes you superficial to be feeling bad about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, most people I think are affected by their feelings about having, ya know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's been somewhat of an emotional thing for me too because it's like I was having a hard time finding pants that fit, ya know that kind of stuff ya know. And it's like oh my God. I am not ready to go down this road again now, and so I'm just (pause)...I'm bitter about it because I don't medicate myself with food. Occasionally they're like okay, well, ya know let's go get some ice cream or something but not like I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:22:40.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know I'm not driven by that kind of thing ya know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's like I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the steroids or a thyroid thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. The thing is, is I gained...I mean all the weight I have on me now is from the steroids. I'm not on steroids now. Though if I didn't know better I would think I was because I've lately...and I think it's...I mean it's also like a (inaudible at 00:23:03].4) all of the time, like feeling like I do when I have steroids, ya know. Like the jitteriness, yet being exhausted and having very a short fuse, ya know. All the normal like steroid feelings of gaining weight, specifically in the center of my body, like all the stuff and like I looked and I'm not taking prednisone so I have no idea where this is coming from. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um (pause) (sighs) it just it...it's, like I said, it's really, really frustrating, ya know. Especially because of my health I can't do a lot. I mean I can do some things, but I can't do as much as somebody else would to make changes in my lifestyle to do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I imagine you can't really exercise. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, very little. I do a little but not a whole lot. Um, ya know, that kind of stuff. I have very strong limitations on what I can eat when. Because of the thyroid medication you can't drink anything that has...you can't have anything that has calcium for the first 4 hours of the day...yeah. Calcium or iron. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because it, um, it causes uh kidney stones and all kinds of other terrible things. Because they're giving you thyroid and so it immediately will react with whatever it is and becomes like a, a problem, so it's like yeah I can't do...ya know I've eaten oatmeal for breakfast for the past 2 years straight. Not because I want to, because I have to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know. It's like I just (pause) I'm just kind of frustrated so, but I'm hoping to be able to...if I can get a good swing of feeling good about things I probably could, but I need to get the pain level down, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:24:56].1) things you could probably, what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Start exercising or doing something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I just assumed that your joints would preclude that but I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, they do, but that doesn't mean I won't. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's sort of a funny thing where it's like yeah, I will start doing stuff a little bit. Um (pause) the...it depends on what it is. Believe it or not I'm not allowed to take yoga. That's the number one thing they say you're not allowed to do...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and it's because my joints all go the wrong direction, so yoga looks great but it's not. But like being able to just get, ya know, going out and taking some walks with my dog...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I can do that kind of stuff at least. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because I could do that more if I was in a lot less pain, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And less exhausted. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Less exhausted too. And so I'm just...I keep saying the same things over and over again. I'm sort of slightly falling asleep while we're talking. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Partially because, because I'm talking all the time and ya know I'm becoming more tired I think. But yeah. (pause) Whenever I'm very exhausted emotionally and physically I apparently say the same things over and over again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you're saying the same things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe, maybe not. I'm just saying that I do know that I do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) But (pause) yes. I got to find a way out of this. I feel like if I could just get a good break in terms of like not having as much pain and having just...I'm not talking about pain free, I'm talking about not as much and maybe having slightly more energy. I'm not talking about forever, just for a few days. I feel like I could really break out of this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) and I feel stupid for keeping hoping that way, but (inaudible at 00:27:13].4) has to. You have to have some hope. (pause) I, um, I just in general I just feeling slightly insecure about myself. Everything is down to the fact that, like, I don't know. (pause) My husband and my mother play Scrabble together over the Internet and I mostly let them do it because I stink at it. My mom, English is her freakin' third language, and like she is a master at this kind of stuff and I just feel like it's not even pleasurable when I was like that outmatched. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [0:28:12.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't want to bring it up with her either because I don't want to be like mom, can you be like easier on me. And like that. But just to make things seem that much weirder than that...I have to read this to you. So my husband and my mom were playing Scrabble quite a bit together and my dad realizes that the words that they were using were so singular that he composed a poem to them. (chuckles) This is like just to give you, like how high the stakes have to be for this kind of thing. Um, let's see here (pause)...this is sort of to me feeling like I am out of my depth sometimes, and I'll explain in just a second as soon as I can get this to do what it's supposed to do. (pause) I thought it was in the department's network but maybe not. (pause) But basically (pause), but yeah basically my dad wrote a poem about it because in a single game of, um, chess...not chess, I mean, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Scrabble.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Scrabble. Oh here it is. "Albi To A Mulan." See these are all words that were used in the last game. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. What to a mulan?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Albi. An albi is the opposite of serenade. It is a song sung at dawn to your beloved as you're saying goodbye. Yes. We're that kind of family. And so the word albi...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know what a mulan is at least. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, yep. So that's, um, narwhal was used.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Axion. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: A couple of other things like that, yup. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Axion. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not an axon but an axion. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Axon, sorry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: In the predawn sky lanes of mulans each lay down letter, laying down words worthy of triple point scores, on the endless Scrabble board of the endless universe, and then, in hardly another instant, altered letters speed from one axon to another, laying down words worthy of triple point scores about albi and mulans, and even axons within another endless universe. Thus said the narwhal. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) That's cute. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like, ya know, we're very nerdy and so sometimes it's like I appreciated this but at the same time it's like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...how in the world I'm going to be playing Scrabble like with honestly narwhal. I'm not gonna see narwhal in the...I mean I know what one is, but I'm not gonna see it in the words, and so it's like I feel really like I need to find somebody who like has a lot less in vocabulary than me maybe to do that. I don't know. But I feel weird asking as an adult for someone to go easy on me in a game, but I feel really intimidated. So... (pause) I don't have to be the best at everything I swear to you. I'm not a perfectionist. I just need to feel like I'm not being beaten into the ground on something, and so I'm not really even sure. I mean this has been a...for my husband and many of my friends it has been a great way to stay connected with people. It's like playing these kind of things from far away, but I don't want to feel like if I get my...if I fail at playing chess, for not like one game, but I'm talking about the great majority of them, ya know, compared to people who do this quite a bit or, ya know, to fail at this thing, it's like it's no longer fun, ya know. And, um, I don't know. Just have a lot of anxiety about doing this. I know that sounds cheesy but it's true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's so many other places you feel like you absolutely can't win. [0:32:32.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so ya know (pause) but (pause) ya know it's...you know it is...ya know it's...and it's...I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've just been straining my axons on this one. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (snorts). Oh my God. Yeah. That's...as much as my husband gets annoyed with my family, he fits in just well with them pretty well, much better than the other way around...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I think. He, he, he...and not that I don't fit in with that—trust me, I do—but it's always like these self-improvement type of thing. It's like always trying to find new and other ways to, to, to improve yourself is definitely something that, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you need (inaudible at 00:33:28].7) to feel better about yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel crummy about the way you look. You've been crummy about I guess this aspect of your intelligence or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, feeling crummy about the changes at work. Crummy about your health. Frustrated about how like (inaudible at 00:33:49].0) uh, (pause) ya know (inaudible at 00:33:56].6) yourself (pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's not even like in terms of aspects of, ya know, intelligence. Most of the time I'm relatively easy about things, but...and I am surrounded by people who are not using their brain around me, so that doesn't really make me feel very good. And it's not like as in I feel like I shouldn't either, but it's not like I'm getting intellectual stimulation by being around any of them either. Though we did get (inaudible at 00:34:27].5) work, so...somebody brought in a Wii, so we now have a Wii to play while we're eating lunch, but ya know that's not even really intellectual stimulation either. But at least it's something. But it's just, I don't know. It's just...I just feel like a big freaking whiner all the time, so... (pause) and I only want...the things that I cannot change are the only things I do want to change in my life, cuz there's very little I have control over so maybe that's probably why, ya know? (pause) But (sighs) (pause) that's pretty much about it. I don't think there's anything else on my mind, unless...I get bored hearing myself talk about this stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) It's probably cuz I've been living it for a long time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and I imagine you're awfully sick and tired of the way things are, ya know. [0:35:49.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very. It's not being bored talking about it, but especially bored living it, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I wonder if you're at all, um...sorry I have to sneeze, uh (sneezes), um, (pause) like afraid of the depth (sneezcs)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bless you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks. And entity of (pause) your sadness and frustrations about how things have been. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think that if I contemplate that, then I'll never get out of it (pause), ya know. Much like if you spend much time thinking about things you can't do, you won't really focus on what you can. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see (blows nose). </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) And so, at least that's the way I think about it, ya know. It's not such a...I mean yes, it's afraid, but I'm afraid I'm not gonna get out of it, ya know. It's just so (pause)...my life is depressing and sad enough as it is, allowing any more, but my life is probably not, ya know. Allowing it, allowing it to have any more space in my life is (pause) more than I'm willing to give, ya know? I am willing to give it up when I have found control of it. But I have no, ya know, choice in the matter. But I just...it's just taken too much already. ya know? (pause) And it's just (pause)...there's only so much I guess that I can do, but (pause) I just don't like stuff that (pause)...so. Umm I think we're pretty close to stopping aren't we?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, in about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I do. I do, if that's okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I will see you Thursday morning. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually if you want to still do Wednesday that's great. You know originally I cancelled Wednesday cuz I thought I was going to have a gig and [0:39:19.4]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And last time she was in was [DATE] but was complaining at that point in time she couldn't shut down.  We learned the last time that the daughter in law and son were separated.  Um, and I think we had some speculation that the daughter might have the same illness as [PATIENT NAME] has.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, my daughter, not my daughter in law.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, your daughter, excuse me.  Okay.  The daughter has many [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My daughter in law is going through, um, a lot of therapy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My son definitely has an anger problem and, uh, yknow, it comes out in the way he speaks to people, especially those close to him because of course he can't do that at work.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He lets his anger, he lets his guard down, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  And I believe since the problems that occurred the last part of December are being resolved.  I believe he is going for some counseling or, I'm not sure exactly what he's doing.  I know what my daughter in law is doing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  You've got to remember something, that, um, you're dealing with, um, unstable, um, cellular energy, okay, or at least inflammation caused by various things.  And that in people either causes, um, over-stimulation or irritability or [INAUDIBLE] or poor concentration, all sorts of things like that, PMS, explosive problems, all kinds of stuff like that.  It's a syndrome very much like ADD, yknow, they get a whole bunch of stuff like that.  So you've got a daughter and you probably have a son who have the same gene.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Really.  Then I have a granddaughter who is going through a lot of things.  I have, um, another daughter who has been going a different lifestyle than I like.  And I know she's not happy, so it's always on my mind, my children are always on my mind.  And I know there's not any -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's the different lifestyle than you'd like?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, she's homosexual.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She's gay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she's not happy.  She's extremely obese.  She was such a pretty girl and she's still very pretty but she's very obese.  She hurt her ankle, still having problems with that.  She's [INAUDIBLE], but, um, I know she's been feeling very stressed about her job, problems with money.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All the stuff.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And just not happy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It runs in families.  It does.  Creates all sorts of problems.  How are you doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm doing better.  And I did want to clarify something from the last time I talked to you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think she was real concerned and I it was the way I worded it.  I said I felt like I was just waiting for someone to kick me and I don't mean physically, it's just that I know I have all these things that I haven't done and they're about to cave in.  I feel they're about to cave in on me.  So like I'm not running, and yet I'm [INAUDIBLE] a block.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What haven't you done?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Bills, taxes, things like that, scary things.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What can you do about it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Get it taken care of.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How do you get it taken care of?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Get my scheduling better.  Get my scheduling down.  I know the grid that works for me for bills, but I haven't made the grid.  Um, yknow, a grid that shows when I have what money and when the bills are due.  And consequently because I don't have that, it ends up, I end up paying more money for late fees and that kind of thing.  Um, and I need to keep order in my house and that seem to conflict.  Yknow, I know part of it is I just, I'm afraid to tackle it or I'm not afraid to tackle it, I resist tackling it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you do one thing at a time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  It's always been my nature.  And if I don't do them one at a time, I end up not finishing whatever it was I working on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Still on Lamictal 200, one half in the morning and one at bedtime, Celexa 40, and alprazolam one, one half twice daily and one at bedtime, plus if you need one for panic.  That working, not working?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not working.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not working.  What's wrong?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, seems like I need to take the Lamictal in three separate things.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it seems like if I take a whole one in the morning, um, it makes, I get too tired, it seems like if I take a whole one at night then it wears off when I take the half one the next day it seems like it wears off before, um, before I need it again.  I mean, it seems like I need it again before it's time to take it again.  The alprazolam, right now I seem not to need quite as much as I did.  When I take it, it certainly makes me sleepy.  When I take it with the Lamictal it makes me so sleepy that I just have to take a nap.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Suggest that when you take it don't take as much, take a half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Of the alprazolam?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, okay.  And, um, just the last week I thought maybe the Celexa was too much and making me groggy.  So I broke it in half, and I don't know, yknow, what, I really don't know what impact that had.  Maybe I need to take the whole thing and maybe I don't.  I still wake up during the night several times which is really unusual for me.  Yknow, I usually sleep right on through.  If I wake up it's like once.  I just cannot take a full, um, tablet of the Aricept.  Um, I can pretty much take half or maybe half and then a fourth, then a half and a fourth.  Is there anything wrong with doing it that way?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because it seems like if I take even a half it's like my dreams get so out of control.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it helping you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, a lot.  Tremendously.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It helps your memory but it gives you nightmares?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  But it's almost like these are nightmares that I need, yknow, to bring things to my consciousness that I didn't even realize I needed to forgive or, yknow, look at in a different light.  Things that I've like stored up for years and grudges.  I've definitely been a grudge carrier.  Yknow, things from my childhood, those people [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you putting any of them to rest?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes they come back and I think about them, but, yes, definitely putting them to rest.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Is your mind staying quiet a lot?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> About fifty-fifty.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Did the melatonin do anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, it helped tremendously.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now this past week, and it turns out I was not just tired, I was really, really sick, I was just getting really, really sick.  And, um, it seems like, even though the melatonin is helping, it seems like I don't really get going until noon or eleven.  And, um, but I do wake up better.  And less exhausted, but I get up and I still feel like I don't accomplish [INAUDIBLE].  And it may be because, yknow, for, I had in the past or way in the past, yknow, I was used to [INAUDIBLE] then it came to me that I needed to go to bed by eleven or I was really drowsy and falling asleep on the couch.  And then I got the job, uh, where my shift was until one in the morning, at one time it was until two in the morning, so I pretty much, yknow, shifted my habits and that was for, yknow, like a year.  I think I'm just having, yknow, that part and maybe I'm just having trouble readjusting.  Like I said, I've always been a night person, but less so until I switched jobs.  And I would be getting very tired by twelve thirty.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where is your job that you're doing now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, right now I'm on -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Disability?  Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].  What was your job?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What company was it?  [INAUDIBLE] yelled at all the time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And things, my instincts change daily and, yknow, some people shift gears real quickly but most of us don't shift gears quite that quickly.  So [INAUDIBLE] I could go on and on and on.  And their benefits are wonderful.  Yknow, the people.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just somewhere at the top there's a disconnect.  I mean, [INAUDIBLE] but I think I just wonder whatever happened to [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So basically you just need to stay the basic thing and let you play with the meds some.  Yknow, like you can take a third three times a day to make the 100, to make the amount.  And Celexa pretty much as is, and alprazolam you can vary that, make it work, and Aricept you vary that until a dose that you find tolerant.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And melatonin just keep doing it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  You look well.  You look normal. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, the sunshine came out and it helped so much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] mentioned that you can still get sunlamps?  Do you know where?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, Northern Lights.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Northern Lights.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Northern Lights.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've heard of it.  Is it around here or do you have to go on the Web?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, you go on the Web.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think you can get one from this, not [INAUDIBLE], Sharper Image.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Are they pretty expensive?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Get somebody with [INAUDIBLE] you can probably get some, or one pretty, yknow, I think you can just get a grow light you can hook it into your lamp or whatever.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Do what?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can sometimes get a, if you can get a grow lamp, grow light.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But I don't know how many illuminance on it.  You have to find that out.  You might have to get two, two of them.  All right.  Come back in about two months.  Come back in about two months.</p>






















<p><b>DR:</b> And how many years I've been seeing you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, let me think, since '86.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Since nineteen eighty six, wow.  Yeah.  And we've gone through, um, basically all the, a lot of the new medicines and tried this and tried that, one childbirth.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And, um, you were going to school, attending school, all those things.  Um, right now you're on Trileptal 600, three a day, 1,800, and Seroquel 200 mg one at bedtime.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm only on Trileptal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You stopped the Seroquel?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just trying to quit the Trileptal's just three at night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, three at night, 300?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Three at bedtime, three tablets?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just three.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], okay.  And you've stopped taking the Seroquel?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm still on the Seroquel.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, gotcha on that then.  All right, that's [INAUDIBLE] then.  All right.  And I last saw her on [DATE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> '07 yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So how are we doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We're doing okay.  Just trying to get [INAUDIBLE].  You know how that is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's she's doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's a junior this year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's doing okay.  I haven't noticed any -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Problems with her, good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not yet.  That'll be, mine didn't hit 'til later.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um, [NAME OTHER] has bipolar I and, um, of course that's a concern with the daughter, uh, who has mental cycles which tend to trigger this stuff off.  And she's in her last year in high school.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> One more year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> One more year.  But no signs or symptoms of anything so far so she's good?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, not yet.  And she does have, when she has her period, she is moody, but.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And you're sleeping okay and everything else?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  I don't hear anything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you ever hear anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It was all on my medicine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like my husband says, I can sleep through, he said I could sleep through a hurricane, and I'm like, no, I didn't sleep through the hurricane that came through here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I did that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You did?  He did too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Mood swings?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, a little bit, but, yknow, it's just I think these are the typical ones.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like what kind of mood swings?  [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, like one day I mean real bitchy at times.  Or I really, yknow, I tend to go towards the manic side.  But there are days when I'm at the other end.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you having any [INAUDIBLE] cycles or it's unpredictable?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just unpredictable.  I think it's just things that, at school, or whatever trigger it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Can you control it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I don't think I want to control it.  I just want it to completely go.  It's easier to [INAUDIBLE] things when I'm in that mood.  I mean, when I'm manic everybody likes that, but when I'm at the other one.  And I think I like that [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Do you ever get any trouble with it when you were in [INAUDIBLE]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I'm just real giddy.  My [INAUDIBLE].  No, I'm not at that end.  Not like it used to be.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How long do the [INAUDIBLE] last you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, a day maybe at most.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How often do you have these?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not often.  And mostly probably for a month maybe at the most.  And sometimes I think I put myself in that mood just so I could deal with things 'cause I've learned how to do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  I've had it so long as you can teach yourself what to go [INAUDIBLE].  It's easier to slip into that mood if you don't want to deal with people 'cause they tend to stay away.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Any side effects from the Trileptal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no, just if I miss one day I just can't sleep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or is that from the Seroquel?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, the Seroquel.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's from the Seroquel.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That you do what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If I happen to not get my medicine, yknow, if I forget to get it filled and I have to wait a day, I don't sleep.  And then I have these, like my hands and feet get really cold.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I figure that was from the Seroquel.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, it's probably bipolar disorder.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is vasoconstriction.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I get real cold.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You get cold, you get, uh, hands and feet get cold, nose gets cold, ears get cold.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Some people it'll get painful and some people have problems with, some women will have breast pain.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't had that, it's just, another, um, it's almost like when I miss my Seroquel I have this, I can just tell, there's a distinct odor like it's coming out of my pores.  And the next night, when I take it, it's all gone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have migraines?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I've had one in my life and that's it.  But it's just a strain.  I just can't really describe it.  It's not a strong odor, but it's just.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's probably the aura that you have if you were to have a migraine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Probably getting some vasoconstriction in there. Some part of your temporal lobe is irritated.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So I make sure that when, 'cause I don't like that feeling.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't blame you.  Start having like weakness or swelling or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  And another thing, yknow, I talk to people, people talk to me about bipolar and staying on my medication and all and they're like [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I said I don't understand, yknow, I know what it was like before and I didn't like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I just don't, yknow, I've had some friends they think they're better, and they get off, I said, how can you like going back to the way you were?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow, and if they go off, oftentimes it'll make the illness a little bit worse when it comes back.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they'll say, well, I'm not ill [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's like diabetes or hypertension.  What about, um, you don't have any problems with twitches or movements, or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, what about weight gain?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, nothing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, the Crohn's helps that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and you have Crohn's, that's right.  And we had troubles when you had to go on steroids.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, now I'm off steroids completely.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, yeah.  Good, that makes our life much better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yes, it does.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, steroids seem to jack everything up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that was the time when it was really bad when I was on steroids.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah .  When's the last time you had an episode?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With my Crohn's?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, I've had some little bouts during the summer, not real bad, but I think the last time I had a really bad episode it's been at least ten years.  I've been real lucky.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> See, that's another thing [INAUDIBLE].  Supposedly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And another thing that's funny, I can tell, I guess because I know my [INAUDIBLE], I can tell when other people are.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I tend to look at eyes.  You know somebody who's, uh, blank faced, fairly good sized eyes, and pupils are dilated, they'll flip the [INAUDIBLE] up and down, check their hands and they have cold hands, I figure that's where they are [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's like, well, I can see them when they go up and down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it's funny 'cause at school people will come to me and they'll start telling me what's wrong, and they'll say do I have what you have, and I'll say, no, you don't have what I have.  I said, but you can go tell it to a doctor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What about, uh, are you still doing one month supply meds or you do three months?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I do one month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> One month.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I think they had just called in a prescription for me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They may have.  Let's see.  [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, we did.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Called in for which one, Seroquel?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Trileptal.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Trileptal?  Okay.  So I've just had that one filled.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you had the other one filled just [INAUDIBLE] about eight months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Cool.  See you back in eight months.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (4-minute silence) I feel as I'm thinking about 2 different things.  One is that, uhm, last night MSCZ and I decided not to go away for the weekend.  And this was mainly because, well, he didn't feel strongly one way or the other about going but I just didn't want to be up in PTN this weekend, with my parents and then the f—, their friends.  And I didn't — somehow that combined with the drive up or the drive both ways, especially after the previous trip we had, just seemed to be enough so that I would decide not to want to go.  And when I called my parents to let them know, well, I spoke to my mother.  And I knew she'd be disappointed a little.  And somehow, because I didn't want to be with them, I began to feel very, well, I began to think, well, maybe I should have gone after all so I suppose I was feeling guilty that I'd felt that way.  But at the same time I felt relieved that I decided not to go.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you talked to your mother on the phone.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You, you say, you supposed you feel guilt, felt guilty or feel guilty about it.  It means you, you know, weren't sure how you were feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, because when I, as soon as I hung up I was, my immediate reaction was, well, now I wish we were going.  But that was mainly because I'd decided we weren't going to go.  And then, uhm, my mother had said, "Well, I wish you were coming."  So I think, perhaps, it was partly, too, as soon as I decided I didn't, well, that we weren't going to go, I could — and I, and, and I had called my mother so that it was definite — uhm, then I could think about the aspects of going that I would have liked.  Whereas before, all I could think about were all the aspects that I didn't like.  (Pause) And I don't know how much this, well, what else was on my mind today is something that affected my feeling about going away this weekend.  But all week, I've been very conscious of feeling uninvolved in, in anything I'm doing.  And (sighs) I don't know, I just feel as if I'm going around in a, a kind of a daze, without any real direction.  And, and this has bothered me in here, that somehow what I used to look to in teaching I don't look to anymore.  And, or I'm not that sure anymore on, on exactly how to go about it.  And so this is probably making it worse, when I feel this way.  Because when I'm at school I, I just don't know what direction I'm moving in and then I think this week I've felt that way at home too, I, or just anytime.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Including here.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  Well, not entirely.  I sort of feel that way today.  I guess I felt that way at the beginning of different times this week.  But I don't think I felt that way after a while, some of the days.  I don't know, I just, well, I guess it's everything just seems so confused and contradictory.  Because when I start thinking about something, first I'll react one way and then I react another way.  (5-minute silence)</p>

<p>And one thing that's been, well, sort of on my mind this week is the fact that I feel more, this year and now, than I ever have before, that I really don't want to teach next year.  And this is sort of a new thing because I've always, before this, no matter how awful each year has been for teaching, I've wanted very much to do it another year because I think I've always felt, well, maybe I can do a better job and use what I've been learning and prove something to myself.  Somehow, anyway, I've been almost driven to keep going on with it.  And somehow now I don't really care.  And I've said I'm going to teach another year and, and I'm just not sure how much I just don't want to.  (Clears throat) And when I feel that I don't want to, sometimes it just seems that I'm feeling that way because I'm sort of facing the things that are hard about it to me and, instead of meeting them, I'm just running away from it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You said, ah, earlier that you've been feeling, I think you called it, uninvolved all week.  I have a kind of an impression that that's the way you're feeling here, now.  But I'm not sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Mm, I, I think that would be the way I feel.  I'm, I don't know, I just have this feeling that I don't care and I, and I just want to get through the day so I can go home and go to bed.  And I've felt that way all week.  Every day has just seemed to go on and on forever.  (Pause) But I think I felt that way last week too.  And I excused it because of the storm and how it sort of started the week off in another way.  And I kept thinking, well, maybe that's why I'm feeling differently about things.  And also there were several things going on in the evening, that I had to go to.  But now that I think about it, it was the same feeling.  And both weeks I've overslept a great deal, which I never, or very rarely do.  And just somehow, as long as I'm in bed, asleep, then these things don't, whatever it is, don't bother me and —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, you've made, ah, clear a number of things this week that have been bothering you, you know, a great deal, that were very hard to tell about and think about.  You saw the movie, "Romeo and Juliet"  and very strong feelings about that.  And then your experience with MSCZ and masturbating, you felt very strongly about that.  It reminded you of all the fantasies that you have had for a long time of being afraid of being raped and attacked.  You thought about your mixed feelings about your father.  It seems to me it's at least possible that those are the things that you'd like to have vanish and be able to escape from into sleep.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, it's another place or another area where I feel so confused because I'm so used to all those feelings that in a way I just take them for granted.  And, and at least I tell myself it's the daily things I have to keep coping with that are so awful.  (Pause) Because I never get away from those other feelings.  (Pause) I suppose it's partly that I'm, I want to separate myself off from daily things because I have to just spend a lot of time talking myself into certain attitudes about these things that really do bother me so that the daily things become interruptions or annoyances.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>It seems so strange to me to feel this way, especially after several days when I, or often when I've come in thinking that I won't have anything to say.  Because today, before I came, it seemed very clear to me that I'd have a lot to say about this feeling I had about going away the weekend.  And yet when I started talking about it, it, it, even if I do have a lot to say, I just couldn't even get close enough to it.  (Pause) And it's almost as if the feeling I had when—, or have whenever I think of going up there is such an ambiguous one of not wanting to be treated the way I know I'd be treated and to feel the reactions I'm going to feel but, on the other hand, wanting to be sort of the daughter of the house, being welcomed back and looking to my parents so I w—, from the same situation I want 2 opposite things.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I think another thing that's bothered me is in relationship to MSCZ.  I've, well, I've been trying to think about that today, too, and exactly what it is I've been doing.  But I can't, I couldn't respond to him at all even if he just was being affectionate.  I couldn't even receive it.  I had to be very passive and I just had this feeling that whatever was happening this week, I had to it al—, I had to be by myself.  And being by myself seemed to mean not even giving him any kind of a sign of affection and not receiving any.  Except that if he would just hold me in his arms and practically treat me like a baby, well, then I liked it, where I didn't have to give anything back to him and he was doing nothing more than hol—, holding me.  But that seemed to be about all that, well, that I could accept, I guess.  (Pause) And since that's the last thing he wants to do, it just created a lot of tension between us this week too, though he's been really very nice about it.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about the way I'm not feeling involved in anything today.  And it's almost as if wherever I turn my thoughts to, I either have very ambivalent or confused or contradictory thoughts or feelings about different things so that I immediately withdraw from thinking about it, anything.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mentioned feeling confused and contradictory before.  When, when you say that now what in particular do you think of?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I was thinking of different things I've started to talk about today and feeling about going up to PTN and, well, feelings I've had for MSCZ this week, which, even though I've been, well, I guess he would call it hateful, cold or unresponsive to him, on the one hand I've wanted to respond.  And yet I haven't wanted to.  And I was also just thinking of some things at school that, uhm — because I always turn to school when I can't stand thinking about anything else.  And this was just on, well, sort of issues that are going to be discussed at school about how the program should run for, for my class and when they should be reading and so forth.  And I was just kind of putting up questions to myself, too.  And all I could think of there were all the different arguments for and against anything and not what I think.  Or what I think is I'm able to see both sides and they seem to weigh equally.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I think, well, I, I was thinking that it's just sort of, of that when I think that way, it's just k—, it's a very general thing too in the way I feel about the way I'm spending my time or about myself, and sometimes just feeling, well, I can't do anything and I don't know what I want to do with myself.  And there's nothing I can really do anyway.  And then if I start thinking that way, then I'll start sort of taking myself in hand and saying, well, there are some things.  But I al—, it's always with the feeling, if you make yourself, there are.  I think I'm feeling that way about going to class tonight, too.  Because once I'm there and involved in whatever we do, I always do become involved.  And however frustrating it is, I have, it is enjoyable in a way.  But yet, before going, I just have this feeling that it's just going to be an awful class or awful for me and I'll be so glad when it's over.  So then I'm feeling that way and telling myself, well, it's never that way once I'm there.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Whenever I have a day when I'm, or time when I'm here, feeling this way, that I just can't get at anything, it always, I always feel as if it's never happened before, it's never been this bad.  I was just thinking then that this is so frustrating.  And then, then I recall that there were other times when it just seemed to me that it was the worst that it could be.  And yet today I was thinking that it couldn't be harder to be here, trying to, I don't know, just come to grips with whatever is vaguely there that I can't come to grips with.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, something just occurred to me that, uhm, seems so little but now it seems that it could have thrown me for this whole time.  When, when I came in today, I felt as if when I said hello to you that I looked at, looked at your eyes, really, longer than I ever had before.  And I was sort of aware that I wasn't kind of hiding my face away from you as soon as I said hello, which I usually do.  And then afterwards, I felt very, right when I came in, very uncomfortable that I had, well, it was in some way, exposed myself or made myself vulnerable.  I don't know exactly how.  And then I stopped thinking about it, but it just came to me again that this had been my feeling when I first came in.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How would it make you vulnerable?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't really think I understand how, except that I know I feel uncomfortable looking at people.  Not always but very often I'm aware of sort of forcing myself to look at people because my inclination is not to.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Were you aware of any particular thing you saw?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  When I looked at your eyes?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah.  I mean, was there any more to it than that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, it was just sort of a friendly expression that, uhm, I don't know exactly what it was.  But I think it's an expression I like to see and yet I feel uncomfortable if I see it and, and keep looking at it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time is up.</p>

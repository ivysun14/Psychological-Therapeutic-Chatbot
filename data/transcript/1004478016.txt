<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] thanks for seeing me again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did you [Interposing] insurance stuff?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I did. It looks like, you know, it looks everything is–it will be all set.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you know, [Interposing] maybe, like, it'll be like maybe $25-30 copay–</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Oh, that's great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Great. Um, I guess we should just start where we left off? Okay. I'm going to say before we start though, I'm–my sister-in-law had her baby last night, so I'm going to meet him right after this. So I'm going to try to end on a more of like [chuckling] less sad note because I don't want to be–go in there and be [inaudible 0:00:43]. So, I've–after Monday, I just felt like really sad, I don't talk about that stuff a lot. Obviously, who talks about that kind of stuff a lot.</p>

<p>But, um, I just–and then, I just get–it's like as soon as I start talking about those things and that period of time, it's just all–it just goes.</p>

<p>[00:01:11]</p>

<p>It just keeps going. And then, I just remember all these things, and it just feels terrible. That night I was trying to go to bed, and I just couldn't. And I just started crying and just couldn't stop. And I just–I mean, that's obviously where this all comes from, but I just don't know what–so, like it just feels like it's always going to be there, and I don't know when it will get less hard to think about or to talk about.</p>

<p>And that is what makes me really upset. But like I was remembering all these things, like, you asked where my mom was when all that was happening. And then, I remembered like what she used to do when we would be acting–you know, we would–we would react, and we were kids. And so, we would just kind of act out, and I think we were just scared, and didn't, you know?</p>

<p>[00:02:18]</p>

<p>So, when we would act out and didn't remember what we would do, but you know, maybe fighting with each other or like yelling at her, whenever she would get really ripped up and really upset, and then she'd scream that she was going to go kill herself. She'd say I'm going to go get in my car and I'm going to drive it off a bridge. Or I'm going to smash into a tree or that was always–and then, she would get in her car and she would leave.</p>

<p>And that was like just the most...it was–that was more terrifying than anything I think my dad would do. Was having–I remember that feeling–that feeling of like–like literally, I remember feeling like I would just scream and I would just run around my house just waiting for her to come back.</p>

<p>[00:03:08]</p>

<p>And we would just be left alone wondering, like, is she going to come back? Is she going to drive off a bridge? And I think that was actually probably the worst of all. [Sighs]. But I hate thinking about it. Like, is this going to feel like this forever?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think so. But you've got a lot inside you, you have to get out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Crying].</p>

<p>[00:04:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you ask that, are you worried that you'll never feel better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It feels like the only way to feel better from all of it–all of the stuff that happened was just to not talk about it, and to not think about it. Because it feels like the more I think about it and the more I talk about it that I'm just harping on it, and just keep it so present like that makes it–like why do I–I don't know. I was going for a little while and my dad, um, over the last year when he was drinking and then not drinking, and going back and forth deciding what he was going to do. I was going to Al-Anon for a little while. And I was feeling like well, this makes me feel better, but then I was also feeling like but all I feel like I'm doing is like focusing on my dad's struggles with alcohol.</p>

<p>[00:05:03]</p>

<p>And I don't think that that, for me, is the root of all of our problems. Like for my–I just felt like going there was just like gurgling up all the past once a week until I stopped going. I tried to share with a group at one of the meetings, and I just–as soon as I opened my mouth, just started bawling and was too embarrassed, [inaudible 0:05:30] talk again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's hard for you imagine that it's not only getting it out there, but there's actually a way that you could really process it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. But I don't know what processing it means. Like, I don't know what that means.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Well for starters, it means talking about it. And allowing yourself the space to be really, really upset.</p>

<p>[00:06:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um...yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that means making sense of all of this insanity and pain. And putting it back inside in a way that's sort of less chaotic and raw.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That still sounds really confusing to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because part of me feels like...I don't know. Part of me feels like I had deluded myself for so long thinking that I wasn't damaged by it. Like, I would think like the things that happened when I grew up were really strange and really, like, messed up. And then, I'd think like but I'm pretty like–but I'm fine.</p>

<p>[00:07:15]</p>

<p>Like, I'd have like these other behaviors, and I have like–and I'd think like, I'd like pat myself on the back, like congratulate myself on how well–how, you know, like well-adjusted I was. And say like I'm pretty good for like the things that happened. And now, it's slowly realizing like no, you're not that–like, if you were that–if everything that was great, you wouldn't of, you know, you wouldn't feel like this. You wouldn't, you know, if you were the–you know, if you were that well-adjusted, you wouldn't have made some of the mistakes you made.</p>

<p>And so now, it's just kind of like processing that part of it, too. Where I had deluded myself for so long into thinking that I was okay.</p>

<p>[00:08:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's a difference between being in pain and being damaged.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. But I feel like I'm both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I know. But what you're saying is if I realized how much these things have affected me, therefore, I'm also realizing I'm damaged.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm saying that's not–I understand you feel that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I'm just saying that's not–sort of one doesn't follow from the other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. So, I guess what I also don't understand is like do I just talk about everything that happened? And then, I just...think about it? Or what? [Chuckling] like, I just don't understand, I guess. I just don't know. I really want to feel better, I just don't know how.</p>

<p>[00:09:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, is the question, like, maybe part of the question is how talking about everything that–every awful thing that happened to me in my life, how is that actually going to help anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's kind of the–well, and then, like do I have to talk about every [inaudible 0:09:22] thing? And is that the only way that I, like, feel better about it? Or do I just talk about the things that are relevant to that situation? Because a lot of times what I do–what I do is when I have something happen, whether it be with my friends or with one of my brothers, or something with Chris, I'll think about like–I'll think well, why are you having this reaction? Or why are you having this behavior? And then, I try to trace it back to something in my past.</p>

<p>[00:09:58]</p>

<p>And I guess, I don't know what my question is. Sometimes I start talking and then I forget where I started. [Clears throat]. But I guess do I just have to do that for everything? For every scenario that ha–happened? And then, think about how it's going to relate? I just don't know. I feel like this a really long process.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes you say that? I had a thought about that, but what were your thoughts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, just because–I guess I just feel like I'm just starting, and I–the fact that I'm so confused over it makes me think that I have a really long way to go. Because the fact that I don't have a grasp on how to–how to heal from the things that happened when I was younger, makes me think that like I'm–I've really got a long way to go that I don't even know where to start.</p>

<p>[00:11:02]</p>

<p>It's like when you start like a running plan. Or like you start exercising. Like, what I–I would–I'd–when I wanted to start running, I thought like I don't even know where to begin. Like, I have no idea. Do I just go for like a 30-minute run? You know, and then that's how I feel, but, with this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 0:11:21] a plan for–</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A plan for wellness looks like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will be a long process for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will be a long process for you to–to get out of really a much better quality of life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do feel that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel like you have a lot of trauma to work through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a lot of unsettling and disturbing, and painful, and who knows, some very toxic experiences to work through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've worked really, really hard to manage to have–to adapt to life, and I don't think it's about how you adapt. Because you were saying before like how adaptive I am. I actually think that that's not a problem for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. No, I don't think it is either.</p>

<p>[00:12:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the quality of your experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Oh, absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it is a long process. For you to get to not only where you should be, but actually, what I think your potential is. And that will take some time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, where do I start, though?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've already begun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well, I guess I don't really know what else to talk about.</p>

<p>[00:13:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel like you haven't already begun?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it does. I feel like by coming here, it definitely does. I just...makes me upset that I waited so long. And it–it makes me, you know, upset, obviously, that it–that it is going to take a while and that–I feel like I've cheated myself out of, like, some really good things by not taking care of it sooner. I feel like...I feel like I've–I feel really, like, guilty to Chris and like just how I've–you know, I feel like I cheated him in some ways out of like our fun early years of marriage by being this sad person. And that makes me feel really guilty.</p>

<p>[00:14:08]</p>

<p>I don't know. I guess it just makes me–I don't know. When I think about all–everything, I have really clear feelings about how I feel about my dad. It's really clear to me, but then, when I think about my mom, I have such a mixed bag. I don't–sometimes I'm really mad at her. And then, sometimes, it breaks my heart, the things about her wanting to get a car–screaming at us that she was going to kill herself doesn't even make me that mad. I mean, it does a little bit, I think it's really irresponsible, but it breaks my heart.</p>

<p>[00:15:07]</p>

<p>That she was that sad, and that, you know, broken by this situation. But then I get pissed again. Well, why were you there? Why didn't you get–why did we all have to stay? And I just don't know how to feel about it. And obviously, there's no one certain way to feel about any of it, but... And then, we just like, you know, and then, we just didn't talk about. And then, we just–it happened and then, it was over.</p>

<p>[00:16:02]</p>

<p>You know? And we always talked in these vague terms, or we'd talk about like, oh yeah, dad used to beat the shit out of the dog. Or we'll say like, you know, we'll just reference things. But it's never like–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He beat up the dog?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Yeah. The poor dog–oh, that poor dog. [Crying] sorry, that just made me really sad. Because the dog ch–was so–oh, he was the sweetest dog. He was this chocolate lab and he was so fat and so sweet. He was literally the sweetest dog I ever met in my life. And then, the dog would be so upset about it, and so he'd chew holes in the wall. And then, you know, like my dad one time was throwing–my dog was backed into a corner and he was throwing bricks at him.</p>

<p>And then, he would–you know, there was that one time that the dog chewed another hole in the wall, and the three of us, me and my brothers were home. My dad came home and I think he was high on coke, but I'm not entirely sure. And he got–he was screaming at the dog and kicking him. And [inaudible 0:17:11] cut the fucking dog's head off. And he went into the garage and got the chainsaw, and we were all screaming because we thought he actually going to cut the dog's head off.</p>

<p>[00:17:20]</p>

<p>And he was chasing the dog all around the house with the chainsaw. And then, it was like there's the dog, there's my dad, and there's the three of us trailing after screaming and crying. And then, I tell the story to Chris, and I'm like–I like yeah, it was–I told it like it was like a funny story. And I was like, it was like if somebody had been there with a camera, it would have been the funniest thing. Like, I tell it like it's funny. And it was–oh, it broke my heart. That poor dog. [Sighs].</p>

<p>[00:17:57]</p>

<p>I don't even know how I started talking about the dog. But, um, he was–I don't really talk about him in the past that's why he's not still here. But...he just did terrible, terrible thing. [Sighs].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's so painful for this helpless creature to be just stomped on and beat on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And [inaudible 0:18:35].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was terrible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was just an innocent bystander.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He would run away all the time and I always just, like, hoped he would stay away, the poor thing. I just don't know why she took him back.</p>

<p>[00:19:00]</p>

<p>I mean, he went away when we were–when I was ten, and I remember so well coming up the driveway from the bus, and I–his car was in the driveway. And it was just like this sinking terrible pit, and I didn't want to go to–you know, I didn't want to go to my house, but I didn't know where else to go. And he was there and I could see them so well on our back porch on the couch. And they're just like holding each other and crying because my–he came back because my grandpa. I loved my grandpa.</p>

<p>So, so, so much, my grandpa, my dad's dad. And then, he was just back. Like, nothing–no big deal. And when my grandpa died, we inherited a lot of money because my grandpa [inaudible 0:19:58] bottling company.</p>

<p>[00:20:01]</p>

<p>And then, it was like now, we're buying this brand new huge house, and [inaudible 0:20:06] and it was this whole big thing. And it was fine, I guess. It was, you know, nice to have that. But I was so pissed.</p>

<p>I just don't ever even remember liking him ever. I don't remember ever having–my mom always says like oh my god, when you were a baby, he was so in love with you. And I don't even want to hear it. Like, don't even–I don't want to hear that. I don't want to know about that. I don't want to hear about that. I don't want to, like, because the only thing that could've changed that is me. If he loved me so much when I was a baby and then had so much contempt for me when I was–as far back as I can remember, then the only thing that it could've been–because apparently, he was this loving guy.</p>

<p>[00:21:11]</p>

<p>You know, and I know that logically. I know that logically, it wasn't a three-year-old child changed into a demon and deserved whatever treatment I got. But that's all I hear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From your mom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: From anybody. You know, like my grandmother, my grandma, she's such a crazy psycho.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your father's mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She's a lunatic. And, um, she'll say it all the time. Oh, he just loved you when you were a baby. Oh, he doted over you. It's like I don't give a shit. For a year of my life that I don't remember, he just loved me? That's terrific. I don't care.</p>

<p>[00:22:02]</p>

<p>Like what good does that do me? The only good it does anybody is to pat themselves on the back, and say like he is a–he was a good guy. That's all it does. That's all it's for. It's just to say like, you know, he was–like, he was a good dad for a little bit. I feel like it's just to comfort everyone else who says it. [Sighs].</p>

<p>I get really sad when I talk about my grandpa. My dad's dad. He had–he had a drinking problem, he–but he didn't drink while my dad was growing up. He quit drinking when my dad turned two.</p>

<p>[00:23:08]</p>

<p>And then, didn't drink again until, um, he started drinking the year I was born because my grandmother left him. And he was madly in love with her, and, um, there's like a serious history of substance abuse, and um, mental disorders on my side of my family. And, you know, my grandpa and his brothers are all–just have something. But when my grandma left him, it had been, you know, 20 years since he had drank, and he started drinking again. And then–but he–he was really sad drunk. That he'd get drunk and he would just cry, and he'd call us and he'd, you know, we need to come over, and make him dinner and–but then, you know, he'd just want to like hold me and just, you know.</p>

<p>[00:24:04]</p>

<p>He was just–he had a really bad problem and he just couldn't get it under control. He went to 20 rehabs in the last 15 years of his life. He just like couldn't get a handle on it. He was really–I mean, the guy was trying so hard. And he eventually, you know, he had a stroke in his 50s, and then, he died of liver failure at 57. And he lived in Texas at the time, but he would still send us, like just the kookiest, you know, just a man who kind of lost it at this point. But like, a bag of peanut M&Ms from Texas.</p>

<p>But just always still so caring and so loving, and so giving and just really the opposite of my dad. And except for the alcohol–alcoholism. Um, and then as soon as he died, like everything just kind of–everyone got money hungry. Because he wasn't–even though he was generous, he never–his kids had to work. And then, as soon as he died, everyone got everything.</p>

<p>[00:25:13]</p>

<p>And then, everyone lost their minds. And started fighting. [inaudible 0:25:21]. So, I get really sad sometimes thinking about if he hadn't, you know, if he hadn't died and what would've happened, and–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you imagine would've happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, my brothers and I probably would've been able to go to co–well, my brothers are in college now. But you know, they still would've had our college money, and so I feel like I would've been able to have done that. And I don't think my dad would've been able to get quite as out of control as he had. Maybe I'm wrong about that. I think that my, um, I feel the greed in my grandma kind of–well, but that was [inaudible 0:26:12], I don't know. I just feel like he–everyone just kind of really looked up to him, and really was–tried to be on their best behavior while he was around.</p>

<p>[00:26:21]</p>

<p>And when he was gone, no one was really accountable to anything anymore, it didn't really matter. And I just feel like there would've...there would've been a male in my life that was a positive, you know. I only remember my grandpa telling me he loved me, not my dad.</p>

<p>[00:27:01]</p>

<p>He and my mom were really close, too. She took care of him a lot when he was sick, more than his–his own kids. She loved him. And, um, they had like a really–she really treated him like he was her own dad. You know, it always–she was there once a week cleaning his house for him, and was always taking care of him, making sure his refrigerator was stocked, and was always bringing us over so that, you know, we could see him and we could have a relationship with him. I think she thought that was really important.</p>

<p>But, you know, my grandmother doesn't like my mom. And so, when my parents divorced, anything I ever said was like oh, you're just like your mother. Oh, that's something your mother would say. You know, this, that and you know, you're just like your mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this your father's–</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: –mother?</p>

<p>[00:28:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if that hadn't been coming from my grandmother, it would've been the best compliment. It would've been you're just like your mother, like, you know, it would've been something completely different. So...[sighs]. My dad's just repeating everything that my grandpa did, but like a decade ahead. Mm, well, he never quit drinking. Well, he did quit drinking, excuse me.</p>

<p>[00:29:01]</p>

<p>But he's–he did his relapsing in his 30s instead of his 40s. He had a stroke in his 40s instead of his 50s. And it just feels like–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Déj� vu?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. But with a mean man instead of...and a mean man that nobody wants anything to do with. I mean, his siblings don't want anything to do with him. We–my brothers and I have a really hard time, I mean, he's–my brothers, I guess, saw him in–a couple of weeks ago, and he's on some new–he's finally being medicated for bipolar. But he was on some stuff that's calming him down, but he's just an asshole. It's like yeah, dad's really easy to be around, he just takes a lot of naps. It's like, well, that's good. [Chuckles].</p>

<p>[00:30:02]</p>

<p>Yeah. Like, I don't know how to–I want to–I want to–I don't want him to die and then regret. When he dies, I don't want to have been the asshole. If that makes any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 0:30:38] what would you being the asshole entail?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not talking to him, not giving him the time of day. The one who, you know, I sued my dad for embezzling my trust fund. And I pretty much just had been saying fuck you to him since the age of seven.</p>

<p>[00:31:00]</p>

<p>And then, a few years ago, I just decided like this is me carrying around all of this, like, this black, dark cloud for him, is only hurting me. It's not hurting him. It's not hurt–you know, he doesn't care. Um, and so, I feel like just being kind of the bigger person and allowing myself to have a relationship with him, whatever that means. Then, I don't know.</p>

<p>I also have this fear that like he's going to die, and then, I'm going to think like oh, I never even gave him a chance. I never even, you know, I never even let him apologize, I don't think he ever would. But I never even, you know, I have these thoughts. And so, now my thought is just like well, he's probably going to die pretty soon the way he's going.</p>

<p>[00:32:04]</p>

<p>So, just make sure that like you're okay with it when it happens. Whatever that means. [Sighs]. So, I'm trying to figure out what that means. And that pretty much just means seeing when he's around, but it doesn't mean what I was doing in the summer, which is whenever he called and said he was sad, I would book a rental car that night and go up and see him immediately. And then, he'd do drugs and ignore me in his bedroom the entire weekend. That I know isn't good. But I'm just trying to figure out what it is exactly. [Sighs].</p>

<p>[00:33:03]</p>

<p>He got a new phone number because his ex-girlfriend had been calling him over and over. And so, he got a new phone number and we all called him on Christmas. You know, he called my brothers, both to tell them that he got a new phone number and that he wanted them to have it. And they had told me in the beginning because everyone was like oh, he didn't call me and tell me.</p>

<p>And they're like oh, well, we gave him your number. And [inaudible 0:33:23]. And then, we all called him on Christmas. And I was like so, I still don't have your new number, like, you know, and he said oh yeah, let me get a pen, let me write yours down. And so, I said here–you know, I gave it to him and I said call me so that I have yours, just, you know, in case. Because I was calling him like once every other week just to see how he was doing. And he still hasn't called me. It was like, you know, it's been over a month. And I don't know why I care. But it still hurts my feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel rejected?</p>

<p>[00:33:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. All the ti–I mean, it's just like a continual rejection. It just doesn't stop. But it doesn't really–more just pisses me off now. Like, alright. What? I just don't get it. I don't know, he–and you know, no matter how many times I tell myself like he's a narcissist, he's narcissistic and he's mentally unstable, and he's an addict, and he doesn't think about anybody but himself. Like, it still doesn't stop me from thinking why hasn't my dad called me? Why didn't he call me on my birthday again?</p>

<p>You know, like, it still doesn't stop that. And I guess it just doesn't matter what kind of psycho your dad is, you're always going to want him to care about you. And I don't like that.</p>

<p>[00:35:04]</p>

<p>Just because, you know, you're always brought up thinking like your parents love you no matter what. And it's just so not true. You know? I don't know, I guess part of me always still does think, even though the logical side of my brain, the emotional side of my brain still feels like it's–it's you. It's something–it's you. It's whatever you are. I guess at this point, I've been so vocal about my hatred to him that probably he–of course, he doesn't want anything to do with me. But it still doesn't make it easier.</p>

<p>[00:36:05]</p>

<p>I guess. I don't know. Why do I want him to have anything to do with me? It's–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you desperately want a father. Unfortunately, the person who was cast in that role [Interposing] making a complete mockery of [Interposing].</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's just incapable of it. He just shouldn't have ever been a dad. But he can be a dad to my brother–I mean, not a real dad. But he can, you know, he can call them once a week. And he can, like, you know, ask them to–my brother complains all the time about my dad calling and bitching about everything in his life. And it pisses me off. He'll say like oh my god, the old man called me again and wouldn't stop talking about himself for an hour and a half. It's like...</p>

<p>[00:37:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think he's bragging?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I think he's genuinely irritated. He says stuff to me, like, you know, he said to me over Christmas, I had an extra few days off from work, and I said like yeah, I thought about going to Florida and staying at dad's because my dad has a three-bedroom condo down there. And he was like–he said that is an awful idea. You'd give him another stroke.</p>

<p>And he just–you know, I was like what do you mean by that? He was like you make dad so uncomfortable, he would hate that. Alright. I kind of already felt that way. I kind of already knew that, but thanks for rubbing it in, pal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait. Is this is your older or younger brother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Older. And they're, you know, they used to live together up on our property in Manomet with the cabins for a couple of years, and they were always really close. And they were–they have a really strained relationship now, but growing up, they were two peas in a pod.</p>

<p>[00:38:02]</p>

<p>And they are the most similar. I mean, my brother is not as much of an asshole. My brother's an asshole, but my brother struggles a little bit more with his drinking. And my brother struggles a little bit more with maintaining healthy relationships, and–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Interposing] say a little bit. A little bit more than your father? [Interposing] [inaudible 0:38:26] maybe a little bit more relative to your dad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Than me. Is that not accurate?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it sounds like your brother's completely off the rails.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Interposing] completely off. Wasn't he just in detox?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he was in the ER.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was in the ER. And didn't they sort of force the detox on him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's very interesting that you say that. That he drinks a little bit more than me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, he just struggles more in the sense that like I can relate in the sense that–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you drive drunk often?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Absolutely not. I did get a DUI when I was 18.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will note that for the record. I guess I was simply saying that because–I don't know, there's a way in which you're sort of–you're putting yourself in his [inaudible 0:39:18] sort of, except a little bit different quantitatively. But–and that's striking.</p>

<p>[00:39:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just because we, like, you know, he and I will call each other–it's like one of our–it used to be like, it'd be like oh my goodness, like I went out and like I had a great time with my friends. Like, I know for him, him going out and drinking means like 12 shots and like six beers. And for me, it means like six beers and I'm really hung over. But for us, it's both always like we went out and we were like both kind of like in the same boat, and then we'd both just like related to the anxiety thing, and we were both–I don't know, I think it was also just [inaudible 0:40:02] my way of feeling close to him.</p>

<p>[00:40:03]</p>

<p>And relating to him because our relationship was really strained for a long time. And so, I think for a long time, I tried to be close to him in that way and relate to him. And I think he wanted somebody to tell him that it wasn't just him. And that he wasn't–and I did, too, for a lot of things. [Sigh].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, when I sort of said well, I don't know, it doesn't sound like you're [inaudible 0:40:40], and that it's just a little bit of more [Interposing] how did that strike you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: As the truth. Like, something I'd always kind of thought but didn't really let myself think, I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what is it like to let yourself think that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me feel like I'm, like, better than it. Or like healthier than him. And I feel bad about that.</p>

<p>[00:41:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Crying] because I worry about him so much and I get really upset thinking about him being, like, hurt and kind of damaged from everything. And then, not really processing it, and like coming out in all these other ways. And I feel like at least before when it was–the both of us were the same, it was like the both of us together. And now, he's–and I don't like thinking about him being all alone because then he's just like my dad.</p>

<p>[00:42:03]</p>

<p>I think I could [inaudible 0:42:04] thinking about my brothers being sad. I was asking my girlfriends like, we were all talking about our [inaudible 0:42:11] then I said like something along the lines of when my brothers are upset, it literally brings me to tears.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you say abnormally sad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't–I don't know anybody else who gets so emotionally invested in their siblings' feelings, and trials and tribulations.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're all part of a war together, and [inaudible 0:42:36] intense feelings about each other's struggles.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that's what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, there's a lot of ways to define war. The one way I think about it is when you're very survival is threatened on a fairly frequent basis.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Both physical and emotional.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. And that makes me want to take the reins of everything for the both of them. It makes me want to say like I figured it out, I know what to do. Like, it makes me want to say like come live in my living room.</p>

<p>[00:43:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, if you want to counteract that feeling of helplessness that you were so–you were helpless back then, and you're helpless now to do anything about them, not yourself, but about them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But that's–I hate that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's devastating. Especially because I feel like they won't take care of themselves.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't want them to be sad for...</p>

<p>[00:44:09]</p>

<p>[Sighs]. And for some reason, I feel that even more [inaudible 0:44:13] my mom. Like, I feel that same way about my mom for the most part for some reason. There's part of me that thinks like you take care of yourself. You do that. Like, I love you and I want to, like, I still am very needy with my mom. Like, if you know, I still talk to her every day and have like a very close relationship with her. But not in that same way where with my brothers, I think I would do absolutely anything for them. And to the point where I really want to just fix everything for them.</p>

<p>[00:45:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to–we're going to need to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. We didn't really end on the happier note like I had planned.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well. I would say I'm sorry for that, but I'm not so sure that's [Interposing] for what you need to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, I respect that you have somewhere to go though and [Interposing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Interposing]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I'll see you on Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Great. Thank you so much for meeting me with this [Interposing].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad I had the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, great. Bye-bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Enjoy the weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. You, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

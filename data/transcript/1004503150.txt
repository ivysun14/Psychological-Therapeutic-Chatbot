<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I handled it well, but it brought it back to why I have a choice to not live there. But I feel like I really have a problem when I can't fathom why someone wouldn't think like I do. (inaudible at 00:00:13.7) Basically it came out – our landlord is kind of kooky and she installed new doors in our apartment, which was fine. But she didn't have the workman clean up after. So we came home and there was scraps of wood all over the place, and sawdust all over the floor. And no-one wanted to contact her besides me, and it kind of like comes down to me always feeling like, "Well if you want the house cleaned up, "A" will have to call." So I kind of made a joke and was like... Because they are like, "You're going to e-mail her, right?" So I'm like, "Why do I always have to do this." And like, "She only responds to you." Which is true because somehow I ended up being her like favorite or something. So I'm like, "Okay I'll e-mail her, but we have some other things that need to be followed up on," so I'm like, "do you think you guys can take care of that since I'm doing this?" [00:01:03.7]</p>

<p>So then they looked at me like I had 10 heads. So I was kind of like, "Hm, whatever." And then over the weekend both of them were away and the dishes that were still in the sink from when we talked last week are still there. (chuckles). So last night I just came home and I was really annoyed and I was like, "Can we talk because I'm feeling really annoyed and I don't want to take this out on you in like passive aggressive ways, but the house is really a mess. Do you think we could clean it at some point because I know that you're both going away again this weekend and the following weekend and I was home with the mess all weekend." So they're like, "Yeah, we'll take care of it. Maybe we can pick a day to all clean together." And then that annoyed me because I'm like, "Why do I have to pick a day to clean with you?" Because the whole thing is we can't clean together because we're so busy anyway. So I don't know. I was just like, "Why do we have to make it fun so everyone can clean when you should just be doing what you're doing?"</p>

<p>So now I agreed to cleaning with them on Thursday, which I feel like maybe I should have said something that I don't want to. And now we're going to have a cleaning party on Thursday which kind of inconveniences me, just so I get them to clean up their own mess. [00:02:11.6]</p>

<p>And then I said like, "I don't mind cleaning and vacuuming and doing that stuff. I really don't care. But I don't want to have to clean up you stuff so I can do that." And they're like, "Okay." And then one of them felt really bad and said, "Are you mad at me?" I'm like, "I'm not mad but I could get really angry when I'm in these situations." But I feel like I said something, so that was good because normally my thing would be to not say anything and I found myself searching for apartments on Craigslist or something. And it's more like to making a decision about, do I want to leave this situation, or running away from it, or packing off and going. But then looking back I'm like, I just really felt annoyed that they ... And I think I said something like, "I don't want to have to ask you to clean up your own mess." And I said, "It makes me uncomfortable because I don't want to feel like a nag, but I wish that you guys wouldn't put me in a position where I have to ask." So then they're like, "Okay." So I hope, I don't know if they'll do anything, but I felt better that I said something. [00:03:17.0]</p>

<p>And then I saw my dad yesterday. He was annoying as ever, but yet it didn't annoy me as much. So we like... He has been complaining for the last couple of weeks that I never see him and I never do anything, so I think I just realized that the man just will never be pleased. So I was going to a Super Bowl party and I needed to go food shopping to get stuff for the piñatas that I was going to make. So I ask him if he wanted to go to Trader Joe's with me, because that's like a field trip for him. And then I was going to visit my brother who was working at my dad's store. So I'm like, "Oh maybe I'll be nice he can go to Trader Joe's on his field trip and then we can all have coffee together." Then he was like, "I don't want to go to Trader Joe's. What do I need to Trader Joe's for?" I'm like, "You like Trader Joe's. You usually get excited when you go there." And he was like, "No. I'm not eating any junk food." Because he goes to Trader Joe's for his gluten-free dairy-free snacks. [00:04:16.3]</p>

<p>Sure, okay. So then he said that he'll meet me at the store because he doesn't want to drive in my car because he only likes driving his own car. It sounded really silly because we were both coming from kind of the same direction going north. And he gets there 45 minutes late. And then he's nagging on my brother and then starts going to work, and he wasn't even supposed to work. And then he was complaining after that I didn't spend any time with him. I'm like, "I just came up here to spend time with you and you worked." And he was really annoyed and I feel like I kind of really didn't care. Which was a milestone for me. But I think I just realized, I was thinking at the moment, "What the heck do you want? I just drove 25 miles away to see you and you went to work. And now you're complaining that you didn't see me." I did my due diligence there. But... [00:05:13.8]</p>

<p>And then I hung out with my mom which was a jam-packed day yesterday, to watch the game. The Super Bowl plans fell through and ... I don't know. They were annoying as ever and it didn't really bother me as well. I feel like I found it more comical than annoying. I did feel like that they weren't as... Well they weren't socializing with me as much as normal because they were glued to the game. So I don't know if that was okay, because eventually they were like nagging. But I don't know.</p>

<p>And then now I'm nervous today because I have to fire someone. So I've been up since 5:30 in the morning. I have to fire someone and in probably in a year and a half I've never had to fire someone at this company and so I'm a little nervous about it. [00:06:06.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes you nervous?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I just don't like being in this type of situation so I find it very awkward to have to say it and ... I think it's temperamental it would be okay. We've been working with our lawyers and stuff and we're concerned that he may sue us because he's getting terminated for many reasons like attendance, punctuality, performance, professional conduct. But he has some FMLA-approved ongoing approved time for some certain reasons. And we're concerned that he's going to think that we're firing him for that reason, and it's more performance and professionalism related. So we're worried that it could be a case where it goes to court. [00:07:00.5]</p>

<p>And then I'm involved with that and I was really thinking down the road. And I'm like, "What if this happens?" I have, like I was talking to Jamie about it last night and he said, "You have everything documented. You've been working with the lawyers for like over a month and it's not like you haven't done everything you're supposed to do. So I don't understand why you're so nervous." Then he was like, "I worry about getting sued every day of my job." True. But yeah, I don't know why I'm so nervous, but I definitely feel nervous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well in your mind there's going to be a retaliation, a potential retaliation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I always just feel bad. And then when I think about it logically I'm like, the man hasn't met his goals like twice in the last... He was on a warning when I got him, when I started last March, for I think six months. So I think he's met his goals maybe twice in the last year and a half. And he's been there for a long time, and we've tried to help him in many ways. And he's not open to it. So I know that I shouldn't feel back, but I don't know, I feel a little bad for him too. I don't know why. I feel like he's not really marketable. And then I think, "Well will he be able to get another job?" I don't know. I'm sure that he'll be fine but I start worrying about those things. [00:08:26.4]</p>

<p>And then well I think dealing with the team after is another thing that's a really stressful because then, obviously, you can't tell your team that someone was fired and for what reason. So you just say like, "They're no longer here." And most of the time you hope that they put two and two together and that's what happened. But then you always have people who are like really nervous about their performance, and they think you're cleaning house and it disrupts the morale a little bit. So then dealing with that can be a little challenging. Yeah, so. [00:09:05.6]</p>

<p>Yeah. It makes me a little nervous but... I don't know why. Someone at my place of work had to fire someone last week and she was like, "It's fine. Don't worry about it." But I don't know, I'm a worrier. And I don't know if that's like... I don't know. I always want to know that everyone will be okay. It's weird because I don't even particularly like the person. It's not like I have this good working relationship with him but, I don't know. I think for me, I think if I was ever terminated, it would be very embarrassing and I would never let it come to that. I think if it got to a certain stage I would just resign knowing that it was going down that road anyways. And so I feel like I almost apply it to myself and, I don't know, feel his shame for him maybe? I don't know. [00:10:10.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you imagine he feels ashamed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think he feels ashamed, but that I would just feel so ashamed that that's...if it was me, that that's just how I'm thinking of the situation. I don't think, I mean, I don't know. I don't think he would feel ashamed because he's not really trying, and I feel like he's trying to milk every last day out of us that he can. I mean, most people when they're on this final critical warning and you know that you haven't met your goals, and you know the next step is termination, most people resign because they don't want it to get to that point. But he's still... Like in our conversations he'll be like, "Yeah I know that I'm in a warning and I didn't meet my goals, so let me know when you're done talking with HR to see what happens." If that was me I'd be horrified. [00:11:11.8]</p>

<p>But I think I do that a lot with things. Like, I think of how I would feel in that situation and then apply it to either how I react to someone or, I don't know, how I deal with them or something. But I'm thinking like, I'm not thinking like, "Why do you care? They probably don't feel that way." Or maybe someone feels differently. But I'm just feeling like that anxiety and embarrassment and that's all I can feel. And it's like it prevents me from moving past something. Yeah, I don't know why that is. [00:12:02.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I wonder, rather than sort of firing him because of his lack of performance, that part of the reason you feel guilty is that you feel like you're firing him because you're angry at him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think a little bit, if that's true but I definitely feel like – I've felt like at time like, "Hm, my life at work would be so much easier if I didn't have to deal with your thing." We just have to document everything. So it is, I don't want say hours a week, but it is definitely a chunk of time away. I have to document his warning, and have a one on one with him. Normally I'll have a one-on-one every other week with my staff. And he has to have one every week. And then I have to sit with him to coach with him, which is terribly awkward because he doesn't really care. And so that's like at least an hour just from those two meetings. So I do think, yeah, if I didn't have to do this I'd have a lot more time. But then I think I feel like (inaudible at 00:13:05.9) situation so I think part of it is definitely true. But I think even if I wasn't angry with him I would probably still feel the same way. (chuckles) [00:13:16.6]</p>

<p>But then I think if it was someone who was really trying then I'd probably feel really bad because they were trying and just because it wasn't working out that I have to fire them. And then I just want to over-think things, because who really likes terminating someone? I don't think anyone would go into the termination room just being like, "Yeah whatever. I just did it. No stress off on me." But I don't know, I just feel like I find it particularly stressful... or awkward more so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Awkward how? [00:13:57.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I feel the need to, I don't know, say something for them. I'm not going to, it would be one thing if it was never apologize. So then it's just awkward because you're telling them their terminated and they're just kind of... well you're sitting with the HR and other people, but usually just like, "Okay." And then it's just like this awkward silence. And HR usually jumps in and asks if they have any questions and then... But it's really awkward when you get the stuff from the desk and someone else is packing it up, and then you go down to the room and you give it to him. And it's this awkward handshake goodbye, and then you never know what to say. Because I usually say, "Good luck with everything." But then I feel like is it almost insensitive to say that, or I'm not going to say, "Nice working with you," because I just fired you and I'm sure he does not feel the same way. I don't know. I just feel this is awkward all around. (pause) Yeah, that's just I guess uncomfortable. [00:15:04.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess maybe once someone has been fired, it's unclear what the relationship is anymore if there's any.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's no way of relating to a person who's not doing their job, there's a template for that. There's a way of relating. Relating to someone who's already let go, what are each person's roles at that point? There really aren't any.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I think for him, because I have fired people and after I've kept in contact with them or we just knew this job wasn't right for them, but they'd be a great fit in something else. I feel like that, in that sense, helps me be a little more comfortable. But I don't know, with him I just feel like there is no... And I'm sure like tomorrow I probably won't even think about it because it will be over, and you know. [00:16:02.5]</p>

<p>But I think it definitely plays into part of the awkwardness because before the only common thing – because he and I don't have much in common. Not that that matters, but when you're working it is what it is, but then when you're terminated I guess for that, like five minutes when you're going through the last steps of the termination, it's just weird for me. (pause)</p>

<p>Then I don't know why I'm so nervous about the suing thing. It's not like he's going to sue me personally, but I just... I don't know. And then I talked to my boss about it and she's like, "Really there's nothing else you could have done and you have everything documented so... People sue and that's what the lawyers are for." But I don't think that I feel like it's a reflection on me, but I don't know in some way it kind of feels like that a little bit. But I know that there's nothing else. I don't know what else I could have done to compel him because he didn't want to get any help or do anything. [00:17:22.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like how you felt about your dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. A little bit. Like he hasn't been fired yet. (pause) But... yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you certainly have a list of expectations that he hasn't met. He hasn't reached the goals.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're very aware of that. [00:18:00.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm. I guess I never really... I guess on the surface I think about him not meeting things, but I never really think about it better like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you have a list of parental requirements, and he like... I don't know if he's even met any of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Food and shelter. But yeah. But then I feel, I don't know, I feel – and I don't know if this is like guilt or something that he's instilled in my dad, or if there's just a certain way that he, I don't know, manipulates you. But then I feel bad for feeling like I have these expectations. Like just now, when you said that out loud, I'm aware that I have expectations but it made me feel bad for a second. But then I feel like I shouldn't feel bad to have the expectations, but then I don't know, I think his idea of what a good parent is or even like a good person is just so basic that I just end up feeling bad that I want more, expect more. [00:19:20.2]</p>

<p>And then he gets angry with you for giving you the most basic thing, and it's almost like, "How dare you want anything else more." Or, "You should be lucky that you had food and shelter." That brings up a whole array of feelings because it makes me angry that he can't understand why I may need or want something else. Then it makes me feel bad that he didn't, doesn't care that I'm mentioning that, or isn't empathetic to it, or that he couldn't, I don't know, recognize that himself. [00:20:00.5]</p>

<p>And then I feel like in many situations, when I just start to feel like that, I don't know, I feel like I just shut down easily. And a lot of time, just because I feel like I'm not getting what I want anyway, so it's just easier to shut down and move on than it is to deal with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's easier about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really deal with it, I think? Or I think I just have this expectation that my expectations will never be met. And so then I end up feeling like, "Well it's up to yourself to kind of get what you want." And then, I don't know, I feel like that's my way of severing whatever it is there and then you're just like moving on. I don't know why that feels easy for me, but maybe it's easier than being upset. [00:21:00.9]</p>

<p>I think I end up being upset, but it's just upset in a different way. I think it's upset like angry and annoyed than it is sad that an expectation wasn't met. So it's easier for me to feel those like annoying and anger feelings than it is to be sad, I think.</p>

 

 

 

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's a lot easier for you to feel that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then, and honestly many times you just are so, I don't know, not self-centered because I don't think that that's probably the proper word – but I feel like I don't want to depend on anyone because I feel like, I don't know. Either like, you can't give me what you want, you're going to let me down, so I'll just... I won't even give you that option to try to help me because I'll just do it myself because it's ... Most people let me down anyways and I can't rely on anyone but myself so I'll just do it myself and make sure it gets done. [00:22:08.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then there's a question whether that's a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you talk about with your roommates, they kind of know what they do but they feel like, "Well "A" will always take care of it." So...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And that's the thing. Jamie is like, "They're totally taking advantage of you." And I don't know if they're taking advantage, but I definitely think like maybe, "Who would think to clean the house when the house is always clean?" I feel like I see things like, "Hm, they're starting to get a little messy I'm going to pick them up." But if they know that once a week it's always tidy, or it will be tidy, I feel like it's... Or maybe they are doing it intentionally. I don't know. I don't think so but... I feel like you wouldn't even think to do those things.</p>

<p>And then I feel like I just feel the pressure to do things a lot more than other people. And I don't know if that's because I always feel like I have to do it myself, but the pressure to make sure the house is super-clean. Or to make sure that I'm responsible enough myself so I have... I can save, I can be self-sufficient, so I won't have to ask anyone for help. And I think that can really stress me out at times. So yeah. [00:23:30.3]</p>

<p>And then I think, like I've definitely come in the last couple of months to the realization that I'm probably causing some of this myself because I don't say things. Or I don't, you know. So I feel like I need to speak up and then when I do speak up sometimes I feel angry. Or like the people... Like I'm speaking up out of anger versus speaking up to just say something. So that's like, I felt like talking to the roommates, I ended up speaking up because I was angry. But I was able to identify that I wanted to speak because I was angry and I changed my tone and stance. So I felt that that was a small good step in the right direction. [00:24:15.5]</p>

<p>And then I think it's like speaking up sooner too, because a lot of times I'm like, "I don't want to have to say anything for this little issue." And then all the little ones build up and then there's an explosion. And then I think, with most people it's okay to speak up, but in like – not my mom – my family, you can't speak up to my dad because then he'll just nag on you that you're upset for a small reason. Or that you had to speak up for something small. And I feel like that sets the sort of tone, and contributed to me feeling like, I don't know, and then I feel like I'm complaining. [00:25:05.5]</p>

<p>But then all I really want is just like, fairness. I don't want someone to clean the whole house for me. I'll even clean most of the house and do most of the chores, but I just don't want to clean up anyone else's mess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's true. All you want is fairness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Because I feel like I don't expect silver platter extended to me, I just don't want to clean up you crappy platter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well all you want is fairness and you don't understand why other people don't act according to that principle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then that makes me wonder like is it me, because I feel like things are not as fair a lot. Like roommates, work, and even my parents the way they treat my brother and myself I feel like is very unfair. I think I'm much more responsible and I don't want to have to depend on them in, the way my brother does, but ... [00:26:06.6]</p>

<p>Like the other day he... So he quit working for my dad, then he's broke so he's working for my dad again a couple of days a week. He went to Arizona last month. He's going back again, I think maybe next week, to visit a friend and my mom is like, "I just bought Brian a ticket to Paris because he said that he always wanted to go there." And I'm thinking like, "Gee, that's nice but why in the world did you do that?" So... I don't want a ticket to Tennessee, or maybe I do, I don't know. I just feel like things are really unfair and I feel like I'm always the common issue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like if I think all of these things are unfair across the board, is it me and not the other people? They'll be like I perceive what's fair. I don't think so, but then I just start to wonder. [00:27:09.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you feel it's an issue of, or that it might be an issue of that you assess what fair is differently?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've thought about that, but I don't think that that's what it really is. Because I think when it comes down to some common sense things, it's like, you clean up after yourself I'll clean up after myself. Or in the work schedule, like you don't have five early outs and I have one. I think they're kind of simple math things where you evenly divide it up, or ask someone if they think it's fair, or if they're... I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Quite a lot of people don't care whether things are fair. That's not how they operate. They're not important to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And so now I'm like yeah, how do I ... (clearing throat). I guess I don't – like what I said to my roommates, I don't like having to tell people what I want so I feel like it's fair to myself, because that makes me feel uncomfortable or like I'm being naggy. So I feel like, I almost feel like they should know to clean up after themselves. [00:28:15.7]</p>

<p>And then I feel like for me to have to ask you to clean up after yourself is unfair. For me to have to, in a work setting, say, "I don't think it's fair for you to not close or..." I don't know. I almost interpret it as rude. Why would you make someone have to do that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You feel like they're making you do something. You absolutely feel that way. That other people's decisions force you to do stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I think part of it's because I, I don't know, I don't like speaking up to be like, "This is the problem." So then I end up just being like, "Here's the situation and what do we need to do to..."; get the house clean, have the coverage at work, do whatever. And then I'm just, I do it versus addressing the issue. [00:29:11.8]</p>

<p>And I mean it gets things done, it doesn't necessarily make me happy, or happy at the moment. So yeah. I don't know how to deal with the situations because I end up feeling like I'm complaining, almost.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're very annoyed that people do not do things the way you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm. I feel like that sounds really bad though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? What sounds bad about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I feel... Well, I mean it's true that I get annoyed with people really easily but, I don't know, I feel like it makes me sound inflexible. But then sometimes me being too flexible is what leads to this. Or I feel like it just makes me, or it sounds like I just want everyone to operate like me. Or... [00:30:12.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do!</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I know. But I feel like that sounds manipulative.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Because I... I don't know. I mean I don't want everyone to be... I feel like when I say that I think of it maybe too deeply. I just picture a bunch of little "A"s walking around. But... (laughs) No, but I mean yeah I guess in fairness I expect, yeah anytime I wish more people did operate like me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you started today by saying you understand that people do things that are so different than how you do them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel like... I don't know. For me it's such a basic... Just like my dad harps on food and shelter. I feel like this basic should be, I don't know, a common understanding. I don't know. It is really hard for me to think, "How could you not see a problem?" Having ... Like when we did our schedule last week, everyone claimed their time and it was like Monday and Friday left. And I said, "I don't want to close Friday. And I've closed the last three Friday's." And they just looked at me like... And I was just like, "I don't think that's really fair." And then I end up saying like, "Well if you already made plans that's fine, but in the future I think it would be nice if you would just come to me if you're going to put me in a position where I have to close." I felt really nasty when I said that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is it a group decision? Who is the ultimate decider? [00:32:06.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I feel like in an ideal world, people would say before, "I have these commitments, are you going to be able to close this day?" So we go into the room and usually hash out the schedule. And so we'll go through each day and then when it comes to certain days, everyone's like, "I can't go because I'm working in the morning." Or like, "I already made plans for dinner." "I have a basketball game." And then, I mean I guess I could chime in with like, "I have dinner plans too." But I don't. So I feel like because I'm available...</p>

<p>So I guess to answer your question the ultimate decider would be like if we went to our boss and said like, "No one can close this day." And I'm sure she would say like, "Well someone has to give something off to close." And maybe I should do that once so someone can feel it. But I'm usually like, "Oh well you know I don't have plans. Or if I do it's not ‘till later, so I'll do it."[ 00:33:06.7]</p>

<p>But then that happens a lot. And then I just think if we are communicating on certain days that we couldn't be here then maybe we wouldn't run into this as much. Or I would know what I'm in for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What you're in for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Coming up schedule-wise. Because I feel like there's going to come a time where we're going to go into the room and I'm going to have plans too. And that's going to be a problem. Like we're already battling over the day after President's Day which is ridiculous because Jamie will be here that Sunday and he leaves Tuesday night. And this girl, Steph, was like, "I want..." We're not sure if we're open Monday yet so some people will work and if you have to work you get an extra day off. So she's like, "I want Monday and Tuesday off because I have basketball games." And then another girl I work with has kids so she wants Monday off, and then someone else wants an early schedule. And I'm like, "I'm fine working one..." And it's like I'm the rational one. So I'm like, "You know my boyfriend's here. I would like one of the days off so I don't mind working the holiday if we don't have anyone, but I want my comp day to be Tuesday because I want to spend one of the days with him." And she's like, "Well I have the basketball game." And then I have Jerry going, "Well I have to work in that night." And then Trisha is like, "I need to have an early schedule because of the baby." So then I end up thinking like, "Well I'm not going to work Monday and then work a late shift on Tuesday. I don't think that's very fair." And then I just started thinking about the other girl, I'm like, "You're going to have two days off, why can't you give up one of them? It's only a basketball game." And then I feel really annoyed. [00:35:00.9] (pause)</p>

<p>But then I ended up thinking about myself, like did my inflexibility or my flexibility just put me in this position? I feel like if I was like, "Nope not working the holiday because I have plans." But I feel like when you say things like that you force someone into a position and I don't want to force someone into doing something when I'm so bold and like, "Nope I have plans." You know. "Tough shit. Whoever's here can figure it out." I don't think that's fair. So then I end up feeling like, I don't know, too nice and I always get the short end of the stick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You see people as forcing each other to do things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And so yeah. Just really annoying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's sort of, this is a series of control battles, power struggles. [00:36:01.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then like there's never – for most of the time I don't like saying anything because to me it feels like complaining. But maybe others don't view it that way. I think I feel like it's complaining because I'm upset about it at the moment, and so... Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it does seem that you feel it is ultimately up to you to figure this out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I know that I shouldn't feel like that because when I think about it more, I'm sure if there were more situations where none of us would work, my boss would like, she's pretty fair where she would help out if need be, or I think if it came up more she would end up saying, "You know one of you has to give something up" And I think if it came to that clearly I wouldn't be the one always giving something up. [00:37:11.4]</p>

<p>I think at that level, I don't know, (inaudible at 00:37:14.7) speak about it more. I feel like I don't want to raise the issue or I'm not comfortable with raising the issue. So I feel like I make myself flexible so it doesn't have to go there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you say ‘raise the issue'. Raise the issue with your boss?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think makes you uncomfortable about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like, I don't even think that she would take it badly, but I feel like these things should easily be resolved at our level. I don't think that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? Why should they be easily resolved?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I feel like it's a stupid issue. I mean it's not stupid because it's clearly important to all of us, but I feel like it's, I don't know, it's... I don't know. I mean I say that it's a small issue but it's a big one. But I feel like it should be a small issue. It's like I shouldn't be as big of a problem as it is. [00:38:13.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Accor...I mean why? I'm not sure where you're getting that from that it should be small.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because then it goes back to me thinking, or wanting people to think what I think. I feel like they should be able to connect the dots that someone's going to have to give something up every once in a while. Or someone may have to make themselves more flexible. Or go to her boyfriend's game late. I don't know. I feel like if those things were realized, it wouldn't have to go to the next level. But then I feel like it's not my problem to make people realize that. So I don't know. Maybe my boss should address it. [00:39:06.0] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I guess I'm not clear why they have to realize that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well because I think the choice that she would give us would be like, "You guys need to work it out yourself," and people would have to think about those things. I feel like if we could do that now then it wouldn't go to that place anyways. If that makes any sense.</p>

<p>I don't know. I feel like I've just – I don't know. It's just like, why can't a group of adults figure out a schedule to work for a week. And then I just feel really intolerant of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it is very similar to the way you feel about your dad. He's an adult, why can't he just act like an adult? [00:40:01.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) Right. And I know that he can't say what's more important to one person over the next, but like with these stupid basketball games it's not like if you have a kid or something. That's, and again I know that I can't be the one to decide what's important and what's not, but if you have a kid I feel like that's a little bit different than you wanting to go to every single one of the basketball games that your boyfriend coaches. I think there are multiple games a week. I feel like, I don't know, are you out of your mind to think like you can go to all of them? It just doesn't seem very rational to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do people have to be rational? Why? Why do they have to adopt that philosophy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She wants to get as many games as she wants. I'm not necessarily it's great to be selfish, but that's what she wants. That's how she wants to live. That's what she wants. [00:41:08.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I feel like it's overstepping boundaries. I feel like if I were like, "I want to go to a zumba class four times this week, people would look at me like I was crazy and be like, "You need to have an early schedule every day so you can attend the gym?" Or, I don't know. I feel like there are things... I know that that's important to her, but I feel like she – I don't want to say I know that she knows – but she, I assume she knows that that's not the norm, or not fair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She doesn't care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She doesn't care, it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I don't know how to deal with people who don't care because I end up feeling really just annoyed and frustrated with them.[ 00:42:05.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. We do want to change them. You wanted them to recognize that their behaviors impact on others, and you want to change them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. Because I feel like at the end of the day it affects me, and so yeah. And then I end up feeling more annoyed because I'm like, "I don't want to – I just want what's fair." I don't like feeling imposed-upon, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like you guys are not very good at being equitable or whatever. It sounds like you need a lot more of your boss's help. It doesn't seem like you guys can figure it out on your own unless you're okay with taking the shifts no-one else wants.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [00:43:01.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess what I'm trying to address with you is you feel very insistent that people need to act a particular way, and they have to act the right way in a fair way, they have to be considerate of others. And when they don't do that, that's not acceptable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I don't know what to do, or how to change myself when I feel really annoyed in those situations or...Yeah because obviously I know that not everyone thinks like me, but I feel like there is this hope that people will be more, I don't know, rational, considerate, whatever other word you want to use. And then I know that, and I'm able to recognize how annoyed I feel but I don't know how to step out of it and feel like, "Well I just don't care." And then deal with it. I feel like that's where I get stuck. [00:44:07.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you don't know what to do with the feeling that things should go a certain way. You hold to that very tenaciously.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just realized we're going to need to stop for today. So I will see you tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Take care. [00:44:41.5]</p>

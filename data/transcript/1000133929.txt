<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you going over somebody else?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like worms doesn't it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I thought maybe you had it like that deliberately. No, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No that's just, that's some crazy way to record. No, I'm not going over anybody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I don't know. I was just looking at my money. I don't know where it went. It's been a problem lately. </p>

<p>Oh my old boyfriend came to see me at school today unexpectedly. And felt good when he came first, when I first saw him I was angry that he was there. Then when I was talking to him I felt bad for him. I'm not sure about why. And then later when I was talking to him I got angry at him. But most of the time I just felt really guilty. And I really think that I shouldn't feel guilty about him. 0:01:19.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, but I really, I think that I might. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's all (inaudible at 0:01:31.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. When you say something logically, the logic of the situation is that you of all things you shouldn't be feeling guilty. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there you were really feeling like you had done something wrong. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Even at the time and somehow I guess he makes me feel like I let him down. He doesn't, I don't know if he knows that he does that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he does that. 0:02:01.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you really feel like..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway, I feel like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you've betrayed him, or.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I don't know how I should feel when I see him. Just meet him. I mean with other old boyfriends things weren't as intense and I just felt friendly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel sometimes friendly with him but there's an undercurrent of something else. Sometimes it's very hostile, sometimes. But mostly I feel good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, I think today that I really wanted to yell at him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But of course I was in a classroom and couldn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you really were angry with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I was. I was. He was telling me that he was the best thing that had ever happened to me. And it was making me real angry. 0:03:03.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where does he come off saying that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean how do I know? Maybe that's the truth but I don't think that at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, but I got real angry. But I did let him know it. But I was still feeling bad. Even when I was feeling angry I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I guess it doesn't matter. But it just, I was feeling so guilty. And actually I know that I felt guilty all along. I don't know. Maybe I deliberately like set out to get at him. When I came back from Michigan where I had the baby and I sought him out. I think I said that before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.0:03:57.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then after he was dating me again I went out with everyone else that I could. So maybe I was deliberately trying to get back at him. Which I even thought at the time but I was feeling guilty about it. I don't know. Does that makes any sense?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it doesn't to you and I'm not sure. Is that right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but I don't know why I should feel guilty. I should have just wanted to get back at him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, something plain and simple like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And all the time you were wanting to get back but you were feeling badly about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Well I didn't always want to hurt him. But I really think that last year when I was going out with him I basically [hit on him] (ph) That's what I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.0:05:00.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway. And of course James, my boyfriend now who works with me. He's really, I don't know what he is. He doesn't like to see Drew. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that he feels guilty. Because he feels, I think, that he's throwing me away. I mean which really isn't true because I have a lover. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [He's very good.] (ph)And so he was really very upset. Maybe that has something to do with the way I'm feeling. </p>

<p>What else? I'm going to change the subject, ok. James' started playing basketball. I can't remember if he was doing it when I was here before. Maybe he was. I think he was. Oh yeah. I think I talked about it. But anyway, he played like three days last week. And each time when he played it. One time he met me afterwards. One time he came home and didn't go out. And one time when he was going to go out with only the fellows he was playing with, he came home and asked me if I wanted to go. 0:06:40.0</p>

<p>Now, about the third time that he went, after he left I was really furious. And I didn't let him know I was angry because I thought it was really ridiculous. I couldn't understand why I was. And I knew he would be angry with me if he thought I was angry. But I was furious. Really, furious. I mean I was throwing things around the apartment. </p>

<p>And I had to call up my roommate. And tell me the things I already knew. She had to tell them to me, so I would stop being furious. So then I decided, I didn't know why I was furious so I thought maybe I was just bored.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like while it was happening, almost like being on a trip and having to be talked down. Having your roommate talk you down. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I knew she was going to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's why you wanted to speak to her. But it sounds like you experienced something really out of control. Like needing that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah well, I didn't wreck the apartment or anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I threw a couple of things around. And I was just angry. And I was, I mean I was really, yeah I was almost, I was ridiculous. I was going to pick up all my clothes and leave. I mean really stupid. 0:08:06.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he hadn't done anything wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I knew he was going to come back right after he played. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like being so angry and being very uncomfortable with that anger. Feeling like, "Hey this doesn't have any justification. There's no excuse for this." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's how I felt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Dumb way to be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I was building up to that though. Because the other two nights that he went, the first night I forgot. I was either angry or upset. Some, I had some reaction to it. The second time it a little resent (ph). The third time, I guess he played four times. And the third time was this time when I had unreasonable. And then the fourth time it was all right. 0:09:10.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. I don't understand what you're saying with all of that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean I, the first time that he went to play I was a little angry. The second time I was more. And the third time I was more angry. So I just thought that maybe I was just spoiled. Not, because I couldn't think of any reason to be. I was very selfish. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like you really feel maybe it's kinda like you have no right to be angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something wrong with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was going to say that it won't happen again. It probably won't. But similar things, let's see. I don't know a whole lot of things with him. Not really. With Drew I'd know for sure all the time. 0:10:14.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I feel even justifiably angry I think no that wasn't the case. Even justifiably a little angry with somebody. It doesn't even have to be a man. Although the reaction is more so with men. I probably show my anger at first and then almost immediately feel, I was going to say bad. That's not very descriptive. I don't know what I want to say. Like I have to say that I wasn't angry and it was my fault. That's how. And I do that. 0:11:34.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you really, yeah. Like you have to, if you're angry you have to apologize. Right away. Right after you're angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't get. That doesn't happen too often with people that I don't know very well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It's just people you get close to and stuff. 0:12:00.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it bothers me because I think that I sometimes have the right to be angry but I always do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Like no matter what, no matter what the provocation you always wind up kinda coming back with your tail between your legs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Drew doesn't like to fight. Wouldn't fight with me. James does the same thing. It's very frustrating. I mean not that I, I really don't get angry at James very often with provocation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was getting angry at him the other night and he just stopped talking. I mean he wouldn't say anything back. I felt like a fool.0:13:21.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you were trying to pick a fight or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was just trying to state my thoughts on the subject. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like you felt not heard or something. Like you had more to say and he wouldn't listen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He wouldn't. He didn't want to fight. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you felt like frustrated I guess. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, "I want you to hear all of what I have to say."</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then I was afraid to say it. I mean I kept on longer than I should have anyway. I knew that he was getting mad at me. And then I thought that I had better shut up. Because I really didn't want him to be angry at me. 0:14:09.7</p>

<p>I want you to talk to me now. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I felt like all I was doing for the past few times was talking about men. I thought there must be more to talk about. 0:15:07.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something's wrong with just talking about men.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's wrong? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually it probably is uppermost in my mind. However the, yeah it probably is the most important thing to me. But I feel that it shouldn't be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I feel I should be more on my own or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That made it sound like you're saying, you should like somehow that's a dependency thing or something like that. 0:16:03.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even if I didn't have a boyfriend I'm sure that that would still be the main subject on my mind though. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So yeah. Like that, sounds like you're saying you're pretty sure that no matter what the sorta outside situation is, like that's a pretty important concern to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh it is. And I really, I mean I feel that it should be important but, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're uncomfortable with it being that important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I, yeah. I guess. </p>

<p>It's almost like when I do some, it's really gotten horrible. When I do something on my own I, let's see. I don't know if this is true. I have to think about it. Sometimes this is true. If I do something on my own, I feel after I've done it that I have to get approval for it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. I just can't do it myself, whatever it is I don't know, and be satisfied. I have to have approval from, well daily. 0:18:03.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least acknowledgement. Not necessarily approval.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like it almost doesn't mean anything without having James say, "Yeah, you did that."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Isn't that horrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no I don't like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get the feeling (inaudible at 0:18:31.6) talk about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. Partly stupid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You depend on him to kinda give your life shape.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I really think that's wrong. I mean I tell myself that that's not true and I mean, I don't know. It is. 0:19:04.0</p>

<p>I can understand having like a base, is that a good word, with another person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Some place to touch every once in a while. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or like a center or something. But it shouldn't be so all engulfing. I really don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like a place you can come. It should be a place you can come back to rather than some sort of a prison that you don't want to, to get out of. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. A nice prison but it is a prison. 0:19:57.1</p>

<p>I know that there are some times that I don't care if I stay at his apartment at night, you know. I wouldn't say that I don't want to but it is I don't care if I do or not. And I always do. And I'm sure that some of the times he doesn't care either. But I still always do. And that bothers me that I do that. Because I don't have to do that. He's not going to do something crazy if I'm not there. I don't have to watch him. But I guess maybe I think that I do. Maybe I don't want to miss anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like there's sometimes when you don't, when you're indifferent to being there. 0:21:10.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And really maybe he's indifferent too but the thought of not being there really makes you uptight. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thought of having you out of your sight or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, isn't that horrible to say? It really makes me sick to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: An awful way to feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That much like you have to grab on, hold him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>It must have something to do with the way that I think that he feels about me. I think it must. I suppose that's pretty obvious. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You suppose what? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I said I suppose that's pretty obvious, what I just said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not to me. I don't know exactly what you're saying. 0:23:00.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well. It's like out of sight, out of mind, maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you're good enough for him so long as you're there. But if you're not there he'll find somebody else. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like that. And logically or intellectually or something in my head, I really know that's not true. But I guess I really don't believe it at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you can marshal all the logical and rational arguments but in a pinch when you're alone, or the thought of being alone really makes you nervous. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don't know what I was going to say. 0:24:29.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure if I feel that if I were better looking I would feel like that or not. But I might feel like that. 0:25:17.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. You mean sorta like it may be something about how you look?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean aside from being fat, like you know I'm getting old. I'm getting wrinkles. I'm sure being fat is the worst part. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like it's an additional thing. Like besides being fat it's also having some sort of feeling about yourself becoming more and more unattractive just sort of with the passage of time.0:26:02.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Yeah and that's not only physical. I'm sure I feel, I know I feel like that. Just unattractive completely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Outside is one part of it but it's inside too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't done this lately. And I haven't done it a lot with James. Before I used to do this with Drew and I felt like it a few times with James. Like, I would get angry or feel rejected or something and my immediate reaction, just immediate reaction is to eat. And that's not only because I'm kinda compulsive, it's like, what is it. "I'll show you. I'll become more unattractive." Or something. I mean it's directly related to fat. Does that make any sense? 0:27:47.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm trying to get a feel for that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like defiance or something. And I'll defy you by eating and becoming you know. Something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you like what I look like well I'll show you. I'll just disfigure myself. 0:28:11.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I haven't done that for a while. But I used to do it. And sometimes it would just feel like..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really hating them with a vengeance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Hating them and eating. Yeah. </p>

<p>What else? Oh a couple of weeks ago. It was the first time that I ever got fairly angry at James. And I left and I went to the local bar. And that was another I'll show you, really. Stayed long enough to have a few drinks and talk to people. And then I felt that I'd showed him and he was asleep all this time. Didn't even know that I had gone. 0:29:26.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So..</p>

<p>CLIENT: And didn't even ask where I'd been. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what does that 0:29:35.5</p>

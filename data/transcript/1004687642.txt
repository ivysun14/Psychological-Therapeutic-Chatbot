<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I ended up spending most of the day after we talked just feeling sad. I was also having a hard time getting or staying motivated to do things—just yesterday. I've got a transcribing project I'm working on free-lance that I've been working on so I've been trying to push it through for Thursday. I was thinking about how it is really different because my workplace is so difficult. People aren't helpful and I don't get praise very often. [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:31) haven't had any repercussions. I laughed and said—which did happened—"My manager said I should stop being so vocal or I might lose my job." He was like, "Well, that's repercussion." I was kind of like, "Oh, I didn't really think of it that way." Then I thought about a whole bunch of other things which could be considered work repercussions. That depressed me as well. When the videos were still plaguing me, I got this woman in HR that I really like, and then she left. Where we had gotten to was that she was like, "Wow, he's a big jerk and won't do anything." And I was like, "Yeah." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He being Will Parr (ph)? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of the ending was that we had a media discussion. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember that. You mean after that meeting she, having met him first-hand, said . . . ? [00:02:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Having seen how he acted and was just like, "Okay, I don't think we can do anything else." I was just like, "Yeah." She was appalled, but there was nothing else you could do. So she's back and I was thinking, "Well, I guess it was sort of resolved that Will Parr isn't here anymore." But then I was thinking about other things that have happened since then, like the head of operations turning in a performance review that was messy or had too much food; I don't really think she was still there for when the video project got canned; Chet telling me that I should stop speaking up because I might lose my job; Karl telling me I should talk to the manager about my problems; and all of those things. [00:03:54] Chet sort of detailing things in my weekly meetings with him that made me worry that he's trying to build a case of "I'm not doing enough work," which is both stressful and something that I don't think he would succeed at doing; but mostly because I think he would have to inform me and I would get three to six months to make a change. It was so convenient how no one was willing to reply to me on our staff listing. It was all just depressing. Also (sighs) I wonder why I left this job. Ethan is like, "You don't really want that job." I was like, "You're right, but if you want the things that come with it . . . ." When I got home it was hot and I was kind of cranky and Ashby was being very cranky as well. [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:42) Her new obsession is that she loves the TV show, Breaking Bad, and I really don't like it because it's violent and really depressing. [00:05:57] She can sit in the room when I'm watching TV and I can't, so I asked if, "How about you watch three episodes, go in another room and then I can watch some TV." She always is a little sulky about it. First she's like, "I feel so bad that I've thrown you out of the living room." But then I'm like, "Okay, can you be done by nine?" and she started a new show right before 9 o'clock—a new episode. I get that she wanted to sit and veg out in front of the TV, but so did I. I tried [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:57). It was too hot. I just felt kind of helpless and frustrated and not able to do anything that I wanted. [00:07:12]</p>

<p>An essay of mine had been submitted to a book and [ ] (inaudible at 00:07:31) and one of the book editors said you can't do that. The main reason being that she didn't like that I wrote an essay critiquing something that she'd written and talked about race and talked about how she made race completely invisible in this essay and makes the presumed subject like—I was like, "That's not really true. This doesn't really work for other people." [00:07:59] She had given like 20 reasons why she had rejected it. She was like, "It's not this. It's not that," but basically the answer was, "It makes me uncomfortable." It really sucked. Another essay got in, but I was still really frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Into the same book? [00:08:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Into the same book. It's a bunch of essays. They took one. Even though the essay I wrote that I was critiquing of Jen's for this specific essay, that wasn't what they had requested; like, "Can you write something that deals with race?" and I was like, "Yes I can." I wrote two things and I actually did get one in. Jen hemmed and hawed until the last minute and then finally I was like, "No." So I've basically [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:51) on that since 2008. I haven't really talked about it. My friend, Anne, who is an editor felt really bad about it. I feel like it's not that I'm mad that my essay wasn't in, I'm mad for the reason that it was rejected and I'm mad that she didn't publish anything that was critical—not critical, but talked about the extreme whiteness of how she views life and death in response to other things. I'm like, "Anyone could have written it. I don't care." It's awkward enough to say, "Yeah." I know I'm the co-editor of this book. It's not my responsibility, but she wouldn't let it out. I was just like, "No." I feel like it sounds like I'm complaining that I wasn't published, which is not actually my complaint. This essay of Jen's– people constantly reference it like, "It's so amazing. It's so life-changing." [00:10:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're critical of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So when I see people doing that, like if it's my friends doing it, I'm like, "By the way, did you [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:28) response to it?" And what happens is that person will be like, "That's really interesting," and their initial reaction is like, "Oh, my God. I want you to read this essay." I'm like, "Have you considered this critique?" The person is like, "That's interesting, though it doesn't do it. It doesn't tell me about it." Or like, "I didn't know you wrote that." So I was really annoyed [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:57) so when someone did that and someone was like, "I just send ten people a day to read this essay by Jen that will answer all of their life problems." I was like, "Oh, my God. If people ever read the essay, they can't even talk to me." So it is like, "There is this critique that I wrote. Have you seen it?" One woman wrote back and was like, "I haven't heard of it at all." I was like, "Yes, the reason why you haven't heard of it is because some people find it unrelatable and not personal and . . . " [00:11:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those were some of Jen's . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. She said it was not relatable. It was not a personal essay. It was completely inappropriate for the book. It didn't get the theme. It's not about that. It's about race. They can't talk about everything. So then it was like, "I think I can like Jen's piece and still enjoy your critique." I'm like, "You can. You can like that. I'm just saying that you might want to consider that this might not actually be the answer to every person's question or whatever." Then Jen rolled in to say, "Oh, my God. That's not what happened at all." That's actually what she said; and then sort of her rationalizations why she didn't publish it, including that it wasn't appropriate for a one-on-one book and something else. It's so frustrating and upsetting and I end up being worried [ ] (inaudible at 00:12:56) just sort of the first time Jen actually responded to my critique about it. Usually it goes on; she just doesn't say anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:11) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes it is. She's trying to be like, "No." The reason why I haven't talked about it pretty much is because I thought that she would roll in and say, "That didn't happen," and then she has a habit of sending her fans to harass people who disagree with her. I didn't really want that. That hasn't happened at least. I don't know. I was being like, "Why can't we have nice things?" (sighs) A lot of it is that I find it a) super frustrating that Jen usually quash this essay, basically. I suffer the consequences from it. It's being snippy about it. It's not like she quashed the essay and I made a stink about it at the time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're saying this stuff as though it wouldn't be clear to me or pretty obvious from how you're describing things, what would be frustrating. In other words, "Look, it's really frustrating because she quashed the essay and then she sort of comes in with this stuff that revises what happened." It's sort of like, May, they invited the essay. She nagged it. You're pretty sure she nagged it because it was critical of her essay. She had some reasons when she nagged it that seemed somewhat like bullshit. Everybody makes a huge fuss about her essay, leaving out the considerable problems that it has that you wrote your critique on. People blow up your critique and then she chimes in to sort of give an accurate account about what happened when you were pretty [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:48) for what happened and might send her fans after you. [00:15:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She has the wit or not has the wit to not do that part, which is amazing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I'm waving my arms about is that, I guess, maybe it makes sense—I'm sure it makes sense in some way. Then you say, "And it's really frustrating," as though describing all of that wouldn't illustrate that it's been wildly frustrating on a number of different points. I guess I could imagine it's because everybody really is shutting you down and not paying attention to you at every turn, so you're kind of expecting at some level that it's not going to be so clear to me from the history of what's happened, why you drive me crazy. [00:16:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot like one of [ ] (inaudible at 00:16:48) is that I have a lot less support about it than I thought I would from my friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had sort of been acting horrible about it for a while because I was pretty upset. She was also upset and then she was upset that she hadn't fought harder. I was like, "I don't know if you could have," that whole thing. I also felt like, "Oh, God." I was worried that Anne Kelly was going to be upset, that I had just busted out with a basket of dirty laundry. I meant to say, "Just so you know, I'm thinking of mentioning that this happened a lot unless it's clear," since Anne Kelly and Jen co-edited the book, it's like, "Oh, what does the co-editor think?" So it's not just that it's frustrating, although it is, I also feel like it's something, not that I've lost friends over, but that I no longer feel as close to people and I don't have a lot of trust that friends of mine who are white and [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:32) acceptance are going to see my point or back it or think at all about, "Why is that one essay so plaintive and the other one isn't?" (sighs) I feel like I have this fight/argument with so many people in my various social groups over and over again. Part of what I hate is the sort of surprise discovering people who aren't white, like I was worried all last night and this morning that Anne Kelly was going to be angry. She wasn't, which was really good. It bothered me all morning. I was just so worried about it. (pause) It's like I want to trust her but it's hard to feel that implicit trust around this. (pause) I sort of wish someone else would write the critique so it wouldn't just be me, but there's sort of I think people are like, "Somebody already wrote the critique—and it was you." I'm like, "Ohh. [ ] (inaudible at 00:20:37)" I don't know. I always have this feeling about even bringing it up or not bringing it up and the sort of back wash or defensiveness that comes up; and the surprise casual racism that starts popping up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's it all about? I'm sorry. That question could mean a bunch of different things. I mean it just doesn't feel to you like it would be too far astray or too complicated or technical—what she was saying and then what you wrote?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What she wrote is called an essay [ ] (inaudible at 00:21:37). The essay is basically Jen's writing is not that she's fat, but she's on the cusp of plus size, which she can be frustrating because she writes as if her experience of just in plus size is the same as everyone's experience. I'm like, "Someone who is a size 30 has a really different experience. You weigh 400 pounds and someone weighs 200 pounds," so there's that prescription. What she writes about is one of the reasons why women diet and why she's always dieted is one she loses 20 or 30 pounds or whatever, her life will be perfect. It will be awesome. She'll meet this amazing guy. It will be like Baywatch, running on the beach—so like this whole thing. And then she's like, "No. Here's the deal. I'll still be me, I'll just be me 20 pounds lighter." The fantasy is that losing weight will fix everything, every problem with your life, and everything that's wrong with your life is because you're fat. Therefore, just be yourself but don't lose weight. Part of my critique is that the images that she's describing—"It's like I'm on Baywatch. It's like I'm in the movies. It's like a commercial." Those are all really ritualized as white. For women of color, even if I lost 400 pounds, I still wouldn't be beautiful because I'm not white. It's a really different experience. Jen's kind of like, "The fantasy is that I would look like a super model or an actress," if I lost weight. That's cool, but I never really thought that way because in order for that to happen, I'd have to lose weight and change my race. [00:23:42] That's not going to happen. I basically wrote about how, for women of color particularly and also for other people, it's much more complicated than "I want to look like a model". It's kind of tied together in that there are ways that fat, black women get particularly stereotyped with mammies and ways that fat, white women don't. The other thing—I think I brought it up in the essay, I might have brought it up somewhere else—is that a lot of times white women will be like, "Oh, my God. It's so awesome to be black because black people are so comfortable being fat and black guys love fat women." Instead of this really creepy complaint where they're like, "Only black guys ever hit on me. It's so annoying." Like what did it fix? [00:24:43] I was super gentle. I don't think I used the word racist at all. [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:57) probably. I was writing it to be gentle so that it would get into the book, because I was like, "Okay. Who's going to flip out? I'll soft-pedal this and say it in different ways," and that didn't work because she still didn't like it. [00:25:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:17) </p>

<p>CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:22) I also would go in much more about how those two narratives served to exclude people of color and make them feel [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:36) and marginalized and also gets into this creepy thing where dating black guys is somehow—like I couldn't get a white guy so I had to go with this black guy because black guys love fatties. I'm like, "No." Also because it means you can get into sort of white women being seen as a trophy object, which is also creepy. There is just all this stuff going on that she ignored. The other thing that I found somewhat frustrating is that she was like, "[ ] (inaudible at 00:26:16) is not relatable. It's not." I'm saying it's not relatable because you're white. It's not about white people. Also, her latest comment was, "It just wasn't appropriate for an introductory book to find acceptance," which, again, means that the introductory group are white people and that, I guess, white people get to learn about black people in book two. [00:26:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've got to go on to "advanced" to find acceptance for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. She wouldn't admit it but her book was geared towards white people. Her whole shtick has been, her mythic core audience has been other white middle class, upper class women who are kind of fat but not really fat—like someone who you might tell, "Oh, you're not really that fat," so the smaller plus size. And a lot of what she's done is about men finding you attractive, like you shouldn't say that just because you're fat doesn't mean you can't get a date. It doesn't mean you're impossible. I got married. There's this weird undercurrent like, "It's okay, ladies. Guys will still think you're attractive." [00:27:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure I'm using this word correctly, but it's also really hetero-normative. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I can't remember if I brought that part up or not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's one of those things where you're kind of almost stated point is you are something I'm going to say about kind of a secret about how to really like more "us", when "us" is a really limited or very specific group, but not identified as such.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Basically, a lot of it is how presumed whiteness of the audience is made invisible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand. [00:28:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she and other people are constantly, "I don't understand why fat acceptance isn't more diverse. Why don't people [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:54)?" I don't know. It could be because of that. Just so you know. And then cue defensive ranting and raving. It's just something I don't feel like what I said was particularly revolutionary, ground-breaking. I don't feel like anything in the critique was—it was kind of like, "Hey, there are people who aren't white and straight. Just think about it." [00:29:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If she had written some kind of response saying, or had communicated some kind of response saying, "Hey, you're right. I do think what I've written is kind of important, but really it does apply much more and is targeting much more a specific group."</p>

<p>CLIENT: She never communicated with me directly during the book process, which was interesting. There are a lot of things that she could have said that she chose not to. Her response was basically a knee-jerk defensiveness and, "You don't understand. Why are you so mean to me?" [00:30:30] (sigh) I see other people who are like, "No. It's important to me that we include diversity in talking about blah, blah, blah," also do the same thing. I feel like that's just what happens all the time. I sort of flip-flop between not wanting to talk about it at all and wanting to talk about it. At one point, I was trying to engage Jen in dialog about this, and it basically never went anywhere. She's like, "But you don't understand. I admit that I totally didn't want to include people of color in this," or "No. That was just . . " She comes up with all of these excuses and was super defensive every single time. So then I stopped because it was making me crazy. Also, more than once, she wouldn't say anything but she would let her fans say things to me. Part of me is like, "Is this happening again?" The way this started is an advice column blogger that I just started reading and I really like, was the one who said, "[ ] [ ] (inaudible at 00:32:19) says that to everyone." I showed this to Jen and she was kind of like, "But . . . nah, nah, nah." I can still like this essay and think your critique is interesting and not retreat your critique to anyone. I'm like, "But I like this blog so far. I was enjoying it, and now ughh." (sigh) (pause) I really hate how often that happens. I go to a lot of popular bloggers and sites and whatever and I tend to not get involved with them, in part because I feel like this happens every single time. There are only so many times that I'm interested in doing that, which is not that many. Also I feel like Drayton is running around like, "Did you read this amazing thing by this person and that person." No, I didn't because I think they're kind of racist and I say, "Yeah." I'm not really up to that. I'm feeling really, really not up to it. [00:34:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think probably what you're saying and what I'm seeing is that you're super upset about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm super upset about it and it's also like taking over more of my worrying time than I want it to, I guess. It's super upsetting and I'm worried that my friends will be mad at me and I just spend a lot of time thinking about it and worrying about it. I'd rather worry—not that I'm worrying about everything else—but, yeah, I feel upset and I also feel like I just really don't feel up to listening to people defend their anger or play devil's advocate or something stupid. It's one of those cases where defensiveness is [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:19) that this thing happened. It was like, "But you don't understand how he didn't mean to be offensive." (sighs) I don't like bracing myself for that. I hate that so many people that I know do that and there's really not a great way to say "cut it out" because it will lead to more defensiveness. (pause) [00:36:12] It's also one of the things I hate about a lot of the [ ] I'm involved in like [ ] (inaudible at 00:36:17). I think more of, "Wow, those are really white social sub cultures and they're really defensive about it and feel that they're way too smart and awesome to possibly have and internalize racism." It's not like I question my decision to be part of various groups, but it would be nice to go on an outing with friends and just be like, "Okay, everyone's just going to be cool," like [ ] (inaudible at 00:37:23) was. And not to be like, "All right, guys, let's not be racist." [00:37:31] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really hurtful and, not just in spite of, but in part because people generally don't see what's going on or how this is hurtful to you—not just you, but in this case, you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think one of the things that I'm kind of upset about the most is that people expect me to not have emotions about it, that I should always look at it as an opportunity. It's a teachable moment. I should understand their feelings. I should be endlessly patient and offering teaching them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean enlightening white people? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I don't want to. No one is paying me for it. Even if they were, I wouldn't want to. I came home with a resource list. Even when I give it to people, they're like, "Okay, well what about other things?" No. The whole point of this is you stop asking. Read these things and go away. Or I have white friends who want me to absolve them of whatever racial anxiety or guilt they might have. That's another thing I don't want to do. When there is that moment, it's basically impossible to say, "I think you're asking me to be your black friend who said it was okay, and that's not possible." (pause) [00:40:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm just thinking of that combined with stuff going on at work, and how sort of hurtful and helpless [ ] (inaudible at 00:41:07) I think. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel paralyzed about what to do or not to do. For a while I was sitting on my floor looking for something to wear today and then I just sat there for a while and I was just like, "I don't want to go to work. I don't want to do any of this." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:41:43) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was thinking that it's not like today is going to be any better, especially since I had to meet with Chet for our weekly meeting. I sort of tried to come up with things that will make him feel like we're doing some productive [ ] (inaudible at 00:42:30) in part because I have to make the plans so far out, but also this feeling like, "Wow. I guess none of my friends are going to be supportive of this," makes it even harder. I'm just like, "I want to hang out with you but I would like an affidavit in advance that you won't do X, Y, and Z." I feel like an asshole for thinking that they're going to do that, except how . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not something they do. [00:43:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up for now [ ] (inaudible at 00:44:15) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was also thinking he really hates it when I'm feeling sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sucks. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It always feels like it won't stop. Like I'm going to be sad for hours, so I don't want to. Like I'd much rather distract myself with [some pills].</p>

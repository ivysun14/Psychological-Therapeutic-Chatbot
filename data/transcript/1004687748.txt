<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I put this here so I wouldn't forget today. (chuckling) </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I feel like an anachronism saying this, but I had a dream this morning that woke me up that I want to tell you about. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: James and I were hDanng a very silly conversation last night, and he was like, "You should ask Chad if he interprets dreams, and then tell him the dream!" I had a dream that I cared that I had a puppy (chuckling). But I actually had a dream... you know, the things that it got me thinking about but... the point is, the way that I interpret things is not necessarily the way that you interpret things, right? Yeah. So it was about Dan. It was one of those... something happens, and then something else happens which is totally unrelated, and then something else happens which is totally unrelated so it's between two unrelated things. I was visiting a prison and eating prison food? And it was really, really bad, and I was just like, "Man, institutional food sucks." And then suddenly I was outside my friend Morgan's apartment in Cleveland, he goes to school in Cleveland, he lives there, about three or four blocks from Dan. And I stayed with him, I had been to Dan's house before. He had a party for his students at the end of every year, so I went to that. And I was sitting on a rock or a bench outside Morgan's apartment, and I knew Morgan wasn't there. I was just at that place. </p>

<p>And I was writing an e-mail to Candace telling her about the prison food, and I just thought Dan was back. I should call him. I should go see him. I just really, really wanted to. And I know I can't do that. (pause) I felt, well... I was like, no, I can't interrupt his life like that, it's just not an option. I need to get out of here. I need to go back home, but you usually want to stay in the city. I stay with my friend Gerry who lives up in the north. So basically I need to go back uptown. So I was like, "Okay, I'm going to catch the bus." And then I thought, "Dan takes this bus, this is his bus stop." Which is actually true. It's like "Maybe, I will meet him at the bus stop." (pause) And I turned up at the bus stop, and it turned into one of those dreams where you're trying to get someplace, and there's like all of these absurd things that keep you from getting there, and you can't remember why you wanted to go there in the first place but you keep going. </p>

<p>It's really gotten me thinking about, it's just like (pause) I'm always like this. I just want to see him. I just want to talk to him. And (pause) he makes me feel so loved. So loved. And he always has, well before he was a teacher and there was no relationship other than I was a student that he liked. I think he makes everyone feel that loved, maybe not that loved, but loved. And I can't feel good about that anymore because I can't anymore, just say, "Hey, Dan's in town, I'm going to call him, let's go get a drink." That's gone. Because every time I get in touch with him, that is me hurting his family or hurting his relationship. And it, it's never not going to be complicated again. (pause) But does it make me not want it to be simple?</p>

<p>I still hadn't gotten to talk to him Saturday. Still don't know what's up with him. (pause) He has a thing where he writes in his e-mails, he'll be very mysterious about something that is really not very mysterious at all, that's happening in his life, and he's like, "I'll tell you when we talk." (chuckling) It's like, come on. So I don't know whether he's still married, fuck. I feel like it could go either way, to be honest. I know I wasn't (pause) the time that he and Britnay were having problems was not my fault. And in most ways, I kind of had nothing to do with it. It's more like my turning up spoke to issues that were there. It pointed out ways they weren't giving each other what they needed. Now, all this is filtered through what Dan says, which I haven't talked to him, I kind of felt that way. (pause)</p>

<p>You know, and so that saying, he and I can't talk anymore. I think from Britnay's perspective, that's how Dan described it to me, is saying, (pause) "We're not giving each other what we need, but you are getting what you need from someplace else. And so I deserve a chance to give that to you." Which I think is absolutely right. I think she did the right thing. Which sucks for me, but I think she did the right thing. And I stand by that. (pause) [00:07:29]</p>

<p>But it's the best thing—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like you really, really miss him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't until I started thinking about him again, and then I realized I really do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not just (pause) feeling loved. It's like (pause) feeling understood, in ways that I don't come across very often. (pause) Yeah, not many people (pause) there's just connections from different parts of my life, and different parts of my intellectual life, that (pause) I read poetry for the same reason that I study Sumerian irrigation systems. Those are the same thing in my life—they're not the same thing, but the one leads to the other. And that's not the case for almost anybody else. It is for him. And one thing that's been really sad for me at school is people aren't in love with their jobs in the way that I am in love with my job. That I need a job that I am in love with. I read a play yesterday, in love with a wide spectrum, but in love with is the way that I'm in love with James. Not in the way that you fall in love, but the way that you are in love with something. (pause) </p>

<p>So I don't really know. And I can't not be complicated. I can't miss him without feeling guilty. I can't miss him without feeling like that's wrong of me. Even though I don't actually think that's wrong of me, I can't miss him without thinking about how much damage it was. (pause) [00:11:15]</p>

<p>You know, I always thought that you hurt people by being careless, or being selfish, or (pause) that hurting people comes from the things that are bad in you. But this is hurting people really deeply, and it's coming from the things that are best in me. And I can't wrap my head around that. I mean, sometimes I can (chuckling). Sometimes I'm tired and I can't forget. It's just hard. (pause) How do I say, I guess those things are still good? It's good to be loved, it's good to love somebody, it's good to connect. (pause) </p>

<p>Dan told me about a book that Britnay had given him after she read it, and was like, "Okay, this is what's going on with us." And it's a recent book, I think, basically written by a psychologist, to describe, this is how cheating happens. This is how affairs happen, talking about friendships that become more and more sexualized and kind of incremental roads to an affair. And as you become closer to one person, you should have your partner. And it's like, yes, that is exactly what was happening with Dan and Britnay. And so I don't know whether that's what was happening with James and I but it was really something to watch out for. I know I was starting to tell all these stories to James, stories about what I did that day. And that's when I was like, okay, don't do that. I didn't actually read the whole book. There's a third of it on Google previews, so I kind of read what I could. But one thing that she didn't ever acknowledge that I think is really important is that being close to people is a good thing. (chuckling) Friendships are good. And there was this kind of implicit assumption that it's impossible to have a healthy friendship with someone of the opposite sex that I find just repugnant. (pause) I don't want to use all of this box. You know, friendship and tenderness and love and understanding, they're all good things but they can be really dangerous. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine there's a lot of what you care and feel like you were living when it does. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's made a huge difference to me having my friends just check in and say, "We love you. I'm sorry you're sad, I want you to be well. We're still here." It makes it better. (pause) </p>

<p>You know, James and I had a really good actual conversation for the first time in a few days. I said yesterday I don't know what to do for him, and I think that's the only thing I can do is talk to him. Be silly, he doesn't get to be silly. (pause) But there's a lot there. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible]? </p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a lot of silliness that wants to come out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's there in him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in me, but I have more people that I can be silly with. And have chemistry with too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank God. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Frankly, I think people want to make the difference sometimes, and they (pause) I don't know that it's being a woman that makes this, but the persona that I present is unabashedly somebody who's going to be ridiculous once in a while. Just deal with it. James is not so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People might mistake him for being serious? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think he gets pushed into those roles a lot of times, a group needs a leader and he's the person that they turn to. And he's good at that, he likes that. (pause) [00:18:12]</p>

<p>(chuckling) I told him that Dan was back, and that we were probably going to talk in the next couple of days. And there's a silence, a serious silence. And then he said, "Well, just remember. If you have sex with him..." And he turns evil, "I will stake him." (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) I get it. I didn't know that he was. But yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "I will keep that in mind." (chuckling) I feel like you still get the raw end of that deal, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Like he neanderized or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I think he's nervous, and I think he's pretty angry at Dan, and not liking it very much. I can't blame him. But I think he's choosing to trust him. But I'll fuck that up. I don't think I'm going to, though. I don't. (pause, sniffling) Sorry. (chuckling) (pause) [00:21:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I'm not really sure what to say. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) You (pause) I guess the crux of this seems to be (pause) you're so sort of dying to and so worried about revisiting what you felt with Dan. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. (pause) Can't talk. (chuckling) I mean, I just don't know what else to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I imagine you're also (pause) wondering about how well I'm going to get what happened with you with him, or what my reactions about it might be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's funny. I don't worry about that with you (pause). There is something I worry about when I tell people. Because it's so much what happens all the time, and at the same time, it has me, so I'm like, well, this is not like anything else that has happened. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean ever to anyone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But there are also... I mean, this is Penny, and there are lots of ways this is like Penny and lots of way this isn't. However it was. (pause) I don't have to explain things to you. Do you know what I'm saying? (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. (pause) Do you worry about the falling in love thing here? Is that something you had...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've felt that in all of my relationships now. Here, I'm not sure, but (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you think about it here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Can't I talk about it more generally? (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, you can't, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't, um (pause) I just think how do (pause) how do I trust myself anymore? How do I trust what I'm feeling for people? What were his thoughts? And I think to do good! Love is good, just go with it. (pause) Stay within the boundaries of things that are generally agreed on that you do and things that you don't do, and it will be fine. I can't think that anymore. (pause) [00:26:48]</p>

<p>I'm so ready, I mean... (pause) Yeah, I worry about it here but not too much, actually. It's more like (pause) in the same way that I've always (pause) thought I can read people and felt pretty comfortable drawing conclusions from my intuitions about people. I don't feel confident about that anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't... I mean, even for any reason, I don't feel like I can trust anymore because it's been so obviously skewed so often. And so this is like (pause) I mean, even the fact that he was my teacher is—makes it so much harder because this honor has been so important for me, and they were the only people I felt like I could really just trust implicitly. And obviously individual people I find out that I can't trust implicitly, and I deal with it. But here it's like, no, the whole—the whole system doesn't work. (pause) I can't just be confident in that relationship. I mean, I can't just be confident in any relationship that (pause) I can handle. You can do real damage just by (pause) telling the truth. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's feeling what you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:29:37]</p>

<p>And some of this relationship is easier in some ways because... and yeah, you were clear from the—not from the very first, actually from about a month in when we said, okay, are we going to do this? But it is going to be very close, and it is going to mirror relationships that you have with other people in uncomfortable ways sometimes, and that's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the point. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I've been able to trust that, and tell you about that and not worry. So when I find myself having feelings toward you, my instinct is to say, "Okay, shut it down." (chuckling) "Let's not tell anyone about this ever. That means I need to tell Chad." (chuckling) And (pause) yeah, so I trust this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But yeah, it sounds like you weigh this relationship as kind of (pause) the kind that you'd be able to handle, whatever emerges. It's quite reassuring. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I haven't thought about that as being an aspect of the therapy relationship before, but I—you're the first person who's ever sort of explicitly said, "This is one of the things that is supposed to happen. I feel—this is what happens." And so it was very, very scary to do, and to say, "Okay, yes, I'm committing myself to this." Very, very scary. In many ways, I thought, "Well, why can't she just see somebody in Japan? Fuck no. (chuckling) I'm sorry, but no." That's not really something I can explain to people. Because they don't know I have a relationship that's working really well, and I don't want to mess with that. But it was scary to decide to do it. But it's not scary now. (pause) Sometimes it's scary. But not now. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) [00:32:54]</p>

<p>I wonder how (pause) much of a factor (pause) this is (pause) in your depression, and especially in the tic. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. You know, I've (pause) I've thought for the past year plus that losing Dan and the depression were (pause) because we weren't less of it? You know, obviously it's going to be a factor, that grieving, but because grieving for Dan followed this kind of (pause) this pattern that was there that I could really see was separate from the pattern of my depression? And kind of was awful, and awful, and awful, and awful, and then (pause) tapered off. I just got to a place where I was kind of at peace with it. Obviously still it's there, but when I let it be there and when I bring it up it's not there all the time, and I feel okay with it, while the depression was all out of control on the other hand it was implied I'd be different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not thinking actually of grieving the relationship with...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no no no. I don't want to trash myself but how do I have relationships? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you not worry that the closer people, it's not going to be very destructive for them? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the way you'll feel very responsible for them. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that is a factor. I think that (pause)... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it (pause) among many other things, the relationship is like (pause) has something that almost like caught you off guard in the worst way, was to (pause) find yourself feeling that (pause) you're—at least you felt you're strong from your strongest and best feeling, crossed the line required.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you are feeling so close to someone, cross the line at heart. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I just have to rethink everything. But it feels like I can't trust anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I need to calm down a little bit. Actually... I have a feeling I can't trust my own emotions. Just by caring about people, I should have done better. Or that I'm not in control and the ways that I care about people are conducive to hurt. (pause)</p>

<p>Of course, if Dan wouldn't have said anything it would have been fine. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We were stupid enough to kind of come through with it. In some ways, I was really pissed at him for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did he tell you? I assume you were right until talking about what was going on with his marriage?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, just talking it up, having feelings for me. I mean, I think that was the moment we couldn't go back to. (pause) Being friends, and working closely together, knowing that there's a mutual attraction—I knew there was a mutual attraction, but he apparently didn't. (chuckling) But again, I can't trust my readings of other people. Because I was like, "Clearly he knows that I'm into him. Clearly. Whatever, it's not a big—it's fine. It's under control" or whatever. And you know, yeah, he said, "I've got to say this." I don't actually remember how he introduced it but it was something like... (pause) it was kind of a, "Okay, I'm going here, putting this out there," and sort of that. You know, again with the things that I tell you—I always believed to be honest and not, to speak the truth. So I'm not going to tell him that I don't feel the same way. It's not that I don't want to, I just can't. (pause) And then it was just like, "Here it comes!" It feels like something that you're no longer in control of. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like something a lot bigger than the two of you, kind of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Something like—I knew the thing to do is, I'd better just say, "Okay, we're never talking about this again." And mean it. And do it. Which I couldn't deal with, I'm not sure I could either. Just say, we have to not see each other again for a long time. Still the thing to do. Otherwise, one thing leads to another, leads to another, leads to another, and then we're talking all the time, and then (pause) and then we were shutting other people out. And it doesn't matter that we never kissed. It doesn't matter. It's still a betrayal. It's still an affair. (pause) And there's so much self-justification and self-deceit going on, and trying to say, "Well, we're not doing anything so it's okay," I just didn't like that in myself. I'm sorry, I know we probably need to stop soon. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've got a couple of minutes. (pause) [00:41:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, years out, I thought about it, I'm like, what could we have done differently? (pause) And the only thing I can think of is that conversation should have not happened. It should not have happened, or I should have said, stop there. And I'm like, (pause) but I mean, I don't know. And it feels unspeakably pretentious to say this, but it's like it feels like a tragic play in that it's in Dan's nature to say something, and it's in my nature to reply. (pause) So I always said that was good. But there it's gone. (pause) [00:43:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um... (pause) Well, it feels pretty good to be in love. And... (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: What? (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh... (pause) I'm (pause) I'm going to challenge you over it all. The kind of (pause) loss of innocence that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't kind of thinking innocence but okay. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —from (pause) seeing how, what you've each felt that felt so good could cause harm, if I'm honest and perhaps a big blamey about it, I (pause) said tentatively that perhaps a bit of a retreat to a more naive sense of things that would allow you to let things go as long and as far as they've been. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: To caricature (pause) and—I'll do this in a very short verse and time, I'm not just going to be out here—and a little bit sort of that hysterical appeal, like, "I didn't know it worked like that!"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, in a way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a way that kind of allows you to be fully in the moment and the intensity of the feelings and draw them up and—I don't mean like outward draw them up, intended for the people, I mean, like, you know, talking about how it feels to be longing for somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like this (pause) I think I'd have to draw them up somewhere, and so that's for how I drew it. Like (pause) I was really in love with Dan regardless. I was in love with Dan since the first semester of taking classes with him. "I don't have any classes with him! Do you need an Acadian teacher?" (chuckling) And (pause) I don't know where else to—I don't know (pause) where else to draw lines. But I feel like he (pause) I mean, I think—maybe unreasonably so—that it's really important that the lines be drawn. Because (pause) I was everything you feel about somebody, you have to sit down. Every time, "Wow, this is what I'm doing now." Every time I care about somebody at all in any way, I have to say, "Is this going to hurt them?" (pause) Should I feel that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, absolutely. I wasn't clear, but I never—I mean, I probably mean—I guess I'm less clear how else do I ask, it doesn't have to. I didn't have any indication that I wasn't clear what I meant. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Maybe, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm saying maybe a little bit, you kind of (pause) didn't want to see what's going on and how people get hurt. And it felt like a lesson learned from this experience, although it was one I suspect you knew before in different ways. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, yeah. I certainly didn't want to feel it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That took it away. But (pause) and I think that's scary, because not allowing to see oneself better is important, it's sort of disconcerting. (chuckling) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can stop for now. (pause) Oops.</p>

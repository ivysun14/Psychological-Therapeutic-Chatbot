<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Temperature regulation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's so much harder in this—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —cold weather.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot more layers involved.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I'm feeling pretty confused about my feeling towards lab. And that's okay. Like I think it'll pass. I feel—I guess I feel pretty emotionally torn between leaving these experiments that aren't getting positive results behind and I've had a bunch of encouragement by Kelly and Thomas who is the senior grad, one of the senior grad students that we just defended.</p>

<p>To sort of like release myself from them and declare victory, but there's no difference between this mutant and the wild type and—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, like I presume that because you haven't seen a positive result yet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you're confident that you'll get results?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess what I'm torn about is whether I have enough confidence in the experiments that have results, have like yielded the negative results and whether there's more to improve. [00:02:50]</p>

<p>So, I do think there's more to improve. I don't know whether that thing being so like clumpiness on the bacterial culture is a big problem in micro bacteria and that has sort of been a problem for me all along, but it is not clear that fixing that will reveal a difference. Like if there is a difference it should, you should be able to measure it. [00:03:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Clumpy or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In spite of the clumping. But, it feels bad to like put up some negative data and feel like there were, there was like something that I could have done to be, to feel more confident about it. Thomas suggests just like taking a break. Like, really, really taking a break. Not like a two day break, but taking like a month break from these experiments and going and doing something totally different which I have the opportunity to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you have different things you could do for that month?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But for some reason, I'm really having a hard time letting go. I'm so attached. I'm so attached to getting a positive result. And I guess whenever I had the chance to talk to Kelly on the phone and that like crisis mode that was sort of what we, what we talked about was like the world doesn't rest on this phenotype and there are plenty of other things to ask. [00:05:02]</p>

<p>So, that was like the beginning of my feeling more and more okay with the fact that this isn't going to yield anything interesting, but I'm not there yet. And it feels like desperation. It feels like—I don't know. There isn't, like it would be so much easier if this were, if these sets of experiments yielded something because then it would be really clear what to test next. And that in itself would be really exciting and I could like schedule my committee meeting, meeting, which I've been avoiding doing like tomorrow and be confident that, okay, there is this big screen and this one gene came up and I knocked it out and I tested it and there is a phenotype and it's like this lovely beautiful story. And like I have like all of these great ideas for why there would be a phenotype and like I'm adjusting all of those. [00:06:33]</p>

<p>And I can see like in, in theory how like that's not the way science goes and that's okay and, and I probably will find something cool that I don't know about yet. And I like the, the project and the questions. Like it's not, it's not like I'm feeling like oh man, it's going to be so boring or it's going to be such torture moving on to something else. It's more like you need like a little carrot. You need like a little recharging to keep going and positive data can be—can play that role very well. And so can like encouragement and I gave a great talk yesterday and that felt good. That's a good carrot too. I guess a carrot is what you're striving for, so that was, that was like a little fuel. [00:07:47]</p>

<p>But it's not, it's not the same. So, there's like so much tension there and then there's like the bigger tension which is like, like I don't know if I'm—. If I'm—I don't want to use the word happy. I don't know if like this work fulfills me and I don't know what would.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I, I think you may be pretty upset that you didn't get a positive result as you really hoped and also felt some pressure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:09:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For not getting and that secondarily maybe you're not—it's like I'm I don't really want to be as upset as you are about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't. I mean I am, I am comfortable with the fact that I'm upset. Like I, that's, that's not an—that's like a pretty frequent. I mean that's like a pattern for me and it's, I think it comes from having an abundance of emotion that has been describes about everything, about a lot of things. So, being upset isn't surprising to me. I do think it's getting in the way of just like having, getting satisfaction out of my days and also like actually moving on scientifically. [00:10:22]</p>

<p>And it helps to know that like plenty of other people have been in my situation and have gotten negative results in much bigger experiments and they like found what it took to move on and like are in, in a different place and are, or like have found very interesting things and so on. That makes me feel worth, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, let's talk for a minute about how upset you actually are about not getting a positive result and at least to me that's pretty important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes to mind about it? [00:11:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's disappointing. It leaves me in this really unknown, like uncertain place. Where I guess I'm not sure that things are going to be okay. And that feels scary. It also makes me feel sort of ashamed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have another question, actually too yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, which is okay. Like, it's, I don't try to belittle it, but it, it—like if you feel ashamed there's usually some component. Some external judging component involved and like actually I know for a fact that I've done a lot of good work and this is pretty typical. So, so that somehow like that actually doesn't impact how I'm feeling for a change. [00:12:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess there's a couple different levels there. One of which you kind of know in your head that you have nothing to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And another level in more kind of an emotional at which that's not how it feels. I suspect that partly in relation to your own expectations, but also in relation to Kelly as you imagine that in some way to be—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —knowing that they're different from that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you let her down and you support her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or just that I missed an opportunity to make her really excited. She's not disappointed. She's, she's, she's pretty excited about me and what I'm doing. But, that's more because of the potential and there isn't—like nothing makes Kelly happier than to, to like be shown a piece of exciting data. [00:14:17]</p>

<p>Like her, she's such a strong person. Like, she's so strong in her reactions and responses that it's very easy to like have strong feelings about them one way, one way or another. Or so like to be really afraid or to be to really cut it like one of her positive reactions. And that I'm, I'm slowly becoming more and more detached from that because it's just like she just runs you in emotional circles. Or it's easy to run yourself in emotional circles. </p>

<p>So, why can't I just like, okay, like I'm, like this isn't it. It's, it sucks. It's disappointing. Like go back to the bench and figure something else out. I don't know like, I think like, when I talk to other people about like how they've coped emotionally with disappointing negative results. [00:15:44]</p>

<p>I've sort of mostly gotten like oh well, I just loved it so much that I just loved being, being there so much that I just kept going. Or like I had this blind hope that like the next thing I tried would work. Like, things that sound unrealistic to me. </p>

<p>And there's this new post-doc, Kurt. We have almost all women in our lab, which isn't uncommon. Well, it's a little uncommon to have all women, and so we have like, essentially Thomas is the only guy who does bench work. And Thomas has been, Thomas is a really, really important part of the lab and its culture and its positivity and it's also like a scientific personality. He's also a really big part of my experience. [00:16:57]</p>

<p>So, there's another guy, Kurt and he's a lot like Thomas in sort of in his enthusiasm and also nice guy and they're both these like very handsome, like all American looking guys who like just sort of make you feel good. And I think that's become more and more important to me as I've sort of struggled more and more. Or like have become more attached to various things in the lab. Either like getting this phenotype or feeling stronger that I care what Kelly thinks. But, so Kurt is, so Thomas is like very, very aware of how silly it is to be really obsessed with some, with like some things in science. Like he is always making jokes about like and we're playing bacteria. Like, like you get the sense that there's like this real world person there who just like has some, a little bit of humor about like what it is we're doing. Kurt seems to be like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Having perspective on—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [00:18:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —on what concretely, what's going on and being at some distance from the fray of—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —like all the significance of it, and.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of various kinds.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Thomas is really and always in the same syntax in my head I always say fine, like Thomas has had a really tough life. His mom has been an alcoholic his whole life. He like had to take her to the emergency room when he was like 15 like three times. She died on the week of his wedding two years ago and he has since had to sell her house and like get rid of all of her—he's just like been very independent for a long time and his dad like kind of is not really someone he depends on. So, always I think like Thomas has these like, has this perspective and he has this sort of robust emotional response and he's, he's pretty hearty and he's had it and I think that's because he's had a, a tough life and he's kind of out of it and he's sort of just knows what's important. What's not important. [00:19:55]</p>

<p>But Kurt has like a lot of the same characteristics, but he's like legitimately, like really passionate or whatever. And came from a lab where they worked like 12, 14, 16 hours a day. And it's yeasts. You can work on like anything. There's always work to be done. The organisms grows so quickly. The field is so crowded and a lot is known about it. So, here's this person who like has some similar qualities to a very, another very comforting person in the lab except that some of the things are in like stark contrast to me and how I and like my ambivalence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:20:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But actually if you take away all of those external like whatever. Like those people and expectations, I'm pretty happy like going in to the lab and doing my thing and like then going home and doing all my other things. And that's sort of how it was for the first, the first two years when I wasn't so invested. And now it just feels like I'm upset most of the time and can't figure out like what has changed and how to—and like if it's going to be okay. I guess I feel a very strong sense of urgency. [00:21:58]</p>

<p>It gets pretty similar to how I feel about most things. How I like, how progress seems to be really important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just had the thought that something about the urgency maybe makes you a bit anxious and that it would be good if I could be in a moment you're feeling that way. A little like one of the guys in the lab whose like, you know, says and does things or looks or acts in a way that's reassuring and helps you feel like sort of—you have kind of more perspective in a way. Or are kind of losing a certain perspective as you're getting caught up in your own and as you imagine another set of expectations and so settles you down. [00:23:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thomas's way of being comforting about this sort of thing is move on, get over it. It's not actually that, that tender, but it's reassuring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It works.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it works. I mean obviously it doesn't work because I'm not over it, but it is what it's what he brings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Kind of like he can be kind of helpful in the moment, or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But I think your point is it doesn't stick.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It's kind of like breaking up with someone. Or like being—I feel like this experiment is breaking up with me and I really don't want to let it go. And I see all the great things that could happen if it, if it were going to work out. And instead, I just have to be like sad until the next thing comes along and then you start to feel sort of okay. [00:25:03]</p>

<p>Like I noticed this pattern in people and also myself. It's like when you leave a relationship you don't actually feel like yourself until, until you make that connection with someone else or until you sort of replace it with the next, a next love interest or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I have two thoughts. The first is I think there's something in the loss around that that can be a little tricky for you sometimes. Like sort of digesting what you tell us, something that's not so easy. Not, not simply painful because it's inevitably that, but a little difficult. [00:26:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it's been really difficult. Almost, yeah, it's almost like blinding me. And I think, like I don't think this is so out of the realm of like what. I keep talking about other people because actually it makes me feel better to know that other people go through this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I think part of this is, is a feeling that goes along with things going this way as though there's something really the matter with you or you really have done something wrong. So, I can imagine it's reassuring to think of other people who you know are in a way okay or better than okay going through it too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess the other thing that I didn't mention is like yeah, I guess I imagine that, like imaginary person saying well if you were more technically rigorous or like—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just got one of those honks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you had just, paid, like why have you been doing these experiments with clumps in them for months now? Like, that's totally horrible. So, like, yeah, I guess I'm afraid of someone being like I don't believe this at all. You didn't do it right. [00:27:51]</p>

<p>When actually the even scarier thing is that nobody cares about your work that much. Like to go and really, really look at what you are doing on a day to day basis. And you have to say this is the best that I've, this is the best that I could do. This is why I think so and like here is the data and nobody, like Thomas is maybe the only person who can really get insight. He's done all these experiments in other ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was the one who noticed the clumps and said well, you could try it, but if there is a big difference here you would see it. But Kelly would never come in to the lab and like look at my cultures. She's, her judgment starts when she sees the data. So, there's almost this really scary like being left alone to make my own decisions about whether to leave or stay with this experiment. That is very difficult for me. [00:29:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Made me think of like in leaving a relationship only knowing yourself how it is that you feel and what you're point of view is and what actually happened and that it's kind of up to you that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And very scary and I can imagine maybe also very sad to think of being alone that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is. It's pretty—it's pretty sad. Like this experience has been pretty sad. I don't know if it's because I've, it's, I've been alone in making these decisions, but I'm pretty sad about this part. [00:30:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another thing I wonder about. I know kind of the lab and I think you know clearly a lot of feelings you're talking about are precisely to do with that. I wonder though if there is some like an echo of the feeling of loss or leaving something to do with stuff in here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think all transitions have this sort of similar quality for me. Like, there's a lot of like do I want to be making this transition? This transition is really scary. What's going to be on the other side? Is there enough momentum to really push me through? So, lots of like, as you pointed out early on, lots of focus on like the decision. Which is something that now I notice like almost every day. Like wait a minute. I'm focusing on the decision. Is there anything? Like what's a little bit deeper that going on? [00:32:08]</p>

<p>And then lots of like, yeah, sort of mourning. Like with what's known and— Thomas is leaving in January. I think that's part of. And then there's this new like Kurt guy and he's similar, but also kind of different. [00:33:10]</p>

<p>So, yeah, it's almost all the scaffolding is like going away and I have to build my own like way to cope and have my own reasons to keep going and have my own reasons to stay late in the lab and enjoy it and like most of the time it's just like oh, I don't know. Like someone help me. So, in that way, it's pretty similar to other stuff. [00:35:10]</p>

<p>The things that I have to move on to are really new. I mean cutting edge and no one else knows how to use this, use this sequencing technology that I'm going to be using. And that is so different from these experiments that I have been doing which is like this technique is from the 1930's to draw, to essentially grow a like parallel culture with bacteria and see how many of them are antibiotic resistant. And in a way it's kind of like this really sort of simple, comforting experiment that I really don't have to think much about. And then there's like very little, I have very little confidence about the next thing. [00:36:20]</p>

<p>And it's like $2,000 to do one of these sequencing run and it's all in my hands. It's like I order the stuff. I run, run the machine. I do the data analysis. So, again, like I'm the one who knows if it went well or didn't went, go well. Lots of parallels to leaving home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And maybe, you know, maybe symbolically you're getting married? [00:37:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I mean. Leaving one center of gravity and going to the next. [00:38:50]</p>

<p>Last time we were talking about Abbey me asked me if I liked what I was doing and I said that I didn't really know what that meant. And suggested that actually there might be an answer there. He said that if someone asked me like, right now, how's it going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that what you meant? Like there's always an answer in the moment?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to me that it's more like you have various answers at various times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or sort of about various things that, that certainly didn't aggregate in some clear way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or then wait to be unified. More so than that there was like just an absence of reaction, so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. No, there are plenty of reactions. I don't know what to do with them all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I'm going to pay out pocket through the end of the year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I think is not going to work for the week of Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unless you can do Monday. So, anyway, it will be like five or six more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I may be able to do something later on Monday. Let me check.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. And the week between Christmas and New Years I will not be. Thank you.</p>

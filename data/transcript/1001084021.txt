<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, oh yeah, that's new, yeah, I grew it and I haven't shaved it off yet.  I don't know if it'll last, but it's 1 of those things where it itches after a while.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's starts rubbing.  So how much rain did you guys get?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We got about 6 inches.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Holy smokes, over period of time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Let's see, it started about 7:30 and I was up at 1.  I got about $1000 worth of damage to my house.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I'd have been in a regular structured house, I'd have lost everything, lost everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mobile homes are up, you know, they're off the ground</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About 3 or 4 feet because I could hear the water gurgling.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you had water actually run through your yard there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Underneath, underneath my house, through the yard, tore my fence up, 2 of my propanes floating.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was it a river or was it just</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was just a river.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just a river.  I had about 4 feet of rushing water.  I got some nice video of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was terrible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It started about what time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 7:30 in the evening.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it was dark then during all this too, so you couldn't really see much.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, I went to be after the Rockies.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At about 10 o'clock and I just, I didn't go to sleep because I knew what was going on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my daughter called about 1 o'clock and told us we better get up and we got up and this poor girl, this girl who lives next door, she's in her mid 20's, the first time she's ever been away from momma and daddy, they live in [INAUDIBLE].  She panicked and she called her folks and she almost got her dad killed because they came and got her and they took off from [INAUDIBLE] and fell in that hole on Highway 78.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He went in and they was behind her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The mother and daughter was behind him.  He come crawling out of there to stop them so they wouldn't do it because they had separate cars.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But they both towed out their cars.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was, it was bad.  We live on the south end of the street and it comes up and the north, it's just like this because that highway don't drain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The state's got to do something about that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anyhow, I get it from both ends and it just comes, it wiped out my shed, moved my shed into my neighbor's yard, tore the fence down, a mess.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh my God.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I looked at my policy and low and behold it covers floods.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thank goodness.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  My poor brother lived down the street, you know, they had a tree fall in a windstorm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they cut it up, they never cleaned the fence off or nothing, it just picked it up and flew it through the house.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Geez.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's got a big hole and he don't have no insurance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh no.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No flood insurance, he's got insurance though.  I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> My goodness.  So what kind of damage did it do to your place?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Tore all my skirting off.  I don't know what it did underneath.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So internally it's okay, it's just underneath and.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but I don't know about the plumbing, the insulation underneath it, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My [INAUDIBLE] be out tomorrow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I'm having eye surgery.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh what, cataracts?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, so I found that out Monday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When are you going to have that done?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're going to schedule it.  The girls going to call me to schedule it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you going to do both eyes?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I went into check my eyes for my contacts.  I went to WalMart, the guy sent me to an eye doctor so they're going to do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you'll probably see a lot better when you get it</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they think, the doctor told me I might not even have to wear glasses on my right eye.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, that's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Phew, so you've got a lot going on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, got a lot going on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now the road is still washed out, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they got a temporary fix and, you know, they have their big art show up there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Artists come from all over.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But they had to cancel that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that was supposed to be scheduled for last weekend.  They got hit pretty hard there too but we got about 6 inches of rain, I mean it was just, you know, the thunderstorm was weird because it was moving to the southwest and they usually move east or southeast.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or northeast.  This moved southwest, right up above, right up against the Red Mountains and couldn't get over the mountain range so it parked there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I just got stuck, huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just stopped and it rained and wind and lightening.  I mean people in [INAUDIBLE] was just watching the light show.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, oh man.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We're a lot greener than you guys are.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah, we've, well it depends, we've had some bad storms the last 2 to 3 days.  Before that, it was just parched.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It was</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We're lush green.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean the deer and everybody is eating good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that's good, that's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what have you been doing with yourself?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, this, I won't go out now, when I go out on my back deck I get depressed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh because of the damage?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If you only could see all the work, I had my lawn, it's all covered with mud.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because they had to come out and move that propane tank and the mud was, you know, we had to step in the mud and that fence is gone, my shed is gone and it's depressing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It really is and everybody's just got a short fuse up there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But other than that, pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, as soon as my adjuster gets out there, I'll know what's going on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I could picture that water coming in, my big TV floating away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And everything I have, of course, I got good insurance though.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good, that's the secret these days.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Something like that you just can't</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wouldn't want to go through that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you can't do much about it once it starts though.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, Mother Nature</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is a lot more powerful that us.  So are you sleeping okay most of the time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, that night I didn't.  I never did go to sleep till probably 4 in the morning and woke up at 6 but I was anxious to see what the daylight was going to bring.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I mean everybody was out.  I mean everybody was running.  Most of us stayed put</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which was the smart thing to do, except for that one poor gal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Is she back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I ain't seen her since.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?  Oh boy, my goodness, oh boy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Her place is a wreck too.  It's just, we was in the house and you could hear the pound, boom, boom, what's that, what's that, what's hitting our house.  We got out on our back deck, it stopped raining but the water was still there, we could see the propane tank floating out there and that's when we called 911.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We had [INAUDIBLE] fire department, they're volunteer, very small, but they were the first.  [INAUDIBLE] sent a fire, they wanted them and the state emergency services out there, HAZ unit was out there</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They had everything out there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, that's probably a good thing.  I mean that could be dangerous.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, propane tanks, that's when I got scared, really scared.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That and when I thought the water was going to get in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so where did your propane tank go.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it wedged up against the fence on the side.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good, so it didn't go too far at least.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it didn't, no, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.  Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And if that fence wouldn't have broke, where the propane tank is, it didn't, it wedged in there but the majority, about 70% of the fence went because when it went, it was working as a dam and everything was brought back up under my kitchen but it broke.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of course it wasn't good news for my neighbor but</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well, it's one of those things you can't do anything about.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So before the flood were your spirits doing okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, up on the Rockies.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, they're winning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you watch the game last night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I watched it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Quite a comeback huh?  It's exciting again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I'll tell you doc, I get that [INAUDIBLE] like Milwaukee or whoever they play, batting, I change the channel.  So many bad things have happened.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They could be in a lot better shape even considering.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean they've lost a lot of close games.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That last road trip they went 500, they won 3 but they should have won that last game against the Braves but sometimes [NAME OTHER] does some things I don't understand his management decisions.  Then I'll listen to talk radio coming up, it's all about [NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're going crazy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I'm hoping that'll be over now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I hope so too because I'm sick of hearing it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I think most people are.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The real story is the Rockies but national press don't cover that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, but how many games back are they now, do you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're 4, I think, well, they're tied for dead, tied for third place with the Dodgers.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So they're about 4 games out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 4 games.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I think they're only 2 games on the wildcard.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.  They're on a roll now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're winning, I mean</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They go crazy up here in [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, they do great up here so if they can just stay home for a while and win some games</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Exhibition games, maybe they can get over the hump.  So, good, yeah, their pitching is doing pretty well and they're hitting like crazy all of the sudden.  Yeah, so that's fun to watch, good.  Now, let's see, energy wise you doing okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good, yeah, a little hyper about what's coming down for my eyes because.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I went to get my contacts, that guy he painted a bleak picture.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He said I was going to go blind, there's some kind of degenerative going on behind it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The eye doctor said it's no but it's because I'm so near sighted but he said they can't fix it back there, they can take care of the cataracts but it's not going to get any worse.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I got a little excited about that but after I talked to, after I seen the eye doctor, he said it won't bother you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Are you able to focus and concentrate reasonably well these days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think all my refills are done on my prescriptions, I'm not sure, I might have seen 1 left on there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me check and see.  Let's see, we did the Paxil actually August of last year so that 1's probably going to expire.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I've got 1 I've got to pick up, I just got, I get them at the first of the month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> After this, I don't think I've got any more refills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I was going to say, both of them look like they're probably going to expire this month</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I can write you out new prescriptions so</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No side effects or problems with the medicines?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, in fact they got me a medical doctor and I got my Ibuprofen back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay, who's the medical doctor?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it's one of those practitioners, the guy, I can't think of his name, I only seem him once.  I've got to see him this month too because they took a bunch of blood tests.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They never called so I don't think there's anything serious going on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where is he, Cleveland?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's in [INAUDIBLE], yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And the voices, no problem?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's been a long time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Years.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I feel, mentally I feel good, you know, except for crazy things happen then I get a little down in the dumps.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.  And no feelings of, I mean, worried or afraid about things, bad things are going to happen to you or anything like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Except for when I have 4 feet of water rushing by my house.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That makes anybody a little nervous I'd say, that's not good.  Okay.  Let's see, you said the medications are no problems, are you taking them pretty much every day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Now well the Paxil at least and the Klonopin, how often do you take that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Klonopin, I don't take that.  I only take those when I really really need them at night when my back's really acting up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and it helps when you take it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it helps me sleep a little bit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It relaxes the back a little bit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, those are the last resort.  I'll find my back brace.  Ibuprofen usually takes care of that so sometimes I don't even have to get that.  Since I got my Ibuprofen back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And how much are you taking of it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know what, I got that filled probably 2 months ago and I think I've taken five pills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, so not very often.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, only when my back, you know, only when I can't, if I move or something and it hurts real bad then I'll take it but other than that, I tolerate the pain as much as I can before I start popping pills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are they the 800 mg, do you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Prescription?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they're prescription.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, that's good if you don't need them all the time, that reduces the risk to your stomach and those kind of problems.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good, besides the flood, any other stressful things happening right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, you know, well my brother he gets really down deep in depression and sometimes that's, but he comes out of it.  I handle him all right because I sort of, you know, you're not very good on [INAUDIBLE] and lives down there, like right now he's really in a deep depressive state because of the storm and he found out he didn't have insurance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, you've got to walk on eggshells.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that's too bad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's on a lot of medications.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well, should we leave the meds the way they are you think?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're working pretty well?  Let me get you 2 new prescriptions, one for each, and you'll have them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think we should change.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, as long as you're doing well.  It's been, it's been a year since you've been off the Mellaril?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're doing fine off it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you think the Rockies are going to get to the playoffs?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think they've got a shot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They sure do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I really do.  I think they've got a shot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If they've got enough confidence in themselves to kind of get over that hump and try to get to that next level.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They've got [INAUDIBLE] today, they're playing a day game today</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then the Cubbies are coming to town, then they're going on the road with the Dodgers and San Diego, I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay, so that could be a crucial road trip.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  It's funny how a flood or nature disaster puts everybody on edge.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I don't doubt it, yeah, it kind of shakes up your sense of security in life.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It really, that highway, they don't drain that, that highway is not draining properly so they've got to do something for that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I hope they fix it then because that's, you don't want that to happen again.  Have they, have you heard any talk about they're going to do in terms of making it better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, you know, the guy that owns the park lives up in Denver, [NAME OTHER] and he's been in contact with the state as far as I know, that's what I heard.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, I'm only interested in my little space, the insurance will take care of getting it cleaned up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And go back on my deck.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you had a lot of wildlife this year then, deer?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, we seen some the night before the flood, some nice bucks came right in the yard.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean big ones and the hummers are going crazy, the hummingbirds.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We've got feeders out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're fun to watch.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I got back, let's see, we went in late May, early June we took 1 vacation and I just went to a conference last week so, down in Mexico, yeah, I was amazed how green it was driving all the way down.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, you drove?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, we drove down to [INAUDIBLE] and it's the greenest I've ever seen it down south.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You went out [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> By car</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, I've never seen it that green down there this time, it's usually yellow, yeah, it was pretty.  So, do you want to do something around this time?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like 11 o'clock again?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Let's see, let me go back and forth here, we can do a Wednesday.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wednesday is fine doc.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, do you want to do the 13th of February?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  I won't mind seeing winter come.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Getting tired of summer are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.  We got a lot of snow too last winter, but snow's nothing like this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, see if this winter is like the last one, that was an unusual 1 up here at least, it just kept snowing and snowing, it didn't melt.  I'll show you all these.  So I've got the Klonopin 1 mg, 1 as needed for sleep, there's 30 with 5refills, that'll be good for 6months and the Paxil, 3 a day, there's 90 with 11 refills so that'll be good for a year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sounds good.</p>

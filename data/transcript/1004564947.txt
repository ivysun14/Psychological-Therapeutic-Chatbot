<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm a little sore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, you literally fell through the roof?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well not all the way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, my porch roof it's - when we moved in (inaudible) it's a little dorm room, dorm apartment and we're like all right. And last year he said we couldn't grow turnips on it any more because they were too heavy, and the roof was kind of dodgy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have an apartment, you have a porch and then there's a roof over the porch?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's almost like a floor. It's almost like a floor. It's like a little, mini-porch that also is - it's a porch but it's also the kind of roof over the steps that go up to the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, like a [inaudible at 00:00:47]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it sticks out. I mean it's sort of like in that room if there was just a little porch just right out that window. Just a little thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I see. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he had called a contractor over to fix the roof and talk about it. And one was like yes, that's really rotten and after a bunch of stomping, they actually make a small dent in it, like a small hole. And we're kind of yes. We knew that it was rotten, we could see that there were - and I was like okay, I just need to get one thing off the porch, like some flowerpots. And I walked, didn't walk near the roof, the hole, but I fell up to my hip, like deep, through the roof or the porch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, like this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not all the way down to the ground.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not all the way down but like - yes. I kind of don't remember most of it because I was really freaked out and in shock. So Ashby was really high and unable to be useful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: High as in like...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Oh, dammit. She's like don't die; I can't help you. Okay. And so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you stuck at all? Was it hard to... [00:02:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: At first? Yes. I had a moment of being like I think I'm stuck; I don't know if I should go down or up because I really didn't know. But then I got myself up and out and grabbed the cat before he tried to go out as well because normally he's allowed to play on the porch but not any more because there's a hole in it. And I actually did consider going into work on Thursday, even though I was up until 3:00 because my heart was racing. I just wasn't thinking it through very well because I was like well I'm just bruised, there's no scrapes or visible injuries; I should just go to work. But I ended up going up a little late. And I woke up and I'm like oh wow I feel like I almost fell through the roof. How am I supposed to go to work? And I'm still really achy, my back and leg.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I'm glad it was nothing more - it was nothing really serious physically?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It was just more like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it sounds like, yes achy and bruised and good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like it freaked you out pretty good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and part of my weirdness about being like I should go to work is that from - this is at night also so I couldn't [inaudible at 00:03:45]. I'm kind of like I don't know how big a hole I just created was. But from the top, it looked like it was maybe like fist size or maybe it looked that big, like it fit my leg but it was like .... And then Thursday evening I got delivery food with my friend Candy and I look up and I'm like, there's a fucking enormous hole. Shit. I don't know how I didn't fall through. [00:04:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fall all the way through, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it, I mean it was big enough to fit me, probably. Well I think I would've just gotten stuck around my hips, which is where I got stuck. But yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it got scary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, which really freaked me out. And then today, I don't know. I was hoping it would be a low workday but at the end of the day, I don't know, I just felt icky and leaning over to grab cables just sucked a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I was willing to - I really like it. I mean flash Thursday, which is a fragment on the sofa. Space facts. And then volunteering all weekend which is, I don't know. I did manage to tell a friend that I couldn't volunteer last night, because trying to pet my cat hurt my arm. But I don't know. I really got a thing though to volunteering for what you've already said yes to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So I'm kind of like eh. But Saturdays volunteering is mostly sitting down, which is probably going to be good. Or I can sit down; I can stand up if I want. I'm handling money for AIDS and so. But - and also, so something really good happened today at the beginning of the day, which is really awesome, which is Will (ph) is leaving the library. And I thought that would never happen and I'm so excited.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. [00:06:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I really thought that that would never happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's going to I think [inaudible] School to waste their money. And I'm just like ahhh. And so because they announced it yesterday and because I was out I missed it. I came back today and one of my friends e-mailed me and she's like, "yes".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the best news or the best and worst news in quite a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, it's better - it's really intensely great. I'm just so happy about it and I've been trying to be somewhat chilled today because I just can't run around and tell everyone I'm so happy he's leaving. Except to almost everyone agrees with me but we're trying to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't realize he was so generally reviled.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so he was made the head of reference for reasons that never really made sense. He's not a reference librarian, so that was confusing point number one. I think they called it reference and library service technology. And everyone was pissed that he was made head of reference; he's not a reference librarian. And he's [00:07:36] to the reference desk and blah, blah, blah. And so that pissed everyone off. And then he made a change under the [inaudible] reference staff, which is pretty impressive. I think within six months everyone hated him in reference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. He was pretty quick. He also visibly - in the first round of layoffs two years ago, he spent a ton of money on stuff and talked about it a lot, including at big staff meetings. Like it just one big, and it's really sad we've lost these employees; we need to work harder and blah, blah, blah. And he would stand up and be like yes, I just dropped, I just bought five laptops. And I remember at one point I was just weirded out. I asked - I remember one of the days I asked someone to talk to him, it's like maybe he doesn't realize how bad this seems. But I thinking he probably should kind of tone down that part; maybe emphasize something else. Maybe he shouldn't just be like I just spent this money. I was like you could do this, that and I had this whole thing laid out in my head for somebody to talk to him about it. And he just looked at me; didn't care. [00:09:10]</p>

<p>And he did this thing. We bought all these books for a sandbox reference collection right after layoffs and they took a lot of layoffs in circulation and they help process the books. So they were pissed. And then they were housed in references, which is off the reference library. And they were like but we have shit back there we use. And so, yes, kind of everyone who wasn't an upper or senior manager doesn't like him very much and [inaudible at 00:09:50]. But anyone who had contact with him pretty much grew to hate him. So he's gone. And I'm actually feeling like semi - I'm like oh I can do something at work with technology maybe. Except no, because [inaudible at 00:10:08]. But, you know, I feel semi-heartened. What else?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great. [00:10:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I don't know. I have a good hour or two being like work doesn't suck. I can do things. And then since [inaudible at 00:10:28] are annoying but I was kind of like oh maybe I could try and work these two, the couple connections I have, get somebody to throw money at me, which would be awesome or something. Also get some equipment that I've been dying to use. So he brought three touch-screen monitors (ph), so. He brought these three expensive HP touch-screen monitors. You have to pay someone to recode. And he hasn't really done anything with them. He tried to do little projects and they went nowhere and everyone hated them. And so I've been dying to get my hands on the computers for something else. So now maybe I can get to, maybe, to get them. I've been so happy. It's really embarrassing. I think I feel kind of not bad that I'm this excited, but I was feeling some of this would never happen, that I didn't totally get how awful it is, things were.</p>

<p>On a less awesome note, Ashby last night decided to go in for another fit of baby suicidal comments, which is irritating. So I talked to her on Tuesday about the concept of fixer-up friends and that there are people in my life that I should not hang out with and Ashby's like yes, I've always told you that. And the deal is that Ashby hates herself and hates people like her, so she - like friends of mine that I know who [inaudible at 00:12:36] too friendly, she's often very ready to hate them because she sees herself in them and thus... So, I offered to goad (ph) her on this point. I'm not going to stop [inaudible at 00:12:57] because you hate yourself. [00:12:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see your point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the next time was - and of course that, and she said and she's like oh and of course that means you shouldn't be friends with me any more because I'm also...I'm just like whatever, hush up. I live with you; just be quiet. Clearly you bring something to the table. And so Thursday she went out with some friends from work, from her previous job, and she came in and she was feeling really sad because basically because she's single is what it comes down to. She feels like her life is meaningless because she doesn't have a partner and she was upset that - so someone was complaining about how their job was really crappy and meaningless. And I think well yes but you have a husband and kids, also makes your...[00:14:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that's the whole point. That's what counts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And this other girl at work had gotten engaged or got an engagement three months before the wedding and was now sleeping her way through all the lesbians in town. And Ashby was pissed because okay [inaudible at 00:14:24] haven't gotten her all the lesbians in town, but this other girl was sleeping with all the lesbians. And so as she came in and sat down, almost [inaudible at 00:14:33] on the sofa, she's like oh so I suck. I'm like oh no, I have to tell you about it. And she's like it's just all so horrible. And then she literally went into her dark bedroom and threw herself on the bed. And I was like, oh great because also my whole body really hurt, I just didn't get up. So I got up and went in. Couldn't she just throw herself on our bed and then get up?</p>

<p>And so I was talking to her and she's like everything's horrible, life is meaningless. And so - and of course whatever I say makes her more angry. So I was like okay Ashby, I know you don't like it when I tell you your life isn't meaningless so I'm not going to say that. I'm just going to say that I think you're an awesome person, blah, blah, blah. And she's like yes I get it. You can't prove that my life isn't meaningless. And I'm like oh God I hate you. And then she was pointed out how it was just so hopeless and pointless and she's just like there's no point in going on. And I was like Ashby I really like to stay hoping you're not going to commit suicide. That would make me really sad. And then she started yelling at me because I was guilt-tripping her and she's not saying suicide. I'm like okay. [00:16:00]</p>

<p>And so, she's very angry that people [inaudible] make her feel guilty about committing suicide and that's really horrible because now she has this constant guilt trip and I don't even, I don't know what to say about that. So I was like fine, I'm not guilt-tripping you about committing suicide. You can do whatever you want. Just say I would be sad. And she was so mad about it. And I kind of gave up. I was listening to her and I was like ah. And she just went off on this whole tear about how she doesn't like to talk to people about how depressed she is because then they just argue with her and tell her and make her feel guilty about wanting to commit suicide. And I'm just like, I don't really know what else to say here. I would really prefer that you don't commit suicide. Sorry. Just sometimes I don't know what to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, she ran right into the corner again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and I've tried to get stuff out of the corner but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good luck with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. In the end it sounds like it's just going to go poorly. I'm like yes, it's going to go poorly. And then she was also mad because several people that she talked to I guess on the walk home basically said the same thing I was saying which is we think you're awesome so don't kill yourself. And that made her angry. And it's so - I kind of - I feel myself losing, feeling less and less empathetic towards her in part because it just, I don't really get the obsession with if I don't have a romantic partner my life is meaningless. [00:18:20]</p>

<p>Her work situation is kind of cruddy. One of her people that she manages sent her a series of text messages at 8:00 at night freaking out about her time entry. And how she felt like the way she was supposed to code her time entry was being used as a way to fire her, was going to be used to fire her, and she wanted Ashby to look into it. And Ashby's thinking, Ashby's like what the fuck? It's night on a Thursday. I can't do anything. Also this co-worker four years ago or so had a major mental breakdown at work and was out for a while. And the head of the organization was like and so Ashby, kind of thinks she might be heading towards that again. Just keep an eye out. So Ashby's playing a little I think you're being crazy and paranoid but...</p>

<p>So as long as I'm like well I agree with frustrations X, but also - like one of her complaints was that she would do nice things for her employees, like an [inaudible at 00:20:01] poll or she does all these things to make them feel good and no one, there's really one level above her which is the Director and none of them make her feel good at work. I'm like that does suck. You could possibly stop doing, you don't have to bend over backwards to make your employees happy. You can just, not that you should, could ignore the text or I don't know.</p>

<p>I don't know. It's hard because I can tell she's very upset and she's talking how she feels completely isolated and disconnected from everything. And that sounds really crappy, I'm like that sounds horrible, but also throwing herself on the bed in your dark empty bedroom is just so melodramatic. [00:21:11]</p>

<p>And also again you could talk to your therapist. This would be a great time to emergency call her or maybe see her more frequently or, which she absolutely flat out refuses to do. Right now she's spending extra money to that gym membership and another membership at another gym, cross membership, but she won't go see her therapist more than every two weeks even though her therapist would be less. I don't know. I mean it guess it looks difficult as I don't want to engage. I can tell that she wants all my attention and I don't want to do that, but nor do I want to say I'm sorry you feel like that, goodbye.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right, it's more of the way what's the kind of appropriate or due diligence in dealing with this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and I'm sort of I don't know that there's really necessarily is one necessarily but I do know I don't want to get sucked into any kind of argument or valid life proving or not proving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words she's pretty good at it. [00:23:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I mean that is her, she's really dedicated to that sort of pattern. Also I remember at one point, I think I said something, I couldn't think anymore, I'm like look I understand you think you're going to die alone and unloved but I really don't think you are. And then she got mad at me for saying that she thought - that I thought that she thought that she was going to die alone. I'm like but that's what you're talking.</p>

<p>The other thing is I also know that, I'm really confident that if I call the suicide hotline and plopped the phone in her hand that she would just bitch her way out of it. Or if I was like I think my roommate's going to kill herself, whoever showed up she was [inaudible at 00:24:22], she would just be able to pull together to not seem suicidal. And maybe she isn't. I have no [inaudible at 00:24:28]. I never even said I'd want to know. But I also, I want her to know that she's not alone in the universe without getting sucked into the emotional vortex of prove to me I'm not alone in the universe. [00:24:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My impression is that it's hard to deal with the worry and guilt that come from keeping your distance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It's hard because I mean if I - let's say God forbid she commits suicide. I would feel super, like I would feel responsible in some way. Like oh I should've pressed more, I should've called someone, I should've whatever. Even though I do think that I have responded to her and she's made suicidable. And it's always [inaudible at 00:26:19] distinctly enough that I can't totally call her out on it because she's just like I just want it to end because I'm tired of being alone. I think the key word is suicide without actually saying it. [00:26:34]</p>

<p>And she's got stuff about planning, like what should we do if she would commit suicide. Like how she would, because she's been financial planning for my benefit, if she were to commit suicide. Would she still leave me six months rent? I've been afraid - I don't even know. I certainly know how to deal with the conception of any of this. She has [inaudible at 00:27:04] friends in case she killed herself. Okay, I don't get it. It's her choice, it's not mine; [inaudible at 00:27:18] in my name. I can't stop her or, you know, she's an adult, she makes her own choices and blah, blah, blah. But I still feel like, I just feel really not okay. I worry that I'm turning away from her when she really needs someone but on the other hand, I don't think there's any amount of turning towards her that's enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess my impression is that your worry gets to such a pitch that you have a hard time reassuring yourself or sort of talking yourself down but kind of focus on the possible catastrophic consequences. [00:30:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what you're wanting from me as you talk about this is some opinionated reassurance or treat it like say something with conviction about the limits of your sort of responsibility or possible effectiveness because you're so worried and so unsure how to think that stuff through when you're so worried.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean and part of it, the part of it that makes it hard for me to reassure myself I think is that she's very open about being emotionally manipulative. So, not very open, but she said to me more than once that she does things for attention and so there's a certain level of dramatic just pay attention to me, pay attention to me. And I feel like I have no way, I don't feel ever confident, I never like - okay I know at least part of this is just you being over dramatic to get my attention. But I always feel, like I feel nervous if I cooperate. How much of that is you just playing to the audience and how much is you being semi-serious? [00:32:40]</p>

<p>And it makes me just, I guess what it makes me think of is friends who try to kill themselves and people who cut, which was, to which I was kind of like just really freaked out by. And I also think I never know what to say to someone who's ever wanted to kill themselves other than I don't, I hope you don't kill yourself because I really like you. And when I tell that to people about half the time the response is just it's kind of like they're baffled. I don't know how to respond to that or why would you say that. I'm just like well I mean, I don't really know what else to say. I mean, I really like you. I don't want you to die.</p>

<p>It's about I don't know what it's like to break. I just want, I kind of - what I want to express is you're not alone. It's not like no one cares for you; I care about you. I know that might not be enough but I would be sad. Please don't do that. But it's unclear to me if that's at all helpful or - I know that there's nothing correct. Like it's not that one thing you should say to someone who's thinking suicidal thoughts but... [00:34:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is really upsetting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's also I've never felt suicidal and so I just sort of feel very helpless and sort of like I really have no idea what you're going through. I just - that's not how I feel when I feel really depressed or when I feel very lonely or isolated it just - I don't know it just doesn't occur to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm sort of of two minds on how to talk with you about it. [That on one hand I'm happy to be [inaudible at 00:35:29] from this considerable removed. But being a [punishment having] (ph) with a friend dealing with some of these kinds of games, opinions or thoughts anyway for what they're worth.] (ph) But I'm also wary of trying to be reassuring or supportive in that way to the exclusion of talking about what this feels like and stirs up for you, which I think is important, and at times the intensity of your anxiety about all of that probably obscures if that makes sense. [00:36:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean last night was I think one of the things that I've been thinking really strongly is, I can't believe I've forgotten her name - I'm having a really hard time remembering anyone's names lately - but there was this girl in high school who she's anorexic, super high achiever, super everything and committed suicide and her family covered it up very intensely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About a while ago?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I mean I talked about it before. I think that she was the first person I knew who committed suicide. And so it was very odd, the initial cover up or story was that she had a heart attack due to anorexia. And then maybe two months later or something, it was no she had a heart attack because she committed suicide. Like, yes her heart stopped and that's what killed her but she was committing suicide.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wasn't so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that situation was, it's just so - it's so weird to think about. It's weird to think about that her family was really ashamed that she committed suicide. The way that people found out was basically one or two people I knew who were very close to her were kind of able to piece it together. She was alone in her car in a secluded area where she was - you wouldn't go there for any reason and she'd also, I mean she came and talked to us and said those things more than once. And one thing she was talking about more recently was committing suicide in your car, how you might do that and a few other things. [00:38:53]</p>

<p>And it's so weird to be not talked about because it never really became public that she committed suicide. Some people knew but even now I mean 20 years later it's still kind of this weirdly hushed thing. And one of the people who figured it out was my friend Jaimie who has tried to kill herself off and on since she was 12 and also someone who cuts. The name I forgot but she used to cut and she used to talk to people how she cut herself and why she cut herself.</p>

<p>And this sort of [inaudible at 00:39:51] from being teenagers, she's talked more a little bit more about how this other girl committed suicide, like she wants to commit suicide too after hearing that because she was also kind of anorexic and all these other things. They have a lot of them [inaudible at 00:40:13], that she'd gotten closer to committing suicide that I kind of was able to or willing to grasp when I was a teen. And part of why she didn't kill herself was through cutting, which I'm like good I guess... [00:40:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that's sort of a tough one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and last week when I was helping doing something with this clothes swapping, someone had changed over clothes and I could see that she had cutting lines on her thighs. And I started to say oh are you okay, and then I'm like oh right, you're a cutter. Okay. And it's just so visceral and hard. And also one of my authors that I really, really love, Kate Bornstein, regularly talks about cutting. She's a very, she's a - Spoken Word, sort of a piece that she - it's an essay in which she talks about cutting and about how she did and does do it to sort of release those other feelings. And so all of that kind of comes together in this. I feel so incredibly helpless about it. The people who cut it's so, you're like it's rolling (ph), you see it. And some people hide the cuts and some people don't. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ashby doesn't cut? [00:42:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She have any intent?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I know of. Especially, I mean I think what she does is she goes to the gym punishingly to an extent. I mean she goes to the gym every single day, every single work morning, and she goes usually on Saturday and sometimes on Sundays. And [inaudible at 00:43:06] morning gym she also does crosses at night sometimes Yes, I don't - it's funny. I'm sure she wants to do the things by herself on the machines but I'm not, I haven't seen them other than exercise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I mean what you said about the statistics had a lot of media critics to me, but it firmly sounds like it comes up a lot for her to you, which I'm sure is partly her intent and partly in your history. [00:44:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I don't know. It's kind of funny because sometimes I do think I'm amazed she hasn't cut herself just because so many people do that instead. She doesn't seem to self-harm as far as I can tell [inaudible at 00:44:34], in part because we tend to walk around in our underwear a lot, there's the whole body, check it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's stop for now. We'll talk more on Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I went and bought a bunch of stick on heating pads from CVS before coming here in my extra 10 minutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, we didn't explain how things [inaudible at 00:45:15].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I got it. I'm just moving extra slow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yes. Extra sore?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Ouch. Okay, I will see you on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Take care. [00:45:41]</p>

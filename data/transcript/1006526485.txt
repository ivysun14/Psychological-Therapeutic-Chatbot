<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. Today’s my day off. I had an extra-long weekend. I had Friday off, today, Tuesday, so I’m very relaxed. Oh, hold on. That’s my mom. Yes, it’s been really nice and I’ve made it a point to see people so I’ve been seeing a lot of friends. And Brian’s actually been very attentive so that’s been nice. And after this I’m going to go to dinner with two friends right here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yes, right around - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. We’re kind of all on budgets and thought where can we get a cheap burger?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and it’s good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so, yes. I don’t have much to talk about today because things are going okay. [00:01:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it’s a different kind of day to be here, yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I was thinking a lot of financial stuff was on my mind because I started off the weekend, I think it was on Friday that I went to go get an oil change and the guy you know how they always try to get more money out of you? So he says oh do you know that your car is due for this and this and that? And he gave me the whole bill and it ended up being $1,500. Yes, I was panicking but thank goodness I was out to breakfast with Brian and he kind of calmed me down saying let’s think about this. You don’t drive a lot. It seems like I need two front new tires and I didn’t know this because Alabama doesn’t have inspections. But I guess if your tires are really crappy that you won’t pass the inspection. So I’m a little worried about that; I’m going to go try to get it done tomorrow. Hopefully - [00:02:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The inspection?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but hopefully the car guy, the oil change guy was just exaggerating a little bit because I can’t afford tires right now. I had a really good meeting last week with Henry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yes, yes, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. He’s looking to kind of I guess use his office space as evening hours because they don’t really work in the evenings. And so I’m trying to get a group together and he’s going to try to see if people are around for the summer. And I figure since I’m not on any panels yet and I’m not yet quite ready to jump into private practice that would be a good starting point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh you’ll work under him? Once he gets back - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes in his group practice. But it would only be once a week, 90 minutes. It’s not a huge commitment and that’s what I want. I don’t want to be hauling over to the Square twice a week for lots of hours. But I need extra - I need some cushion. [00:03:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, well what would be a regiment be? How would you, how much would you - ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You haven’t gotten that far?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - they take so many. They take so much for the percentage, I think it’s 40 to 60 or something. But in the long run, 10 weeks if I get 60 [inaudible at 00:03:32] that would get me over a grand. And for me that’s a huge cushion so if I have that going while I’m working on finding a sublet and stuff like that to have a patient or two, that would be nice. It feels weird that I’m at the point in my life that I can do that kind of stuff. And Henry was so funny. I trust him and I’m comfortable with him and so he was kind of teasing me in a way because he said what’s going to be worth your while to come over here? What if you only have three people show up or something? So we did the math and he said okay, that comes out to about $700 and I said yes, yes. He said you’re not making enough money. [00:04:18]</p>

<p>And then we got to the point where he just very truthfully asked me how much are you making? And I told him and he basically said, and I guess I knew this I had just forgotten it, that in a group practice you’d be making about $80,000 a year, and I’m guessing in a private practice that’s just all of your own. You’d be making even more than that or as much as that. And I’m thinking to myself what the hell am I doing at GWU? So that’s started in my mind but I can’t imagine leaving, at least for another few years, I love it so much there. And I, I mean knew that I wasn’t ready to dive into anything on my own yet. I didn’t - I guess I had applied to a few group practices and I have interviews that were upcoming if I hadn’t gotten the GWU job but just, there was something about the community aspect of it and the coworkers and just being on different committees and being part of the university. But damn $59,000 a year compared to $80,000? That would be a big difference. So - [00:05:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many hours would you say you put into GWU?</p>

<p>CLIENT: 9:00 to 5:00 and then once a week I run that group and so I stay 5:15 to 6:45. I could run it in the middle of the day but that would make it harder because client hours are so important and during certain times of the year it gets so booked. And then I don’t take any paperwork home. Once in a while we have presentations but it’s just, it’s not a lot of preparation. It doesn’t feel like work there. [00:06:10]</p>

<p>I’m learning a ton. I don’t know if I told you this but last week I got my annual review, I think I did. And so I had the meeting with the director and the associate director and they just give you so much feedback about your growth. And I get supervision still. It’s called peer supervision. And I’m going to get to supervise next year. It’s just all this stuff that I wouldn’t be getting if I were alone in a practice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yes, yes, yes. There’s a lot of fringe benefits, [inaudible at 00:06:43], other benefits than pay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just they’re really invested in your professional development and right now I feel like that’s where I’m at and that’s what I’m focused on. And I want the feedback and I welcome it. So, I guess I’m making the conscious decision to just struggle for a little while. I know I don’t want to be like my coworkers. I was talking to some of them that have private practice. Some of them work so hard. There’s this one lady that lives about an hour and a half away and she comes into Hamden, she gets there at 7:00 a.m., sees a client 7:00 to 8:00, and then goes to work, and then commutes all the way back home. And then some nights, some days she comes in at 9:00, works, and then goes to private practice in Hamden and then goes home. [00:07:34]</p>

<p>And this other guy does private practice almost every night after work and he doesn’t get home to his family until 11:00. Fricking long day. I know I don’t want to work like that; I just want quality of life. And thank goodness it’s just me now; I can’t imagine if I had a family to support. So I’m just thinking maybe a few more years of this and then transition into private practice. I feel like I’m just getting my feet wet, with this group. Henry already, he taught me kind of how it works. Just it felt like a crash course just telling me about the notes, and the theme and just simple things that nobody teaches you that stuff. [00:08:24]</p>

<p>And then if I start one or two patients on my own, that would be a little bit more cushion. The tax money is running out slowly; I’ve had to get a little - because that was my cushion for a long time because I filed very early. And there’s all this stuff coming up like going to get my car done. Suddenly it’s new tires and let’s not forget the two cavities that I have that I’ve been putting off because I don’t have the little bit of money that my insurance doesn’t cover, or the malpractice insurance that I’ve been putting off. I know that’s not much but it just, it all adds up a lot. [00:09:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yes. No, it does. I mean that’s - $59,000 is tough to live and lost (ph) on that. Just is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s ridiculous. And it’s just, it makes me sad that little holidays pop up here and there like Easter or this long weekend that I could’ve gone home and I can’t go home and visit. But at the same time I don’t want to go home and visit. My family’s just so miserable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why, what - ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My poor mom. I think I mentioned this to you last time that she had a few days off for Passover and stuff. And she wakes up at home on vacation and she calls me up and says I haven’t been able to stop crying as soon as I wake up in the morning. Did I mention this to you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t remember about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was - right away I thought of my students who often come in and say to me I don’t know what’s wrong. When the semester was really busy I was fine and I was studying 24-7 and now that it’s calmed down I’m so depressed. It’s because you have time to think and reflect. And so I asked my mom, well what’s it been like for you on Monday through Friday? And she said I don’t have time to think. I just run to work and then I’m exhausted when I come home. And now she’s home and just wakes up and Billy’s there, and Billy doesn’t have a job and she has to kind of face reality. [00:10:25]</p>

<p>I feel so bad for them. It feels very strange. I’ve been saying in here just my career’s going up and more opportunities are coming my way and they’re just stuck. It’s really very sad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I think each kind of possibility for you to kind of earn more or potential for not just earning more but to do anything that kind of advances yourself it’s almost like a kind of a certain element of melancholy is associated with it. It makes you reflect about how your family’s stuck. It’s a simultaneous way of - it goes in tandem with these experiences in your life. [00:11:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I haven’t heard from my dad; he hasn’t called. I’m guessing it’s because he’s not too proud of the way his life is going right now. He probably never found a job. He lives with his mom - what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said he won’t call. He can’t call if he’s feeling that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I assume.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I mean, yes, so you notice that he won’t call when the chips are down or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean the last contact I had with him I remember he said how much do you owe on that car of yours? Tell me the number. And I have Billy still bothering me with can you file that police report, I need to get those $80 from his car break-in. I don’t know what he does with all his time. [00:12:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my little sister, she lives with them, she calls me today and says hey do you have a minute? I’ve been really depressed and I don’t know why. Yesterday I’m just crying for no reason; what’s wrong with me? Like I can just magically give her the answer. But I mean I can imagine. I feel like that living in that house. Just kind of dreary and depressing. And the poor thing, she still wants to be a speech pathologist and she has this plan to get her AA and then somehow go to UGA; it’s about half an hour from my house. And my parents are totally against that idea. And I hate that they don’t - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thought of going to UGA?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. They have dreams of oh you need to go away to New England to be in a college. You need to go GWU or something. She’s not going to do that. And Billy called me after my oil change actually and I picked up the phone and he said hey listen so we want to send Carly (ph) (ph) up there for the summer. How long do you think you could hold her up there? [00:13:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hold her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said you mean like how long do you want her to stay with me? Yes, there’s this acting workshop through Yale that I want her to do. I’m thinking how can you afford that? It’s probably expensive and she doesn’t even want to act. And he says could she stay for about a month with you? And I said yes, that’s fine. You know, just appeasing him even though I know I’m going to talk to Carly (ph) and that’s not going to be the story. And I did talk to Carly (ph) later and my sister says to me don’t pay attention to Daddy. Daddy’s crazy. I’m not going to any workshop. I’m coming there hopefully in July to visit you for a week and then coming home. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes. No it’s something, he has this kind of, some sort of grandiose kind of fantasy of what’s possible. And actually she’s kind of trying to really reckon with what - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Reality. [00:14:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - with what, yes, what’s possible, really possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: These are my realistic options and then he said something like we want to get her away from this riff raff down here in Augusta and get her in a more cultured place where she’ll be able to meet people who actually think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why [inaudible at 00:14:28]? Was she - they want her to be you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s funny because I made it. That was their dream for me originally I think to go to where Billy came from. He grew up in Chicago, Northwestern, well he grew up in Delaware but then - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He went to Northwestern?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He went, no, no, no. He grew up on the Delaware Shore and then for his senior year they moved to the big fancy house in Northwestern and he went to high school there. And then he went to the Florida State for one semester and then dropped out. So I think that since I was little, my parents kind of wanted me to go away to New England somewhere. You got to go up North that’s what they always said. And it didn’t work out like that because I ended up staying there for college. I don’t know why I didn’t apply back then. I probably could’ve made it in but I just I guess I wasn’t ready. But eventually I made it up here. And all my friends are professionals and they love that; my mom’s always bragging about that. Oh, all her friends are psychiatrists and psychologists and they have all these degrees. And here’s Carly (ph) hanging around with people who go to community college, who want to be techs, medical technicians and stuff like that. And they think that that’s trash. [00:15:55]</p>

<p>So I was thinking about what we said in that session a few weeks ago when remember I was talking about if I mess up who’s going to drive the boat, like the boat’s going to sink? I was reminded of when my little sister called me and she had been talking to my mom about how my whole family, my mom’s brothers got together for a barbecue and they didn’t invite my mom. And Carly (ph) started talking kind of like my mom and she started saying things like who do they think they are? I heard that they just get together and drink and get drunk and smoke marijuana. They’re so trashy; for God’s sakes, you’re a doctor. [Laughs] [00:16:47]</p>

<p>And I’m thinking, first of all, yes I get that my family is different and they do that stuff and none of them are professional. But I don’t sit there and talk about them that way. And when she says comments like that it makes me think holy crap, Billy’s not a professional, my mom’s not, Carly (ph)’s not, so I’m the one that somehow holding them up or something. If I mess up, that’s not acceptable. I’m supposed to be the put-together person who’s a professional, who’s made it. So when I think back to situations where that drunken afternoon, no way. That’s like - that’s what that made me think of. And when she said that on the phone I almost felt like myself putting my head down because that had just recently happened. [00:17:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I see. Yes, so yes, you’re the one who’s kind of steering the ship towards something better than what they - </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so if they knew the truth - but I’m both. I have messed up like that but I do have it together as well. I don’t know if I truly can believe that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well something too about it, about a certain kind of real strong, really strong feelings and kind of almost like a disgust around the roots, certain roots in the family. Around like drinking too much, trash, can’t be that way. That - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Low ambitions - [00:18:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - low ambitions, yes. Low ambitions, right, right. We can’t be like that; that’s going to be our ruin. And yet there’s something also kind of like, as you’re sort of saying, they, that means they don’t have contact. They disavowed that side of their lives, their roots, their - </p>

<p>CLIENT: But yes, I’m the only one out of our little family that is what they are trying to portray. They live in this huge fricking house in Augusta. It’s not new or anything. It was built in the 70s and but it’s in a beautiful neighborhood where people do have money to kind of fix up their houses. It’s a really nice neighborhood and it’s right across the street from a middle school that’s very good. And I’m sure the houses in our neighborhood could sell for a lot and I’m thinking to myself what are they doing living there? Everything for them is just facade; know what it looks like on the outside. [00:19:47]</p>

<p>Yes, so I haven’t been tempted to mess up in any way. I haven’t drank yet, I’m nervous. Every time I’m out in an event that people could be drinking I get not nervous but just a little unsettled because I don’t yet have the urge to drink anything but I don’t know what I’m scared of. Like for example today’s Monday and so I went for my little jog earlier today and I passed all these house parties and people were drinking. And I passed by some restaurants where the patio decks were opened and people are eating and having a beer and it was sunny and I thought ooh that would feel good. I’d like a beer. But then I’m telling myself no, you shouldn’t. [00:20:43]</p>

<p>And it’s not like I have a fear that I’m going to have a beer and that’s it; it’s going to get out of control because I’ve drank plenty of times and it’s been fine. But here I am getting ready to go to dinner with my friends and I might feel like having a beer and a burger. But I’m nervous about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that you’d be tempted to mess up. [00:21:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. Brian is very extreme and he doesn’t drink. At the most he’ll have a beer rarely. So he kind of made me promise just don’t drink. And I almost feel like I’d be lying to him or something. And I agree; I’m in the process still of finding a psychiatrist because I don’t know how it interacts with my Zoloft. And any kind of crazy - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What - anything ever happened to those names I gave you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You gave me one name.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just one. Okay. Over - oh yes, one on that side. Anything happen with it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of all these expenses I’m just postponing, postponing. But I’m going to - I mean that’s still on my to-do list.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I always only ask because I wanted to know how it turned out. [00:22:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. No, I’ll let you know when I find someone. Anytime I’ve messed up in any major way it’s involved alcohol. And my friend Patrice has her 30th birthday coming up and she wants to go to the Hotel and I know that’s going to be a night of drinking. I went out; I went out this past weekend Saturday night, with Patrice and a bunch of our friends, these guys that sometimes we go out with, and they were all drinking. Patrice never drinks; she just - she’s got a lot of medical issues so she just, she goes out and has fun without drinking. And I didn’t have the urge to drink and I told myself well if I feel like having a glass of wine or something maybe I’ll do that. But at the same time I’m trying to save money. If I don’t feel like drinking don’t drink. And I ended up drinking water all night. And I was fine and I had a good time. I’m just so scared to mess up again. [00:23:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it’s - I mean I think there’s just, like we’ve been talking about there’s just so much to that experience of quote, messing up, right, that really emerges for you. It gets categorized as messing up but it’s something that is really powerful of how I’m suggesting it’s a substantive feeling or state of mind that we’re yet to really fully understand but we know, I mean we’re really learning a lot about it. Like, just all of the - it wasn’t just the drinking and isolation right that day with James. It was so much more. It was so much about feelings and - [00:24:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: My friend Patrice who I was supposed to see that night, remember because after the concert I was going to hook up with her and my other friends. I finally saw Patrice for the first time in a long time this weekend and so when we were just sitting there on Saturday night I kind of gave her a little bit more background. And she was saying - everyone I’ve told this story to they say Melanie, it doesn’t sound like it was just the alcohol. There was a lot going on emotionally. But I guess what scares me about it is that I didn’t realize that all that was brewing. So how do I not know I now have something brewing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I hear you. It’s about how scary that whole side that just kind of came out of nowhere was. Almost like what the hell happened? I would remember it. What did I did - that whole time, that side of the experience, yes. Oh yes. Yes, and a fear of getting in touch with it again but I think it means something. And I think it has something to do with I think a lot of something about, I mean I don’t know, something about the feelings about these roots. [00:25:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking after I told Patrice this whole thing, she’s very supportive and understanding, I was thinking about the examples I’ve had growing up. And I remember just a few years ago - I actually think that it was just in the recent, the past two or three years because I think I remember telling you this, that my mom went out to happy hour with her friends from work, ended up drinking too much, threw it up on the front lawn and my little sister saw her and she called me up crying. Like making a spectacle - she’s a grown woman, my mother. And it doesn’t surprise me because I saw my mom doing that stuff. I saw my mom with her brothers and my cousins and aunts at parties growing up where they were getting drunk and dancing and getting inappropriate. Inappropriate in front of an eight-year old, like Billy would come out dressed up in my mom’s lingerie. Not to be silly but it just seeing them loud and rambunctious and drunk - [00:26:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, something about forgetting the temporary kind of suspension of all kind of senses of what this could impact or what it means or you know. To somebody it’s just a free, almost like a free-for-all getting into something about themselves, throwing caution to the wind, just letting themselves just completely go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and there was never not in front of the kids or go to your room. I’ll never forget the party where we were serving them drinks. I was in third grade; I was 10 and my cousin was 12 and she ended up getting drunk because she was tasting the drinks. And she was sitting on the toilet passed out with her head back, I remember, and my parents were just trying to take care of her but they weren’t in a panic or anything. We just thought it was funny. [00:27:39]</p>

<p>They could’ve gotten the cops called on them. She was 12 years old. And then I have all these memories of my dad just getting drunk and emotional. He would get so emotional when he’d pick me up from my mom’s and he’d start crying your mom wants to keep us apart, or there was one time I spent Christmas Eve with him and they had guests over. And he ended up getting so drunk he spilled the pot of soup over in the kitchen and burned himself and the guests had to go home. Then my grandma had to put his pajamas on. </p>

<p>And then when Sasha, my other sister that we share Dad with, she used to get picked up for the weekend from him. I remember her calling me and complaining that oh my mom got mad at Dad because he was drunk when he picked me up. You know, just all this stuff. When I look at it that way it’s kind of, it’s kind of a miracle that I don’t fuck up more or that I don’t drink all the time. I mean I did for a while. I think back to college and the beginning of grad school but that was a little bit more developmentally appropriate. [00:28:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, no and I see it like this. I think that what really spooked you about the whole, that whole showing up to Brian’s place right that in some way you felt that, you knew it kind of scared him or something. It brought out this side of you or you felt like oh I did something that crossed some sort of line to him. [00:29:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I showed up on his doorstep?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes. And that that really - but it was a way I think, one way of thinking about it was one way of you telling him about, something about how, something about your life about you wanting to tell him about what you’ve experienced and can he take it. Can he take it, can he understand? Does he want to know that in some way? Not that it’s a conscious kind of thing but I think it’s implicitly showing him another side. Which I think is what is something that was in action around the situation with James. Someway that you were trying to show him this isn’t, I’m not just in this category; I’m somebody else. And I’m scared of losing it. Can you take this other side of who I am? I’m going to [inaudible at 00:30:38].</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know how Brian, of course he doesn’t like that side and it’s dangerous and he lectures me when I do something. But he doesn’t reject me for it. He’s been so close and attentive lately and I’ve seen him so much. That girl never responded to me because I - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You spooked that one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I talked to him about how the note doesn’t look like it’s a year old. And he still swears, he says I swear to you it’s from - you kept saying the girl’s name like I was supposed to know who she was; I don’t. That was a long time ago. And I told him I don’t know if I just don’t care or if I’m willing to start fresh and have everything out in the open. And I don’t know what it is because I’m not sure if that was really over a year ago. Strange that he still had it in his glove compartment. [00:31:51]</p>

<p>But he’s also been making more of an effort. Like sometimes he’s - I think last week and the week before he’s seen me twice in a week. He never used to do that. On Friday that I didn’t have work, he picked me up from the oil change place, took me to breakfast, took me to Target because I needed to get something to hang up a frame, helped me put up the frame. We spent a regular day together and we never get to do stuff like that because our schedules don’t coincide. [00:32:30]</p>

<p>And then after that he had to go home to write a paper or something but then he said I could come back tonight. And he came back that night and slept over. And I knew that he had a busy weekend. He had to go be with family for Easter. That’s the part where it gets weird because he tells me all about the family drama. He doesn’t get along too well with his mom and he was anticipating that she would be very passive aggressive. And he called me from the car and I said oh so where is Logan? Oh they’re in the car behind me, following me, because he had to take off and go to work after the Easter party. [00:33:16]</p>

<p>So I’m so close yet so far away. I’ve got this image; he’s sitting in the car on his cell phone talking to me, telling me all about the party he’s going to with his family, and then they’re in the car behind him following.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes. There’s something kind of that has to remain almost compartmentalized about this other element that’s happening. Is that right, is that - ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s just weird. I’m in it but I’m not. I haven’t even met his son yet and he was telling me - I was just asking so what’s it going to be like, who’s going to be there, who are you looking forward to seeing, just letting me into his life. And then later when he got to work and he was in the parking lot he called me again. And then he worked 7:00 to 7:00 and then woke up this afternoon and then called me when he woke up. [00:34:16]</p>

<p>And we’ve just been very - we’ve been doing a lot more communicating. Like Friday when he was over, so we went out to breakfast, we did our stuff and then we ended up going back to my place and having fun. But then that night when he came over we were both really tired and we never don’t do anything physical when we’re in the same room together. And we were just - he was telling me he felt like cuddling and we were just laying side by side, holding each other, talking until we drifted off to sleep. And it was so nice. I feel closer to him since this happened.</p>

<p>It’s still weird, though, when I talk to my friends about it. We’re out with these guys and they’re friends of ours and we’ve been friends for over a year now and they know about him. And I don’t know how they know the details, I must’ve told them some stuff, but one of them asked me so have you met his son yet? And I said, oh what a stab to the heart. Don’t ask me that. [00:35:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did it, yes, what did it, what was the stab - yes, can you see?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That it can’t yet be normal. That it’s still weird. I actually kind of wish I could tell people he’s married. Does that explain it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that, too, seems like, right, something that you’d feel has to be - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like another side of me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - another side of you. A determined very private side of - I mean almost like you describe it as a, to use your family’s way of thinking, like a side that your family would see as kind of a quote trashy or something. Is that - ? [00:36:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my God. My mom, I don’t know what she would think. I remember her telling me about my cousin who got kicked out of his house that he was sharing with friends because he was sleeping with a girlfriend’s or the guy’s wife or whatever. And the history, you know, my grandmother and all that. I could never let them know that. I haven’t even let my mom know that he has a son or that he’s divorced, which if we stay together eventually I’d have to tell her that. And she’d consider that strange or bad. Why would you go with a guy who has baggage? [00:37:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes. Just says so much about how she must sound so [inaudible at 00:37:23] herself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m trying to care less and less about what she thinks but it’s hard. After the breakup with James I told you that the first thing that came to my mind is damn my mom’s going to be so disappointed. I have to live off [inaudible at 00:37:43]. I found his Chapstick under my bed and I had this momentary fantasy of me oh imagine if I had picked this up and burst into tears. That’s not happening. It should or something but - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, but not, you couldn’t see a feeling of - </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. You know if anything I can call up Kevin more. I don’t what it was but I did some more Facebook spying and they’re still together. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did they get married? [00:38:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, they’re engaged.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They’re engaged.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think that’s what I’m waiting for. That one day I’ll look at Facebook and the mom’s going to have pictures posted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of? You’re friends with her is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, you can see one of their Facebook - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, sometimes you can see certain - well I’m still friends with his mother and his sister. And once in a while I’ll [inaudible at 00:38:50] the events. Yes. Oh, I thought you meant her like the fiancée.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no, no. I [00:38:57].</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yes, once in while for family events and stuff they’ll post pictures of everybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right. That’s how - </p>

<p>CLIENT: She just, she looks like a baby. She’s 21; he still looks giant with a beard. And he just turned 33. What would I think if I had a daughter that was 21 being with a 33-year-old man who’s still an undergrad? I don’t know why I do that to myself. I think it’s lots of things. It’s how could I have wasted so much time. That feels like a different person, a different life. [00:39:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, but what does - what does the - </p>

<p>CLIENT: But also things come up like if Kevin knew about what happened at St. Patrick’s Day weekend he’d say I told you so. You’re not going to find anyone to take care of you. I knew you’d keep on troubling with those kinds of problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re not going to find anyone to take - oh, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean James walked away. [00:40:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, no I can appreciate though the bit about the kind of impact Kevin seen that that side of your life and responding to it. Taking care of it to you seems to [inaudible at 00:40:37].</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it still bothers me that he found someone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about it, yes? How are you thinking about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me, I know that this is not the reality of it, but it makes me feel more messed up. Like okay he must’ve been the normal one or the healthy one if right away he was able to find someone. And look, they’re still together and he, look at - I’ve had all these hook-ups and - [00:41:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh because he’s found somebody, he’s with somebody he’s - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I’ve had James who I totally - part of me thinks I completely messed that up. And now I’m with a married guy. When I really take time to sit and reflect it makes me think I’m damaged or something. But when I’m just living life and just distracted and things are going okay with Brian, it feels better. It feels almost healthy and it’s okay. But now that I’m sitting here talking about it and I feel messed up. [00:42:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Messed up. What made you think, feel messed up? Or what is it that’s messed up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know probably that the relationship isn’t perfect and I knew Kevin the way he was when I knew him and he’s a disaster. And I know no one’s relationship is perfect. But I’ve never had something normal because I was always hiding Kevin, my parents didn’t approve, and now my next major relationship is a married guy. I have to hide that; my parents wouldn’t approve. And then I found James who my parents would totally approve of but I fucked it up. Not that I even wanted it to work necessarily. He was a good guy just a lot of stuff was missing, it was moving too fast, the passion wasn’t there. It makes me think that maybe I’m attracted and wired for the dysfunctional and that’s the way it’s going to be. [00:43:35]</p>

<p>[Pause]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well putting it - </p>

<p>CLIENT: That I don’t think about this all the time. That’s a lie; I do but just not as deeply as I am right now because right now it’s making me really sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you noticing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just want a healthy, normal relationship and I think I’m scared that I’m not capable of that. [Pause] I mean because there it was in my face. James was a potential healthy relationship but always swat the minty (ph) ones. [00:44:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, but I guess I’m wondering, yes, there is this thing that you do describe of feeling as you’re talking today there’s this line of I feel good about the way things are going with Brian; I feel okay about it. And then it kind of moves to a very different tone where you start to feel very sad and kind of like you’re fucked up or something. And it seems to hinge around at least two things I was thinking about. One is that when we talked about, when you talked about if your mom only knew, then what would she say about me from your standpoint. </p>

<p>And then also when I was thinking about something that I said about it also led to that kind of feeling. Something about me bringing up this - something to the effect I said something like you’re looking for something in Brian that you’re not getting in these other places, something to that effect. That had an impact on the shift that - [00:45:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I’m not sure when the shift happened but suddenly something drastic happened and I started feeling really sad. I thought it started coming up when I started talking about Kevin. [00:46:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yes, okay. It’s associated with Kevin and - </p>

<p>CLIENT: That was my experience but there you are looking at me so maybe it looks different from your side. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it’s - </p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt it kind of sink in - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: With Kevin. Oh, okay, okay. [Pause]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that just, that was a young relationship but it lasted 13 years. And it wasn’t healthy. And I haven’t had good examples of healthy relationships and I mean look at now what I’m drawn to. A married man. [Pause] I’m just scared that it’s always going to be dysfunctional like, I feel like James was my opportunity for something healthy and I said ick. [00:47:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes there were those icky kind of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, when he would look at me a certain way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes. No, I think yes, it raised a lot of stuff but there’s also something about both Kevin and Brian. And I think in different ways they respond and you feel kind of understood and - Kevin got that kind of the drinking stuff. And you felt cared for and he would just kind of look at you and say what were you thinking? But it wasn’t condemning; it didn’t sound like he thought it was trash. He didn’t see it that way. He didn’t conceive of it that way. [00:48:02]</p>

<p>Brian doesn’t see the kind of, the interesting, in a certain kind of erotic experience, the sexual experience as upset - in fact he relishes it; he welcomes it. He wants it; he wants to know that. Does not see it as trash. And I think you felt like you weren’t sure about James. Certainly in the - I mean I think in either sphere, either in the kind of the element of yes, this other side of me comes out and it kind of scared him off. What to make of all that? And you felt he wanted to run away. What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wasn’t expecting to get so sad. Are we on for next week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Next week. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re welcome. All right. [00:49:33]</p>

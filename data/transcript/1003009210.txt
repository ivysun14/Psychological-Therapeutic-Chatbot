<p><b>DR:</b> How are you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good as like how?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Strong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're strong for the way you're dressed in this weather all right?  But, how are you really doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tired?  How about the depression and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're okay with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And getting upset, mad, any of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but everybody does that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.  But like, is it creating problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like how?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like how?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My probation officer thinks I need meds and I think I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Medicine don't cure everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right, right.  No it doesn't, but it sure helps, right?  Ultimately it's you who'll, but if you kind of, you know if it's like an uphill battle going up a slippery slope, it's kind of hard to do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Medicine don't help me.  I've taken everything and anything I can, it won't help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know you've taken a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing helps.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  But you know one thing [PATIENT NAME] is when, when you've taken the meds, often you haven't taken it how it should have been taken, right?  Remember that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't like taking meds because they make me tired.  I'm tired enough without taking them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So now, the probation is still going on though?  Until when?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Until I get my fines paid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much left?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fourteen hundred dollars.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And how much are you paying every month or every week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing.  If ain't got a job.  I got nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I got a job, but I ain't got paid from it yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What job?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I work at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here in town?  Uh-huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As an assistant activity director.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for you.  What, how much do they pay you though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Minimum wage, $6.55 an hour -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I only work 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So about $120, $130 a week and out of that they -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get paid every 2 weeks so I haven't got my check yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just started?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But they'll give it to you and then you'll give it to your probation officer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not all of it, some of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how do you do at the job though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like you don't get upset there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because sometimes the elderly can be, especially with the activity part, can be hard for them, but you're pretty mellow?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just want actually some medicine that will help me [INAUDIBLE] because everything I've taken hasn't helped me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  I know.  Let's figure, let's figure that out.  Um and one thing that helps me figure out which maybe the one that's likely to do the best is if I can get some hints from you, some help from you on how on some of the past medications, what did a little better than the other?  I know none of them really did what they were supposed to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't really know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if you just look back -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Geodon made me tired all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Geodon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Made me tired all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It didn't help nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Abilify didn't help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing helped.  I don't remember all the medicine I took.  I've taken a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know you have.  Let me go through the list here a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know I don't ever want to take Geodon again.  It made me tired non stop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] been on it for 6 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Topamax, it didn't help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Any of the antidepressants?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know, but the antidepressants help the moodiness as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The only thing I've taken was Flexeril and Prozac.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that didn't help my mood swings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That didn't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't even think I have a disorder.  I don't think I'm bipolar like everybody says I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just have mood swings.  Everybody has mood swings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Yeah you had them a long time, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wish they'd actually like, diagnose me with something instead of mood swings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everybody has mood swings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, um-hum.  Depakote, you ever been on Depakote?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a medicine that will often help uh, just with, you know mood swings stable and settling someone down.  Now, do you have insurance that covers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have the State of Kansas insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's one of the best because they're pretty much, I don't need it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No I'm just seeing if I got it.  Yeah I got it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  That may be, did Lamictal help?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think I take that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] because that may be a good one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I want something that's not going to make me tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What did Abilify do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well um, let's go with Tegretol, which is just like the Depakote, but sometimes Depakote can cause tiredness, so that way we can get the good out of that and um, not the bad part of it.  So let's go with that, uh and then we might have to go back and add either Fluoxetine or one of those depending on how, you know, how you do, but for now, let's go with that and see, see how you do.  Are you still on -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just like real; I can't sit in one spot for 5 seconds.  I'm like just always up, walking constantly.  I just can't stay still.  And everybody says, "Oh that's just a part of you not taking your meds."  I just can't sit still.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have we ever had you on an ADHD med before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I'm like [LAUGHING], I have trouble sitting wherever I'm at.  Whether I'm in school, I'm at work I just can't sit.  I'm like, I'm constantly walking around.  I even do it at home.  I sit there and pace the floors at home because I can't sit in one spot, spot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here's what we'll do then we'll see where we go.  Go with the Tegretol plus add Concerta, which is an ADHD med and see how you do.  You know, as much of what you've been on in the past, it'll be good to see if we could find something to help settle things down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I take these at morning or at night?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Concerta morning, Tegretol night.  Now on the Tegretol [PATIENT NAME], we will need a blood test done in about a week or so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  After I take it or before I take it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'll take it at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, do you need the blood test before I start taking the medicine or after?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no.  A week after.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A week after I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See, you start the medicine tonight and keep taking it every night -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then do the blood -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In about a week or so, go in the morning and get the blood test.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So like next Monday?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Monday's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the blood test is to be done about 12 hours after the night dosage.  So if you take it, if you're taking it at night around 9:00 then have the blood test done at 9:00.  If you're taking it at 8:00, then have the blood test done next morning -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Why do I have to do a blood test?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Why do I have to do a blood test?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To see if there's enough of it getting into your system because that's the only way we know if it's going to do what's it's going to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Plus to make sure it's not hurting the body.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So both.  Okay [PATIENT NAME], hope you do better.  Hope you feel better, hope you do better, hope you're more settled and so that you can get the probation officer -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, off my case.  You want to make another appointment for about a month?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's your prescriptions.  That's for the blood test in a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

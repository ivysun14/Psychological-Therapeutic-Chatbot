<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good, um, nothing has really changed between last week and today. Um, I can't wait to be done with school. Um, I had a long week this week with work and school and everything and, um, (pause) that's, nothing's really new.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, good. I've had like the least productive weekend so now I'm stressed about all the work I didn't do over the weekend and now I have to get done. Um, so today's going to be a really long day. Uh. [00:01:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made this weekend unproductive for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, well I had like the best intentions on Saturday, I mean Sunday to get all my homework done. Then Saturday night I ended up going out with all my friends uh, kind of like a spur of the moment. One of my friends got engaged so they all went out and then Sunday I didn't do anything so.. (laugh) I know it was fun but not very responsible. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Better than not getting work done because you couldn't concentrate. [00:01:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know that's true. I just slept all day. Um, so, and nothing, I'm going over to my mom's next weekend for Easter brunch on Sunday, with Kyle, so it'll actually be fun. And, I think that's (laugh) I don't know. Um, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are your thoughts like during, like so nothing major happened this week? How does that affect where your thoughts are and what your thoughts are like? [00:02:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I talked to my stepmother on I guess Friday and just to see if anything had changed. And um, she seems to think that he can possibly get um probation and, I don't know if that's her, I don't know if that's realistic or if that's just her I don't know, thinking out loud.</p>

<p>But um, because the police haven't reported what they've found in the house yet. So, I'm not, and so that they, there's a date April 25, um, which will only discuss his uh, his bail, and if he should continue being released or whether or not they want to heighten his bail and they want him to go back to jail. Um, and then there will be another date mid May which will then disclose the charges. And then after that his attorney gets a certain amount of time to defend his client. Which will bring us into June and, so I mean, really not like he won't go to jail or be sentenced or anything until mid summer. So, nothing's happened this week just kind of more waiting (laugh) (sigh). I don't know. [00:04:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like at the beginning you sort of expected sort of a big change you know sort of rather quickly. And things did, you kind of found things out. But now it's much more sort of sits there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just the way our judicial system works that you know, but I had no idea. That he's, like this you know dragged out forever. Um, he's still living in that hotel I guess. Um, and, I don't know. I just wish something would happen so this could be over with. I, five more weeks until I'm done with school (laughter). I don't know. I just need something to change because I hate just waiting around. [00:06:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah that's really hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, I don't know. (laughter). I don't know if...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you imagine it would feel different if he had been sentenced?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I feel like maybe at least some closure I guess or, having, it just irritates me that he's sitting in this hotel you know, basically not having to deal with anything, uh, normal talks about it you know. Um, and I really, he has yet to see a consequence I guess. That's from my perspective. Like I want him to be in jail, not I don't know, he just gets to I don't know, I don't know that it makes me feel so bad for my stepmother that she's now a single mother and he's just ordering room service and watching TV all day. I don't know that that's what he's doing, but, it's just frustrating. [00:07:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it feels like other people are getting punished more than he is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's always been the case, everyone sort of on their tip toes around him. Sort of, I don't know why, but just the way it's been. (laugh). And, and I just hope he doesn't get probation, you know. I don't know. Cuz I, to my knowledge he's never um, been arrested, not arrested, you know like prosecuted for something of this magnitude. Um, so. You know, there is still that chance that he could just you know get (inaudible at 00:08:46) but I hope that that's not the case you know. [00:08:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what your brother and sister are hoping for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, uh, I didn't talk to them. Uh, really about this at all. Um, well I don't know. Well one it's weird to bring up, you know. Um, and you know my little sister gets really defensive quickly you know. So, I don't want to, you know when I do see her I don't want to, I don't know, um, and my brother, is on a whole different planet. He just you know, I don't even think he, I don't want to underestimate how much he understand or doesn't understand because that would be the worst thing anyway. So, um, you know because he's twelve he's still, he's a smart kid you know, but you know, his worries consist of video games and his guitar. (laughter) [00:10:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He probably notices that his dad is not around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, I'm, I know my step mother says that she talks to them about this whole thing. I don't know, I don't know if she does. And I keep asking if they're you know seeing anyone, which they absolutely need to, I think. Um, but she doesn't drive currently so she can't get them anywhere that's not very close to their house that they can walk to. And they have you know homework and sports and stuff after school so. It'd have to be on the weekends and you know she's just kind of putting it off I think. Because you can find someone, you know there's gotta be. [00:10:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a guidance counselor at school? Or a psychologist?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is, well who they have been talking to. I know my little brother sees him once during his study hour, now it's once a week. Um, for during so it's like forty five minutes once a week which you know that's great and he seems to really um, you know it's a guy and he thinks he's really cool so.</p>

<p>Um, my little sister, they were um, she was having to go. But I guess that ended or um, so, I think she should still see someone. But they have I guess last week, she um, she's, I mean she's a fantastic student and last week she just, she had a paper due and something else and she just didn't do them. You know. [00:11:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so. Yeah she just didn't pass anything in. She was supposed to go to school on Thursday, she walks to school and never got there and came back home after my stepmother left for work. So um, she, you know, of course they do the regular, if the child doesn't show, they call you know the parents, especially since the, and she's got a red flag on her name anyway.</p>

<p>Uh, they're giving her extended grief time I guess they're calling it so, you know. For part of the dates and uh, I mean as a student you can only miss four days of school a year, I don't know maybe it's six, but she's already missed the time so. And I don't know what the punishment is but they're not gonna hold her, you know, as long as she's still making an effort. [00:12:52]</p>

<p>And she's you know, I guess she already passed the report; she e-mailed her teacher on Sunday. She was only a few days late but I just hope that she, you know because junior year is so important for college. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like even if your step mother hasn't you know got them in to see somebody, privately, certainly they're looking out at school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's eyes on her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um, that's just so not her behavior you know, that to leave for school and then turn around and come home. She never would have done, you know. I think last year she had perfect attendance. Like never missed a day you know. And this year she was saying that she's missed over two weeks at this point. So, not at one time you know. Well she did actually miss a week when this all happened. [00:14:02]</p>

<p>My little brother (big sigh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure it's a really different environment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I could not imagine being in high school or middle school. Because most kids are being you know, (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel already like, you don't want people to know, and in High School and Middle School everybody knows everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yes. Uh, that would be awful, I mean they both seem to be doing ok, you know given the circumstances. But um, and they have a week off for April vacation, I think a week and a half so that will be good. Um (pause). Uh (pause) I think that's (unintelligible at 00:15:15)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you like to talk to them more about it? It seems like there's this pull of like you don't want to bring it up because it's hard...[ 00:15:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hard subject to bring up and you're not sure how they'll respond and yet it's a really big subject that you all know is there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would. I would like to, but I just don't want to, I don't know how, like how to begin. And (pause) I mean you know their relationship with him is completely different than mine. I mean I've never lived with him, I don't. So, I, I mean they've always sort of known my feelings toward him so I don't want to come off looking like a bully or you know. When if they still do have you know, some, and then I don't want sit there and listen to them talk about what a wonderful father he is when they have no idea, you know? So, I, I, but I would like to talk to them. But I also wouldn't want my step mother there because um, yeah, and I'd want them to be completely honest. And as much as she's saying that she you know, she's starting to see the light and, you know. [00:16:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Plus a very different relationship that she has with him versus what you have and they have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder what would happen if you just put something out there like, "So I've noticed that we haven't actually ever talked about what's going on with Dad".</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And didn't go beyond that but just sort of acknowledge that there has been sort of this weight of silence on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And give them an opportunity to either share what they are feeling or thinking or not. [00:17:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. I've only seen them once since this whole thing happened and I was supposed to go over there last weekend, you know, this past weekend and um, you know I called my step mother and she said my sister was swamped with homework. So, because the whole point of me going over there was to spend time with her because I didn't. So, I don't know. So I didn't end up going over there. So. [00:17:47]</p>

<p>So when I, you know I talked to them on the, more my little brother I talked to on the phone. Everyone once in awhile he'll call me for a three minute conversation. And then um, other than that might not be the right time and I've only seen them once I don't want to talk to them on the phone about it. So. Um. I don't know, I will. I will, but (pause) you know (pause). Yeah. [00:18:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a really hard thing to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But, yeah and then when I do see them I, you know they have so many other things going on in their lives that are good and that I want to hear about you know, rather than, I don't know, he just takes up so much time like in my thoughts, that you know I hear about my little brothers band that he's starting and the songs that he's writing. Like that's the stuff I want to talk about with him, you know, not this. You know, because I'm sure you know, that he's thinking about it just as much as I am, or more you know. I don't know but I also want him to know that I'm you know, here to talk to, so. I don't know we'll see, I just, have to get time to go over there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's hard cuz you don't have a lot of time with them because they are busy kids and you've been having your own life too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't, it's hard to fit everything in without other stuff being really important too, kind of being able to focus on all the other things that are happening in life. [00:19:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. You know it took, to be done with school, have one job, you know. I've been working the whole time. Have all weekend to do what I want to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) I know, does that really happen for anyone though?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes. Probably not every day for the rest of your life, you'll probably have periods of time that look like that you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I've always had more than one job, plus school. [00:20:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's interesting to hear you say that that's the picture you're looking for. Last week I believe you were thinking about signing up to learn a language and um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have always.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You weren't really setting that up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Kyle always says that's Kim's ambition of the day. I'll see something, I want to do that and then I'm totally focused on that for like a week and then I forget about it. So. But I do want to learn you know a language. You know I have weeks like, you know, last weekend I had the whole weekend off and I said this is so great and I got nothing done that I actually had to get done so when I you know have like six hours between job number 1 and job number 2, and you know I have two assignments to get done, you know I get them done because it's my only time. But this weekend I was like oh I'll do it Saturday, oh I'll do it Sunday, oh I'll do it after dinner on Sunday, oh ok, I never did it. So, anxiety. [00:21:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes when you flip flop from being so tightly scheduled and then having this big open space it's hard to know how to, you don't have a lot of practice actually at managing big open space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it's easy to you know, and very tempting to let that happen. Because you too deserve some time to sleep in late, veg in front of the TV and go celebrate with friends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Part of healthy life is having some of that time. And when you don't know when you 're going to have the next chunk like that it's like binging. [00:22:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's, I mean I watched seven hours of TV, laid in bed all day on Saturday, got up, went out and did the whole thing again on Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe if normal life consisted of more weekends where you had a big open space, you wouldn't feel like you needed to like suck it all up right then. You would be able to know; well next weekend I'll have some time to loaf around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, catch up on a couple episodes of whatever and it would be easier to structure yourself. Ok, I am going to work on that paper for three hours and then do something for an hour. [00:22:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't have a lot of that kind of time because you are off and running from one thing to the next thing, to the next thing, that you have to be at.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So now I have to be like, so much in my time, and I'm like so mad at myself because I could have had all of this free time, I could have made this week less stressful. But.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you enjoy hanging out with your friends?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did, it was so fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like it was an important thing to go out. [00:23:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, mmhm. I mean I wouldn't have missed it, so I just could have balanced you know, that. I don't know. I just didn't so whatever. Nothing I can do. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't go back. Maybe that's what you needed. Maybe you needed a day to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. Hopefully I mean I don't have a, it's not gonna be an all nighter. But. I just, don't have, I just don't get out of school until ten, or nine thirty and then I won't get home until ten thirty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow that's late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so. You know I'm working and when I leave here and then after work I go right to school. In school, the last class gets out at nine thirty so. [00:24:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:24:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and, yeah the rest of the week is like that too. But oh well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe the kids will nap.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh) No they won't. Um, no, but then their naps are like three hours long, but they fly by. So. I don't know. (yawn). I did so enjoy a long weekend of not doing anything. Next weekend actually won't be too difficult because I'm house sitting for them but they're going away for the weekend, so I just have their dogs. So that will be nice. And then I'm doing that brunch on Sunday. Then I'll have four weeks left of school. [00:25:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can catch your breath.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know I can't wait. Just to not have to drive there, that's the worst part. It's not as if I was five minutes away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it's a long drive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but one of the, you know like last Wednesday I drove an hour and fifteen minutes up, my round trip is you know two and a half hours, to turn in a paper my professor wouldn't accept online. Like why? Like I printed the paper and put it in his mailbox and drove an hour and fifteen minutes home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, you know, I know I shouldn't complain about things like that. [00:26:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it just feels like a waste of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a total waste of time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I'm sure, you have actually harder things that you're dealing with in your own life, not even having to compare to some random other experience. It feels that with all the other things that you're juggling, not being able, in this day and age when most teachers do accept an online paper? It seems like to not make an exception for someone that has a really long commute...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I e-mailed him and I you know, just asked not wanting to say you know I had to leave early from work and I drive an hour and fifteen minutes each way, anyway I could you know, turn into you, and it's called like a digital mailbox. And um, he's like the assignment specifically indicates that you must drop it off in my mailbox in my office before four o'clock and blah blah blah. So. I'm like ok. [00:27:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's too bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did deliver it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was very green of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, that's what I should have said, the side I should have taken in the e-mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll do it but the environment is not thanking me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I only have to drive there eight more times. (laughter) Cuz I have classes Tuesdays and Thursdays and then one of our, you know our exams are online so I won't have to come for those two class times at all. Eight more times. One is today. It will be great. And my family already booked their flights to come to my graduation. [00:28:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That will be exciting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does graduation mean for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything. Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In addition to not having to drive. I know that much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm so excited to graduate, but terrified. And, you know and I'm looking to go to graduate school a year from next fall. So not starting in September, um, in 2013. But it's so fricking expensive that I don't know. I don't even know how anyone pays for it. [00:29:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do any programs in your area of study do uh, you know, like pay you to teach you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I've began, I've heard of that but I haven't looked into it or.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it's a little early because your timeline is.... I mean your applications won't start to be due until next January.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, til January. So but it's like, it's over a hundred thousand dollars. For two years, I don't know how. You know Kyle has a hundred and sixty thousand worth of debt right now for a four year undergrad. Uh, because we're living on student loans in our apartment too. And I was fortunate enough that my grandfather paid for my undergrad. But I mean Amherst is, um, six thousand a year? [00:30:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a better value.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I'm just so fortunate to graduate completely debt free. That having a hundred thousand dollars at twenty four and I've, and Kyle's twenty two and he has you know, he's in worse financial shape now than before he went to college. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you think of debt, there's different kinds of debt. And having school debt or college debt is looked at much much differently by any kind of credit institution than having any kind of credit card debt. The interest rates are much lower and they're much more flexible on how you pay it back. And in the future when you go to apply for mortgages and things like that down the road, it's not looked at in the same way. It's not a bad thing to invest in your education. And you were fortunate you know to get the deal for instate tuition and having your grandparents pay. It doesn't ruin in the same way that having you know a hundred thousand dollars of debt for something else would prevent you from being able to do things. [00:32:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just still seems like that's so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a big number absolutely. And it's daunting to think about how do you pay that back and how do you carry that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he went and met with a financial counselor person, you're required to before you graduate and it's deferred for six months. But starting in December, it was twelve thousand dollars a month to pay off the debt in twelve years. Twelve hundred dollars a month would be our entire rent you know. I don't know why I'm stressing about this, he does not think about this at all and I am so stressed out about it. [00:33:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well for him it's been sort of part of the picture, he knew it was coming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. I don't know. I mean millions of other college students have done it, so I guess we can to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it is daunting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know, I just, I'll be the first person in my family to graduate from college.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations. That's a big accomplishment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm, so. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet your mom's really proud.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah she is. My sister went to college but she didn't graduate and my brother never went. Yeah, I couldn't imagine if I went to graduate school, I wouldn't even know what to do. But it's a thing, it's that doing it on my own. Cuz you know, they have. You know. [00:34:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not having anyone to help you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's you know stressful and there's a whole other set of tests I have to take, and the GRE's. Which I haven't even signed up for. But I'm not behind if I'm not going to start until next year. Um, so. I'll just do it and, how people normally do it in two years?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's normal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they call it a two year program but I mean it's not uncommon to do it in three or four. Right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really depends, there's so many different programs depending on what your focus is an whether you go to school full time or part time, there's not necessarily a better way to do it, it's really what fits for your life, and what's going to make you feel most comfortable. You know? Waiting a year, waiting two years. Waiting long and being able to do it faster? Because you could do it you know full time? Or starting sooner and doing part time classes and then being able to work and not feel as completely overwhelmed as you sometimes schedule yourself to be.</p>

<p>You know, I think, taking time to finish school. And then really look at well, what are the different types of programs? Are there some programs that offer more assistance than others because that may be a big deal for you. Are there some programs that are more flexible in their program of study you know. Some programs are set up that everyone does it full time and that's just it. And some programs have more flexibility you know, offering classes in different semesters. You know, giving yourself time to research all of that. [00:36:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have to meet with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also giving yourself time to work a little bit in the field, maybe find a mentor. Especially because you are the first person in your family to go through this. Finding somebody you know, wherever you end up working that has maybe done this, has gone through a master's program or whatever you want to do and can help guide you through the process. It may be worth waiting a little bit of extra time.</p>

<p>I know when I did it; I applied right out of school and had absolutely no idea what I wanted to focus in. So then took a year of work, became a lot more clear about what area of psychology I really wanted, I knew I wanted to be a psychologist but I didn't really know what kind of practice did I want to do. Did I want to research? Do I teach? Is there a mix of that I want to do? And so I took a year to kind of figure that out for myself and then applied to completely different kinds of programs the second time around that were a much better fit for me than what I thought everybody was supposed to do. And sometimes that you know is important. [00:37:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It'd definitely help, because I have no I mean, Kim's ambition of the day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, even if you can find a program where you get more assistance, it still is an expensive ambition. So, figuring out really what you want to stick.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and just I mean it has to be worth it for me, in the end am I really going to you know make more money because of my continued education or you know, in psychology where you have to have more education you know. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it was easy for me; I couldn't do what I wanted to do without it. But, you can work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean does it really matter? I mean for me it would be more about the education than you know, having the letters at the end of my name you know. So, um. We'll see. But, I've [inaudible at 00:38:45] I see myself doing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.. Yeah and it doesn't have to be right away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the people I work for the husband has like five degrees from Yale. Like, how... how... (laughter) So. [00:39:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I wonder if a company paid for some of those. That's another thing, a lot of times a company will pay for you to get your masters, then you sort of owe them. But that would be a pretty good option for you. Some fields do that and some don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's harder and harder to find that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or they'll pay for some credits at least. That's probably more common now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be great I just gotta find one now. Um. And, so my you know my boss is meeting with um, with the, I guess he's the CEO of a design center with my resume. We were talking and she said you know would you be interested if there was like a secretarial position? And I was like yes. So I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I'm still applying you know, not for today, not for a job today but um, but, I mean I've got like three last week, I was at. So. [00:40:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If there are three jobs that are interesting and a good fit then that's a good number, plus you get to count the meeting that your boss is having as an acquisition.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because really networking and using connections like that is probably more, it gives you more of a shot at getting something than you know applying online. Which you have to do, but you're going with a whole mass of other people that are doing it and you have no idea what that first, that first pass through they do is so random. As to what they end up looking at, unfortunately that's the system now and that's what you gotta do. But I mean networking you can do and actually connecting a face to another human being is so powerful. And I think every career center would tell you that's what you have to do as much as you can. And you do the other stuff too because sometimes that's your only avenue. [00:41:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, I used to work for a law firm and when we'd be hiring, they were putting like key words into like their database system and they would get like four hundred applications for one position. And if someone didn't have like manager in their title, they would get.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just gets... it might have been a great application. Sometimes you just don't know which, did you pick the right words to put into something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's very unfortunate that that's, it's, but one of the side effects of the online world. It's so easy for people to sort information. It's so easy for people to send out applications, so many of them go out to everything. [00:42:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish I had a job already. Now that, um, I'm out of school so soon, I couldn't really start working until June anyway. Because I graduate the twelfth. And that whole, I'm taking like five days off that week because my grandparents are going to be here plus I just want the time off. Then the seventeenth myself, Kyle, my mom and my step mom are going to the islands, did I tell you this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did tell me that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't wait. So, uh we're gone for eight days so. And then that brings us to the end of March. [00:43:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: End of June.</p>

<p>CLIENT: End of may.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: End of May so I really couldn't start until June. So, um, but I mean I should still be applying anyway. Because if I don't have a job at graduation, I'll need to be here three times a week because I'll be seriously panicking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does your, [inaudible at 00:43:56] you could. I don't think you'll need it. But does your health insurance stay good until your twenty five?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll have to change because what I have now is through school. [00:44:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Usually they give you some carryover until August.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it is until August.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most of them run on an academic year so even if you've graduated the new one starts on August 1 or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to look.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah double check because your school might be different but a lot of schools run the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm covered under my step mothers plan also, so that's and the new law is you're covered under a parent until you're twenty five.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so, but insurance, as long as I've worked in the field of insurance and also been a subscriber, I still find it a little confusing. So ask.. [00:44:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, the ones through school is just much better so that's what I've been using. But yeah, I do have to look into that. Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm pretty sure that those usually last until August. But double check so you're secure and then you know whatever switching we need to do whether it's because you have a job and your own insurance or whether you switch back to using your step mothers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Um, yeah, a lot will be changing in the next...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hopefully some good transitions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I can't wait to move into my parents house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's an idea?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is still an idea, um, but it won't be happening until um, Kyle graduates if it, so I mean we couldn't just pick up and move without both having jobs and a place to live. So um, I mean I'd like to see it happen after January first you know so, and then my plan would be to go to Grad School there and then um, you know if I could finish without the.... [00:46:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Get a few years there...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that would be the end date and after that... So. Um but it's all the idea you know, so. Um, so we'd live at my parents house from August to January. Be able to save you know a ton of money you know, not paying, paying a very small amount of rent. We'd probably actually be able to swing it. But it'd just be hard for planning and finding someplace to live, you know not knowing the area at all and going out on interviews you know from Boston to... Um. [00:47:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well maybe we'll work on this.</p>

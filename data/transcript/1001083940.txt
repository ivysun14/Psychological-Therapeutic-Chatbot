<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, a little slow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A little sad I guess.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, do you want to tell me about it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well since the last time I've been here, I've been into a fight with my son and his friends.  I had to go to court with that.  He's [AGE] years old and that was a big mess.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What happened?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Some children wanted to jump him on the school bus and I went out there to talk to the parents.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the parent was not even trying to work nothing out so the children started fighting then all the sudden we started fighting.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You started fighting?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we all was fighting and then we had to go to court and they dismissed it. So, that was, it ended okay.  Then I kept my son home for about a week and a half because he was afraid to return to school.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I had to sit there and coach him back in school.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then my daughter, she's [AGE]  years old, she finished her little training education training and she returned back to [DEIDENTIFIED], took the baby with her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's gone back to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now where did you all stay in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In a [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where is she going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well she's in another part of the [DEIDENTIFIED] that didn't get water, by my sister.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh all the [DEIDENTIFIED] didn't get water? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not in, where she lives. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Forgot what they call it </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She didn't get any and she has a trailer in her yard and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She has a trailer?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah a FEMA trailer and my daughter is living in a FEMA trailer and my sister's in the house.  So she started working.  She got a decent new job with the school board.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So she's happy.  She's where she wants to be.  She said she wanted to be home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, but I was sad because she took the baby and that was my daily routine, kept me going, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Gave you something to do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Gave me something to do and kept me alert.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, my son got in trouble again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What happened?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Him and another little boy broke into the school down the street, down on [DEIDENTIFIED], just to be in the school.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he got arrested for that for Christmas.  He wasn't home for Christmas.  He was locked up in the juvenile detention for Christmas.  Got him out of that. He had to go to court this Monday for that and luckily they dismissed it again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I don't know what's going on with him.  I don't know but I think I'm ready to take him back home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you mean back home?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Back to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want to tell me about that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm feeling sad about that because, in a way, I want to go back and then again I don't.  I don't feel like going back because I hate the fact that you lost everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You have nothing to go back to and the only thing is to start over.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you still end up with nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, so my children, they want to be home.  They want to be around people they know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They want to feel free to roam around in a familiar environment.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With their friends and all of that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Well you can understand that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can understand that but with me, they were always feeling like I was sunken in a hole in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I was glad to get out of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wait a minute, you mean you were depressed there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I was depressed there too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, can you tell us about that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was depressed.  I had suffered with depression in [DEIDENTIFIED] for the last ten years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What kind of treatment did you try?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was on several medicines.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you remember the names of the...?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Paxil.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Zyprexa.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Zoloft.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Those were the ones that I tried and I was on Prolixin, that was the last medication I took before coming here. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did any of them, were they of any help to you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The only one that I didn't have a bad side effect with was the Prolixin shots once a month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Once a month.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That worked pretty good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That worked but I gained so much weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How much weight did you gain?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I was wearing a size 10-12 before I started getting treatment for depression and now I'm like 280 something pounds.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh my God, you gained a lot of weight.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've gained a lot of weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, we'll have to take note of that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My eating habits, but now I don't really have an appetite.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, before I, when I was on other medications, I would constantly eat.  I would eat every day all day long.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I stopped exercising. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which medicine did that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I want to say the Zyprexa because I didn't know how to take...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay dear, I'm sorry about that interruption.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I stopped exercising.  I used to be very active but after the depression I got so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me ask you, active doing what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did you do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Everything, I was, my children were younger, we did everything.  We did baseball in the park, they did the school activities, the PTA, the church every Sunday, working in the church with the youth, exercising, I had an exercise routine, I would go to the gym with my sisters. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My sister teach exercise, I used to take classes with her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, your sister teach exercise?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you a good dancer?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I used to be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You used to be a good dancer.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I used to be a good dancer.  My sister teach dance and all that and we went, I even danced with [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You did.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My sister did.  In the summertime we would go, in the summer we would take classes with them but I lost interest in all, doing all that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I used to take walks in my neighborhood and I just gave up on everything.  It looked like everything was so negative and fighting against me.  My sisters want to commit me in the hospital.  Every time I looked around I was going to the hospital and it wasn't helping it because I kept telling them the medicine was making me worse. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It wasn't making me better.  I didn't feel good on it.  So instead of them trying to help me find medicine or a doctor that could help me, they just kept admitting to the hospital.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which really broke my spirit.  It really made me, you know, I got to the point where I had to make myself fight back, you know, so I could take control of my life again and let them leave me alone.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, that meant moving away from them and being on my own when I didn't have nothing but I was able to provide a roof over my child's head.  And you know, we didn't have nothing but we had our little house and that made the difference.  But the thought about getting back to work and feeling like getting up every day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Putting on the face, I couldn't do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was so hard for me.  I would get sick thinking about it.  So I just said well maybe I wasn't ready, you know.   One doctor told me that he thought I was disorganized schizophrenic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which I didn't know what it meant but I know my life wasn't in order, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That part makes sense.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't take care of my house like I used to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I used to keep a clean house, every week and I had my routine, washing and all that, keeping house.  When my children got old enough to start helping with doing things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They kind of complicated things for me.  I didn't know how to fit them in my routine.  I was so used to being in control.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of doing everything and I didn't, I backed away from the church because I didn't, I wasn't happy doing that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you get confused or what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just wasn't...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You didn't get any pleasure out of it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't get any pleasure out of it and even though I felt I was doing it for the right reasons, it wasn't enough.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was like always finding wrong with something I would do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have a lot of preachers in your family?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, as a matter of fact, my family consists of eight sisters and a brother, and I'm the youngest of ten and they all have college educations.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Lawyers, doctors, all of that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Successful people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're successful but there too, I have one sister that raised me after my mama passed.  I was like in the sixth grade, I guess 12 years old and my daddy was living but my sister took me into her house with her marriage and her two children and she raised me.  And she is the one that I have the most problems with.  She gave me so many problems from the time I was suffering with the depression.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What kind of problems?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well when I told her I was seeing a psychiatrist because I felt like I was out of control and I felt a deep depression.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I brought her to the doctor's office with me once.  He told her if [PATIENT NAME] acts up, commit her.  I just couldn't take it no more.  I didn't like the doctor.  I thought he was wrong for that.  I told him I was having problems with that sister and he just gave her...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Authority.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  He gave her more authority to do what she was doing wrong.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To lower it over you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and she was you know, she always said I'm going to help you, I'm going to help you but she...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, she'd stick you in the hospital.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She abused me. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Abused you how?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because she would put me in the hospital. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, stick you in the hospital.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, call the police in the middle of the night while I'm asleep and I'm getting taken out of bed.  Yeah, getting taken out of the house, my children watching it, and it was awful, you know, I just...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That was embarrassing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, it was and they kept doing it over and over, so one time, like when I told him I was having problems with my sister, he told me to commit her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wait, he told you to commit your sister?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I was having problems with her.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, and I couldn't understand his rationale for that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So when I got tired of her doing it to me, I used it against her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did you do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I went and got the commitment papers on her but I didn't hide them, I hit him with it.  I gave it to him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wait a minute, you committed your sister?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I gave her the papers and I called the police and I told her, I said look the police is on the way to get you, if you don't leave the house you're gone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She didn't believe you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She had the paper, she knew they were coming.  She got up and left and never came back.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh no. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But see, she was taking care of my daddy too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That is interesting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that was my way of fighting her off of me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I said, I'm going to make you feel afraid and the fear that you're trying to put in me, I'm going to put it back in you and see if you like that feeling.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Turn the tables.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah because I was like, I couldn't ration with her because she wasn't hearing nothing I said. She just kept doing it.  I couldn't understand why she wanted to hurt me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, she kept saying I'm trying to help you but she thought she could make me happy and get up and do the things she was used to seeing me doing by doing this but it tore me, it's breaking me down, it's not helping me.  I mean you're doing this in front of my children, all my friends, everybody knows what you're doing to me.  They don't understand it because they don't see what you see.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You [INAUDIBLE], you see</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She was telling lies on me and I was just, you know, I just couldn't stop it, it wouldn't stop.  You know, but it's strange I want to tell you this...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, let me tell you this now, was she a church woman? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A big church woman</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, yes.  Every Sunday, all day, all night. Yes, yes, all day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All day and all night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She told the psychiatrist that he wasn't a spiritual man and he couldn't help me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did the psychiatrist say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He told her he didn't know nothing about what she was talking about and then he asked her what was on top of her head.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What was on top of her head?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm asking you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She told him a tablecloth and he said, now you see what I'm talking about [PATIENT NAME] and I was like no but both of you all sound crazy talking about right now.  You ask her what's on top of her head, and she answering that, telling you a tablecloth, you know, and I thought, I said well the only thing I see she's saying that, you know, the Baptist church the women wears cloths over their head.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe that's what she meant by that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, but I just couldn't and she, everybody said my other sister said, well, [PATIENT NAME], [NAME OTHER] is mama.  [NAME OTHER] is not my mama, she's my sister.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Older sister.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's my older sister, you know, and I don't like the fact that every time I come to her house, she expects me to clean it.  Always clean up, clean up, clean up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> After the [DEIDENTIFIED] the lights was out. She told me vacuum the floor, I said you vacuum the floor, if you think you can.  She said well I'll do it.  I said well let me see you.  It didn't really dawn on her electric was off.  She couldn't vacuum.  She just wanted to make me clean.  Everything is clean [INAUDIBLE] every time I go inside her house, it was how you going to come into my house and not clean it up, you know, because I'm not no cleaning, I'm not no maid.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Stop expecting that of me.  I'm not going to give it to you, you know, I have to live in my own house, I have my own life and when she came to my house and she was just [INAUDIBLE] about everything.  My children was too wild.  My house, when she put me in the hospital, she got my children and her got together and cleaned the house, washed the wall and all of that.  I was like, my house didn't need cleaning like that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I'm sorry about that. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I was just, you know what, I rely on her, I relied on her and I had to pray a lot to forgive her for what she did to me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I prayed, I would wake up 2 o'clock in the morning crying and couldn't sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, from what they did to me.  And I was like, what did I ever do for them to do me that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, what brought that one?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I couldn't understand it.  I couldn't understand it then, I couldn't understand it but I had to make myself forgive her because I needed them and that was all I had.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  Well now, let me ask you, how is the medicine working?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The medicine I'm on now?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wonderful.  It helps me sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And when I wake up, I'm not dragging and tired and feeling...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So do we have a good balance now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, I'm feeling, but the thing is when I don't have it, I don't sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't know whether that's a dependency build up or it's just...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well let's just assume that we just need the medicine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's keep it like we're doing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well good seeing you.  We'll keep the medicine like we're doing and what are we doing, meeting once a month?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we were talking once a week but I wasn't able to make it because I was baby-sitting.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that's why it took me so long to come back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, but you haven't been out of your medicine have you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I've been calling the prescriptions through the drug store.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you've been calling in for it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I'm out of it now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, well we'll go ahead and get some more.  We'll keep everything just like we're doing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So my thing is I wanted to ask you, your opinion about returning back home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and to </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me ask you this, why are you all so crazy about [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because it's home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that's the only reason?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because it's home and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, Is it...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it partying, the drinking, the dancing, being up all night, is it all of that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's all, well all of that's going on, you know that, all of that going on around you but it's being home, you know, wherever you are in [DEIDENTIFIED], you're home.  You get off the bus, it's right in front of somebody door, you knock on the door, they're going to let you in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

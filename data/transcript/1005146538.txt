<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to come up a little in my chair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, too cold.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I got a decent picture of the lovely granddaughter on my Kindle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can put the pictures on the Kindle, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. You can do anything you want to do on the Kindle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it a web (unclear) too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:00:35 - 00:00:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a nice case, too.</p>

<p>(Pause: [00:00:55 - 00:01:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A reminder, I'm out next Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the following.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And then back after that though, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so we'll meet –</p>

<p>CLIENT: The 22nd or something?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah right. Yeah I think the 22nd. Gotta be back the 29th.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:02:06 - 00:02:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am not the type of person who's very computer wise. I know I should get AOL on this.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:02:34 - 00:02:39] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. You're looking for your most viewed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's no network action. That's part of the problem. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I should have (unclear) WiFi. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh you do.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:02:58 - 00:03:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She wrote, she's got my shit "guest."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Guest. Oh, oh, I got it, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's Deborah, my shit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. She's just such a good kid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you have? You have like a deal with a 4G thing on there or something? You can get some (unclear) or wireless?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. ‘Cause I went wireless in my apartment. But I should have AOL and everything (unintelligible).</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:03:44 - 00:03:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Unintelligible)</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:03:56 - 00:04:03] </p>

<p>CLIENT: You're going to have to get me one of these things so you can show me how to do it. (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got the iPad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You like that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that what you put your finger on?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's on.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:04:03 - 00:04:43] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't figure it out. But it should have the AOL on it. Where she hides these things (sings) I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The pictures or the – </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to get onto my Facebook.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Host visitor, the website. (Unintelligible) hook up here.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:05:09 - 00:05:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you might need – but you need to get on – </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can go into the like the coffee shop across the street. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: If they have a wireless?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I don't think you can – it's hard to pick up a signal in this suite. There's the one for this suite but the password is written down somewhere. It's like a long string of alphabetical letters.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Unless there's an open network. If they're closed you need a password that's all. But you have a wireless router in your apartment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it automatically plugs in the password if you've been out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And (unclear) I watched the movie last night. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: On that thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On my TV set and I can watch it on this and I can watch it on my computer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The new movies out? How did you get on? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Play Station 3. I can download any movie that's out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Currently in the theaters?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: With the Play Station 3.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even ones that are right new in the theater?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Deborah just goes online, whatever she goes on the Play Station 3 and downloads them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are they pirated or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then again I'm not sure because what an excellent picture.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Very clear, everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I says, oh yeah, I like this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does your daughter figure that stuff out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She can just use that mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Use that mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nah. I don't think she's ever going to use her (laughs) (unclear), ya know? [00:07:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean she's got the same genes as Heath.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you, ya know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't know what's with that kid. (Laughs) You know, she means well but. I tell ya, there's so many things on here. I have to stay away from (unclear).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From what? Ghost shopping?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go – there's a thing that you can shop at any store?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it goes – I want this and I want that. I have this, stay away from those.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All you got to do is press a button now. You don't even have to – </p>

<p>CLIENT: I got (unclear), ABC News. Oh yeah, all these, all the old google, huh? Facebook. I wonder if you could sit over at the place across the way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And get a signal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. What is it –? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you get home can you download it and save it to your, save it to the Kindle?</p>

<p></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm going to watch Lincoln tonight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How the heck did she find – there must be some – because it's not like you can rent it – get it off Itunes or something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She probably has some way of – </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I guess when Bennett had his Play Station 3 that's what they used to do, they used to download the movies and that's how they'd watch them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they don't have to pay anything. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but there doing – there's some pirating they must be doing, like a pirating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, it tells you right on the box when you buy it that you can download movies and – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Hey, I enjoyed it. Of course I had to tell Mary to shut up I don't know how many times. I guess you can't take Mary to a movie theater either. She'd be, her and Dolores, they both sit in a row at the very end of the theater hall and sit together because they'd be talking the whole fucking time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because they'd be like the – </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Imagine the movie they saw versus the movie that you saw? I mean in the same theater? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be a whole different movie.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dolores would be right up there at the screen talking – ‘you go girl!' I'd punch him right out, girl. Go ahead.' You should see her when she's down watching Beverly Housewives - , the Housewives of Beverly Hills. Oh yeah, she's right up there in their – ya know? Oh it's like (unintelligible). I said, ‘Deborah, from now on I don't give a shit – you and her go upstairs and watch TV.' </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tell you, you can't get a word in. Either one of them. Yesterday Mary called me so I called her back and she's telling me how she called housing – not housing – how she called for her landlord to find out if they can come out and give her like insulation for the house and all this stuff – energy savers where they change all the light bulbs and blah, blah, blah, blah. But then she called someplace else to someone and she got all the answers – how do you go about getting shoes for a diabetic person? I said, well knowing her landlady's a diabetic, I says she has to go to a foot doctor and her foot doctor has to write out a prescription for diabetic shoes. I says either he will send her to this place or he'll take the measurements in his office and then he mails away for them. She can pick them out out of a catalog. So Mary says, all right. I says, Mary are you going to be seeing me later on today? Which I knew she was coming over. She says, yeah. I says, good. Hang up the fucking phone ‘cause you're wasting my minutes. She thinks nothing of being on the phone for like 26 minutes. And of course it's eating right into my minutes because I have that, I get – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's unlimited daytime.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, unlimited. So, it really doesn't matter, but I just told her that to shut her up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just had enough. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I give a shit about her landlord's freaking problems, you know? Boy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right. Right, right. But Mary has a way of kind of talking as if, you know, you're just a kind of receptive audience, right? Like you're – </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and like I said, I don't give a shit what Mary does?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh, uh huh [yes]. Ha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So Saturday I had Mary come down and she took me to get a haircut.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah. (Laughs) What was that – like for the low, low cost of $20? Wasn't that it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For 13.95 for a haircut. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no I meant for the taxi service.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wasn't it 20 bucks that she charges?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I gave her $10 for the gas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I paid to get her haircut. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So $20.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the tip. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We went over to the mall there. I went into Radio Shack, bought myself a wireless thing to hook up the router hook up at the house. Then from there I went where I did some grocery shopping and I bought her some odds and ends like Cream of Wheat and you know, Oodles of Noodles and all that good stuff, ya know? So that was all right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You bought it for her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Then when we got home I took her out to eat. I bought two boiled lobsters for myself, because I haven't had lobster in so long. $26.99 for two lobsters and it didn't cover anything with it. No – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No potato or – </p>

<p>CLIENT: No potato or nothing. So I had a side order of French fries and onion rings. Well the first lobster had no taste to it whatsoever. I only like the tails. I'm not favored of the claws or anything. I'll take the meat out and make salad out of it, but it just was tasteless. You would have never known – if you were blindfolded you would never know you were eating lobster. That's how tasteless it was. And there was hardly any meat on it. I said to myself, did somebody eat the meat on the way coming out to my table, you know? Okay. Mary got scallops. Evidently they were good but I wouldn't have eat them because they were in the oven, gotta be fried. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they were baked or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or boiled. I don't know. But not my – fried? Yeah, okay. And then I had to bring home something for Deborah. So come dessert, Mary wanted tapioca pudding. I have always liked the grape-nut pudding "made fresh every day." One spoonful – it was sour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ha!</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, okay, send this back. Just the whole thing sucked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lousy. Lousy feed, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then I had bought two containers of onion soup to take home. I couldn't even eat it. That's how much salt was in the thing. You had to dilute it, and dilute it, and dilute it. So I was just pissed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what – they're going south on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I called and bitched. And the kid was like, ‘and your name?' I said, ‘Louise.' ‘Oh, Louise, I'm very, very sorry. I'm mail you out a gift certificate.' I says, ‘take your gift certificate and shove it up your ass.' Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Totally pissed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I said boy it really went downhill since you boys took over. It's like when I grew up there with my generation – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You worked there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know you worked there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was 21.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just turned 21. I would get done, cross over ‘cause there was no highway there and cross over and walk over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's at – where the Square is? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's right there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you were down the – </p>

<p>CLIENT: Where the shop is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And as I said, there was no 97. There were streets and you could walk over the street and down the other side. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The old prison used to be there. They used to give the electric chair.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But, yeah I was very disappointed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's wild. So you worked there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long did you work there for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not long. I think I lasted a month. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you find it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was – I mean I enjoyed it but you know, the first night I was – I only went in there to help out because they were short some waitresses. I says, ‘like I know what I'm doing there.' Ah, don't worry, he'll have everything all set for you. And I says well – I would go to the table. I didn't know V.O. was short for – it's not vodka. Whiskey?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's gin isn't it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know but I'd be getting bawled out for getting everybody's drinks all screwed up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't have any training.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So of course the guy says, well, you're making all these mistakes on the dinner. You've got to pay for them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. If it's some damn food, guess what? I'm drinking ‘em. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd be so fucking shit-faced.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh? Okay. Yeah. Did they care if you drank?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I would drink after work when we were supposed to be cleaning up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did they make you pay for the – you gotta be kidding me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, he says – ‘cause hw was my age at the (unclear), ‘Louise, you're father's going to kill me.' (Unintelligible) (Laughing) I'm driving you home.' [00:21:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was Blaine the owner or something? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Blaine was the owner's son. But he did bartending and I think he – you know, he was supposed to be the hostess with the mostest, you know. So I says, ‘okay, so. Well they wanted me to clean the slicer for the roast beef sandwiches. I says, ‘I ain't touching that.' I said, ‘you'd have my hand held on one blade and (laughing) and my other hand in the other one.' Naw, I'm clean.' (Unclear) guys walked in that room – ‘well, you don't do this, you don't do that. What the hell do you do around here?' I said, ‘I'm here to look pretty. Okay?' That didn't last long. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. What did they, let you go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just – my father said, ‘Louise's coming home drunk for some strange reason.'</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh is that right? So he pulled you out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I said yeah they told me I had to pay for my drinks that I made wrong on and of course it was all hard liquor shit, you know. Especially when I (unclear) just started liking it you know. He's kind of – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He got worried?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah he (unclear) from there. I couldn't get up the next day for Ashton Fuel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was a no-no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was he like about that? How did he react? </p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean you can't get up for work? I have a damn headache, please Dad. You know. No yelling, please? That was the end of that job. Which I didn't mind because I didn't want it in the first place. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. He just sort of farmed you out in some way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah – 7 o'clock in the morning to 5 o'clock at night, Cross the street and go over – enough was enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many days did you wait tables?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I might have did that maybe five days, six days. I don't think it was a whole week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. But you were set to work there every night or something like that? Like another job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. From like 5:30 to closing time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he didn't let you off for the days that you were working for – </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Oh no. I was just supposed to – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about that? He really rode you hard. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, ho. Yeah. Yeah let's send Louise out back. And then I started dating the bartender, Jack. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the restaurant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I think my father just wanted me out of there altogether. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Drinking and guys, huh? Didn't like either one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Take your pick. Any pick you want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did he think would happen? Twenty-one years old, working at a restaurant with a bar? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where you'll meet somebody. </p>

<p></p>

<p>CLIENT: Just turned 21. That was the drinking age. Party! (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you doing for your dad at the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was the bookkeeper.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, my usual. Bookkeeper, dispatcher, answering telephones. You know, the usual. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you start doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I was 18. Right out of high school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right out of high school. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually worked there for many years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how long did you work for him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I worked right up until Heath was due. So that was 18 until I was 25.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So some of it was when you were with Paul? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Paul hated my father.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you can say that again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My father couldn't understand why he didn't work during the winter months. I says well Dad he's a welder. Do you expect him to go out and weld when there's snow all over the beams and what have you? No Dad. Well he could get some – he could come down here and do some work. I says well he doesn't want to come down here and do some work. He did for a while. He felt he could help my brother with the oil truck in the winter. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Was he still living elsewhere part of the time or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No he was down here full time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh you meant down here as the oil company. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like, Heath, why wouldn't you want to do that? He's getting unemployment, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. So he got benefits when he wasn't welding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know my father. If you're not doing 101 things at once then forget it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did it get to be so charged between your father and Paul?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know. I mean, let's face it. We lived with my parents at the time and then when the apartment downstairs was done, you know, we were downstairs, they were upstairs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You lived with them. So Paul moved in with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you – pregnant at the time? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you get married?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When we first got married we had no place to live.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we moved in with my mother and father. And then after so many, you know, my father started to build an apartment down in the basement for me and Paul and that was that. So, yeah. Paul was around for a while with my father and when my mother decided to leave my father he took my father up away and hooked him up with this nice lady.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the next thing I know my father's staying at a hotel for the night and he wasn't staying in it alone. Oh yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was sleeping with this woman.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This woman. Oh yeah. She was all over him like a hot potato. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did he think of her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well. It was quite a change from my mother, let's just say. This one was very blond, very – there was nothing shy about her. If she wanted to get laid she'd just say, you know – ‘come on let's go screw at the motel.' ‘Goodbye, Dad, see you later, Dad.' Oh yeah. So yeah it was – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you guys got your dad hooked up with somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He had met Paul's mother and father and sister and her husband and ya know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did your dad think of all them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He didn't say much. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, rural.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And French speaking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, more or less most of them were but it's funny, his mother spoke English. Paul's father spoke English. His sisters spoke English, his brother, spoke English. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But Paul?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Paul, very – not a lot. He learned how to speak English by reading the comics, the Sunday comics there. But you understood what he was saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But French was their first language. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They'd start out in English and then the next thing I know they're all speaking French, so – one time Paul and I, we had gone out with his friends and they started speaking French and Paul says you know she understands you. And they're saying, ‘no she doesn't.' And he goes, ‘well, you'd be surprised.' Because I spoke it too after being around with them so long. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ‘Cause sometimes I would fall right into the language with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you guys – I didn't realize Paul was there when your mother left. And you and Paul kind of shepherded your father through all that time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Unclear) [00:31:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were Paul and your father getting along at that time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I never knew that Paul hated my father as much as he did. You know. But – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What the hell led to the bomb?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Something must have really ticked off Paul.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you didn't really know what it was?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Never. And like I said, if my father was still alive he would say that it was due to that the car was bombed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pink Cadillac convertible. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about that. How about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very, very, very exciting and you know you figure my father had sold property so yeah. It was fun city. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your dad was embroiled in all that in some way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Business owner. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And you know I mean – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially fuel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The guy, he owns the bar across the street, right, you know one of the streets where our electrical company was, and my father had sold him the business next door so he had the Auto Body shop and then they owned the bar across the street. The dance area was at the front and then you go down around the street and that would be the backdoor for just the bar. So yeah, you remember those things, the days very well. And when he started dating this lady, who owned the floral shop, next door was a bar where all the gangsters hung out and a couple of them got shot and when I went into labor down at the flower store one of them was going to come over and wanted to deliver my son. I said, I can see it now – oil tycoon's daughter gives birth at florist's shop – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait. So what happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, no. My father was dating this Italian girl.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that flower store still there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Unless there's a new one. Well, next to her there was a bar and that's where all the gangsters hung out. You know, there was a few shootings and what have you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was the bar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So one of the gangsters, he was also a fireman. Well he was going to come over and see if I needed – if I was ready to give birth he was going to deliver it, but I could just see the headlines.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you were ready to give birth he was going to – </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was down at the flower shop–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, and you went into labor there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he came by and said, ‘hey, I'll deliver.'</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God. What happened? What did you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, ‘Paul, take me home.' So I went home. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who gave you the ride home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Paul came and got me and I went home, I showered, got ready and I waited for the doctor's phone call and he said to come up to the hospital. The nurse asked me if I was in labor. I said no I said but the doctor wanted me to come in anyways. Well, I was only – seven minutes later I gave birth to Heath. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Seven minutes later from – </p>

<p>CLIENT: Entering the hospital. Evidently I'd been in labor all that time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The whole time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And didn't know it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She went to get me out and she goes, ‘she's already in labor! She's ready to go!' I looked up, dip de dip, and that was that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about that? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Deborah was a bitch. She didn't want to come out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She didn't. Wow, long labor. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Over 36 hours, Deborah. And then when they told me I'd have her before midnight I said, I don't think so. I says tomorrow's my birthday, I'm closing my legs now. I ain't pushing any more. I had her on my birthday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wanted to wait, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I went in on a Friday so I figured I'd have her anyways before then but then when it got so close I said, I just might as well wait for my birthday. And I did. And then I kept saying, the longest gift I ever got in my life. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The birthday gift. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The gift of a, I don't know. I saw the doctor yesterday, aggravated the piss out of me as usual. My appointment was for 11:20, I don't think I saw him until 25 after 12 and I was like a raving maniac because I'm depending on a ride. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Unclear). And I had so many things. Well, I gotta go see the heart specialist again ‘cause he's not happy with where the incision site is, almost as if it was like next to my armpit, it's like a couple of pea size I don't know what you'd call them. I thought they were from the lymph nodes. [00:37:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were worried about the lymph nodes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not that though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't think so. He says it might be part of the incision site underneath. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he doesn't know. So he put in a consult, the surgeon, to see if he can probably remove that because I'm in pain or do something, what he thinks he should do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's less – is it less the incision site and less the incision at those lumps that you reported? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Here's my incision site, here. And then the lump is like downwards a little.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And where does it hurt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right between, right before the armpit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It hurts there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where the lumps are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and all the way –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All the way up to –</p>

<p>CLIENT: But sometimes if I go to move it will like kind of catch and I don't know what it's catching on underneath my skin but something hurts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What will catch?</p>

<p>CLIENT: As I said, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something feels like it's just catching.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and it caught, it hurts. So – </p>

<p>CLIENT: Jesus. So maybe – something doesn't feel right in there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he says, well, all right, how's your backside doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, well the sore has flared up, that's gone. But the tenderness is still there. I says, and now I have pain all along the back ribcage area I says, and it goes up to the ribcage – goes from the ribcage up to the back, either way you want to look at it. So he says, well I think it's probably something to do with the muscles he thought, so he ordered me Flexeril. You take one Flexeril and you're out for the night, the day, whatever. He says these may make you a little loopy. I goes, more so than usual? He goes, well I don't know, whatever way you want to put it. He goes, take three a day. Oh I says, he really wants to put me out. So he says, are you comfortable in any particular position? I says yeah, laying on my side, but I know I can't lay down in bed all the time, I gotta get up and walk around. He says, all right. Even though you sit down, I says, yes I know, I've got to get up and circulate. He says, okay. So, I'm just not a happy camper health wise. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much of the back was – how much pain did the sore give you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The sore was causing pain because it was right in the crack there where the fracture was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they didn't position me. Every 15 minutes they're supposed to roll you. Say if you were on your right side, 15 minutes on your right side and then 15 minutes on your left side and then 15 minutes back on your right side and they're supposed to rotate you every 15 minutes. Not once did they come in and help me move from one side back to the other side. I said, well that's how I got the sore. Yeah?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the sore was painful. Is it just a very strong irritant? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Against clothes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I said, okay, what should we do next? This leg still buckles. I says I may as well just have the leg (unclear). [00:42:23] I get around better (laughs) (unclear). Mary's going – will you shut up! I said well I'm telling the truth and call me stumpy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have a few minutes. What's the story with Mark? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh him. I don't know what's with Mark lately. He did the same thing last week. He – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well last week you told me he said well this is – I don't know now, he said something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I saw him Monday and Tuesday and then I didn't see him Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday but he showed up Monday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He showed up this past Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then –</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I saw him Monday. I saw him Tuesday. We spent the whole afternoon together in bed, you know, that was fun. Didn't hear from him Wednesday. Didn't hear from him Thursday and I probably won't hear from him today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is his schedule changing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No he hasn't started work at the new place yet. He's going to be working over here and I don't know. I know he - Wednesday Keisha has her appointment and he takes her to that. Yesterday she had an appointment again so he takes her to that. So I called them and he said he was at the doctor's, he'd call me back. So he called me back just to say, I'm here with Keisha and we're at the doctor's. And I said, okay, fine. So he hung up. He says, oh, I'll call you later. Nothing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. Huh! </p>

<p>CLIENT: So Deborah says, I don't give a shit if you call or not, she says, I miss Jack – his dog. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Something's cooking. Something's changing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, you don't know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He's getting back into his silent mode here. Not talking to me about what's going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that really – </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well something that sounds like it's an outgrowth of all that stuff around pills and asking for the Vicodan, the beer. You're kind of putting your foot down with him, how he reacts to that. You know, such complicated business that this is somehow, I mean who knows what he's actually doing on those days or what the story is, but it seems like it's a response to that kind of you putting your foot down with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very complicated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Did you see Peter?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he came by Tuesday. Oh my God has he changed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought it was my father crossing the fucking parking lot, that's how much he's aged. He had his hair shaved and it's like you know how it's like you go in the service and you get it really crew cut, well it's all gray. He's gained humungous weight, wears suspenders to hold his pants up. I told him he looked too old to be dating me. I told him (unclear) my boyfriend. (Unintelligible) got her started, even she's dating smokies. I says yeah, well wait til you see Deborah's girlfriend, not only is she a lesbian but she's black, too. ‘Jesus H. Christ, don't tell me that. You and those smokies. You're the one that started that.' I says well what can I say. He asked me what I was doing earlier. I says, getting laid. ‘Don't tell me by a smokie.' I says, yep. And I (unclear) my girlfriend's daughter came over that afternoon and Mark was there and she's going – after she left she called me up from her cell phone and she's going, ‘not bad, not bad at all.' And I says, yeah, I know. (Sings). You know how that goes. I'm just a trend setter. You know, I can't help it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trend setter among the daughter and the granddaughter. Okay, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm trying to fix Fran up now. (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh! Now that would be a miracle in race relations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh shit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be a miracle of race relations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, have a good week off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. I will see you in, on the 29th. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Bye Louise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know you'll miss me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles) Okay.</p>

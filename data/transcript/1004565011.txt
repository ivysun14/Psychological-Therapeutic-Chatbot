<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I have something scheduled for Friday. Does that work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. For 12:30?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's what we said. That is what I have as what we said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As our weekly, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That works for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me just write it down though. Okay. So a lot has gone on since the last time we met. First of all, I left here two weeks ago today, Monday, and I guess I went home kind of being frustrated that I didn't really know how to talk to Franklin about the things that I wanted to talk to him about. So we got home and I'm kind of irritated and I was just being a little pissy and stomping around a little bit. I put on my workout clothes and I was somehow irritated at him that he was starting his workout or something. I don't really know. I think I was just bothered, just having talked about all that stuff and not really knowing how to verbalize it, wanting to and being irritated. I don't know. He was acting like everything was normal. So this resulted in me getting frustrated and kicking a chair that I thought —it's stupid — I act out when I'm angry sometimes and it's never a good idea. I kicked a chair, an upholstered chair, and I somehow thought that my foot would bounce off of it and it was really hard, I kicked it really hard and my toe immediately started filling up with blood and was throbbing, killing. I ended up screaming and Franklin comes in. He's helping me with my toe and I was like, "I kicked it and I was stupid. I don't know why I was so frustrated." I kind of blamed it on myself — well, no — I said I was frustrated with myself for not being able to work out. [00:02:14] It was medium true, but definitely not 100 percent, but I didn't really know how to say that. Anyway, we're sitting on the bed and he's helping me ice it. We had to put a hole in it to drain this blood so I don't risk it falling off. So as we're doing this he says to me, "I think we should try something," and I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "I think you know what I'm going to say," and I was like, "Well, just say it." And he said, "I think that we should try being friends," and I said, "Okay. What do you mean?" And he starts to go into this thing about how we always fight and we haven't really been acting like our relationship should be, which is all true, and that he wants to try to be friends so we can do more of our own stuff, but still living in the same living situation. The kicker is that we must change our relationship status on Facebook to "It's Complicated". I said, "Well, what does that have to do with it?" and he said, "I'm tired of living a lie that everybody thinks that we have this perfect relationship and behind closed doors we have all these issues," and I was like, "Who doesn't have issues behind closed doors?" "Everybody thinks we're perfect," and I was like, "Okay, but 'It's Complicated' is like . . . " It's so stupid. It's just dumb. [00:03:48] So I said to him, "Well, who cares what people think or don't think or know or don't know or whatever?" and he tells me, "Exactly. You shouldn't care. Why do you care what people think. I want you to change it first." At this point I still didn't know what to say to him and he'd given me another 30-minute monologue of all this stuff that's wrong with me and how I need to work on all this stuff personally and in the meantime he's going to work on his acting and his photography, totally inconsequential to our relationship or personal issues. I was so tired of it I was like, "Whatever. Fine." I was leaving in two days. I was pissed I hurt my toe. I was going to the work conference. I had to walk around like "What the f**k?" you know? So we go in and change our relationship status. One of my things was, "Okay, fine. If you really need to change our relationship status on Facebook then at least remove the f**king post." A thousand people on Facebook. Everybody knows us that are mutual friends. I don't really want this big post that "Went from 'In A Relationship' to 'It's Complicated.'" Yeah, it's stupid but to the same extent I don't really need everybody to be like, "What happened? Blah, blah, blah." So we do that. Okay. Fine.</p>

<p>[00:05:12] I'm leaving on Wednesday morning. We leave. We say goodbye. He's been acting normal these last couple of days before I leave, which I'm confused about, so it's kind of putting me in a gray area. So I go to him saying I have my work trip and I'm going to try to enjoy this new city then he's coming to join me on Friday and we'll just try to make the best of it. Fine. So, of course, I have butterflies in my stomach the whole time that I'm in this trip waiting for him to come. I don't know exactly what's going on and all this stuff is going through my head. He comes and, I guess, he's always making friends on Facebook with people from other places. I guess he had been talking to some girl about photography or acting and she was in the city where my conference was, living with her cousin, working. He wanted to meet up with her to do some acting classes. I was like, "Fine. Whatever. That's fine, but I want to see all this tourist stuff. I know you've been here before and seen a lot of the tourist stuff, but I haven't." [00:06:03] What ended up happening on the trip is that we just basically fought the entire time. I was irritated that he wanted to hang out with this girl and her f**king loser . . . I'm sorry. You can go sit at somebody's house and somebody's stinky apartment and smoke pot or f**king talk — whatever you want. If we're in a place together that we haven't been I think it's more enjoyable to be doing that somewhere else. Not to mention that my foot was all f**ked up. I couldn't wear shoes. I still can't even put my foot in a shoe because it hurts too much so I'm wearing sandals, which aren't meant for walking, especially there. I met up with him after the conference finished on Saturday. I was being kind of bitchy and pissy. I recognized that I was being bitchy and pissy. I apologized to him for being bitchy and pissy. [00:07:03] He was like, "Well, yeah. I know. I don't know why you're acting like that. I just was telling her how awesome you are." I was like, "I understand. I'm sorry." And then he kind of was pushing it and I was like, "Okay. I recognized it. I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me." So fine. Spent the rest of the day walking around. We walked around an area window shopping. My foot is really hurting me at this point, but we kept going and going. We ended up at the place where she's staying, this girl. Finally I'm off my foot so I don't really care. Then our plan was to go meet my friend, who has just moved there recently. He used to work at the Center and he just moved there recently. I had already seen him my first or second night we went out to dinner and that was really nice. He was throwing a little surprise thing for his boyfriend, Clint, at a wine bar. So we went to meet up with them and that was really nice. My foot was really hurting but whatever. We went. We ate. We drank some wine. He then wants to go meet up with his friends or — whatever — this girl and her friends at a club to dance. Obviously I wasn't trying to dance, but I wasn't going to say "no". I was happy to go as long as I could put my foot up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just to be clear this is Franklin [00:08:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Franklin, sorry. Yes. Jeremy. No, no. We were going to go there then. I was happy to do that. I wasn't complaining. I wasn't bitchy. Like you want to dance? Enjoy. I'm going to sit there and that's fine. Then we're in the wine bar and somehow I stumbled or - I don't even know — but I kicked a shoe, restubbing the toe that was already hurt and it starts bleeding. I go and baby it and I'm okay like, "Fine. Let's still go to this thing if you still want to go." Part of me is thinking a good boyfriend would be like, "Ehh, whatever." Let's just call it a night," but he didn't and that was it. So we get to this place. It's a $20 cover. It's all Asians, awful music, packed on every wall. His friend hadn't called him to tell him that when she got there. Nothing. I'm like, "I really don't want to go in there. My toe. The $20. The bad music. There's nowhere to sit. I don't want it to get stepped on." All this stuff. He got really annoyed at me for repeating over and over why I didn't want to go in. He was like, "Just don't talk to me. Just don't talk to me." He still wanted to go out. I really at this point just wanted to go back to the hotel, so we just go back to the hotel. I put my foot up with ice. We were in a room with two double beds, so that night I did sleep in a different bed because of my toe. I was keeping it up. So then we wake up in the morning and he's kind of annoyed with me because he feels like I'm trying to pack all this stuff in and I don't really care what he wants to do and I just want to do all this stuff and I'm not really listening to what he wants to do and all this stuff. I'm like, "I don't really care. I just want to see some tourist stuff. We can work your time in. To be perfectly honest, did you come here to see this person? I understand that you like hanging out with people that live in distant cities. I don't understand." I even asked him that. And he's like, "Are you retarded? Of course I didn't come here to see her." So I'm like, "Okay. So what's the big f**king deal?" [00:10:08]</p>

<p>So we decide to walk around in the morning. We walked to this building and the Wharf, and my foot was already hurting. We're arguing. We're at each other's throats about everything. I was irritated because I wanted to eat at the Ferry Building. He didn't like anything there so we decided to go to Fisherman's Wharf. I had told him that everything is more expensive there. It was more expensive there. We ended up paying $50 for clam chowder and crappy pizza. I just wasn't able to make the most of it. I was irritated. I was frustrated that we weren't getting along and I was just irritated all around. So, yes, I was being a little bit bitchy. We started to have a conversation about it. Basically, he's telling me that I always act like the bitch. I'm not social. All this stuff that I've heard all before basically. I kind of shut down and am like fine, whatever. So we're going to things. There's a carnival going on, a Caribbean festival. His friends are there so we decided to go meet them. [00:11:05] Yes my foot hurt already, but I was like whatever, fine. So we walk around with them. That was fine. We had a nice time. Honestly, when we met up with them it seemed like he was so much happier, having so much more fun with them than he was with me. Granted, we were arguing. It still stung. Then they proposed to go to somebody's house. Now I didn't ask how far it was. Franklin didn't ask how far it was. I wasn't going to stick my neck out and be like, "Well, how far is it? Where is it?" because he's already annoyed at me. So we end up walking for days. I don't even understand why we walked so far from a f**king neighborhood to the next — and I'm in these shoes that I've been wearing all days. It was just ridiculous. And then he's looking at me like, "Can you pick up the pace? I think you're going more slowly than you need to. I don't think you're walking right because I think you should be walking at some sort of a rhythm because I think that will make your foot feel better. I think you're only making it feel worse. They're walking slow to keep up with you but you could try to keep up a little bit." Like really? I feel like, as the man, he should have said to these people, "My girlfriend's foot is really hurting. Where are you going? We'll meet you there in a taxi," or whatever. Or like, "Maybe we'll meet up with you later. We'll go back and change. She wants to change her shoes." Whatever. I feel like as the man, and not only as the man but the person who wants to hang out with these people and schlep all over the f**king world, that he should have said that, right? So when I kind of said that to him I was like, "You know, I wish you would have said something." He said, "You have a mouth." It was like, "I know, but these are your friends. This is what you wanted to do," and he said, "Well, whatever. We're doing this together." It was so unpleasant. [00:12:45]</p>

<p>So we end up getting to the destination, which was a grocery store. They want to buy groceries to have a barbeque at his house, which is another 20-minute bus ride from wherever the f**k we are. I had told Jeremy that I would meet him and Clint to go see fireworks. There was supposed to be fireworks. I had also wanted to go to the hotel before to rest a little and change shoes. This turned into a big fight. We ended up saying we would go, then we won't go, then we'd go, then we won't go, and I ended up saying you know I really want to go back to the thing. "Sorry guys. Have a good night." And to be perfectly honest, I was coming off a little bitchy but I really didn't care. I'm sorry. This is not a lifelong friend. This is some girl you met on Facebook two months ago. You have mutual friends who do the same bullshit. I'm sorry. I care more about myself and our time together right now. He, on the train, is telling me about how I'm selfish and I don't listen to him, I only think about myself, and I don't think about him in any of my plans. At this point I can't even tell what's true or not and I can't even form words, because I'm so run down by all this shit already. So we get back to the hotel and on the way back to the hotel we're having this huge argument as we're walking and I end up bringing up how, "I'm sorry. I've just been worried about this whole thing and I didn't know what was going on with you and me. I don't know what you meant by 'friends' and I don't know what the f**k is going on. It really hurt me that you wanted to change your status to 'It's Complicated'. We're not teenagers. I don't understand." He said, "Well, now it's 'Single'." I was like, "All right. You just proved my point. You're 16." [00:14:23]</p>

<p>So we get in the hotel room and we fight more. It ends up with me crying, him saying that I'm selfish and negative, I won't choose to be happy and I act bitchy. He doesn't care about this relationship, again saying that he is falling out of love with me because of my personality. It ends up with me crying so browbeaten that I'm just like, "Oh my God, you're right. How did you put up with me for so long? You're right. I am. I'm a bad person. Oh my God. I can't believe it." I don't know if it was because I actually believed it or because I was so irritated and sick of him spitting these accusations at me and me really having no defense and not knowing what to say. This is on, obviously, the tail of the conversation that we had before I left, which is me saying I have all these things but I don't' know how to express them. It just made it even worse. So I said to him, "So I guess we've decided to break up?" I don't even know how that conversation ended. It ended, yeah, I guess it ended with breaking up. Like, "You need to work on yourself." So I said, "Okay, fine. We have a night and a full day left here so, please, I'd really, really like to enjoy it with you. Let's just pack it in our suitcase and bring it home." So I said, "Okay, so what would you like to do?" Even though, I'm sorry, it wasn't my plans the whole time. We walked around with his f**king friend the whole day. We went to see my friend for two hours. We went to go find his friends at a club that didn't work out. The next day we spent a couple of hours by ourselves and then we met up with them with you. Pack it in our suitcase and bring it home. So okay. So I said, "What would you like to do?" because, you know, I'm so selfish that I've been doing all my plans the whole time. Even though, I'm sorry, it wasn't my plans the whole time. We walked around with his f**king friend the whole day. We went to see my friends for two hours. We went to find his friends at a club that didn't work out. The next day we spent a couple of hours by ourselves and then we met up with them for the rest of the f**king day. Sorry — that seems pretty even to me. If not, more "you" shit. So he said, "I want to go back to the house where they're having a barbeque." I said, "Okay, fine," so we take a cab there. It's all the way on the other side of town. We take a cab there. I just get over it. We chill for a while. We go to a bar, have a bite to eat, then we take a cab home. Fine. [00:16:32]</p>

<p>The next morning we wake up and we are doing tourist stuff. We go to town. We did so much walking. So we're in town where it's a lot of hills. We decide to pull off somewhere. We got some steamed pork bun things and we were going to have a little snack. I'm in my stupid sandals that are slippery. I slip on a piece of f**king lettuce or something. I don't even know - something in the street. I slip and fall pretty gracefully, but still rip my pants and skin my knee. On the same leg that I already have my injury and I was going like, "Oh, that sucks," but I wasn't crying. I was fine. I was like okay, whatever. I washed it off. He was like, "Oh my God. Are you okay?" and then he proceeds to be like, "You need to be more careful and watch where you're going. You know you have an injury." "What, Franklin? It was a piece of lettuce." "Well, I know. I'm not trying to say. I'm just saying be more careful." Okay, fine. So then we walked another million miles. It was a really stupid place to walk to our next destination because it was really super duper far, but we did it. Then we got on a bus and we went to the field where you can see the bridge. Took some pictures. Walked around a little more at Museum of the Arts. Took some more pictures and then decided to go back to the hotel where we've stored our luggage. Then we decided to go back to the area of the hotel. His flight is at 10:00, so then we decide to get drinks before dinner. [00:17:57] I'm like, "Well, we should talk a little bit about what's going on." Once again, it just turns into him being really defensive, speaking to me all huffy-puffy. Not talking normally. I'm trying to ask him to talk normally. I was like, "Honestly, Franklin, I don't really know what this whole 'being friends and still living together' thing is. I don't know if it will work for me. It puts a lot of pressure on me." But, again, it's the same shit with him telling me what I need to work on and why I'm looking at it the wrong way. "I'm willing to make this work if you'll just choose to be happy." Again, I don't even know what that statement really means. It ends with, "I'll move into the other bedroom. Should we give it a time limit of how long it takes me to be a better person or whatever?" He was like, "We'll check in in two months and see if it's something that can be worked on or not." So we come to this decision. Fifteen minutes later he's like, "I don't like that. I just wish we could go with my original plan. I don't want to sleep in a different bed as you." At this point, again, I'm so sick of talking about it in f**king circles that I was like, "Okay. Fine. Whatever." So we have dinner, he gets on the plane and he goes home. [00:19:13] Then I'm talking to him on Thursday when I get back to work. I get back on Wednesday morning and take the day off, see him that night, and we get pizza. Thursday I'm talking to him and I was like, "Listen, what is exactly going on with us?" He was like, "I don't know, but this is too hard already. I feel like we need to talk this through and see if we can figure it out or go our separate ways." And he's right, obviously. What that's left me now is the dilemma of how do I talk to him and I don't know how. He's acting like everything is normal. He's acting all lovey-dovey, but all this shit has done is make me feel more distant and pull away from him a bit. Considering all this stuff that I put to the side before, it's all coming to the forefront. Some of my friends have said maybe I should write him a letter and have him read it because it's very hard to talk to him and not trip up on my words because of the facial expressions he's making or he interrupts me. Some of my other friends have said, like Jeremy has said, "I really want this to work out for you guys. Obviously you guys really love each other but, to the same extent, you have to be good to yourself. If Clint ever called me an asshole in a fight — no thanks — who does that? Maybe you just need to sit him down and say, 'I love you, but I need you to just not talk for a minute and let me speak.'" Jeremy's biggest thing was just be true to yourself, be true to yourself, be true to yourself, which is obviously right. Then, of course, a lot of my friends are saying other things. My friend, Amanda, has kept comparing the issues I've been bring up about Franklin to her own issue that she has. I was like, "Wow, people put up with different things and can tolerate different things." But then once I told her about this new thing with the "Complicated" status, she was kind of like, "No, Trina, I was sticking up for him but this is ridiculous. He can't do this to you." She feels like he's taking advantage of me because he's comfortable living in the apartment and he doesn't want to think about making any changes.</p>

<p>Of course, everybody else is saying the other thing I have to think about is why would he want his relationship status changed unless he wanted other women that are on Facebook to see and give him the attention? Like what's going on? Free up more room for conversation. To be perfectly honest, that part of it is inconsequential to me. If that was his motive, the "It's Complicated," then that was his motive. I'm not going to put that on the table because I'm not as concerned about that as I am about our actual issues that we have. Of course, I'm nervous to talk to him because I don't really know how to frame it and I end up always tripping over my words. [00:21:59] The bottom line is I don't want to be with somebody who every conversation that we have about issues that we're having turns around on me and doesn't leave anything for him to work on, on himself. I guess part of me is nervous for a couple of different reasons. Part of me is nervous that he'll have the same reaction as always and that either I'll get all twisted up in that and let it slide or that he does have the same reaction and I'm like, "That's it. I'm done. I can't take anymore." Then I guess there's another little part of me that's nervous that he will actually finally recognize it and want to work on it. Then comes the hard part of putting in the work. I guess that's the best-case scenario. I just don't know how confident I am that he's going to be able to recognize it. He has issues. Also, I'm not confident that I'm going to be able to verbalize it in the way that it needs to be said. Just a lot of stuff all at once. [00:23:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot of stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And the trip was definitely a fail. It was just not good. It was not pleasant. Gain, he's just kind of acting like things are normal now, like being so super duper sweet, lovey dovey. I don't want that to make me hesitate to have the conversation that's hard because what will end up happening if I don't have the conversation is we will get in a fight about something and the same shit will happen again. I know it. I need to talk to him either way. I just don't know how to have the conversation. (chuckles) That's what I've been stressing about. 00:24:10</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it sounds to me as though one thing you seem to want from me is my judgment about various things he has done and ways he has acted towards you. In part because it seems your own judgment of it vacillated. It feels very much one way in the moment and another way in retrospect. It sounds to me as though you have this idea that I might be able to give you some opinion as to how it actually is or how he's been and is this reasonable of him? Is this fair? Isn't it fair? Is he being ridiculous? If so, how ridiculous? Stuff like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. A little bit. Yeah. 00:25:51</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds to me that you are wanting — I don't have any problem with you wanting it because that's fine, of course — but I think it's reflective of the problem you are having with him in that, in this case, you are looking to me to sort of be the arbiter somewhat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What is "arbiter"? Like mediator?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. More like the person with the judgment about what is going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe a little bit. Maybe also I just want to make sure that I'm not all those things or something. Like I'm not this selfish, negative, bitchy person, which I don't think I am. I think ultimately I guess . . . 00:27:22</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder why your confidence about that is at a low ebb.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think because of these conversations that I have with him. I think because when I try to have a conversation and look at things pragmatically and what's really going on here and why are we having these issues, it always seems to be my issue according to him. It does make me wane in my confidence about what of that is true and what do I take from that and apply to my real life? What do I say is, whether subconsciously or consciously, mentally and emotionally abusive? So maybe I'm not looking for a judgment call as much as maybe just some guidance on how I might approach this without risking the same kind of conversation, which is obviously a hard thing to . . . 00:28:28</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what I'm saying is I think that an important part of why you're having trouble in these conversations with him is your confidence in your point of view - to the extent that you sort of hand over to him a legitimacy or authority to tell you how things are, especially in the moment. I guess I see you sort of doing a little bit of the same thing with me, which I why I'm reluctant to give you a straight answer, which I'm clearly not doing. (both chuckle) Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. 00:29:28</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me that were I to simply say "Okay, here's what's going on. Here's my take on what's going on. Here are the three things you can do about it. Here are your options. Here's what I think you should try with him," then you're in a sort of — obviously not the same — but, in this regard, sort of the same situation with him. You sit down with him and he tells you how it is. And, at least in that moment, you believe it and react as though he's right. Later you look at it quite differently, but then you're stuck, not knowing quite what is what.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. 00:30:24</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somewhere in there must be the idea that kind of why you'd invest me with this sort of insight or judgment or something. In other words, I'm wondering why you do this with him. How is it that he's the one in the moment that gets to make the call about this. For example, there are clearly other things in your relationship that you feel much more sure of yourself about. For example, your finances. If he came to you and, in fact he has come to you as you describe to me, with plans about, "Well, I'm going to try this and do this and save the money and we can work it out like this." It's clear from the way you talk that you're very confident about your view of how things work financially and where things are at and what he's likely able to be responsible about and not, and how to handle that with him. You don't all of a sudden say, "Well, geez, maybe he can travel around the world all the time the way he says he can and work five hours a week and grow and flourish." You're really confident about that. But when he comes to you and says that you're selfish and you're this, that and the other thing, it's a totally different ballgame. There's something very different going on with you there where, in that arena, you sort of grant him the authority. [00:32:24] I'm not saying you should be dismissive of him. I'm just saying your confidence is much less with that than with — I just picked the money stuff because it was something you had told me about in which you're confident, I know. So something is going on there. That's what I'm trying to figure out. It does feel, like I say, as though you do some echo of what you're doing with him when you're with me, looking to me to sort of make the call one way or another about how off the deep end he's been or not. Also, relatedly then, how you should take this up with him. 00:33:01</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I think a lot of that has to do with, in terms of the "in the moment" stuff with him, it's just hard to talk to somebody about something when they're just so defensive, animated and up in arms about stuff and not really able to talk normally. Even when I say, "It's okay. We can just talk about this. Don't feel upset or anything. I'm not upset." This is how I'm talking. This is talking. It's really difficult to talk to somebody like that and so I think that I kind of revert to a lower confidence time in my life maybe. Maybe in high school with other relationships or something like that where I kind of like, rather than keep fighting to get a word in edgewise and then be blamed for interrupting, just shut up and take it and then figure out how to deal with it later. I think that's what I've always done and now here I am. 00:33:59</p>

<p>I think another part of it is also being a little bit scared that maybe what I actually have to say will mean that we're not going to be together anymore because, honestly, I don't want to have a life with somebody who's going to treat every conversation like this. I don't, at this point, feel confident that he's ever going to really change it. I think that it has to do with his upbringing. I think that it has to do with what' he's been through. He'll even say things to me like, "I've been through way worse than you. I was beat and I had my penis burned and tied with a rubber band," and he brings up these horrible things that I know about that I've cried with him over. Kind of saying, "You haven't been through all this and look at me. I've been through all this and I'm still happy." Like, "Okay. Thanks for literally giving me nowhere to go with this." I think that all these things make me a little bit nervous that whatever I have to say will end up being actually what's going to make me happy is if I'm just able to be on my own for a while. Otherwise I just feel like I'm walking on eggshells constantly with him. I feel as though if I don't say what I need to say we're basically living the life he's wanted, that we're having the relationship that he wants. 00:35:19</p>

<p>Another thing that really upset me, by the way, we were talking about the wine drinking. I come home and I'm cleaning up on Wednesday. There are five empty bottles of wine and this man had three nights in which he could have consumed these five bottles of wine, and so I was like, "What the hell? Why five bottles of wine?" When I approached him, he kind of got defensive and he was like, "Well, why do you think I would drink that much? What were we talking about before you left? I was like, "okay", and I kind of left it, but it did make me upset like, "Really? You have to drink that much knowing that it makes me upset?" That's another issue that I can't even bring up with him because if I bring up the fear of alcoholism in my partner with him it turns into, "You're not my mother and I will never be an alcoholic." Again, it's all these things have been culminating to make me feel like if he's really not able to listen to me and have a conversation like a normal person, then I really can't be with him right now. That's a scary thought and it's, of course, worrisome like, "What am I going to lose? What if he can work it out?" I just feel like I've been walking on eggshells for so long that I'm not sure that I can do it anymore unless he's willing to put in the work also. He's not ever willing to say, "I'm going to put in this work," unless it's acting or photography and working out, which has nothing to do with our relationship. I think that's why I've been looking outwardly for solutions and how do I do this. 00:37:10</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see — because, in a way, you don't want to know what you really think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And of course I don't want to hurt him. He's being so sweet now and it's kind of clouding my vision about the whole thing, but I really don't want to wait a long time before having the conversation because I don't want another argument to start over something and then, again, round and round in circles. It's just been weighing on me a lot is what the big thing is. It's just been weighing on me. What do I do? How do I approach this? How do I not see things only through my mind's eye and make sure I'm looking at some of what might be the truth in what he's saying? I think that the most frustrating thing, though, is that he's just not willing ever to say, "You're right. I should stop this," when I always do in these conversations. Like, "You're right. I do need to be a little bit more positive about some things." I always do. Maybe I don't always follow through on that immediately, but I always agree. He never can look at anything, anything that he does and say, "You're right. I need to work on this." Obviously, that's really frustrating in our relationship. And so that's, I think, what makes me think that maybe we should just not be together. 00:38:32</p>

<p>I mean his whole ridiculous thing of being friends and then this whole f**king relationship status thing which is still "It's Complicated" right now, that was just a stupid thing to put in there like, "Are we having an adult relationship or not?" I mean, yeah, I do want to point out to him things like when he tells me, "For three years you said you were going to do this and do that and you haven't done it yet," and da-da-da, I want to say, "Well, for six months you said you were going to get back into classes and you haven't done that. I mean I know his defense will be, "Oh, well I haven't heard back from the woman," and da-da-da. That's bullshit. I'm sorry. If you really wanted to be back in the class, you would have been back in the class. I'm sorry. I want to be able to bring all these things up, not in a mean-spirited kind of way, but kind of in a way that says, "You're saying all this stuff about me. While some of it might be true, I need you to recognize that these things are not okay," or "Please, let's talk about things differently." I kind of just think that the real answer is that yeah, I think I am looking a little bit like, "What do I do?" I think just talking about it here is a little bit easier than talking about it with friends who offer all sorts of varied opinions. 00:39:53</p>

<p>I think the real answer is I don't want to write a letter. I want to sit down and try to have a conversation with him. Yeah, I think I'll need to do some rehearsing in my head. Think about it a little bit. Get my ideas straight, kind of gauge how that conversation goes and make an educated decision that's going to be the best for me. If he really is not willing to back down from his defensive nature and kind of lecture-style chatting with me about things, I'm going to have to tell him that I think we should take a break from living together and see what next steps we can take because I can't do the things I need to do for myself feeling like it's never going to be enough for him. I think I'm worried about it being a mistake if I do that, is another issue, so it's obviously scary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true. 00:40:55</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's definitely something that I need to do, even if it is a mistake. Honestly, it might be a mistake we're making if it will give me a chance to be a little bit more introspective and work on my stuff without feeling like I have somebody watching me work on my stuff — "When are you going to be working out? Are you working out today? What are you doing?" Stuff like that. Like I was talking about how I need to get back into working out and now my toe is f**ked up. "Well, you could do stretching and you could do this and you could do that." While I know he's just trying to be helpful, it almost feels like even more pressure, like now if I don't it's like, "Well, you could have been stretching. You could have been stretching and you haven't stretched and you haven't done this." I think maybe some of it is imagined, but maybe some of it is imagined because of how he's treated me about it, you know? It's not coming from nowhere. I do have to mention in the conversation that I have, I do have to mention to him the drinking thing because that's also something that bothers me and that's a relationship issue to me. It's a lot of big stuff . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is a lot of big stuff. 00:42:04</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . that I feel unprepared to deal with but, again, like I was talking to my best friend the other night and she was like, "I know this is hard but I really think you just need to have this conversation with him ASAP," and she's right. There's no time limit on making a decision about my relationship, but I think that the longer stuff goes unsaid, the less opportunity for change there is, I think, immediately. So, yeah, but this conversation has been helpful, even though I've been talking most of the time because I think it's allowed me to be a little bit clearer about why I've been hesitant to have the conversation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. We should stop for now, we have one on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. We'll meet on Friday and then we'll keep that for as long as we don't have to cancel. Thanks. 00:43:23</p>

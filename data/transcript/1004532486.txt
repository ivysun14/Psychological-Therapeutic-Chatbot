<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where should we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sigh) I don't know. There's a lot that happened this week or these past two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, so think about that for a second 'cause I know one of the things you wanted to do is to try to stay more focused on one thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So take a minute for yourself to think about all that's happened, and then ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think it's the same really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... theme or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Because then choose the theme it feels like - one theme but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean even just like - oh, sorry. Even just like ten minutes ago, I sensed like a really angry, you know, which I felt really bad about, but ... (sigh). Okay, so the - like the rat thing was what, three weeks ago or whatever? So I talked to Phil about it, and - which was hard. And it - and he seemed like apologetic or ... he didn't like say, "I'm sorry," but I think he - like his body language and the way that he was expressing himself sort of expressed that, and so I felt a little bit better. And so we went to back to sort of being quasi friends except maybe I didn't trust him as much, like - sort of like a little bit weary of him, but still in terms of, you know, laughing about things or sending each other silly e-mails or whatever. Things sort of went back to normal, which was nice until the other day. He - he - oh, so Julia, Phil, and I were both - all - all three of us were trying to take a shower. And I had - I had been awake before the other two, and so, but I hadn't said anything about waiting for the shower or like I was getting around to it, and Julia hopped in and I was like okay, well, I'll just wait until she's done. [00:01:38] I'm not like in a hurry. And then Phil got up and started to cook or whatever, and then he was like, "Oh, yeah, I'm just waiting for Julia to get out of the shower," and I was like, "Oh. Look, do you mind if I just go before you?" And he was like, "No." Or I said, "Can I go before you?" and he said, "No." And I was like, "Well, you can't just - you can't just say no." And then I - I guess I just sort of like trailed off, but I was like, "You can't just say no. Like that's not really nice or fair or whatever." And I was really upset. He actually stopped like in the middle of cooking breakfast to go take a shower. And then came back down and had like this - well, 'cause he said that he had a meeting, which I was like, "Okay, well that's fine if you have - I don't have a meeting," so ... but then, he had this like sit down breakfast with his girlfriend, who was just like sitting there for like 45 minutes after he took a shower. And I was like, "Well, that's like kind of rude." And so I - then I took a shower and whatever. And I told him like later that morning, I was like, "Oh, hey. Can we talk about - can we talk later?" I said something like that ... again, and he was like fine. [00:02:40] And so - and then I would see him a couple of times in the house (this was like a couple of days ago), but I â€” I was just like so angry that I didn't feel like I could talk to him then I guess, and then he - I guess he took that as avoidance, and he sent me these series of really angry e-mails about chores and stuff. And so - and I was like - and I even sent him an e-mail earlier too. I was like, "Hey, I think that we're talking about more than chores. Can we maybe talk about this in person?" You know, in a like polite way. And then he responded with this like long e-mail. He's like, "Well, sometimes when we talk in person, I feel like I am - what - what is he - I feel pressured to see my points or something, which to me was like talking about a bad thing, like he didn't really mean that he was sorry or whatever. And then he went on and on and on about how like - about chores and stuff, and then - and then he said this one thing that really, really pissed me off. And it was something about like I feel like you need a lot of approval and that's not normal. It was just - maybe the phrasing of it was really, really aggressive, and I just - I couldn't help but like - I just sent this really long e-mail. And like it was really angry and ... [00:03:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you felt attacked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I - yeah, I mean I really did. And I don't - I mean like even as I was thinking about it, I'm like here I go again. And like I knew that I was doing this thing again, but I couldn't help it, and I feel equally guilty and satisfied. Did that make sense? Well, and - and like I guess I'm angry at Phil, but I'm also angry at myself for like even - for like knowing that I was doing this and I'm continuing to do it. I mean I guess in my defense, it wasn't as angry as it could have been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you have been - what would you have felt good about saying in response?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really think we need to talk about this in person, I guess. But ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then what would you like to have said in person? Let's - let's have the conversation you wanted to have. [00:04:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm - I don't know. I think I would've said something like - well, see, that's the thing. Like the things that I had to tell him, that he was rude and like was rude to me, and that I didn't appreciate that, and that I think that sometimes he's a little bit self-centered are both like really aggressive and attack - attacking things to say. And so, I didn't really quite - like I was thinking about it. It was like how do I say this in a way that's not mean? Like how can I put this in a way that's not attacking him? But I couldn't think of anything, and so I don't really know what I would say. I mean I would say something like I thought it was really rude that you sort of just cut in line for the shower. Maybe you didn't know that I was waiting for it, but it would've been nice if you had asked why I had wanted to take a shower before you or if you had at least explained that you had a meeting, I would've said fine. And then, I don't know what I would've said about the whole needing approval thing. That just really makes me furious, like really profoundly angry. [00:05:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So here's - the way to turn it around so that it doesn't feel like you're sort of attacking him back or being - kind of putting yourself in the one up role of defining his behavior and labeling his behavior, because it doesn't really matter if you're right or not about whether or not he was rude because the piece that he's gonna respond to is that you're telling him what he is and you're labeling his behavior, and ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... nobody responds well to that. Everybody feels attacked, just the way you did when he said to you like you need too much approval. So the way to turn it around is to talk about how does his behavior affect you and what you ended up feeling. So these are the classic "I" statements rather than saying, "You know - you - you know - I think you're rude" is - is not a nice statement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a "you" statement disguised. But saying, you know, "I felt really attacked when you," you know - "I felt really attacked in that e-mail when I was described as needing too much approval." It gets - it makes some of the same points because you're still kind of labeling his behavior. You're letting him know how his behavior affected you, so it gets across some of the same point without setting you up to be the attacker because it allows him to see the impact he's having without feeling like he's being judged. And that - that might actually work better for you because you get to say something and not feel like "Oh, here I go again. I'm being angry attacking person, which I don't feel good about either," yet, it still lets you express some of what's going on. [00:07:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So - I mean it's just - it's a way of just kind of turning the - turning the sentence inside out so that what you end up doing is instead of describing him, and you end up describing how you felt in response to him. And it doesn't leave you quite as vulnerable saying like, "I - I - I was really sad," or "I was hurt." It's a little bit vulnerable, but that actually is what decreases some of the defects on the other side too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The shower piece is a little bit trickier because he kind of got set up there. You asked him if you could go first. You gave him the right to say yes or no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't want him to, but you kind of set him up to say no because you asked. If you had said, "Hey, I was actually waiting for Julia to get out. Can I go first?" Or "I've been waiting. Do you need to go now?" That - that would have given him the context in which to make his decision. That would've given him a little. It would have kind of given him a little bit of a fair playing field. Or you could've just said, "Hey, by the way. I've been waiting. You can go next." That would've been a more assertive way of keeping your kind of place in the line. But he didn't know he was being a jerk really there because you asked if you could go next and he was like, "No. I decide not." I mean would the nicer thing to being - do, always say yes to that? Yeah, but he's not really obligated to. [00:08:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. I mean I guess I wasn't even - to be like totally honest, I wasn't mad about the order of the - I wasn't in a hurry. I wasn't going anywhere. It was really just the way that he responded to that I guess, and so, yeah, I guess I could've done more into ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, it probably felt even worse when you then saw him sort of like get out of the shower and hang out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you know, kind of having this leisurely morning when you're like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. So - yeah, I guess that ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He felt like he was kind of just saying no just to say no. [00:09:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, exactly. When - maybe he didn't know it, but it wasn't his right to do that I guess. But I guess I'm also worried because like when we had the rat talk, we also had the my mom is gonna stay with us for graduation talk, and so - and I - I sent this e-mail out and I was like, "I realize this is a lot to ask, and I totally - I realize that asking this might put some of you guys in an uncomfortable position, but like - please don't feel like you have to say yes. I am sort of just asking to - to see what it would be like or whatever," and everyone said, "Yes, of course, like I've had a lot of families stay here before, and it would be fine if you do the same or whatever." And Phil was like, "I don't know. We need to talk about this in person." And so - and when we talked about it in person, he was like, "Well, we only have one bathroom," because we only have one bath, and "we need to be really low key about the bathroom, and we really need to figure out like how to do this so that - 'cause graduation is going to be really stressful for me, and like my family's gonna be ready and I want this house to be, you know, somewhere where I can come to relax or whatever." And - and like that's fine. I was like, "Okay. I don't know what we could do to work that out better, but I mean I would be willing to be low key or whatever, schedule the bathroom or whatever. That - that seems like a reasonable thing to ask." But then, this whole thing happens over the bathroom. And so now I'm like really worried. Like can my mom actually stay in the house because I'm not gonna have - like it's one thing to like talk to me like I'm a little kid or be condescending to me, but if that happened to my mom, I don't know what I would - I would go nuts probably like, and so, I don't know. [00:10:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it possible to set up a schedule for graduation time and have it just be a more objective clear cut like this is when people have, you know, you have it from slot A to slot B ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I was confused ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... and put your mom in there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was confused because to me, that's not really low key.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But it is clear cut.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. And so I guess like now that would be the - the more logical thing to do, but I don't know. I guess - I'm just really frustrated with Phil, and I know that Julia is also frustrated with Phil. And then like together, I sort of vent to her and she vents to me, and I guess maybe - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It kind of ends up escalating rather than having you feel better. [00:11:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of. Yeah. Even though it does feel better to be able to talk to someone like about stuff, but then now, like after I sent that really angry e-mail, Phil e-mailed - or Phil talked to Julia and she thought she was in the middle, and I was like, "I'm so sorry for bringing you in the middle. I like hate being put in the middle and I'm sorry that I did that to you." So then it's like affecting all this other stuff, and like - and that actually was the part that made me feel the worst I think. And - sorry. There's just so much going on. And then I had this fight with Tim last night, and he like yelled at me and I sort of just walked away, and not - but I guess the one thing that was - is good about fighting with Phil is that like now I have this like irresistible urge to go and talk to Tim before it gets any worse. And so - so, I don't know. I just - I feel like - and - and so my friend from college visited this whole weekend. We also didn't have like the easiest relationship. And so all this has been happening this past week, and so I feel like there's something wrong with me, and like - that maybe I'm not handling stuff correctly or I don't know. It just makes me feel bad about myself instead of sort of wanting to turn around and address things that may or may not be actually happening. I don't know. It's just really confusing. [00:12:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is similar about all of the relationships do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't say stuff, and I - that really confuse - I think that's why I was so pissed off by Phil's like thing that I needed approval or something because I mean, it's not true, but I can see how I would come off that way. You know? Like - but - until - I don't know. It like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does he see you think that makes him think that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like speak up about things or like - just even the way that I phrase things. Like just saying, "Oh, I was waiting, but you can go ahead of me." Like - just - like that - that's what I think and that's what I mean, but that's not what I say. And I - I don't know if it's just not in my nature to speak that way or I - I don't know. It's just really frustrating because that's what I mean and say, but that's not â€” or that's what I mean, but it's not what I say, and people don't react to what I mean. People react to what I say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it makes it easy to ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You kind of ask. You wouldn't ask - asked the question, you kind of asked for his permission. [00:13:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. To do what I was already ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. What you were already doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though I didn't mean to ask for his permission.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But that's what ended up happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder - so what - I wonder what prompted you to ask the question rather than say "Hey, I was waiting"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean - I don't - it happened so quickly because - I mean I was washing dishes and he was making breakfast, and so it was like literally like a five-second exchange, so, I don't know. It - I don't know. It just makes me feel like I'm stuck ... 'cause I don't always have time to like, you know, what am I - how am I going to phrase this or, you know? [00:14:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it will become more automatic over time, so then change with the automatic responses. Your automatic response was for - to ask rather than to - rather than to - to share, but that's - it's not doing that is not always gonna take a ton of thought. It takes a ton of thought now because you're not used to it, and it's a big leap from what your - your impulse is, but the practice of kind of noticing it going back, practicing it a different way, that's gonna kick in and it's gonna become a little bit more - it'll become closer to automatic and then more automatic, but it takes a while to change the patterns. Do you think there's anybody that you would have said, "Hey, I was actually waiting, but you can go first if you're, you know, are in a rush"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My family probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [00:15:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would probably say that to my mom or my brothers or whatever. Or I would just be like or go. I - no, I don't. I don't know that it would be such a big deal with anybody else if I didn't live with them. Maybe - and I was thinking maybe like it's just that we spend so much time together, and then it's like a really intense ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Things do get more intense because it stands in for so much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I don't know. I mean I feel like I was really trying, and then I feel like I just epically failed. So, I don't know. And then even just with Laura like, Laura was my friend from college that visited for a week. It was her spring break, so she came here. Like - just like little things - I - I don't know like - she would do stuff that would really bother me. Like for example, we were in - we were at a health food store'cause she's gluten-free. She has an intolerance. And so, we had to go shop for gluten-free stuff. [00:16:20] And so, there was like - I had the cart and like - and there's no one in the aisle, and I had it like perpendicular to the shopping thing or whatever because I was looking at the shelf or whatever. And of course, if someone had come, I would've moved. But she was like, "Oh, my God! What are you doing?" And like literally like moved me out of the way and then pushed the shelf close because I don't know - she likes to not be in the way of people, and she's like extreme minimalist or something. I don't know. And I felt like really? Like that's - I - you just - I - you - that was my personal space, like why did you do - and so I was able to say something like, "Oh, that was kind of rude a little bit," or like - but it sort of just trails off and like it sort of becomes buttering, and then I shut up. And then I resolved to do - to like really talk about the next time that she does something that really bothers me like that, to talk about it. And then the same thing happens again. And so - and the same thing happened with Tim. Like when he started yelling at me, I walked away. When, you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was he yelling at you about? [00:17:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: We - I - there was a box of tissues in the living room, and so chores have been falling behind in the house, and Phil has been sending out 8 million e-mails a day about chores, which makes me not want to do my chore. But that's beside the point. So Phil, sorry - Tim had cleaned the living room or whatever and then put the - put everything that he found that wasn't, you know, supposed to be in the living room in the kitchen, which is my area to clean. And even just like dishes and stuff, he just put them there, and so like I guess I would clean them or something. I don't know. And so - but I - and I was - I swear like I was half joking and I was like, "Oh, you know, thanks for putting that in my area. Like whatever." But I didn't mean it to be like passive aggressive or anything. I was actually joking. And then he started yelling. He was like, "Not everyone is out to get you! Oh, my God, Leanne!" And I was like, "Oh, my gosh! I cannot handle this right now." And - and so I walked away, and I was going into the kitchen, you know, to take the tissues or whatever, and he followed me in and was like, "Oh, let's talk about this 'cause I don't want you to be passive-aggressive later or whatever," and so I was like - I just - I walked. I said, "You need to stop yelling at me," and walked away as he was trying to talk to me when I maybe should have stayed or talked. [00:18:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was he trying to talk to you or was he yelling at you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both, I think. Like he wasn't like yelling yelling, but his voice was definitely raised. And I don't know. I don't know what it is - like all of that, it doesn't scare me, but I sort of just - my instinct is to run and hide or like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nobody wants to be confronted in that way. That's not - I mean it's difficult to have a confront - a confrontation, but there are - there, you know - there are ways to have a successful confrontation, and that's not, you know - having someone say, "Hey, can we talk about something? It might be hard to talk about," as a way to set up a conversation where you're not going to feel as attacked, even though it might be a difficult conversation, but I mean - you kind of, you know - you made this joking type of comment, he reacted to it strongly, and he starts talking to you in a loud and aggressive way. Most people wouldn't respond well to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I don't think it's unusual that you responded by wanting to retreat from such an imposing figure. [00:19:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But usually like, I guess what I would - what I would expect my reaction to be is to sort of hold my ground and be - and say something like, "Please don't yell at me. I think that's really rude or something. This is not conducive to a like mature conversation." Say something like that. That's what I would want to say or at least ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you did say, you know, you - I - I need you to stop yelling at me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then I walked away as he was still talking to me. You know, I - that's not what I would do to my family. I'd probably start yelling back at my family, which is equally unhealthy but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'd have to find a third option.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. But that's just - it was just a lot to - every week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a lot. Yeah. It's a - it's a lot of exempt. You're right. And these things are all connected. It's the same - same pattern coming up with different people in slightly different scenarios. But I think it - it can all be addressed by the same thing, which is figuring out a way for you to be able to talk in a straightforward manner while setting your boundaries and adhering to boundaries that are safe. [00:20:47] And I mean emotionally safe because no one's getting physically attacked, but, you know, even - even with your friend, Laura, you felt like your boundary was crossed. And you weren't able to sort of effectively communicate to that to her for yourself. You know, you kind of felt, you know - you trailed off. You didn't really get to say exactly what you wanted to say. And she didn't really get a clear message about why that felt not okay to you. And why maybe it wasn't necessarily - you - she reacted so strongly to you not having the cart the way that she would've chosen it. If you choose to angle the cart differently than she does, it doesn't really reflect poorly upon her, which is my guess what she was responding to. She probably felt like, "Wow, I think it's really rude to stand, you know, in an aisle like that, and people are going to think I'm rude if I'm with someone that does that." Well, guess what? There's a boundary between the two of you. She doesn't have to worry so much about you making a different choice than her. But neither one of you kind of felt like your boundaries were respected. [00:21:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's right. Hmm. I did at one point ask her if she was angry at me or like, because I think she was angry when I chose to drove - drive - well, drive places.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Plus I am not grading.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I chose to drive places, I think she got really angry, and she said that she got carsick, but I don't think that that's necessarily true because she felt fine whenever we were going somewhere that we would otherwise not be able to ... I don't know. It was weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think she was angry about choosing to drive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because she wouldn't speak to me like when we were in the car, and that was like this is really awkward. Like I just felt really awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Over her driving or over walking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I - I was driving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But why would she be angry about you driving? [00:22:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, because I think she wanted to take the bus or the train. She thought it was ridiculous to drive or something. And so - and so, at one point, I - I asked her, I said - well, even before we got in the car, I said, you know, "Would it be okay with you if we drive?" And she was like, "Well, I guess if you really want to." And I was like, "I mean it's fine if you want to take the bus, I don't mind doing that." And this was like the way that this - the whole week was. I - I was like, "It's okay. We can do this other thing." And then we would do - she would say, "No," and then we'd do whatever, and then she'd be angry, I - I think or it was just really awkward. And so I at least - I guess I asked her. I said, "Are you - are you angry at me or is there something bothering you or something?" And she said, "No." So I mean I guess that's all I can really do, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So I guess that one was good, but that was like also easier because I spent so much time with her. [00:23:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder - I wonder if she would have responded differently if you said, "It seems like you're angry," or "it seems like you're uncomfortable"? Do you think she would have responded differently?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I mean I don't know, but maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the difference there is, you know, "Are you mad? Can I take a shower?" Those are what we call closed questions. They - they only allow for a yes or a no answer or - they don't only allow. I mean I guess somebody could be creative and come up with something different. But they really pull for a quick yes or no. You know, like it's a fill in the blank on a test versus, you know, a more open-ended question, where someone has a lot more room about how they respond back. So an open-ended question, you know, it seems like you feel uncomfortable. It's not actually a question, but it - it leaves a lot more room. You could say, "What are you feeling right now?" And that's an open-ended question because there's so many ways you can answer that question. [00:24:38] And she could say, "I'm not feeling anything. I'm feeling like it's a waste of gas to drive. I'm feeling like you make all the decisions." There's so many places you could go with a "Hey, what are you feeling right now?" And it - "It seems like you're upset," kind of leaves the same sort of like she can say, "No, I'm not upset," or "I don't know what you're talking about." You know? It leaves a little bit more room for a yes or no. And it does - phrasing your questions that way and trying to be as open-ended as possible gives you the most chance for someone to respond back in a fairly honest and open way, whereas the yes or no's kind of almost pull for a certain response. You know, it's like if a doctor says, "Do you drink?" Someone says yes or no. They don't say, "I tend to have a few drinks on the weekend, but, you know, not during the week," or "Oh, yeah. I drink every night and buy drinks usually on Friday and Saturday." And if you want to get the more honest response, usually trained physicians do - ask very open-ended questions because people are less likely to make stuff up if they have to make up a lot, and it's really easy to deny something that you're feeling. It's just kind of more set up for that. So that might be, you know, thinking about how can you make the questions more open-ended and how can you make your statements more focused on you rather than - or an I, yourself, rather than on them might get you responses that are a little bit more productive in these conversations. [00:26:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're harder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't - I just - yeah. I don't know. It just comes back to like oh, I wish I could do that, or maybe I wouldn't have so many issues with people that are nice ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's practice. It's practice, practice, practice. You can do it, but it's not - it's not your natural intent, and, you know, I - I bring these things up. These are techniques that you can learn, and you just haven't learned them. That - and it's not a fault if you have something wrong with you. Is there communication techniques that work we're ready to learn right then? Whenever and now's a good opportunity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. Yeah, that makes sense. And I can see how like being angry at someone else is sort of like - 'cause when I was angry at Phil today, I was really angrier at myself for responding this way or whatever or, you know, just feeling so angry 'cause I hate feeling angry or I don't know, a million different things. And so I can see how that would be more productive for me in the long run. So yeah, I guess I just don't really know how to do it. [00:27:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. The - the point of learning to phrase things in this way is not to take care of the other person. It's because in the long run, it gets you more of what you want out of your relationships. Like in a short, you know, as a consequence side effect to that, they might end up feeling better too, but that's okay 'cause that's actually good for your relationship. The point of altering how you approach someone is so that you get what you want out of the relationship, and that - that's generally available to both people. But I'm - I'm talking to you about this not because I think you did something wrong and I feel bad for Phil or I feel bad Laura, I'm talking to you about it so you get what you want out of ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... those relationships.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I understand. Yeah. No, that makes sense. It - but - yeah. It's - it seems like a lot of work. [00:28:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is. It is. You're right because they're not - making these kind of changes is gonna be you noticing what happens when you're out there, knowing that it didn't go necessarily the way you wanted it to go. And us going back over it and saying like, "Okay, how could you phrase that differently until it feels a little bit more natural?" And it's gonna feel like translating for you for a while. You know? It's like when I asked you to say something in Spanish that you were trying to say in English, and it was really hard. It was much easier in one language than the other, even though you're perfectly fluent in both. That's what this is gonna be like, like trying to say something in your natural language that, you know, that that memory occurred in and trying to translate to the other language. It's gonna feel awkward at first. But you're perfectly capable of doing it. It's just - it takes practice. [00:29:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think like the one thing that I'm worried about that maybe this will - I guess maybe this will help with is that like when I feel so angry that I'm like capable of sending these ridiculous e-mails or yelling at someone or whatever. It just like - my - if my instincts, my like everything about what I want to do tells me to like I'm - I'm never gonna speak to them again or just like immediately cut them off, and I can see how this would be ridiculous and problematic for like a real relationship.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, I - I don't know. I mean is that - do you think that that's like involved in this or - I mean is it just like it's the easy way out?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like your feelings are so intense at that time that you don't know what to do with yourself or them. So in a relationship that you want to sustain beyond then - you need to find a way to sort of put that on pause and wait for the emotion to de-escalate a bit, and it will. Like even when you are your most angry, you don't stay that angry forever. It eventually dissipates. [00:30:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sometimes it dissipates because you act on the angry impulse and even though you know - you know, like you said, like part of you felt really good for saying all those things and sending it off and part of you didn't. So partly the anger dissipated 'cause you did something. You discharged it. But that anger would also have kind of dissipated like - just like a bell, you know, the bell curve. And then, even if you do nothing, eventually it comes down on the other side. It builds up. If feels like really quick when it's angered, and then it does, you know, kind of come back down, even if we do nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then isn't that - I mean I guess that's sort of what I've been doing until now. Right? Like waiting - feeling angry and then waiting until it passes, and then moving on, and then feeling angry again, and then moving on, and then - but not saying anything and ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, that's the difference. So we wait for the anger to pass and then not do nothing because not doing anything means that - that same issue is gonna pop up again, and that anger's gonna pop up again, and it's gonna feel even worse 'cause now it's the same thing over again. The difference is - there's a difference between letting the feeling subside and doing nothing and letting the feeling subside and address the issue that was underneath the feeling. [00:31:32] So your ideal situation is let some of the intensities subside from the feeling, and then make a conscious choice rather than an emotional reaction about addressing the issue that - that triggered the feeling. And that's the piece that you're really working on. It's like how do we figure out how to go back and talk about these things in a way that actually addresses the issue? It's not so much the feeling, you know, we're gonna get angry, even in really good relationships you're gonna get really angry about stuff sometimes. And the healthy thing is finding a way to address the issues that create that anger, so that you're not having the same issues over and over and over again 'cause that's what's not healthy in a relationship. Fighting is perfectly okay. Being upset is perfectly okay. Having the same issue over and over and over again is eroding for a relationship. And I think that's what you're feeling because the same types - like with Phil, you know, just like with the rat. The shower felt like the same thing. He was rude to you. He wasn't really paying attention to what you were really asking for, so it felt so intense because it's that, you know, slightly different scenario but same thing. And all these e-mails you get about the cleaning, it feels attacking, just like it felt attacking when he said, "You need so much approval." That's what makes it so intense 'cause the issues really haven't been resolved. [00:32:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so - I mean I guess like practically, I have no idea how to even begin to try - I mean he's moving out soon, and so I'm just like I just want to - maybe I can just ignore him long enough to wait until he moves out or something. But that doesn't work either because I have to deal with him before graduation. I haven't talked to him about the shower or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, if you want things to go smoothly when your mom's here ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... something needs to be addressed about that particular issue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so there's like this urgency to like (inaudible at 00:33:21) the (inaudible at 00:33:22)? I have no idea where to start. I don't know how to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you were to describe what's going on between the two of you right now, how would you describe it? It seems like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if I was talking to him?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. You can talk to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:33:37]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems - I think he's rude. I don't know. It seems like he ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't get to judge him. You get to talk about what's going on between the two of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's supposed to be hard. If it was easy, you wouldn't need me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It seems like he and I are on - have different expectations of communication, but I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So that sounds like actual - so I know I told you to talk to me, but that was to make - was to make it easier. If you were to start a conversation with him and said, "It seems like we're having different expectations of either - of how to talk with one another, or we're having different expectations of how things should go in the house." That's a really - I think that's a really safe way to go into a conversation because you're not blaming him, you're describing what's going on in that dynamic between the two of you, so there's not really blame to go around. You're not blaming yourself and apologizing unnecessarily, and you're not also putting all of it on him for being rude, but you - it does seem like you are having different expectations. It - that sounds really accurate, and it sounds really non-blaming. So you're having different expectations of how - yeah, how to communicate. You're having different expectations of how to kind of get along in the house. [00:35:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that would open up a way of talking about how to talk to each other I guess?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could. It could also just smooth away. So like the next big thing coming up is probably that you want to go smoothly is this bathroom thing for graduation. So you could open up a conversation about that by saying, you know, "It seems like lately we've had different expectations on how to handle things in the house. I know you mentioned some concerns about like the bathroom and my mom being here for graduation. Let's set something - can we set something up that's really clear to avoid missed communications or to avoid the different expectations?" I think something like that kind of - it sets - neither one of you at fault, and it gives you both an opportunity to kind of problem solve it together, which might feel different than one of you having to change, you needing less approval in his eyes, and him needing to be a lot more considerate in your eyes. Like that - those things need just one of you to change. How would that - how would something like what I just said, how would that sit hearing that? [00:36:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it would be a good start. (Laughter) But I think there's a lot more like - that's a good way to start it I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you might not be able to address everything at once 'cause there is so much built up. But thinking about maybe one challenge that could be addressed before ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. And so, I guess - if like - is there something that I can maybe think about saying when - like if he says something else to me that I think is really rude, is there maybe something that I can keep like in my head that I can say? I mean would that be like - I feel like - no, that's the fake one, but look ... Do you know what I mean? Like - but I don't know what I would say. I would say something like - I mean - what I would mean is like please stop being rude to me. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I need to say something else. [00:37:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So what you - you can say, "Please don't talk to me like that because it hurts my feelings." So it - it - do you hear it? So let's - I'm gonna try both out on you. So say you say something, and I said, "Please, you know, that was really rude." How do you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean I would - I guess if I had said something that I meant or something, I'd feel like, "Oh, no it wasn't. It was true or whatever."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if I say - use that same thing that you still felt like was true. And I said, "Please don't talk to me like that because it hurts my feelings."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd feel really bad. [00:38:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See which one you want to use?</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So - and the difference, still he gets the message that he was rude, but instead of being mad at you for calling him out on it, "Please don't talk to me like that" sets up a boundary. It demands that you be respected, which is what you want in your relationship. And that "because it hurts my feelings" personalizes it. It - it makes you - it shows you the humanity in the exchange instead of the anger in the exchange. When you say, "That was really rude," you are showing the anger in the exchange. And whether he's right or wrong and knows he's right or wrong, he's gonna get defensive because nobody likes to be called out in their bad behavior. Some people will go back and reflect on it later and actually change their behavior for the better. Other people won't get to that space. And I think what you're hoping is that he will go back and sort of reflect on it because you would, but we don't know, we don't have control over that piece.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But being able to kind of assert your boundaries, like, you know, "Please don't talk to me like that." And then letting him know how it affected you. You've got - you've got to sort of more of an end to actually affect the behavior, plus you've protected yourself. [00:39:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you - you might not be able to say all that. You know, it might be really hard for you to do the two-step thing. And even to say, "Please don't talk to me that way," you know, that might be enough to kind of put up the safe boundary. You know, you kind of tried that with Tim, and he kept coming after you, and you left and that's okay. You know, sometimes leaving is a perfectly good way of protecting yourself, whether it being ... yeah. There's nothing wrong - there's nothing wrong with that choice. It gives you an opportunity to come back later and address the issue if you want to. It leaves that door open.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is - so I know that like for something like my fight with Tim, clearly, we have to talk about it. But, I don't know, I mean is it weird to bring something up twice? Like because I feel like the rat thing isn't ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The rat thing's over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And - and it's only over because you've tried to - now, if you go back to that same exact thing, what ends up happening is like the defensiveness from before comes up again. And it - it ... [00:40:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I thought it was over ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... until he was like, "Sometimes, I feel like I have to agree with you to keep the peace." And then, I was like, "Well, what exactly are you talking about here?" You know, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he could've been responding to the rat thing, he could've responded to something that he thought - that he's holding onto from seven incidents before, and you don't really know. So, you can go back to, you know, "You made this comment about having to agree with me, and I'm wondering what that's about, not how I want you to feel." And maybe you could talk about that, but, you know - with Phil, I don't think that - it's - it's more about the dynamic between the two of you that's getting repeated more than any particular incident where that dynamic is being expressed. Have I lost you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So right now, it's like you have this repeated exchange with him where you feel that he's attacking you, he feels like you're being unrealistic or too needy in some way or another, and that's what keeps getting - that's what keeps getting felt between the two of you. He felt - it sounds like he felt that way about the rat. You - you needed too much for him, and you thought he was being incredibly rude for not being able to help out in this crisis situation. [00:41:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even just the - I'm actually not really even upset about his behavior. It's really the way that he tells me things is really rude. Like, "No," or "go take the trash out." Or, you know, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that tone of voice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So it's really - it's really about the way that he speaks to me I think that I'm really upset because I wouldn't have been half as angry if he had just said, "I'm actually," or "I'm not feeling well, I have to go back to sleep," or ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... you know, "I'm so sorry I can't help with you." I mean I would've have been angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So exactly what you just said, it's not about the rats, it's not about the shower, it's not about the trash, it's about the tone of voice. So that dynamic of him being sort of condescending to you. So that's the issue that you eventually want to be able to address with him, and you can - that's probably gonna come up in another thing, and then it's ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: How soon? [00:42:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah., very, especially 'cause you guys both I think are pretty upset with one another, so it's more likely to even come up again. And so the next time something comes up, addressing that, addressing the tone that is feeling so objectionable is what's gonna start to make the difference because if that thing could get solved, all these other - the context that it occurs in is not really as important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know like if the rat had never showed up, you would still be upset with him about how he talked to you about something else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That just happened to be a trigger for that particular conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay. And is it - I mean I don't know if maybe I am too needy or something, so what happens when there's like truth to - because Tim has the same objection. Like he seems to think that I'm too sensitive, I take everything way too personally, and that I guilt people into doing things. That was his like thing, and I was like I don't really - I don't know what to say to that because that's not how I think, but maybe I am being that. I don't - you know what I mean? Like ... [00:43:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think it's probably not that you're too needy, but that you have normal needs that aren't being met. And why aren't those needs being met? Well, partly because you're - you haven't found a way to be able to express them in a way that people can understand and respond to them. So it's not really that your needs need to change, but, you know, like today, with the shower, you had a perfectly normal need of wanting to be able to go in the line that you were waiting in. That - yeah, most people think kind of line up, and I know you weren't standing outside the door in line, but that's ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she expected. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, the kind of like the way it goes in the house is, you know, somehow, people get a vibe for who got up, and what - who is expecting the shower, and what the normal thing is, and your need was to have that honored. He had - he didn't really know. So he feels now like, "Oh my God, you're so needy. Like you asked if you could take a shower, I said no, and now not only do you need me to let you take a shower 'cause I really want to, but I also need to tell you yes or no in the exact way that you want me to" is what he's thinking. [00:44:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which isn't - and if that's really what you needed, yes, that would be pretty needy because how is someone supposed to magically know exactly what they're supposed to say at all times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's not really what you're asking for, right? You know, so it's a - it's a miscommunication between what you - what you actually need from them and what they think you need from them. And when you can learn ways to communicate that they can understand what you' re actually asking, the disparity between what you actually need and what they think you need is gonna come down. When people can communicate clearly about what they're feeling, generally the feelings don't seem so objectionable. But I - so much of this is that you're - you're having miscommunications all over the place, you know, and especially with these people because you - you live together so you're in close quarters, if - you don't have room for a lot of the sort of feelings to dissipate, and the same stuff keeps coming up because you're living together. If you only saw each other once in a while, it wouldn't repeat so often. It wouldn't feel so intense. And then you wouldn't have a chance to fix it. This is actually - these are all actually opportunities. [00:46:06]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now aren't you so lucky?</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean like I said, I guess it is good, but the one good thing that came from sending Phil this ridiculously angry e-mail was that now I feel like I've like - "Tim, where are you?" Like, I was quasi waiting for him to come home sort of thing, like I just want to get it over with. But I think - I think that one of the reasons that I didn't talk to Phil before this all happened and after the shower - like about the shower thing before we all got really angry at each other, was because - I have like this tremendous amount of stress around having these types of conversations, and I noticed it. I was like I know that I'm consciously avoiding him because I don't want to have this conversation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're hard conversations to have. [00:46:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I mean - I - I get that like, you know, things wouldn't be valuable if they weren't hard to do sort of thing, you know, like - like I get that. And I'm willing to do the work, I just - I wish it wasn't so stressful. Or so like - it's almost like I build it up 'cause even just having the conversation is so much less stressful than the before having the conversation. And so, I don't know if that's like a horrible way to think about these types of things, but it just seems like this tremendous hurdle, like - like final exam stress, you know, like really extreme.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There - I mean I wish I could help you take away some of that stress, but I think, you know, it's there because it is an emotionally difficult thing for you to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's normal? [00:47:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's normal because - it's normal because of the fear that you take into it. Will they always feel that stressful? No, because you're going to get better at them. And part of the stress is that this is a hard - a really hard scale for you. It's a new way of talking about things for you. So it's like, you know, you go into it fearing that it's gonna go really badly 'cause you're, you know, this is new stuff. It's uncomfortable. You're fumbling with it still. When it's - you know, when you feel like you have mastery over this stuff, it won't feel that stressful. These kinds are - one, you'll have conversations like this that will have gone well, so they'll seem - seem a lot less risky, and you'll feel much more comfortable with it, so it won't seem like such a daunting thing to do. So for now, it makes total sense that it feels that scary, and yeah, you can try to - you can try to minimize that stress by, you know, doing your deep breathing and imagining it going well. Those will be things that can - those things can actually help to reduce that - those anxiety feelings. But really, what's gonna make it go away is practicing it a million times and finally having some success with it, and, you know, practicing some of the wording in here, you know, hopefully is like a dry run to take away some of it. [00:49:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before you go, do you want to practice how you'll - how to start the conversation with Tim?</p>

<p>CLIENT: With Tim? Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that someone you said you were probably gonna (crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's so much easier, yeah.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just feels like so easy compared to ... yeah, I guess I would say, "Hey, I was wondering if we could talk about what happened the other night or last night or whatever? I - I felt really attacked because you yelled" or no, that's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... when you yelled - when you yelled, and so I walked away because that was really stressful" or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I'm gonna help you shorten it because it's easier for people to take in a - a - you know, a shorter message. If you condense that to "I thought - hey, can we talk about what happened the other night that was beautiful? I walked away because I was feeling really attacked." If you - just that - do you feel like that gets your message across 'cause I don't want to take away your message? [00:50:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That shortens it because it's two pieces, and it takes away all of the "you" statements on him and puts - it just explains to him your behavior. And if you can kind of - if you can leave it at that, he will most likely respond to that last piece, which was saying that you felt attacked, and hopefully be able to come up with maybe what he was really trying to express. Maybe apologize for attacking you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How - how could I like express - like it's really important for me to express that I don't want this to ever happen again. Like I don't - I need him to not yell at me. You know? So can I just say that or is that rude or?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can say, "I need to feel safe, and when I feel like someone's yelling at me, I don't feel safe in my own house." So - because you can tell - you can tell him what you need. You cannot tell him what he's allowed or not allowed to do. And, you know, with some - with some limits on that, and, you know, of course you can tell someone they're not allowed to hit you. Is he allowed to yell in his own house? Well, it would be nicer if he didn't, but you don't really, you know, I feel like that's a little bit stepping the line and that he's gonna then respond to that with like, "You can't tell me what to do. You're not my mother." [00:51:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't want to set yourself up for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But even if it's - I don't care if he yells, but I care that he yells at me. Like, I don't think that that's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think if you say, "I - I - I need to feel safe in my own house, and I feel like when someone yells at me, I don't feel safe."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I - I think you can get across your same message and be less likely to set yourself up for that response of like, "You can't tell me what to do."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I just want to protect you from that kind of response because that won't feel good ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... if - if you get that. But I think, you know, saying like, "This is what I need. I need to not be yelled at in my own home.

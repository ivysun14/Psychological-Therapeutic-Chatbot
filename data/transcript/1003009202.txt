<p><b>DR:</b> Um, how's your appetite?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Gaining or losing weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I think I'm losing, but slowly, as supposedly when, I'm trying to lose, that kind of, uh, slow weight loss, you know, without starving myself, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, good luck on that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, if it works, let me know what you're doing, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I [INAUDIBLE] rapid weight loss and then maintenance.  I don't know if that works better, or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excess, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Surgeries work well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh they do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Impressive stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I thought they were like real dangerous here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, they can be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Dep, you know, someone your level of weight shouldn't get them -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but when you see the real big, you know, people who, who are suffering with -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With obesity, and their hearts are just dragging.  I mean, it's a thing of beauty to watch the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Weight go away, but you can't, uh, partake.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true, and I do, uh, see a cardiologist.  I had a slight, um, actually twice, I went twice in the past.  [INAUDIBLE] slightly enlarged aorta.  Which may have been caused from some kind of blood pressure incidence.  She's wondering if I had, uh, been a cocaine abuser, but I don't know if it would show.  Do you have to be a big abuser for that to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do, is, do you have hypertrophy?  Do you have a big heart?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, just the aorta -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just the aorta?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And just slight, very slight -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Slightly, very slightly meaning that, uh, it hasn't changed since, uh, in six to eight months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They do echocardiograms -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To look at it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she looked at it, and she said no change since the last time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And your valve is okay though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's no stenosis that's, that's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, my valve is, is happy, but a longterm heart murmur -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Going back many, many years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you remember what kind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably a slow murmur [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Uh, you're sleeping okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, except, you know how I get up and I go, uh, send my wife off to work and go back to sleep?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's been kind of shifting from the morning to midday, which is not good, cause it screws up like, uh, my plans, like if I, if I go back to sleep at like 6:30 or 7:00, you know, I can sleep, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, when, when do you go to sleep at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, about 11:00 or 11:30.  My wife goes to sleep about 9:00.  See what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, 11:30, and then at 6:30, after you've sent her off to work, you feel like you need a little extra sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I usually make up the sleep that she, I, I sleep around the same amount.  Yeah, I do, yeah, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got, I'm up since 4:45 it's no the 6:30 part, cause after 6:30, I'd be, if it wasn't for the getting up two hours [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And why do you have to, uh, send her off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Cause, you know, I want to be nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So do you hang around with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we hang out, we talk and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, sweet.  You know, some people wouldn't do it, but I don't really mind.  I usually just go back to sleep, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Actually -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She appreciates it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she appreciates it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long does it take, an hour or so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and she has to get up, you know, earlier than she really has to, you know, [INAUDIBLE] so she doesn't have to rush.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, your, um, once you do wake up and get out of bed, do you feel rested?  Feel rested in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yes, except late, yeah, I feel rested.  Sometimes like, uh, um, I'll nap later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll go, you know, I don't feel like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, what time do you get out of bed on your second round?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Usually 8:30, so usually like 6:00 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get some sunlight?  Do you try to get some sunlight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a lighted room, so I'll get natural sunlight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Twenty minutes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, as much, as much as the weather permits.  I mean, it's direct sunlight coming, it's a very bright room, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Well, you need at least 20 minutes in the morning before 9:00 AM.  That's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I, I try to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, is your energy okay during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Generally, yes, except when I'm feeling tired and, you know, the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, accept when I miss that nap and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you take a nap every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I don't take naps except when I'm, except when I am sleep, except when I don't go back to bed -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See, you need those extra couple hours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, but I don't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you don't take it in the morning, you take it later?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any exercise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, yeah, I do, uh, walk around a lot aside from the, uh, physical therapy thing two days a week, which is actually becoming a, a big workout cause I'm getting  a lot of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sweat?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, sweat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Heart rate goes up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and it's a lot, a lot of Pilate type stuff, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Is your back getting better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you don't quite know whether, course of time it would've gotten better anyway, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, my general health is getting better from doing this.  There's a lot of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And a lot of it is, is, is building up muscles where I don't need to, you know, carrying stuff and learning how to do a lot of stuff without injuring my back and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Strength building and skills that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what are the exercises you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See, like, uh, squats and certain things and, uh, throwing, uh, at the end of, um, one of those tables, bending all the way down to the floor and raising myself up and just my back muscles.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And there's a trainer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's abdominal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's a trainer that they call, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She a licensed therapist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Oh, she's a therapist, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's essentially a trainer -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who guides, guides the exercises -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and you're feeling better physically?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Um, how's your self esteem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Generally good, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you getting along nicely with your wife?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, except we had a bad week about two weeks ago, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I think she, she works in the financial industry.  I don't think it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is her job in jeopardy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's making money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's not she, she, where she's working, because she's in [DEIDENTIFIED], one of three banks that are solid -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That are perceived as being solid in this country, large banks, clients -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Last man standing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  So the people are flowing in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh really?  Business is booming?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, they're in money management, you know, so they're managing money, you know, for rich people, and they're -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, uh, you know, like now [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So will they be hiring you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Seems like they want to just keep people working harder and longer, so that's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of talent out there getting fired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I got a lot of patients, it's ugly.  It's brutal what's happening to banking.  But, listen, uh, [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Consolidation.  That industry needed to be shaken up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  It's a weird thing is that now they're all, they're all going to, um, probably be panic hiring in about three, four years.  These people will not go back -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Won't be around.  They'll be in some other [INAUDIBLE] hedge fund.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  They'll be, like, uh, looking to the baby boomers [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is your wife, uh, negative on the economy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think, uh, it depends on her bonus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Actually next time.  I mean, we, our, our anniversary's coming up in March, and we're going to like, uh, uh, Paris and Venice, you know.  Got enough points to, we realized it wouldn't cost that much, you know, and things people aren't doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Correct.  And the dollars strong.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The dollars strong.  And we figured we'd go against the crowds, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's cheaper than, it's cheaper than staying home if you're going to travel, staying in the US.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Except for the rent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It'd be really nice if you were homeless or something and didn't have overhead costs and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, how's your son?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's good.  He's actually also traveling.  He's been on this around the world, have you heard of Semester at Sea?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's going around that, and, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, that's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, we're taking him down to the Bahamas in, in January.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that where they leave from?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, leave from the Bahamas for some reason and come back into [DEIDENTIFIED] in May.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much does that cost?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Surprisingly little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, well probably [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like $24,000.00 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For the semester.  That's off the school -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they're accredited?  They get [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they're accredited, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So yeah, it's fully accredited.  Every, all the points are, I guess except for [INAUDIBLE] everything else is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they, they really learn something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of courses do they take?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's taking, I guess, he's a religion major, and he's taking stuff about, you know, religion and culture, and then they'll learn four native languages.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Coordinate it with where they go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  He has a lot of anxiety with piracy now so I don't know if -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you see that?  They had to take people off the cruise ship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't know if they're going to reroute, I don't know if they're going to reroute it or going, uh, not into the Med, but going around the west coast of Africa.  This could happen I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's really amazing that there's piracy -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they're so brazen about it, you know, just continuing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have to teach them a lesson.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what's going to happen, cause, you know, the things -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can't keep poking the world in the eye like this and, especially like Somolia.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, and they even have their public relations, you know, you know, it's laughable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so he's starting Semester at Sea in January.  How long does it last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, until May.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And is that cheaper than his regular tuition?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's slightly higher, but not much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it's like a bargain considering, you know, to do all this.  We pay about $19 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well and that includes all the food, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, just his food and his shelter and classes, but not land trips, is about $24,000.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how much is the university?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About, about $19,000.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For just tuition?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, that's tuition and, and, uh, and dorm -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And dorm but not food?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And food plan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right so it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's for a semester, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's about -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's about $5,000 more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What a, you know, what an experience of a lifetime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's right, it's well worth it.  In fact, it's a bargain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guess um, from someone who, I'm not at this stage yet, college fund for the kids -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got devastated by the, I didn't even think of it, you know   -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh by the market, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's retirement money, so you don't even think about it, just how to use it, but I've got a kid going to college in six months, and lost half of the college fund.  It's just, you know, terrible, just terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they're a lot of excellent public colleges, like [DEIDENTIFIED] and things that are underrated that, you know, really just don't cost that much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, in my day, you took loans out and you just -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, the whole burden was not on the family.  Do they still give out, uh, lots of aid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, so there's financial aid, and there's, uh, [INAUDIBLE] Canadian colleges, there's some good colleges that no one's heard of in Canada, besides [DEIDENTIFIED] which is like, and that's like an Ivy League almost.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, it's cold though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kids are smart enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I ain't going to Canada.  All right.  So, uh, and what year is he is school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's a [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's a [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, and he's like, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, I've known you a long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's running his radio program, and, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know what?  We met [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whoa.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we're almost at our decade.  We've got a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whoa.  Throw a party.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> An anniversary -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Alumni reunion, 10 year.  Um, yeah, so, so, but I think of your son, for you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In high school [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.  Um, and no suicidal thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You feel hopeless or helpless?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, not often.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not often.  You mean fleeting?  You get -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Flee, fleeting, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I mean, this is not something we have to worry about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your concentration's decent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, pretty good.  Do have a problem getting, starting other people, especially like when he cleans in the house to, to rearrange my desk, which becomes very disorganized.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, uh, can you read?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Oh you mean for a long -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Can you stick with it without distracting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you, and you're getting your work done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty much, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not spinning your wheels or, you know, or grasping anything and doing other things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I do that.  Sometimes I get like involved, like I forget that, uh, you know if it's really interesting then I'll read up on, I'll read too much on something or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You get, you lose yourself -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I lose myself in things, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's great, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  That's what I, yeah, that's, that's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That counts as pleasure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you getting decent pleasure, enjoying things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, finding more pleasure.  You know, and generally -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you getting some belly laughs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, or, or chitters I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're not, uh, all right.  But it's robust enough for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean it's, I always have low expectations for the holiday season, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are the holiday plans?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just, just stay home and not see anybody, and then emerge in January and do lots of stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Become a curmudgeon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but your son won't be coming home or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he'll be coming home in a week.  We've decided, he doesn't come home for Thanksgiving anymore because it's, well, he doesn't want to because it's so unpleasant to travel and it costs twice as much anyway, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he comes home for Christmas?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  He'll be home for about a month -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you'll go with him down to the Bahamas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we'll, we'll go to the Bahamas with him, and then we'll see him again in May.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Will you spend like a week or so there vacationing or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  We'll be over there like a little less than a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've never been down there.  That should be nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, take 2 mg of Klonopin every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's about what I usually take, 2, 2.5 at the most.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take Provigil, you're still taking 4 of them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it seems to work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It gives you the juice, especially to do your exercise, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know, sometimes I feel like I, I guess I have time release cause -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, it lasts 12 hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh that's, that's not a time release?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, it's not a time release.  It just, that's the effect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I was wondering, if, uh, I know sometimes I feel I can sleep on it in the day, and like wake up and feel, it's not just a rest that I feel more energized.  It's not, it's after this has hit my bloodstream, okay -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's why I thought it was, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The [INAUDIBLE] you take 3 a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that seems to be enough?  You're not relapsing?  You're doing fine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, what would 4 do?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, well, listen.  We've had you on, you know what, we did have you on 3.  You know what, your wife gives us a hard time when we over medicate you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It depends on what it is.  Sometimes if, uh, she doesn't like me working if she's in bed to sleep.  Sometimes I like to work at night, you know, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could, you could try an extra one if you want -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I can?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and you don't have to take it all in the morning.  You can take, you know, the fourth one let's say at noon or something, or split it up 2 and 2.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  I'll let you know if that would -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll try that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, try, so I'll put here you are around 30 to 40 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, I have people all the way up to 150.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, you do?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it usually goes -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that the most [INAUDIBLE] of the MAOIs or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Without a doubt.  It's the greatest medicine ever made.  In fact, this article I was reading, uh, now is, uh, about MAOIs, how underused they are and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What a shame it is, cause so many people need it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, a lot of doctors are scared away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, cause there's been some deaths -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, so, anything where there's death and lawsuit -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not a, not a growth industry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but there's, there's death in every, whatever you do, you know, like not doing it, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well yeah but you don't get the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They sue for, inaction.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, for example, you know, I take care of the sickest of the sick.  You would think that have plenty of suicides, because I, I'd say 75% of my patients are suicidal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One or two over a decade.  Well one really, over a decade.  That's very, very low rate, and I hospitalize almost no one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the point is, when you use it when it's time, you get far -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lower, uh, negative outcome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was reading, also, is that, you know, is that thing about that kind of suicidal blowback, you know, from some of these meds, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I'm also reading that you can get that from talk therapy as well, is, is it, it's just coming out of depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it's not necessarily the medicines, and it's not that it's not risk, but it's not, therapy, is that from the meds or is that from -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It looks like in kids at least there is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some risk of charging up suicidal thinking, not behavior -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But thinking, and we know that suicide is interesting in that it runs separately from depression.  Suicide runs in families by itself separate from depression.  You know, suicidality is a condition.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well you know, was it the [NAME OTHER] family where they, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] the last guy that jumped out of the window, you know, so I think they all did, a lot of them.  So yeah, she's, she's seen that, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And there's, uh, so there's something to do with impulsivity.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, uh, anyway, so if you, if you have bad depression and that condition -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're in trouble.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, do you need prescriptions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess I'll take a Klonopin.  I had, I filled it earlier in the month cause I want one, um, [INAUDIBLE] before the end of the year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In, in fact, um, with the prescription stuff, try to get as much as you can when you're here so we don't run into those -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, so you're giving me every [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We just refill the others, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I have some refills on, I think just Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just Klonopin?  And then, uh, I'll uh, let me shut this off while I describe the illegal things I'm doing.</p>

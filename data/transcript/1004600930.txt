<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi! Come on in! (pause) I should have let you know last time that I started recording last time. Is that okay with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And just to let you know, you're confidentiality is absolutely protected. We're doing therapy in the Midwest. You know, it's like everything is changed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My name and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah. Well your name wouldn't appear in it in any way. But any names...I guess if I said your name in the session that would be changed. Any names you talk about are all changed to different names. I just wanted to let you know that. [00:00:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (pause) I guess I can talk about my weekend. (chuckle) It was okay. I mean, it wasn't...it was a weird time for me. I had an interesting experience and just food for thought I guess. I met...I stayed with Graham (sp) and I guess I went just to get away just because things were getting so oppressive and I was just constantly thinking about Victor staying at home and everything. My room reminded me of him so that's why I went. The whole time I still thought about him. (chuckle) [00:01:39]</p>

<p>You've got to relieve your mind. But yeah, I don't really expect anything from Graham (sp). Maybe at the back of my head it was like, "Maybe we'll have sex," but when I actually started spending time with Graham (sp) it was like, "Oh yeah! It's not very nice to spend time with him," I remembered. We had a little bit of disagreement and he told me that he thinks I'm still a kid, I have childish tendencies, and he couldn't be close with me because of that. [00:02:30]</p>

<p>I guess Friday was okay. We had dinner and then we took the train back to Aurora. We were intimate for a little bit and that was alright I guess but then we went out to hear some music and then we came back and I guess fell asleep. In the morning we were just kind of intimate and then I guess I wanted to do stuff to him but it didn't quite work. And he was like, "Well oral always works," and then I was like...I didn't want to just because the whole time I was being intimate with him I was just really sad and I missed Victor and I felt bad about doing this to both him and Victor. And I was just watching myself do that and thinking, "Is this really happening? Am I finally going to be able to disconnect my heart and my head from my body?" I guess older people do this, right? They have casual sex with people they don't really love. And I've never really done this until now. I guess that's my sexual immaturity or inexperience, I don't know. It's just not me and I just felt bad that I was doing something that I'm not completely comfortable with and forcing myself to do it. [00:04:05]</p>

<p>So I said no to him about that and then he's like, "Why are you worried about?" And I was like, "Yeah, I guess just hygiene," and he was like, "Okay." And then we were in bed until nine or ten and I just started complaining about getting my tea. He said, "Let's take a shower together," and I kind of refused again and then we went out to this little grocery store where he bought stuff for brunch and he was going to make me brunch but then I guess I was acting like a kid because I just wanted (pause) my tea. I just wanted to do stuff my way. The whole time with Graham (sp) I felt like he was pushing me around and I was just becoming a doormat and I hated that and I hated him for that. So he cooked and he asked me to do stuff and the whole time he was a little (pause) upset it seemed. And then after he ate he got up and he started cleaning up and I don't know why, I just sat there. I don't know what came over me. I just was like sad that instead of being normal and being happy or whatever and saying, "Oh you made brunch, let me do the dishes." That's what I should have done. That's what I normally would have done if things were right in my head but I don't know why I was upset at him and I just sat there. [00:05:40]</p>

<p>And then I took the dishes to the sink and he was like, "Can you please clean that up?" and I was like, "Well my tea is cold. Let me warm it up and drink it and then I'll do it." And he got upset and I realized and I said, "I'm sorry, I'm trying to apologize," and he was like, "That does not sound like an apology (inaudible)." (chuckle)</p>

<p>And then for the rest of the day he planned to take me to his hairdresser so I could get a haircut and that again felt to me like he's pushing me around. Why does he want my hair cut, you know? I couldn't see it as something nice that he's sharing his hairdresser with me. (chuckle) Then he was like, "I'll drop you there and I need to be by myself right now so we'll meet up later." So I was like...I felt bad and I kind of tried to apologize and said, "So much for the haircut." He was there for the whole time. I think he left for a little bit and came back when I was getting my hair cut. [00:06:50]</p>

<p>And then he was like, "So now we will go to a park and we will make out." (chuckle) This is the way he said it. It was just so unromantic and unflattering and last time when I went to see him in February I felt that same thing, like that was my first time being so intimate with someone who was not a myth, someone who I didn't love and wasn't in a relationship with the whole time we were hanging out and not being intimate I felt an aversion to myself and to him. And I was feeling that same thing where it was just like, "Wow, I don't even feel like kissing you. I don't even feel like being with you. And I have to do it." And I did it but it was just I felt so (pause) wrong about it.</p>

<p>I had already texted my friend when he said, "I don't want to spend time with you," so she replied and the three of us had dinner and again I was just like, "I wish Graham (sp) would just leave, you know? (chuckle) I wish he would see that I want to be with my friend." He sat through dinner and then he left. He went back to Aurora and my friend and I, we hung out at the station just talking. She went through something similar but not quite I guess. She was with a guy for nine months and he broke up with her and she had fallen in love with him so she was really obsessed about him. [00:08:21]</p>

<p>But yeah, I mean like...so when I went back...I went back to Aurora, to Graham's (sp) place, and I realized he had made his bed in the living room and he gave me his room and I was relieved (chuckle) because I didn't want to be intimate with him. So I just went...but then I felt bad. I realized that he's not like Victor. He's not kicking me out. He's opened up his home to me and he did make me brunch (chuckle) and he's giving his room to me and he's not forcing himself at all. So he's nice and so I just told him that I appreciated him and I was sorry the way that I was acting and he was like, "Well, you know you act like a child and you're just not generous with your spirit and I cannot be close to you. I do not trust you." And I said, "I accept that but I want you to know you mean a lot to me as a friend and I don't want our nine year friendship to...I don't want to ignore that." And he...I gave him a hug. [00:09:47]</p>

<p>I guess...I just didn't like to hear that I wasn't being generous because I feel...I take a lot of pride in the fact that I feel generous or I want to be generous but I guess lately, especially this weekend, I was completely somewhere else. I went to see him but not really with my whole heart and sole in it, you know? I have to keep my guard up because he doesn't want a relationship and he can be kind of mean at times so I have to maintain that and that makes me a little...a lot less generous. I wonder why he said that. Maybe because I didn't give him a blowjob (chuckle) or I didn't take a shower with him or I didn't offer to do the dishes. When we went shopping I didn't really hang around him the whole time he was trying stuff on and giving my opinion. (sigh) [00:11:00]</p>

<p>It's just the way he makes me feel. I feel rotten about myself. (pause) He said he would help me shop for myself and we ended up in an expensive shop and I spent 500 dollars on four things and I think that whole thing was building up because Graham (sp) is kind of well to do. He's inherited some money and he's bought his own place, a really nice place in Aurora. You can see the whole city from there. You can see everything.</p>

<p>So I was thinking, do I begrudge him his success? Do I begrudge him his wealth? I probably do because I have an aversion to wealthy people. I feel like if my dad just had his act together I would have been...our family would have been so much better off right now. He was smart and he was a physicist but he only worked maybe five years of his life and then everything just went down the drain for him. So I feel like if I hold him responsible for us not being...not having much money, I (inaudible) on my shoulders and all that. And I guess I begrudge Graham (sp) his...the fact that he's inherited money and the fact that he has a nice place and he doesn't have that many responsibilities. [00:12:33]</p>

<p>I used to be a lot generous with him. I was his friend because both of his parents passed away while I knew him and I felt bad about that and I would send him greeting cards and books in the mail. (pause) I completely stopped doing that for a while. (chuckle) But I guess when you're intimate with someone it completely changes the dynamics of the friendship also. Everything is measured, like how much you give to them, how much you take from them. It's like an account is being kept, you know?</p>

<p>He told me that I act like a kid and I was just like, "Yeah I guess." (inaudible) I have that...different ranges (ph) of people are saying this about me then I guess it must be true and I should find out more about that and work on myself. (pause) [00:13:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At what point did you start getting intimate with him? Because it sounds like you've known him for a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well I guess when we first met he was a librarian when I was a student at the university. I was just graduating. I was still with Jeremy and kind of breaking up with him and Graham (sp) said he had a crush on me and I said, "Well, I'm in a relationship." But then he was just so interesting and different that I just continued seeing him, hanging out with him, and at one point we were intimate. I think he kissed me and I gave him a massage (chuckle) in bed. It was just very short.</p>

<p>We used to hang out. So we'd hang out when we first met and then he moved away from that place but we kept in touch via e-mail. I was applying to graduate school so I sent him my essays for comments. (pause) Yeah, and like three years ago, when I first moved here, he came to visit and he was in a bad place and he tried to kiss me and I said, "No, I'm with David (ph)." (chuckle) [00:14:53]</p>

<p>And then in February when I was completely going bonkers (chuckle) I went to see him and I knew that we would be intimate because he was attracted to me and I guess I was attracted...but no because in December — not this past December, two Decembers ago? — I went to Chicago to see a few people and I was going to stay with another friend but I stayed over at his place and we ended up kissing. I wanted to do it just because I was attracted to him but I was kind of still with David (ph) in a sense but things were kind of bad between us at that time. I was feeling very used by David (ph). The whole money thing was there.</p>

<p>But yeah, this time it was just expected but my heart was so not in it. Like last time, my heart was in it in the sense that I just wanted to be intimate with him and I was invested in that moment. But this time I was completely a little shattered (chuckle) from Victor (sp). (pause) [00:16:24]</p>

<p>I don't want to be that person who's so bitter and begrudges people everything. So yeah, he inherited some money. Lots of people inherit money and he's actually not that arrogant about it. I mean, he's a little vain I think, and that bothers me but (pause) (chuckle) I'm not his girlfriend. What does it matter to me how vain he is? (chuckle) I want to be generous. I do, I just don't know how to get back to that phase. (pause) I hate that I'm becoming this bitter person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're feeling bitter?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I just...seeing other people happy I guess makes me bitter. (chuckle) It's not good. (pause) [00:17:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like it taps into this feeling of aggravation, feeling deprived.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, probably. I mean I do feel deprived a lot. I tend to think in those terms. A lot of people are deprived but they don't think like that. They focus on the positive. I don't tend to do that so that's precisely the reason I'm becoming so desperate about things, about writing, about sex. It's like, "I'm still a virgin. That's must mean I missed out on this very, very important experience." Whereas it doesn't have to be that way. There's lots of people who don't have sex and they are 30 or 40 and [they were all 25 as in this case] (ph). (chuckle) I mean, yeah, I shouldn't...yeah, I don't know why I think of everything in terms of that I've been deprived of stuff. [00:18:43]</p>

<p>I mean, if you feel the need for something and you're normal, you just go out and get it right? (chuckle) I don't know. But you go out and get it but not in the desperate way that I might be acting right now. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This sort of most recent difficult time, it started in February when you got the rejection from one of the schools you applied to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and just like one of my stories that I sent everywhere that was rejected by everybody. It's just like...it's ridiculous. I really don't have my head straight because I write crap and then I expect it to get published in the best places. I don't even take a step back and analyze that no, this is just getting worse and worse. I have certain strengths. I've been published before. I've won awards so it's not like I'm completely delusional that, "Oh, I think I can write." It's not like that, you know? (chuckle) I can do good stuff. I can write good stuff. I just need to have my head straight and think rationally about stuff and know that these are my strengths and this is what I should be writing and not just set myself up for greater and greater failures. [00:20:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel you're setting yourself up because you're not writing what you're most talented in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's like this bad pattern where you know you're going to get hurt by something so you do more and more and more of it just to torture yourself. (chuckle) So I feel like that's what I'm doing. I write one draft and then I send it off and I'm like, "Oh, I'm waiting for the call to come and them to say how lovely it is." (chuckle) (pause) And people do say in their rejection that they like a lot of things, it's just not right for them is what they say. Which means it just needs a lot of revision. It just needs to go through several versions. That's all but if I could just be strong enough to do that, you know? [00:21:14]</p>

<p>There's too little time and I just keep getting (pause)...I don't know. There are too many things that I want to write about so it's like running around like a headless chicken trying to write about everything and then everything not being stellar, everything being shabby and half-assed works.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be the difference between you're being invested and writing things that did so well versus now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It was just a different time when I was in MSU and I had structure, I had teachers, I had deadlines, I had to write. I was just very, very motivated and driven and very confident. (chuckle) It sounds cocky right now but yeah, what I wrote my teachers loved and they approved and they approved it so much in class that I ended up alienating pretty much everyone. They played favorites a lot and...I sound so cocky right now. (chuckle) But that was the thing, the award...they give this (inaudible) award to the best student and they gave that to me and that was...I guess that, in a way, maybe it went to my head also. [00:22:46]</p>

<p>Yeah, there was a contest and I stayed up one night working on this story. I revised it a few times, sent it in, I won the contest. It was just like things were that good for me in the sense that I knew what I was good at and I did that. I had the strength...and I was living right in my place that has become oppressive to me, working on an old computer. My mom was still there, sleeping, and I just had some cold coffee and I stayed up the whole night. I wish I could just replicate that whole night, (chuckle) coffee and [paste it] (ph) several, several times on my calendar. (chuckle)</p>

<p>(pause) But that's what I really miss about being in school, just having that constant approval of my teachers and knowing that I'm doing well and I'm continuing on the right path. But it was just a one year program which is the problem so it got over before I could get used (chuckle) to that routine. [00:24:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that was sort of the last time you felt good about what you were writing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's been three years or longer.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:24:10] to 00:24:30)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there was something about being in that sort of relationship with parental figure who you wanted to please and in turn for pleasing would give you sort of adoration and love, that that was what motivated you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there was not...my parents have not really been that kind at all. My mom's nice enough and she loves me and we've been together since I was born but (pause) she's not really warm and friendly and giving the kind of approval and being the kind of parental figure parents usually are — being strong and being (pause)...I guess Victor (sp) was like that a lot which is why I like giving...like losing him is hurting so much. The first night when things started between us, the things that he was saying, he said this and this and he's like, "Why are women always quoting me?" But he said, "You can always come to me, even if you kill someone, you know? You can still come to me. Things can never be that bad that you can never come to me." I guess he said that when I said I was suicidal and he had just lost his cousin. [00:26:06]</p>

<p>And at that time I was kind of shutting him out. I just didn't want to talk to him that much because he was David's (sp) friend and we were kind of friends only through David (sp) and I never really hung out with him alone at all. Every time we hung out David (sp) was right there and they would always talk about neuroscience and I would just hang about in the background. But that was the first or the second time even that he and I were actually face to face connecting without David (sp). And he said that to me and I just kind of...I let my guard down and I started opening up to him. And I guess I'll always see him as this strong father figure sitting on the couch in his nice home that he's built for himself and like his apartment, I mean, and kept it up and stuff. And I just want to be by his feet. (chuckle) [00:27:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By his feet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why his feet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. The first time I barged into his place that's what I said and he did reach out to me and he did put me on his lap and comfort me. It didn't work this time. (pause) I guess I always do have boyfriends who are father figures. This time around it was like even more even though I'm older. But he was just that strong to me or my image of him, the ideal of him was like that.</p>

<p>It's probably for the best, obviously, because I was leaning on him so much. Every time something happened, recently I mean, David (sp) got upset or said something my instinct was just to like reach out to David (sp), reach out to him. (pause) And he had probably had enough. (chuckle) If we were not intimate he probably would have been fine but since we were and I fell in love with him he probably started evaluating me in terms of a potential girlfriend. Who wants a girlfriend who's always leaning, doesn't have a back bone, and is always crying on their shoulder? [00:28:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's almost like you feel getting romantically involved with someone makes things sour.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What about (inaudible)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well like you said if you were friends he'd be fine but since you're intimate he's not fine with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's my understanding. (pause) Yeah, I mean...but then things are just even more complicated because he's David's (sp) friend and we both feel guilty. And my squeamishness in bed is really just me shutting down to him because first of all there's the David (sp) wall and second of all when he said, "I'm polygamous and I don't...I love you but I'm not in love with you," that just kind of put me off and my body just kind of, in a way, it made a response but certain things shut down.</p>

<p>I mean, I still have to deal with the breakup over David (sp) and he is just such a small part of my thought process right now, I mean compared to Victor (sp) and other stuff.</p>

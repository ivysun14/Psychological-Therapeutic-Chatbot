<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine. Also, I got the report from the [ph? [0:00:10] clinic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And looked through it a bit. We can talk about it now or another time, it's up to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now? Okay. So (pause) let's see. Let me (pause) say—so I am not a—obviously not a neurologist, not a neuropsychologist, but sort of, earlier on, especially in the first few years after, like being in practice, I did a fair amount of work with kids and grownups with learning disabilities, ADD, and anxiety and depression-related stuff. Specifically as it related to school work, which meant that I read a lot of neuropsychological reports, like reports on neuropsychological type things. So probably, I don't know, for a year, something like that, for a few years.</p>

<p>[0:01:17]</p>

<p>So I read a lot of these kinds of reports. And this is quite different from what would, at least in this area, be a standard report. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) They—I guess what's different in particular—it looks like it's—I have not read through it super-closely, but I've kind of glanced through. The history is well-taken. That all looks good and standard. The test they administered is really the part that's nonstandard. </p>

<p>They (pause) the usual battery of tests one would administer for a neuropsych report would be somewhat different. I think the only—the two that were familiar were the Conners, which is a rating for ADHD symptoms. Then the Beck Depression Inventory is a standard inventory for assessing depressive symptoms. </p>

<p>[0:02:34]</p>

<p>But there is a lot of stuff they didn't do that would generally be done, and I've never seen a report that included scans. Now, again, I'm not a neurologist, so in a way I'm not qualified to say much about them, but I am a bit skeptical that I've not really heard of people doing diagnosis by a brain scan. So I'm a little skeptical. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Particularly because being in this area, there is a lot of research done, NGH has a number of labs, as do some of the other clinics around. Where they do researching using FMRI and other types of brain scans, and I've not heard of any of those labs using them for diagnosis. </p>

<p>They may say things—there is a lot of insight, for example, PTSD and also ADHD (pause) involved—like some neuroanatomical differences. So like there are (pause) trends or general differences you could say between the brain scans of people who have PTSD or ADHD or controls [ph? [00:04:12]. Certain structures are different sizes. There are also neurochemical differences I think, at least with PTSD, that are very well documented. </p>

<p>[0:04:19]</p>

<p>That's not the same as diagnosing it that way though. And I don't think—I've not heard of that being done. You know, that's not a research literature that I read, so it's possible it is, but it's certainly not in general use or I would have probably heard it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that makes me a little wary. (pause) And you know, that said, we kind of know you have PTSD. It's not sort of up for grabs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But (pause) Yeah. So I guess—but I'm (pause) I guess I'm a little cautious of some of the conclusions they draw based on those, the scan data and some of the other data because it's not something that I've really seen done before for certain. But you know, that said, I will read through it more carefully and see if there is anything that seems helpful for our work.</p>

<p>[0:05:49]</p>

<p>Also some of the dietary recommendations, those are pretty nonstandard. I know that (pause) let's see, what'd they say? Like I suspect that (pause) a lot of what's recommended for diet like relating to learning, emotional and behavioral problem, as they say, is not very well founded like in the research. </p>

<p>[inaudible [00:06:46] people have lots of different opinions of that though. Then maybe some of it works, but it seems to me like it's pretty important to distinguish between like, you know they talk about the benefits for dental health of exercise. Those are extremely well documented. </p>

<p>Like study after study after study shows that in general for people, exercise helps anxiety and depressive symptoms. The same, I don't think, can be said of avoiding caffeine or eating a healthy diet. I mean, within some limits of course. But it doesn't mean it isn't true. But to sort of throw that all in there together, as if it all has the same basis of evidence, like makes me a little wary. </p>

<p>[0:07:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I'm a little cautious about some of that. You know, that said, again I'm not an expert. Those are research literatures that I read. But I guess I do feel like I do have a sense of what's kind of standard practice and recommendation around these sorts of things, and I feel like I should say something about that. </p>

<p>[0:08:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think part of the reason my mom wanted me to go there so badly was because it wasn't standard and it wasn't as (laughing inaudible [0:08:12) medication. So... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing while speaking) I think was, in her mind, sort of the value added. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. (chuckle) I understand. (pause) Yeah and (pause) I mean if you wanted, I could certainly find you someone who is a neuropsychologist who could read the report and give you a much more informed and expert opinion about the (pause) sort of soundness of the conclusions they drew from various results of the tests. If that's something you want. I mean, it's up to you. But I'm just saying, if you're interested in that, I could try to find somebody that would [inaudible [00:09:05]. </p>

<p>[0:09:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm, I mean based on—I had a follow up with...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: a different doctor [inaudible [00:09:07] last time. Based on what he said, I think, I mean I'm going to keep these things in mind especially...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: like with uneven activity within the two poles and sort of weird cycling stuff. Which is interesting, but I mean in the follow up the doctor was saying that he thinks overactivity in the right temporal lobe is a big problem and that managing that is a priority.</p>

<p>[0:09:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he said, you know, medication-wise he recommends Lamictal [ph? [00:09:47]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lamictal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I really—that's really unappealing to me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you tried—have you been on that one before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no, but people on the Internet say it makes them feel stupid and have trouble recalling words.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. </p>

<p>[0:10:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he said a really low dose. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not recommending it, I just didn't know if that was one of the things you had tried or not. Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And I mean for migraines they recommend me—I'm taking [inaudible [00:10:13] too. So it's not a shocking recommendation. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, Lamictal is a pretty standard mood stabilizer. I see a bunch of people who are on it, and (pause) and I can think of like one person—there are a couple of bad reactions you can have on Lamictal. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There is a rash. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I saw one person who had a rash like that even after he'd been on it for a few years. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is not good. But, you know other than that in my small, non-representative sample, people have generally been okay with it. I've not heard people describe the side effect you're talking about, which is not to say they don't exist. I'm not at all saying that. </p>

<p>But (pause) I guess I—it's up to you and I know how you feel about medication, but I would want to know what the real base rates [ph? [00:11:12] were of those (pause) sometimes it's really good to listen to the chatter on the Internet to hear things you might not hear elsewhere, but I guess I, you don't know what else those people were taking. You don't know what else is going on in their lives. (pause) I don't know. I would want to know what other kind of research for those sort of problems were for that medication. You know. I'm really not trying—I don't care what you take.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>[0:11:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't have a stake in it. (chuckles) Yeah, Lamictal's a standard thing. A lot of people who try it find it helpful. And I know of problems people have had. I've seen them. But (pause) not one of the medications I've heard people complain more about, relative to like an SSRI or even a stimulant. But that's not to push you to do it. But yeah, you might want to look at what the documented rates of the side effects are [inaudible [00:12:35] look at that. </p>

<p>[0:12:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know like is it one person in 10,000 who forgets words or it is one person in 10? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean all the people on the comment boards I saw who had that problem were on pretty high doses. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But what if I made myself stupider and I didn't even notice. Because if you're a little stupider you probably wouldn't recognize it. But it would still affect you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. Some people who are writers and professionals and stuff are on Lamictal and who don't (pause) see either in their own perception or other perceptions of their work anything like that for them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe </p>

<p>[0:13:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But again, you know that's a very small sample I'm talking about. So—I really don't know what the general trends are. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. One thing that also made me a little hesitant...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... was this part of the right temporal lobe that's really hyperactive for me is the part that does sensory processing and integration. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's something I want to be doing a lot of. I mean, if you're writing a novel, you want to be bringing in a lot of different sensory experiences and bring that to the page. That's something that's important to me. So it's sort of an unappealing thing to try to shut down. I guess. </p>

<p>Although in theory you can only think about so many things at once. I think they were suggesting that that activity was taking away from left brain activity which includes language and reason and stuff like that. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:14:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were saying that they found higher activity in the right front temporal lobe based on the scans and that that should be managed and maybe through Lamictal. And your concerns about effects of dampening that down on your, I guess, intellectual functioning generally and writing specifically?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because when I was doing critical work, I was interested in like interdisciplinary relations. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the ways in which the senses affected each other and how they were together. It seems like that's a pretty important thing to me. (laughing) I don't want to get rid of it. </p>

<p>[0:15:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need—yeah, see this is where it gets tricky for me because I guess I would want to know first whether it's sound to diagnose increased activity on the basis of a scan like that before I went through his whole cascade of thinking about treatment. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know. I think that's the sort of danger. You—"Okay in a way hypothetically maybe it's not true or that's not the way you look at it, but alright. Let's pretend it's right. And then we'll think about what the treatment options are. And then I'll think about what I think about those treatment options and how that relates to my life." And I don't know. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[0:16:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe there are questions about where it starts—you know (pause) I guess, yeah. I'm wary of the conclusion in the first place. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, for example, (pause) my suspicion, again I'm not trying to say I'm any kind of expert in this at all. The guy who did the test was a neurologist, and I'm clearly not a neurologist so this is not a very well formed opinion. </p>

<p>But what I suspect is true that if you take 100 people with PTSD and a 100 people without it, you will see some general trends let's say in the electrical activity in different parts of the brain or in their neuroanatomy, you'll see certain regions that are bigger or smaller or whatever, right?</p>

<p>[0:17:14]</p>

<p>That's a very different conclusion—to be able to say that in general is quite different from then pulling out a 200 first person [ph? [00:17:31] and saying "Which group does this person belong in?". It's a little bit like saying, "We have 100 men and 100 women, on average men will be taller right?" But you know, that doesn't mean that the next person who comes along, you can tell what their gender is based on their height. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's my concern. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's, I suspect, why they don't do diagnosis this way most of the time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah that's a good point. (pause) Yeah. And I've been trying. When I was worried about Lamictal, the guy gave me two other pieces of advice, to try going up to 1,000 a day of GABA. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>[0:18:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't been able to go beyond 300 because it makes me so sleepy. And then to try a really high dose of taurine. So do two weeks of really high GABA and then two weeks of taurine. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are those like—are those standard psychotic medications or alternative medications? Because I don't know—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alternative. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was wary about the Lamictal. He said, "We'll try these first, and if they don't work, we can try Lamictal. "</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>[0:18:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I've been having a really hard time getting myself to take a high dose of GABA. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: GABA's a neurotransmitter right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's not supposed to go through the blood brain barrier, but I think I've had enough concussions that my blood brain barrier sucks and things can get through it. Or for whatever reason makes me tired. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a million reasons it could make you tired (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have no idea. Yeah I would—would you ask Dr. Wiseman [ph? [00:19:26]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Although, I don't know, I'm just so hesitant about any medications now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you (pause) in my opinion, you're not in the kind of shape where I—clearly, you're not—I'm not going to force you to take any medication. You could walk out of anybody's office and decide not to take something and just not do it. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might want her opinion though. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>[0:20:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling while talking) If you don't want to take something she prescribes or you're worried about side effects or any number of other things, okay. But that's different than saying, "So how many—what percent of psychiatrists would ever prescribe GABA or taurine?" (pause) </p>

<p>I mean—Omega-3 okay, that's sort of alternative, but a lot of people prescribe that. I've heard of psychiatrists prescribing it like in studies okay. I don't know, maybe GABA is too. Maybe GABA is on the west coast and they don't prescribe it here. I have no idea, but I guess I'd want to know how far off the beaten path I was there. </p>

<p>[0:20:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she would probably be able to tell you. (pause) I don't know her well, but my general sense of her is that she's not going to say, "Sharon didn't take my recommendation to try this medication so I'm going to get back at her by telling her something."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just want the help and I imagine that she would give you whatever help her informed opinion she could, apart from what you want to do about any of her suggestions, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I think it would be good if you talked to her about it. But you know, it's up to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it were me and I were actually going to consider doing something like these recommendations, I would talk to a neuropsychologist. You know send the report, have a half-hour or hour consult with them. And they would tell you—just make sense. "It's a little unusual but it's a reasonable way to do things" or, like "No fucking way." I'm not in a position to say that, although I can tell you that, I've read one or two hundred neuropsych reports and this one looks quite different.</p>

<p>[0:22:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think—I've looked at the research on GABA</p>

<p>THERAPIST:: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the main problem is it's not supposed to go through the blood brain barrier, so most people just say it's useless, don't waste your money. </p>

<p>THERAPIST:: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It clearly does something for me, although I'm not sure how I feel about that something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, the something that it does isn't necessarily—it makes you tired right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And sort of like relaxed. I mean it's good if I want to go to sleep. But I usually don't want to go to sleep. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Does that mean everything that makes a person sleepy goes through their blood brain barrier? In other words, because it makes you sleepy, does that mean it's psychoactive? Or are there other ways to induce sleepiness?</p>

<p>[0:23:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Theoretically. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have no idea. I mean it's not my—I could imagine that something doesn't have to be psychoactive to make you tired. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean Chamomile tea probably isn't psychoactive, although that doesn't make me tired either. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I only slept an hour last night (laughs.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my god. I imagine you're tired anyway. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there more to talk about this for now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>[0:23:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although. It was sort of unfortunate. They did it in two steps such that you give your history to one person who records it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then you talk to the actual doctor. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it was sort of unpleasant. I don't really like getting through the stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, this person, that person, the other person. And then the doctor I talked to moves. So I had to do a follow up with some different doctor. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was sort of irritated. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although I guess sometimes people move and you can't stop them. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Right.</p>

<p>[0:24:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the guy who did the follow up was this type I'm very familiar with from high school and such, the Texas protestant who plays in a worship band. I just—I could just tell. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ugh. I don't want your advice. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that was neither here nor there. (laughing while speaking)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) I see. Just annoyed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He said he plays the guitar, drums and bass. I kind of—I just kind of knew and then he said that and I was like, "There you go. He's in the worship band." (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But umm. Hmm. Oh well (sharp laugh). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Let me know if you want the name of a neuropsychologist. I know a bunch of them who could [inaudible [00:25:11] </p>

<p>[0:25:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean right now, with no insurance and... (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...all that is probably not the time. But... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I understand. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But if at some future time I have insurance and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just hoping I don't get into a car accident, which is always something that's very likely for me to do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) (pause) So another good reason not to leave the house. Not having insurance. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhh. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) People don't usually get injured in their homes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? Is that true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) I guess I imagine people do get injured in their homes. I don't know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably not like going to the hospital injuries though. (laughs) (pause)</p>

<p>[0:26:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's strange. I got back like late Monday night. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I haven' been back to my own apartment yet. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You staying with Jeff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which always happens when I come back—the transition period. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But luckily Sue is out of town for a few days with Columbus Day. So that's a big relief. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But. Uh. I certainly haven't been happy to be back. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:26:57] sort of nervous about (pause) about talking about it or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>[0:27:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just kind of sleepless. It's strange. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nervous about coming in here and talking about being back? Or nervous about talking about it with Jeff you mean, overnight? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of nervous about talking about it here, which is strange. I mean we talked last week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) It's not like anything that new or shocking has happened. I didn't rob a bank in the last week or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Umm I don't know. Just being here makes me feel sort of lame, and I don't want to talk to anyone (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) umm . Like I wish I could do something successful before talking to anyone. Because then I'd have something impressive to say. (pause) But you can't be a success in a week (laughs). </p>

<p>[0:28:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (pause) Are you feeling lame coming back here after a few months without more I don't know, that you feel better talking about? In other words, is it partly like marking the time since you've last been, where you feel you're at and stuff like that that's contributing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm (pause) well it's more just that. Like the last time I was here there was a chance of going back to school, and now there's not. And just being in, what feels to me, like the university town, given that everyone I know here and everyone on my block is (pause) being here with that possibility totally gone is just sort of a new level of misery. </p>

<p>Although, it's sort of a relief. It's been pretty clear to me in the last week that I'm just not in any shape to be in the program [ph? [00:29:25]. (Pause) Because I just feel so fragile and anxious and afraid of being around people. (pause) I wish I had worked it out such that I could maybe wait a year or two to sort of regroup, but... (pause) I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:29:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not on leave anymore, you're just out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And you know when I was last here there was sort of hope that I was (pause) that I was improving. I'd be ready to go back soon. And sort of having to admit that I'm just not at all ready is tough. (pause) It just makes me feel inferior to pretty much everyone I know. (laugh while speaking) (long pause)</p>

<p>[0:31:09]</p>

<p>And Jeff got frustrated with me the day I came back because I had two [ph? [00:31:14] applications due on the first. So like I thought I'd finish them on Sunday night, but then I almost missed my flight because I was editing something I had already edited that I wrote months ago, that I just hadn't planned on working on again? (chuckles)</p>

<p>It was just going to go in. I had—it was like a 30-page [inaudible [00:31:40] and I was trying to send out (pause) I wrote a new opening, because my first opening sucked. (chuckles) I was trying to send out newer stuff on the hope that it was better than the older stuff, although that's hard to know you don't have the sense [ph? [00:32:03] (pause) So we were taking this meditation class at the Insight [ph? [00:32:10] Meditation Center. So we came straight from (pause) the airport to that. </p>

<p>[0:32:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I finished up these things and sent them in. I got the last one in at 12:30, and I was terrified that the portal was going to close at midnight. But I sort of suspected that they would keep it open for the east coasters until like 3 am our time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I mean, I got them in by 12:30 on the day they were due. But I think Jeff was displeased that I didn't get them in by midnight because it's stressful. My computer died and I left my computer charger, my house keys and my car keys in Texas. (laughs) Which also—you know almost missed both legs of my flight. The second leg I was just spaced out and almost didn't make it to the other terminal in time. (laughs) (pause) </p>

<p>[0:33:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I imagine (pause) I mean (pause) it sounds like it's really hard to be back. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's making you feel really sad and inadequate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just really—there's no place for me here and no reason for me to be here except Jeff. But I don't like this city. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have anything to do here that I can—you know, you can freelance from anywhere. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. (pause) Jeff also...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think it's worse. I think it's not just that you don't happen to like this city, it's that (pause) it comes from too not being at school and a lot of bad memories from here. (pause) You feel alienated from a lot of the people in the communities that you know here. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:35:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: All of that's very painful. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. And I still, whenever I leave the house, I feel so afraid that I'm going to see someone I know (chuckles). It's really tough being outside. Umm. I just never—I've never had that experience in my life anywhere else. I always loved to get out of the house, you know? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>(pause) </p>

<p>[0:35:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And whenever I try to see the positive in the area, I just sort of remember back to my first—there was a period of like a few days, probably like three days when I was sort of happy and hopeful after the initial turmoil and before the secondary turmoil. There's just such a short window, no more than four days, when I was really optimistic and happy and thought the houses were cute and the trees were nice (laughs) you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>[0:36:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the I just—ever since then, I've just associated them with misery.(pause) And I mean, trying to make myself like it reminds me of just how delusional those three or four days were, when it seemed nice and like a place where things were going to happen. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>[0:37:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And do you try to think more positively about things here, or see it more positively, you just feel like you're deluding yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That makes me feel stupid. It's like, "Didn't you learn any lessons in the last two years?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>[0:37:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the kind of things that you should use to cheer yourself up when you don't have a lot of material to work with, like houses are cute, it's like, "What are the cute houses to me? What are they doing for my life?" (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really hard to convince yourself that they're going to change [ph? [00:37:53] you that much (laughing while speaking)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>[0:38:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess when it comes down to how you're actually feeling, it's (pause) really unhappy, alienated, inadequate, ashamed, frightened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I'm really worried about...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Frustrated?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Umm. I'm really worried about money because [inaudible [00:38:44] hasn't gotten the assignments together yet. And they're asking me to look for some sort of part time job that's unrelated to, you know, things I want to do. To do [inaudible [00:38:58] is unpredictable. (pause) And that's sort of tough because I really don't want to do something that would put me in contact with a large amount of people. So I'm thinking of looking at like part time nannying or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>[0:39:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe other freelance, but being in the sort of vulnerable financial situation makes me vulnerable to other people. It's really scary and unpleasant. And juts the knowledge that I might have to take a job where I have to interact with a lot of strangers is really scary. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>[0:40:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's been this sort of—in the last couple of years—this sort of like almost like reflex suicidal feeling that is just sort of there in the back of my mind pretty much all the time. And in—since maybe like May or something through summer, and even when I was in Texas with the bad news, like there were days when I didn't feel like it. And actually sort of actively wanted to live. </p>

<p>And that was sort of a novelty, when usually it's just sort of like, well I'm not going to be immature and hurt people or that sort of the rationale going on. But it was nice to have something that just wasn't like negative. </p>

<p>[0:40:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah it sounds like it was nice not to have to disagree with it at all. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's—that's that reflex feeling has been a lot worse since I came back. And it's sort of unpleasant. Like that makes me feel lame too. (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh just—you know—makes me feel weak and immature. (pause) And like I should have learned some better coping mechanisms by now. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:41:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you scared of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. There were times—there have been times when I was. But (pause) not now. Umm. I think I'm stable enough that nothing would sort of get me past the guards I have up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially since I'm not drinking right now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean when I jumped down a couple flights of stairs [inaudible [00:42:12] years ago, I was really drunk. And I think as long as I'm not getting really drunk I'll be fine. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you jump down a few flights of stairs? I don't think I knew about that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My junior year of undergrad right after I got back from study abroad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: After those things happened. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:42:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I sort of ran out in to traffic a couple of times within that month, but it was always a result of drinking. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. We have to stop for now. Does this time work next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll have to check. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll see ya. </p>

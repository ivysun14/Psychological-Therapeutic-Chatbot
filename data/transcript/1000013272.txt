<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: One, two, three, four; one, two, three, four. This is interview number seven. One, two, three, four; 90729107. OK.

</p><p>PATIENT: Good morning.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hi. Good morning.

</p><p>PATIENT: Was that Lucy calling you?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Un-huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's what I thought (laughter). She seemed a little more drunk or whatever (laughter). She's like one of those people to - that's funny. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's really funny. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You changed.

</p><p>PATIENT: I've changed. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes you did.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah dare I ever want to talk to you about that change. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's incredible Jacquelyn. You never really - I never really understood that I put it on. It's a slow process. It takes a - took me about a month and a half to really get it very well developed, and it's been two years. It's like there's a number of people who know me with the beard only, and so I shaved it off Saturday. And I saw one person that I knew on Saturday, and they were just horrified. And then I saw a few more people on Sunday, they were equally horrified. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: And Monday came, and I went back to work and everybody - people I even only remotely knew came up and commented. That's really going to take. You know, it really is. And I felt like, oh hell, quick, put it back on. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Please (laughter).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Susan can't really understand the impact of it, and I don't know anybody who, in this day and time, who had one on and taken it off. These are the people who can probably really understand, and - because it say's so much not to tie (ph) them, unless you're free to - about your, almost about your alignment, you know, [polarize the silence] (ph). And I guess I'm really becoming dependent on it making a statement for me. That in an anonymous group of people that made a statement where a clean shaving me doesn't make any statement at all, and ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A statement about where you stand.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. [2:46]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I understand.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right and it's funny the reactions I've gotten. Some people have really - they were really, I would say comfortable. I've become very uncomfortable now. I guess the reason I want to talk about it is that I don't how much of that is me. How much of that is reading into it something that's really not there? I could hit you on a day where you felt particularly, you know, you had a problem of your own that you're trying to think through, and it would seem that you were indifferent.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I don't know how much of that really is me, and how much of it is real. But I haven't - I have felt uncomfortable. I really think I'm dreading tomorrow night. I teach a group of dental assistants' downtown, and I'm dreading going down and hearing all their comments. I guess I just been covering (ph) just to bow out, and it puts me such that I really don't know how to operate. I went Christmas shopping on Monday night. I went out to Bargain Castle; real hassle in there. It's a real kind of a big discount place for toys, and I just want to have glove laces tightened and Susan came - we came back and Susan said, "God you sure were shy and very condescending and your ..." She said, "You've been shy since you took off your beard. Your not, you're scared." I guess it's scary. How much was that beard just a not - it's a part of me, a non-entity. Just like three or four pairs of pants that I usually wear. Nobody makes a big deal if I get a third, fourth pair of pants, but how much of that fear was just an issue (ph) like that and how much of it was a real big thing. [4:48]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds like it's hard to separate whether it's a big thing for you or a big thing for everybody else. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like [I should] (ph) - you behaved some ways because you had it on kind of.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, right. It allowed for a certain degree, certain degree of more freedom. It certainly attracted attention. Not around New York or Chicago, but I didn't always stay around New York or Chicago. When I went downtown, it certainly attracted a lot of attention. When I went to River Oaks Shopping Plaza out here on 159th, it attracted a lot of attention. When I went to [eat out] (ph), it attracted a lot of attention. And even my advisor said that I, you know, I said - we were talking about the beard, and he was very against it at first. But it seemed like he began to like it and began to like being with me with the beard so that - I said, "Well what kind of impression would we have made in Las Vegas?" He said, well he said, "Looks like we've made as good an impression." You know, which is kind of - it really kind of struck me funny because he was probably the single most critical person. 

</p><p>He liked to joke about it, but that statement at least implied to me that he not only accepted it, that he was not exactly happy with the idea that I shaved it off. God it really, really gets to be a momentums thing, and Susan's response is you're making too much out of it. It's just another affair. That is what she said Sunday. She said, "I just want you to go about just be normal." And like now she said that thing that made me shy, and I just don't think she really wants to hear how I feel about that. [6:54]

</p><p>She suggested that I shave it off. I had been thinking serious about shaving it off. She said, "Well when you tell people..." She said, "I think you're telling them too much." She said, "Just tell them you just thought of shaving it off." And it's not quite that simple, and I don't want to bore people with - it's not that accumulation of hair, it's more symbolic than that. And I think what people are asking is have you changed, and then they ask why you shaved it off and everything. Why you shaved. And then this is just way out of walls (ph) and bounds. I don't know. And I haven't had anybody I really have felt comfortable with talking about it and letting out all of the funny feelings that I had, or you know. Monday this fellow that I only remotely know came up to me and said, "You know I shaved off my beard one time and I felt so self-conscious, and I put it right back on. I shaved twice and then put it right back on." And then I thought, why you are saying that to me? What are you really trying to say? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like I sympathize with you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Was that what you were trying to say, or please put your beard back on? It's the same way - the same sorts of things happen when I put it on. People come up to me and they say, "Golly, I really always kind of wanted (ph) to help you." So after enough of this, enough reinforcement on that line, it really began to hit home. There was something that it was there for, and shaving it off was very important. Jimmy cried. He didn't know who I was. He knew everything I [was about to do] (ph). Tylyer and Joseph were very upset. They thought that I should go back upstairs and put my beard on like I put your clothes on, and it's really ... [9:14]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But feeling somehow a lot of people have not invested in your beard.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, damn right Jacquelyn. I guess that's were I get, I think, and that's what I don't know, but I think it's that way. I think that's the way it is. That's the way it feels. How accurate that is, and how much I'm reading into that, I don't know, because it's been three day now since I've been back to work, and people really just need to settle in a little bit. But it's hard. Like for instance, I went to - I go to a clubhouse two days a week, and it's a small class type of people. And the instructor was about 15 minutes into his lecture, and he's talking about something very, very interesting. He was talking about ribosomes and he turned around and said, "Have you got something missing?" He said, "You shaved" right in the middle of his talking about ribosomes. Then he went right on back talking about ribosomes, and (chuckle) you don't - I just really wasn't prepared for that. I wasn't prepared at all for that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like a few things to me. One, I mean like your shock of realizing that somehow people saw you with a beard, and they just, they had you pictured that way, and so whatever it meant to them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And the other, I guess, you're - it must be a bit strange to you I'm guessing, right (ph)? I'm not different. [10:54]

</p><p>PATIENT: I want to hope that I'm not different.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah maybe that's it. You're just kind of wrestling with, "Do I feel differently because I took it off?"

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And then see everybody reacting to me and think I'm different.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because there was a certain reaction pattern that you got into. Like, and this was especially how it would feel to be crowded outside your own element. I mean outside of Central Park. There's a whole reaction pattern that you got into for stopping at a filling station. You get out and look around. You could just see the expression on the person change. And then as you begin talking, he became at ease again. But you could use the word gas oil and motor oil, things like that, to put him back at ease. But all again, there's always these kind of feelings. There's also a very real feeling that I guess I'm free to - I feel free to admit, but it doesn't help much. It's what, it makes me almost want to run back and put the beard on and face that fact that it's a real attention getter. 

</p><p>I mean I didn't run across another beard in Las Vegas. I never run across another beard in a dental meeting. You see, and it was a unique type of thing because it seemed to make a statement about where I was.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were trying to make a statement then you thought [you couldn't help that] (ph). [12:38]

</p><p>PATIENT: My statements seem to be a matter of yeah I can - you can be free. You know, a very stayed profession, you can be free to do this. There are dentists who are concerned, and it seems to say to that not all people with beards are going in between one injection and another. See I wear a beard on when I'm lecturing. I guess I really depended on it there, didn't I? You had to do it before. God I just had (crosstalk). No big ordeal. No kind of ritual or right, but I guess I really came to depend on that making a statement for a lot of people that I would otherwise be anonymous to them because I can get them now to staying with the same situation and there's no statement to make unless I verbalize that statement. And it really seemed more comfortable to say the statement by the way my face looks. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think that, you know, maybe they could - they could kind of [dealt with it] (ph) was going to put it in and act accordingly. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Something like that] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you wouldn't have to say it directly to them. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right and especially then in wearing of a beard with that statement because it's so unexpected and that's why. And I guess it's something that I always wanted, that I always wanted to be needed. I always wanted to be doctor (ph) - to be somebody.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it really felt very good to kind of stand up on your feet. [15:00]

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, very good. It made it a lot easier then to move in certain circles because that's why in not being able to converse for the first time, and then with that, it was their fault. See I was the free one. If they couldn't converse, it was their hang-up. And I kind of just realized that you have your own duty. And the thing that really upsets me to is that Susan doesn't seem to either be able to or want to hear what you're saying either. I think she has a lot tied up in that. She suggested that I shave it off because she said it didn't look I smiled very much. That I looked mean [kind of] (ph), you know. And in fact it does disguise most of your lower very facial expressions, and then people have to rely a lot of your eyes when that happens. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I haven't thought of that (laughter). 

</p><p>PATIENT: So it's a - I don't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Lets you - you feel like you can't really talk to her about it.

</p><p>PATIENT: No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's the feeing she has?

</p><p>PATIENT: I feel like she can't hear it because she doesn't - she feels some certain responsibility for suggesting that I shave it off. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Suggesting (crosstalk), yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm sure that's part of it, and so she second guessed that by putting it down, you know, "I think you're making too much out of it. I'm really getting tired of hearing all these stories about what happened to you beardless." She said at the outset when I grew it, that if I didn't stop talking about wearing a bread that she was going to reshave it off. So I'm not really going to make her shave it off. She's going to keep at me to shave it off because she didn't think it was going to hold (ph) [17:22]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's something that, you know, that you get reactions to. Well you're damned when you put it on and you're damned when you take it off, but you can't put promises to that because then you'd be ... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. There's nobody I can really sit down where you - just what to you do? Sit down and say, "Well let's talk about my beard." Well frankly you're the only one that I feel like I can do that I think. I don't even, you know, I just really don't even know how to sift through all the feelings locked up underneath. I felt ugly without it. I always felt like I was uglier with it, but then I take it off and I felt really ugly, very fat. People will say, "Golly you got fat cheeks now." You know, and all this sort of thing. I mean that bothers me. It's interesting because it seems that it's very much a conscious issue. I can rationalize. I'm just going [to be a] rationalization, but how do you rationalize it? 

</p><p>And the fact that in going and coming, you usually don't have that many coming (laughter). That's something, you know, there - it's not about some organic basis I think. God I mean what do I do? Do I put it back on and - the comments were about six to one negative that I shave it off. Of course that's here. Now in other places it may be six to one [for you] (ph). What the hell am I doing, six to one. Oh why am I keeping tabs? And this begins, I guess, to open up a whole issue of where I am in the way people see me. Like I said, I bet their - I'm real bizarre for wanting to be someone. I would of glad to have been a movie star. I was glad to have been a politician. I leaned a bit early in running for the high school type political offices that defeat was very hard to take. [19:52]

</p><p>And, of course, I got defeated very badly because I was always running. And I would in a class of say 750, in my senior class, and I would run for senior class president, I get four votes. I knew one of them was mine (chuckle), and I couldn't imagine who the other three people (chuckle) were. That's where I felt uncomfortable (ph); that kind of rubbed off from putting you down. I was on the ten most disliked people on the senior class list, and these things do something to a young man, especially when he's in a - in adolescence. There was nobody to tell. I didn't really talk to my parents. My mother didn't want to hear it, and my father just was very, very aggressive. He really couldn't hear it either. He really didn't want to hear it because it was very important to him that I be accepted. It was important to him that I be superior. He couldn't take which one I was, and I didn't get any help from them on those issues. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like in addition feeling some [of them were feeling] (ph) that it really was awful to be there on the list

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah well the point that I shouldn't be, you know, don't worry that; don't worry about that stuff. It wasn't as blatant to say, oh, you're on the list. It wasn't like that. It was just like, oh don't worry about it. Popularity's not worth a damn - whatever. Population was always very important to me. I can remember so clearly the words that my father said to me. And I was getting on the train to go away to college, and my mom slowly died (ph). We're sitting in a train station, and she'd gone - she had taking me across to eat from the train station to this little greasy (inaudible at 21:57); this really gross place. And we both gotten our lunch for 55 cents for the (inaudible at 22:05). [22:05]

</p><p>And my father's supposed to meet me, and so here we were sitting in the train station. And my father wasn't there, and he wasn't there, and he came. And he could barley walk, he was so drunk [and he looks over at me] (ph). And I remember telling my mother that I was scared, and she said, "Well don't be scared." And then my father came over and he said, "Well I want to tell you one thing son." He said, "I want to tell you that when you go away to college ..." He said, "Don't ever open your mouth." He said, "Opening your mouth has gotten you in a lot of trouble in high school. Don't ever open your mouth. Just be very quiet and reserved and study hard because if you flunk out, then don't ever come home." I just don't say a word, and then I get on the train and the train gets about three blocks out of the station, and then we hit a truck. And the driver's there, and he's worrying to death and all this sort of thing. The train catches on fire. I am not saying a word. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just been glad you weren't hurt.

</p><p>PATIENT: (Crosstalk). And I went away to college, and in the back of my mind, I kept saying, "Hey that he was right. That I was always a - I was never what I should be." And I didn't finish for two years of college. And instead of having a - instead of being very high in my academic pursuits, I almost - I did very well on the first mid-term; very, very well. And I looked at it and I said, "Oh god I was doing well." I didn't want to do well, and so I busted all my signs (ph) in my seat, (inaudible at 23:57) seat. But anyway I got to where I couldn't do other than well, and by the time I finished the second year of college, I was doing quite well. And then I [never forget what] (ph) happened. No one really accepted who I was.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I bet that seems very clearly to you. Don't show yourself because everybody wasn't bizarre. [24:27]

</p><p>PATIENT: Or they didn't like it. Even more blame than that. They [misread that] (ph). They didn't like it. They didn't like who I was. My father didn't think I was enough of a loner. My mother thought I was too much of a loner. My older brother and what is now my sister-in-law thought that I was some sort of a dirty old man. They couldn't realize that I was having problems with that sort of thing. All they could do was criticize. And really in my early years, I had no one that I could really just (inaudible 25:08), and so I turned to myself. And I became very self-sufficient, but always in my mind I always felt, you know, wish this whole feeling sort of brings back to these talks from all these years ago. There's a certain degree of acceptance; a certain degree of uniqueness; a certain he's OK feeling. And it's so complex because really, I just found it really to be - I like the acceptance, but I don't want to part of the group. I want to be unique, and I want to be accepted, and I want to be me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: In a sense that they're giving it to you in both groups. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To be unique and accepted and (inaudible at 25:00). I am unique and accepted and beardedly, whatever that is (laughter).

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But like you could really be (inaudible at 26:06).

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. So the - these are things that are really ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's only like a theory basically is that you want be unique. You want to be me or else it won't be equal. [26:25]

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. You see, I think, as we - as I talk about it, this gets down to the issue of why - when we first met, I talked about the fact that laws needed to be fun (ph). Almost like what I would imagine someone who was using an excuse when their paranoid here. It's - and everybody watching them sort of thing. Well and maybe what I'm saying is not unparanoid. I hate their words, and I'm glad - I guess this is one of the reasons that I'm here at the counseling center. I would hate to get my file and see rubber stamped on it, paranoid schizophrenic. That would scare me to death, and that's why I guess I'm here rather than at a psychiatrist. That's why, but still it's the same - it's what I'm trying to say with that normalcy because I think if I could - the laws tend to make me numb, and they do something [like they do] (ph). And I have trouble living by those laws. I have a lot of trouble keeping my mouth closed. 

</p><p>And it's hard for me since I been able to open up to a few people back in [New Orleans] (ph), and it's hard for me to take the rejection. When she says, "Oh, you're making too much of an issue out of it. Why don't you just tell people you that you shaved it off because you felt like it?" Well I say to her, "But it's not like that." I said, "It goes deeper than that. It leaks in, it goes deeper." But I don't think she could really hear. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you really liked it, everybody understands, but it is because you ... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And somehow feel like you got [her back] (ph). [28:22]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah because she feels like, once again, that she's responsibly for it. I think both of us have a basic fault that we started our marriage with and that was if things are not right, I'll make them right. It always required an action instantly in that it's going to be here to push you so hard. You can here that I'm an a**hole, but in my way, my regiment, my dynamic, I take action (ph). If there's a problem, I act on it. And I think that's one of the reasons that she doesn't want to hear is that she feels that there's - she has to balance. She has to say, "I love sturdy (ph) hair. I hope you never shave. Don't shave today." That's where I go. So we wind up not doing any real (ph) change, but we do feel like we're happy (ph). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but in other words, it feels like it's sinking in from the other person is to really kind of understand how they feel. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I can be referring to some of that to is that fact that things are not going well at school and we - and on occasions made an appointment to teach that's good and that's bad. That shifts - that says that I can try to control (ph) me, but we're going to see about this. If we don't - if you can see about it completely that I was experimenting some, you know, I understand now. I know that that's hard, but I accomplished to really being able to work through that, which is in my - which would be good for them if they did work through it, maybe. I don't know. [30:25]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you liked to kind of give them a chance. Well it sounds like it gets more (inaudible at 30:32) then, and you feel like you can't talk because that means that you're bad. That means she's going to feel like she has to act, so I can't even tell her about it though. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well she doesn't want to hear it. I mean it's hard to say to someone who has just told you," I really don't want to hear anymore about your beard." Then say, "Well you got to do more about my beard." I don't know, you know. I get put down again. I'm frightened of this rejection that I felt from my parents. "No, I don't want to hear about that problem; bunch of bull. Just get out there and get that - get on line." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just talking about it gets to you, right. Just go out there and do something.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. If you don't like being defeated then don't run for offices (ph). I don't know. I know liking me or disliking me, the [feeling I have is hurt] (ph), and that's what I wanted them to hear. See there, that's what's come time (inaudible at 31:38). A simple little 15 minute spin in the bathroom and walking off angry as a bear. She didn't [contact did she] (ph) and it's interesting. Another thing she's trying to say about - she said, "This is [kind of] (ph) unique." [I felt like doing it for her] (ph) because I couldn't talk to her, and I felt like talking in some detail to a lot of people. I especially like talking in some detail to a lot of people, but I think the experience is worthwhile. Sometimes when I talk, you begin to lose feeling, so I'm interested of where it's hitting the person. That there's a - it is an understanding. It's the, that it's like - almost like the book Black Like Me, which is a white male who [dyed his native skin] (ph) to black. He goes back to his hometown, and he had left three months before. And he (inaudible at 32:50) in a way was an excuse to get, you know, eye of the native skin and went back at three month later after he completely isolated (ph). [32:59]

</p><p>It's kind of - and the same people who had been so friendly and so nice to him suddenly his coloring was all they could see, and this is the same type of feeling. The complexity of what he meant as a black man with the same facial, you know, same facial appearance expect for this change in the melanocytes was just actually a feeling of - he said is more than he ever could imagine. He had write a book. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 33:31).

</p><p>PATIENT: It's a tremendously interesting study basically. Well I feel some of the same features he did. Suddenly I had changed. I won't be the same person. I remember having a comment made at like our New Year's Eve party last year like, "Well we're sure glad you came. We really needed one bearded person here to kind of round out the group." So, I mean, it was a boring New Year's Eve party, yet [I just] (ph) popped it off. All of a sudden, you don't know where it's really at. But still, it's been a lot. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There you were unique.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah and Georgia's thinking that's why I shaved it off. We were talking Saturday night and Susan said, "Well ..." She said, "I really think you ought to put your beard back on when you go look for a job." So this [implied to me the fact] (ph) that she really said that. I'm like OK it implied to me that Susan may know more than she would like to hear. She understands more, and I just don't want to hear anymore about your beard. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It feels like something - what it means to you and [you're scared] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: It's interesting. In my relationship and her relationship with Jan, much as it is in the same way her relationship with me, I guess that's why (ph). She reaches a point where it becomes painful for her to either talk or hear something and she changes the subject. She's been unconscious of that kind of. She changes the subject, and it really gets to the point where she doesn't feel that she can control it all. It's hard for me to take because sometimes when she reaches that point, I'm already through (chuckle). And that's really hard for me to take. [35:29] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That would be like you just guessing that she's going to [clean it up] (ph). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. It's good that I understand that now because I know that it leaves me zero because when she changes the subject or when she says, "I'm tired of hearing about it" that makes me turn off the quiet voice (ph). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Wasn't (ph) dreaming when you said that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Last night? [I said that's what I thought] (ph); that's how. And then she feels guilty and she goes, "I'm sorry and I understand and that's why I'm here. "Oh, that's alright." But here I am still to prove this thing right and talking and I just [raise the volume] (ph), and she can't take any more.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What would happen if you said you're going to leave? 

</p><p>PATIENT: She would say I'm sorry, I just can't hear anymore. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because then it would still have the same effect.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Things I really put you through - maybe that's why it feels lonely. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess what I'm prescribing that I'm young (ph) and this is going to leave you to at least accept that. Not expecting her to not hear anymore, but ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you say [out loud] (ph) ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, it's important I be heard. It's very important I be heard. Just saying it doesn't ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I heard, but [now I] (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh it would be great if there would be no action. I would love to be able to talk and there be no action. I'm sure she would love to be able to talk and there's no action, but I was the greatest one of that. Graham, her father, was a phenomena. He was always acting on anything she said. If the little girl said this, and he bought it for her. If she said, "I don't feel good", and they'd let her stay home from school. He was always acting [in a way] (ph) ... yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [But when you're a baby, it's sort of innocent now] (ph). [37:27]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah and so when I took over, I began to get into this pattern of acting out on anything she says. I am wicked, wicked with affection like something she said. She was unhappy with him. She felt very unsure of herself, and she said, "I think I like to have a baby." Then have a baby. It's hard to admit because it's hard to admit that it might have been better alone. I don't want him to know that because I could really - I could really feel like I might destroy it. That's the same sort of crap I got from my parents because there was only 14 months difference. And the older I got, the more I realized that I was a mistake because they were very - well told me I was a mistake. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 38:34).

</p><p>PATIENT: Sure.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel when I suggest things like that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Just talk.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just say how you felt about why [you're an inconvenience] (ph). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well that scares me for one because she rejected me very nicely, and I was like pushing. And she's going to come down stronger, and that rejection will go down and hurt more, and drive me more into myself. [And, you know, my son, it scares him] (ph). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I just - because I was wondering if you had any feeling right here in my saying that because I felt like you kind of pulled away from me, and maybe it made you feel really bad this time. [39:32]

</p><p>PATIENT: Exactly and I used to feel like I could visualize how it might be. I pushed you hard exactly for that reason in our earlier sessions. Your lack of response, your pleasant, smiling face, always seemed like you weren't here. It really did seem like [she wasn't here] (ph). And that was very hard for me to take. That would be very, very hard for me to take because I need for me to be heard. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And if you weren't heard, you're in trouble. Some kind of response come back would mean things to her.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah not necessarily on verbal, but at least that feeling of, yeah, the more we talk, the more I can understand how it must feel to kind of - and I seem to understand now why you're saying the things - this sort of thing. That's the response that I would love to, you know, I imply. It doesn't have to be said in words, it can be said in attention. It can be said in not doing something else while I'm talking. It can be said in some type of a way to be responsive. I almost chuckled the first time, I did chuckle to myself, but the first time you said, "Well he's like your son" because I had gotten that from Ted, and heard Susan say so many times that that's what Jan said. Oh it feels like you would [spin it] (ph). And I'd feel like, "Well here we go. It's here" she says (laughter). So I kind of - it is important; very important that I be heard. [41:30] 

</p><p>And [of course again for that reason] (ph), it's important that I hear. I'm beginning to appreciate that much. If I was in - if there was a situation in which I can undue when people want to talk. My (inaudible at 41:53) the same time, but ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like the important part is getting through that the other person really understands where you are now (crosstalk).

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, I'll step in. I've spent hours lecturing and boring people here just so I can, you know, by using the knowledge of reason in a blatant overstatements so that I begin to feel apart of that stance (ph). I could just set it up, and that makes me feel - it would, it makes me feel sort of uncomfortable sometimes because I ... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because I feel ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah like it's too much, and that's - some people have told me that that I'm just too much; that I come on too strong. That's very important to me that people would be able to understand what I'm feeling, and it's so important to me that I understand what people are feeling. And it's only been recently when I've done this. I used to second guess that by playing a comedian, and it's usually a comic. It's a comedian, if the more sophisticated comedian aspect didn't work, then like I would always become a comic. Almost as bad as balancing a glass on my head or something like that, you know, just that's ridiculous. It's very degrading, but this is the way I went through high school, you know, ha, ha, ha, ha and that ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It makes you feel bad.

</p><p>PATIENT: It makes me feel real bad, and most of the time rejected. You see I was - I [obviously] (ph) said stop. They couldn't help it, you know, I looked like a clown; again and again. [43:52] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 43:54)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean, I really felt like saying something or doing something to [off in your left] (ph). I guess right now it would really be like saying something to me to like (inaudible at 44:10) and get rejection - clown and things like that. And I don't know whether I liked to take rejection without [being afraid] (ph), or whether I feel comfortable sometimes when (inaudible at 44:26). I think that makes me uncomfortable some times for her to say, "It's OK." It's not always that crucial that, you know, that experience. I wish very much that I could shave it off and say, "Oh, it looks nice" or you know, I didn't get that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It makes you [accept it] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I made it look simple, but it's really not. And anyway there would have been, for a while now, (inaudible at 45:13]. I don't know how to help her, period. That's a requirement (ph), and I still don't know really how to handle it. I'm dreading tomorrow night, and I'm dreading the time that I go to [Frank's ex] (ph). That I was there three years ago, like two years ago, and I had my beard and nobody noticed me. And their like, "Oh I didn't notice you, you've changed." I dread going to a movie in March for the (inaudible at 45:41) because last year I had a beard and everybody knew because I was in Chicago for two years, and now I won't [see the film] (ph) in Chicago ever year. I can see the film (ph) in Chicago. Lots of people won't know me, and I get to start all over again. And that's real simple. [46:01]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's like suddenly now when people look at you entirely differently, and all of them saying something; everybody having some kind of reaction.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, right and it's not about - it's a physical aspect. Like a six to one negative made me feel like [I'm trying to be fake] (ph). Ten, you know, that would be the little push - I can go from there. What are you really trying to say, and why do you grow another beard, why? But I have fear of compulsion too. I feel so damn good when I can just get away from her with - for like a while I liked you better with a beard. I let it drop. I haven't pushed. I haven't said why to anybody. I mean I should have, but I'm just glad I let it drop.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you didn't want to scratch any (inaudible at 47:07).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. That's incredible. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Makes you feel good. It's kind of overwhelming. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It really is. I mean I was prepared for some of it though. The reactions of the children hurt and so, and Susan came home, "Well I really like it. I really like it." And then the first person I saw was this - the girls, and we spent the Thanksgiving weekend down in Philadelphia. She just [tugged at the beard] (ph), and she just loves beards. And she loves pipes, and she thinks that manly. That masculinity is a key to a beard and pipe, and she just [went on] (ph), "Why did you do it? Why, why did you do it?" I'm like, well God (laughter). What did I do?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm still here.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I'm still here, right. And I don't know who to talk to. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm here. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I know. Do you think that would work with Susan to say I need to talk [a lot] (ph)? You don't have to act like it's scary.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like what you did at (inaudible at 48:28) is let her hear how you feel. I don't know (inaudible at 48:33). What I was responding to was the feeling that somewhere - when she said how she felt, when she had enough, but you didn't feel free to say now use that because you won't speak. And it's almost like this old cup (ph), and I'm feeling like - it shows that I saying that I'm feeling a little more hesitant and somehow if you're both there, then you may decide not to talk anymore, but at least it helps you out. [49:05] 

</p><p>PATIENT: This has happened before. This has also happened on the sexual issues that she has felt like I can't take anymore, and so I don't try. And it keeps (ph) and builds up, and then it explodes again. I have really never understand it. If I say I got through and you have to listen to me, that completely takes away her freedom. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's the end (ph) game. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And that's an action. There's an action implied there that you have to listen, and that's the action. I mean you don't have to become a sexuality about who said it, but you have to listen. And she says, "I've had enough. I can't hear anymore." Which she doesn't even say that straightforwardly, but I knew I'm just tired of talking about it. That's what she says. It seems like a casual way of putting it for such a serious statement, and Susan hinges on my feelings, I think. And that's where I'm at a (inaudible at 50:28) right now; trying to gauge other feelings. 

</p><p>It's like yesterday, she asked me to come home and baby-sit from two to four, so she could come over here. And that's as hard as hell for me to do because things are really popping at the hospital, and here I come home and I - I'm home, one block away babysitting. It does no good for the kids. I make her feel guilty, and yet if I say, "Susan it's really hard for me", then her action will be not to ask me to baby-sit. But I don't know when it's going to really be hard for me, but she can't understand that I don't know when it's really going to hard. 

</p><p>Like the patients never schedules themselves for some reason. You never scheduled illness. So if I say - she asked me, "Well we can have [high tea] (ph). Can you sit for them on Tuesday?" And I'm like, "Well like Tuesday's not going to be that hard of day." I can sit for her. Tuesday comes and the place is blowing up, and I know that I made that commitment to her, so home I go aggravated. And I say, "OK well hurry back. Get back here. I got to be back by four o'clock." And I get back at four o'clock and things have calmed down, and I really didn't have to be back. [51:48]

</p><p>It's like the difference about skin color that we talked about. And that really hit home for me (chuckle), and I went home last night and I said, "Well I'm sorry I made you feel bad, but this was why." She said, "Well I don't know what to do. I don't whether to ask you to baby-sit again or what." I said, "Well just understand that if I'm aggravated, it's probably not the cause of the physical babysitting phenomena. It's because of the way I feel. I feel that way sometimes when you have sent me home at five, and I just can't make it home at five."

</p><p>But I do, and when I do come home I'm bored because I haven't had a chance to work through the day. Most of the time I'm bored, but you see the freedom that's there. If I say to her, "No I don't ever want to baby-sit", then that's cuts into her feelings. And she's not going to be able, and she - we can't afford, and she can't find a babysitter to come in all these little one hour, 15 minute, 30 minute stretches that blimp up every once in a while. Like when she wanted to go back over Lyman (ph), and have coffee with one of the girl's she worked with. Well I told her I'd come instead. Well I came home and another one of these crisis - minor crises that happened at the hospital. So I was no good to [begin with] (ph), and I end up by making her feel guilty. And then she doesn't have any clue for going over and drinking coffee having this high-paid, high-pressured babysitter at home, which I ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess you couldn't call from the hospital when the crisis developed and then said well this is a crisis now. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No because I promised her you see, and she had made a commitment. And it's very important when I make a commitment, it's very important that I keep that commitment. That's very, very important. If I tell student x that I'm willing to sit down and discuss his research, I sit down and I discuss his research. And the problem I'm finding with that very, very responsible attitude is the fact that there are times where I sit down to listen to student x, and I really shouldn't be. Like I'm really not there for student x, and am I doing student x any good by listening to him, probably not. I'm probably not. But how did student x become someone completely different? No you understand that what's important to you is important to me and, therefore, I'm not going to see him at that time. [54:30] 

</p><p>It's like, listen, I came over today, and suppose you were embroiled in something, and I'm sitting here. Are you still (inaudible at 54:38); more than likely. That's your professionality. You may not feel like you mean that much to me, and you feel like everything I said just went right off the top of your head because you were someone else, but you're still going to see me. I guess you're still going to see me. That's something you would comment, but you understand that that feeling of responsibility. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I feel the same type of responsibility not only in the hospital to my patients, but at home to my wife. I mean that's a real problem. I would rather have her understand my aggravation when I come home. "I get it." And then say, "OK I'm going out anyway."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right as long as - the way you're saying OK I made the commitment. I want to keep it even though I'm feeling really frustrated (ph) about it at this point. But you don't want her to feel she shouldn't go, she shouldn't ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I mean you're there. You're ready to do it, but just being all upset about it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right and like this is something that's important and I understood that this is her freedom, so I don't know how to handle it. It's just so - when I haven't said my peace or, as I mentioned, it may have especially happened in the problems that I had with sex because either she was tired, or I don't feel like she could hear where I really am. And she's just there because she goes ahead and talks to me about the problem she has in that way. Like I implied that I'll just be there, and I always am there. I never tell her I've heard enough, and she's not there. That's my other half. I mean that's the way I equal on the scale; if I can sit and hear her, why in the hell can't she sit and hear me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like you had enough for once (ph), and you didn't tell her?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah and [everything went wrong] (ph). We know how important it is to change (inaudible at 57:01). Sometimes it probably would have been better had I not heard it all because it comes back out. I do understand that. I understand this is how she felt very attracted to this man, and she told me about him. We went over to their house one night, and they were discussing [to her] (ph), "That I really had a very loving dream about you last night." [57:32]

</p><p>Well their discussion went on and that was only an interlude, and then we'd pick up to something else. Well it came time for her to refill the drinks, and he went out into his kitchen, and she went out to the bathroom, which is about three (inaudible at 57:49), and she didn't come back. And then I just fantasized about all these wild things. Here I am trying to carrying on this conversation [pretending I'm liked it] (ph), and tries to be all intellectual. And she came back, and I really was, I guess, wanted - on the way home, I really was out of context, "Well what in the hell were you doing in the kitchen." "Well I'm not doing anything at all. I'm just talking." And then we went home, OK. 

</p><p>But you can see how the situation - maybe I have had enough. Maybe I didn't need her to tell me the details. She felt like she needed to tell me the details, and also now I was glad that she did. But it's not, it's not that standard situation. It's really a dynamic situation. Well my problems come out in other ways too. I want to say to her, you know, you demand all this from me, maybe you're going to have to hear some (audio abruptly ends). [58:47]

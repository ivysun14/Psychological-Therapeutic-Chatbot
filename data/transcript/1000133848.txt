<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview Four. Interview Four.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and we contend with weather... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Weather, yeah, right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and so I have a good tape.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, weather makes a difference in how people feel, in how children react too...and it's kind of lousy with... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Kids are like that.] (ph) [0:00:18.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, they act differently too...so, everyone reacts differently, but you can't have everything. (chuckling) I don't know what to talk about today. I was thinking about it on the way over and I thought, "Well this guy (ph), what should I say about this guy (ph)?" And it's not supposed to be that way, isn't it supposed to be spontaneous in my life?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sometimes you can... [inaudible at 0:00:48.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...especially, if your seeing... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, they do, oh, I see. I was just...trying to re...think back of what I've already said...and what I've already talked about. And I ...I thought to myself, "Well I've surely covered a lot of ground." (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and a lot of your life where you've... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[had trouble in a lot of circumstances] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...in a short period of time (chuckling) and I thought, "Wow! For...24 years it sure went over quick." But at any rate, I just know I'm at a standstill. I...I just thought well I've talked about my childhood and I talked about my parents and I talked about my sex and I talked about...what I do and I've talked to you all about that, and I couldn't think of anything that I didn't talk about. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you kind of feel like you've said all there is to say about yourself and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I...I just...I just don't know what else to say about myself. I...I, and something I don't know if I talked about my self confidence in myself, that I lack confidence in myself, that's, and so I don't know if I remember, I don't remember talking about that, that I lack confidence in myself, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't feel like, you feel like this aversion (ph)... [inaudible at 0:02:22.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...like I, I want to be a very confident person within myself but I'm not really a confident person and the only person whose going to change it is me though, you know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Life is kind of up to you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...with your self confidence?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that happen to your feelings, like how can, what do you see yourself doing that makes you feel unconfident, unconfident [in how you're feeling?] (ph) [0:02:48.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: How you're feeling - oh, that I see myself getting in a rut.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how's that, what kind of would you say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like doing...going to, doing the same job every day, I mean...going to work every day...and it's not really a rut but you're still, you're not getting, you're going, you're doing the same thing essentially but you're doing it differently every day...like when you're teaching it's never the same but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It seems like it is though?] (ph) [0:03:07.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well kind of, yeah, it feels like the same thing, like I'm not, I'm not getting...I should be going back to school and all this stuff...and I'm not, well when I should be. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I'm not sure how that ties up with lack of confidence. Do you understand, for my treatment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (chuckling) just I don't know, I need a push. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, kind of like what you really feel you should be doing is going back to school, not teaching?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well I feel that I should be going to school while teaching or I'd like to go back to school and not teach but at this point it's kind of impossible but I would like to do that...just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel kind of like it's your lack of confidence or is lazy if there's a lack of confidence or... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true too, maybe a little bit of both. (chuckling) Maybe it is laziness, yes, I am lazy too, that's something I've never talked about either... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:04:02.1]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...is my laziness, yes, laziness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, and the appearance of not to do something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, I or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So sometimes you think you're going really do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and leave it to the last minute...until...it gets to the point where you can't stand it anymore so you do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you do it. When you're doing this like you're really forced 'I have to on that.'?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. I was all, I mean...I did that all through school too...if there was a paper due I'd...be doing it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Up the night before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, up the night before finishing it off, yeah, I've...done that all the time, many times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kind of the way your life is... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Crammed for exams.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...not to do things in stride with that feeling and be principled about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You let them pile up even more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And go, because then I don't have any choice...there isn't any choice, either I do it or forget it...and I'm finished. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow kind of like you feel your... [inaudible at 0:04:57.5] ...you should be going to school and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, I should be doing...all these things but I'm not. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know and kind of like that laziness we push through, it's kind of like with girls too a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true, yeah, right, it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're not kind of forcing yourself to... </p>

<p>CLIENT: To do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...take the initiative?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, take initiative to do it...there's no guard (ph), there's no push, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if falls in your lap with pain (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If not, right, (chuckling) really. Even, well I remember in college...and there was a couple of kids who were living in the neighborhood went to the, we went to the same college together...if we didn't get together and study or something like that I probably would've never done it, you know. And this one, this one girl...so we used to ride back and forth and things like that and study on the way and...and stuff like that, and without...someone...there, you know, "Okay, let's go, we'll get started." But I mean really...I was grateful for that. You know once I got started and really into it...it wasn't that bad...but it's the initial push that... [0:06:03.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of you can't, I mean once you find yourself doing something where you can, you do really care about it some.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You know like I'm thinking about when you were seven or...I guess I'm thinking about being a girl too though.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, anything and then I find it's really beautiful afterward...after I finish something and it's all completed and it's all done and...you've got this big feeling of accomplishment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so that it's kind of like you've accomplished this... [inaudible at 0:06:27.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] That's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's where I, I mean I really see that... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, that's it. So I know that I lack confidence within myself and initiative and drive and all that and what I need is a push. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I don't (ph) think you can... [inaudible 0:06:52.2] ...within yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. And I...I just - I don't' know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it's kind of... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I...like if it, like it was, if it comes and it's really...important and things like that, it's like I'm so afraid to start it but...it's really...I've learned [to empty it] (ph) and then go finish what I've started but it's the idea of...taking that first leap, in anything to do with anything...not just the job, even when I'm just cleaning the apartment...and I'd leave it go but then after I get started I can get it all finished in nothing flat. (chuckling) And then I'd say, "Well, that wasn't so bad after all." (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Well anything?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know everything before you do it, it seems like you push it back in some way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, you know like, "Oh God, I hate to do that you know." (chuckling) And then but after I've...get it finished it's kind of nice. (chuckling) Then I can say, "Well that's done and I can rake that off the board and..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "...that's finished." But I usually, I try to be organized, I'm neat and I'm, and I find myself being organized, being organized helps to get through a few things. I usually know where things are and...I can usually find things and stuff like that but besides that, because that really is...being the most organized and...orderly. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You have to know that [there is a meeting] (ph)... [0:08:29.5] ...somebody's going, (chuckling) you know and I'm trying to do it, (chuckling) but, I don't know, so that's my self confidence. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kind of feel that maybe in a sense that you're just dealing with 'I have all these things'] (ph) and so I'm getting this kind of feeling that...[your confidence is just very, very exclusive for you.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess...like your confidence has you just feeling like negative thoughts when you're dealing with your confidence in which...having the confidence... [inaudible] [0:09:10.7] ...and that can really just set the stage to let that feel... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]...already talked about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just getting a real sense of you... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know like that you're really serious... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: About my self confidence?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you're ready to talk it today because... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, it wasn't that, it wasn't, it wasn't I couldn't handle it...it was just something that I thought, well I hadn't mentioned and it wasn't that experience (ph), you're right, it wasn't really the greatest experience but it...I did it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of a little bit horny (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is, it really is...it is, I mean it's kind of important but I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is and you kind of felt like it should be... [inaudible at 0:10:06.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know, kind of dispassionate (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I already know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]...[and that you're going to do what you really do like.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the truth, really that is it. (chuckling) But I don't know. I guess some of it is ...the old saying, 'behind every, behind every man is a woman' and they need a push... (chuckling) a drive, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of and so if you want to get married and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, probably, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...have a wife that should be able to... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd be out working... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...give you a push.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'd be out working two jobs and going to school at night and everything...but right now...there's nothing, it's not a pressing matter...as far as going to school or anything like that, it's not, as a matter it's more... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And Tanya thinks that it's, you don't have to make these decisions... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I want to...I want to but I really don't have to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know if I had to then... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd probably be doing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I'd be doing it then...there's no doubt about it. (chuckling) If I have to do something I'll do it...but if I can...try dragging it out I'll do that too. (chuckling) I don't know why that is. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [When you can have these magical interludes?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean...like I mean I guess...I just I'm trying to think that...have I ever and it's like I was trying to think...if I, if I wasn't ever able to do anything by myself...and so it wasn't, I'm at the point where...well there's big decisions that you have to make...and stuff like that and...really...I can't remember...any big stress with something that...I had to do by myself...especially - well I don't know, especially like Texas. I always worked, we always had jobs and my parents both worked so it wasn't...this...they were always there to tell us what to do, they weren't there to tell us what to do...we did things on our own, you know. [0:12:19.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you can't...you can see that you can have those kinds of days... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...sort of use them as... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, I mean no one was always holding my hand you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is it, is it, I guess...I mean what is...like you're like thinking she could really feel about him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why don't I? Well at this I...I don't know if I'm using it as a - what's the word I want - as an excuse...or as a cop out or whatever it is, but...like now I've taken courses over at the...Ryder, whereas Tanya hasn't definitely, and they're really kind of lousy...that their professors... [inaudible at 0:13:00.3] You know you go in there and they say, "Okay, you have one paper to do and I don't care if you come or not and everybody's going to give a report on this study that was one and you're going to give us, you're going to look up this study in [such and such] (ph)...and you're going to report to the class." Well I mean...I can read (chuckling) you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:13:19.3]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, I can read, I don't have to look into someone, what someone has to say...and some other person getting up and tell it, which is really kind of sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you tend think the course is are steal time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, it is! I mean...or doing his job is probably what the whole thing is. And I've taken 12 hours and this is pretty (ph) past 12 hours when it's done that way and it's kind of discouraged me. And then I...I think to myself, "If I want to do it I'd like to do it...like go back to school and quit work and just concentrate on school." Because that's another thing, I usually, I have to concentrate on one thing at a time, I can't...take...both subjects at the same time. If I want to do something I'm going to do it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All the way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...all the way...[regard it as a loss.] (ph) So and now...I, I don't, number one I don't have the money (chuckling) and number two I'm still draft eligible and if, of course, I went back to school I'd be...I could be drafted, then I'd lose my deferment and so it's kind of like been up in the air a little bit so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about taking this because you, [you'd really like to try and understand?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's more complex, that's, that I...there isn't even, there, that I think is afraid that I'm going to be shut down or told no...like I said before...a fear of being told no, and that I would hear, there's nothing I could do about that...so if I, if like going to school is a different thing you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So I mean if there's nothing...there's nothing to do about feeling hate (ph), [there's no fear for the hate.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, that's it and, but I'm not that type of a person, I'd take it...personally...which is kind of be [a light.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you, so what I'm saying is so that...like if you do get pretty recognized, (ph) and it might be just in passing remarks, it doesn't mean that you are erecting (ph) personally, you were just... [overlapping voices at 0:15:15.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but I can't, I know what you're saying...and I should realize it but I can't, I've always...I've... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just think... [inaudible]... [0:15:23.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but everybody, whenever anybody says anything to me...and if I don't, if I, and even if a person is being facetious it doesn't bother me...or being sarcastic or something like that...I can take that, but if I'm not sure that person is being facetious or being sarcastic, whatever... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you take it seriously?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...then I take it seriously, right. Now in fact, oh, there's this one woman at work...you just can't tell if she's serious or being funny...(chuckling) and I didn't know this at first...when dealing with this person; I had not idea if she was serious...but...I didn't realize she was being funny...but after a while...she turned out to be great...hysterical...but I took it very personal, you know. I don't remember whatever was said or what was said...but I...I didn't realize that she was being funny and so I, she was that type of a person...who can get away with that sort of a thing. (chuckling) But, yeah, I take it very personally...so and...then I just kind of...crawl away (chuckling) and there's nothing more I could do...like if I...I think to myself though too...I should jump back and say, "go to hell" or something like that but I won't do that either. You know I just, it's just...I should always maintain the upper hand, never lose my cool...and just...keep on smiling, (chuckling) but that's not me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you just kind of take it as if your whole worth is... [overlapping voices at 0:16:50.5]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess that's why because if...your sense of worth about yourself kind of [fear administrative] (ph)... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, which is the truth, too. (chuckling) I don't know why, why I should feel myself so...kind of, kind of always belittle myself or something - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And at work you maybe...patronized and not like to be patronized... [inaudible at 0:17:20.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, that's true, yeah, you got it. Not liking what I was or what I am or...but trying to keep, trying to have, trying to work out what I will be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean, yeah, but it sounds like feeling very unhappy about what you are and you hurt feelings must be part of that, maybe problems with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know because your guilty about this, having homosexual feelings when you... [inaudible at 0:17:54.1] ...harder to take this, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And not being the, and not...like being the typical - what would you say - rah, rah...American-type male. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feeling strong and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like masculine. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the strong, masculine type, yes, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes you view in this person [something like that?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, that's...and that's probably why I don't like the saleswomen I work with. (chuckling) [0:18:28.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that, I think it's important to you, that you'd really like to see [that it's quite possible?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would...I would. (chuckling) I should go sign up for a health spa or something. (chuckling) [I don't think like that.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this is kind of just...kind of for you reinforcing those feelings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:18:52.3]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know just like...someone like you is very passionate... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, always.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kind of probably because you not yourself you think it's just...that they become... [inaudible]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and maybe like you fix on that I mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No one every asks if, you know what I mean, because no one, I mean is going to come out and call you a lousy person (chuckling) but you had that feeling, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And you'd sympathize.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right...it's always... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Like you can see it a little bit?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] But...be, them being afraid of other people...that you weren't as good as other people, yeah, but that's kind of dumb.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, saying you weren't as good as them so you'd stay away from them... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...kind of avoid them and just... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...try of avoid those contacts where they kind of show yourself to be... [inaudible at 0:20:15.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Be, yeah, right, uh-huh, right. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you win... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in your mind? Are you like the most... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]...confidence in you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. You need, for a person to have confidence within themselves they'd have to be...like told they've been doing a good job...even for anybody. I mean...like you really have to be...kind of like, someone has to come up and say...even as an adult...everyone's looking for a pat on the back...and to say... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:21:06.1]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. "You know you're really doing a fine job." Or...it's, it's...really kind of nice you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess in a way that there's equally self confidence involved in this and your own sense of... [overlapping voices]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like if you were in a pinch... </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...if they're worth your sense of yourself being like centered around other people's opinion of you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Other people's, yeah, that's it, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...is the only opinion that counts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like...with your parents it's like, 'no, I don't have that sense of accomplishing (ph)..." [inaudible] [0:21:37.3] </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I'd like it if I liked the attention I got from like being different."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. (chuckling) But meanwhile, oh, when I had finished...the student teaching and things like that...I mean you had, you're working with cooperating people...and then I'm looking at the same people who were my... [inaudible at 0:21:59.5] ...and she says...and they would always say, "you know there's really a fine lesson" and things like this and, "you really did a good job" and all that. And, or your supervisor came in and told you...you were doing a marvelous job and all this stuff. Well it really boosted your morale... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and then you really... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and it felt good to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you really felt good and you went out and you did better...I still think that a lot of, a lot of administrators and bosses and everything else, they don't...realize...how much people really look for that sort of thing...they, you know, "Well I saw...you really did a fine job." And even at home...looking like it was well...you didn't get, there wasn't any big to-do to make over you...no one... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No one who would kind of... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...they'd...my father was a very unemotional person and...my mother...spelling would be 'just fine'...stuff like that but she really didn't know what she was... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you never really kind of felt though that... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...she was giving you pats on the back... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but that they wouldn't be there to give you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I mean like this was very kind of stuff you felt being unable to take it, feeling unworthy of it or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, yeah, and even though you didn't...you were doing a good job and all this, but that was never really kind of there...you never really got it, (chuckling) you just went about your own business... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like your own... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...doing your own thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like she didn't try.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can really miss something like that... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...happening because you need it to make a difference (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right...even when and...like going through college...it was like that all through college and stuff like that and I remember finishing...and I thought, "Well hell...I'm, I was the only one in the whole family," you know and I said to myself, "on both sides of the family...of the gobs of cousins and everything else," I thought, "I was the only one who finished, you know." And...she didn't say a word. (chuckling) Or and there might have been some graduations or something like that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like you needed her to tell you it was a real accomplishment... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was a real... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in your family and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and she probably just didn't get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...like there was no big deal...and I remember even that I mentioned it to my mother once and I said, "Well he just...he doesn't care if I did or not." And she's, "Oh, yes he does. You ought to here him talk to other people about you...his son did this and his son did that." I think, "well it doesn't do any good to talk about it to other people, you need to say it to me," you know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you would've liked to have heard it from him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd just like to know when he, [when he's real strict] (ph) he would've never even come to you like that... [overlapping voices] [0:24:26.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, nothing like that...never would've told us...never, you know. Okay, well the only time I remember, my brother was coming home from Viet Nam...and I thought, "oh...we're all going to not be important (ph)", and that was really, there really was a question mark in my head. I thought to myself, "is he going to embrace him", you know. And I was really wondering if he would, and he did...and I was really happy...that he did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Touched you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not me, my brother. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what I'm saying is it touched you to see him embrace your brother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, it really did...it was really nice...that he did...just happy that he did, so. That was the, but that was the only time I remember him...ever embracing any - oh, my sisters...but...never one of... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not you though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, never, I mean...I don't remember him ever...embracing me or...the only time my brother was, I mean when he came home from the service. You know I didn't...and I didn't, and I said to him...I said, "I don't think, there's nothing shameful about it or anything like that." But...it's just the type of a person that he is...he won't. (chuckling) It's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's just kind of being alone... [overlapping voices at 0:25:37.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, yeah. Yeah, there wasn't, [that wasn't good.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...longed to be included [in his affections] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. (chuckling) He was a very, he's a devout perfectionist, I mean...everything will be done to perfection...just unbelievable, and he's the type of a person that can do anything he wants to do, in fact, with his hands...and just anything...and he fixed our whole house and just redid every room in the house and plastered, painted, knocked out walls...put up walls...he built the garage by himself from scraps...and he's kind of...just unbelievable stuff...that's really...but he wouldn't ever, he'd never let us ever do any of it...he'd, if we wanted to paint or stuff like that...any of us, any of the kids, I mean...he'd, he'd always end up doing it himself because he knew that what he did was...meet his approval, (chuckling) something that we did he would always have to go over and do. He couldn't accept it...that, the way we did it...even my mother, he would never put a thing up to my mother...(chuckling) and she'd...she'd say, "Okay, if you don't want to do it, I'll do." You know then, "Oh, no you won't." (chuckling) It was...it was always like...he did it and it was his way and that was it, no other way. So it's kind of like we never got to do any of that stuff, which is kind of sad because I really would've like to have learned...half the stuff that he did you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how do you mean with just follow directions?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. And I remember moving into my apartment and he's says, you know, oh, he'd like to come over and help me paint and stuff and I said, "No thanks." (chuckling) And I said, "That's okay." You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't think I did such a bad job. (chuckling) I asked him what the basic strokes were...how to do it and he told me and I did it and it turned out kind of nice, and I'm sure he found something wrong with it but he didn't say anything to me. (chuckling) But I was kind of glad I did it myself, too. (chuckling) [0:27:37.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you felt a pride in it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, yeah, I did it myself. (chuckling) But it was kind of difficult to accept it...that...everything was done a certain way...I mean he did tell us, he did show us how to struggle (ph) Texas. (chuckling) You don't mock this crowd. (chuckling) [Under handing these and with his struggle, you get stuck.] (ph) (chuckling) I don't know if that has, it probably has something to do with my self confidence too, because I never got to do anything... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean sure... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...by myself, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...sure and it's like...you want to interact...[see how he reacts.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You'd be faced...with his reaction.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though you kind of do with respect, you do just kind of like... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and your partners going to... [inaudible at 0:28:35.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, really. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now here you are left with, you have to do something with this problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] It's been, oh, and going to the... [inaudible] ...school and...you never did anything by yourself...you were always told what to do. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Oh, really, I mean I was never allowed to have school like that.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, you never...you've always been told what to do and you've always been kept under some very close watch of a kind you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and kind of like you expressed your worth on ledgers (ph), [expressed to yourself] (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[you're lonely] (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[ and sort of finding that person.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was always...you did it. And I, the only time that, not until I got to college did I really learn how to think for myself...and do things by myself and...go by myself...but not until then, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, yeah, and so it's kind of like...for a whole lot of your life just taking messages and none of them been written to you... [inaudible at 0:29:28.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you've like become complacent with it and... [inaudible] Think back when... [inaudible]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can do them, right. (chuckling) Like today, just like she was threatening to go, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And you thought she would.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. I think...well I'm sure...I'm sure of myself in some things, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You attempt to think through what she's saying?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm sure of myself in my job, (chuckling) you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [But that there's just some kind of feeling of...] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, as a feeling, oh, yeah...I can do that. And I'm sure of myself as far, as far as being responsible...or...I don't, I mean as like just being a son...but as far as taking care of myself, I'm sure they'll...help...as far as...paying bills and all that sort of stuff and running a household and stuff like, I'm sure of myself there. And, I don't know, being...kind of an independent on myself...as far as that is concerned, you know. [0:30:55.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [That you want them to know.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, yeah...it's no big hassle...I'll worry about it...whereas, whereas [if you mention a mouthful] (ph) then it's unfriendly...I know he's going to come and take in that highway (ph) or something like that you know. If anything ever happens unusual...I mean drastic, [I mean I don't know he gets so cold when he's down at the roundup,] (ph) scared and...kind of apprehensive and scared at first when something really serious comes up...but then...like, but...after he, usually you and...I make out...whatever I do. I mean and...one time I remember being, I was drafted...because I had to sign up and all sorts of stuff...and so a friend of mine...we drafted a letter...I mailed it everybody...in the whole country (chuckling) and they made a mistake...and just they didn't realize I was in school...at that point...so they made a mistake...but I remember...taking it and just kind of sitting down and getting these letters written and just...taking hold. Oh, sure my family...well after I got through like going in front of the draft board, I mean and I said to myself, "well I'd better...to get the whole mess straightened out" because I didn't want that hanging over my head...so I did that...in seeing myself through it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of handled the pressure (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...as it came in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...really...as it came up...if there was, I wouldn't, and I wouldn't ignore it because I know you can't ignore it...there's things you just can't...if there's really... [overlapping voices at 0:32:35.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you kind of feel this kind of bridge (ph), like...you can handle in some cases... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...unless maybe a whole lot's made you feel really sad about things (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, at first you realize that it's, it's really a crisis...and all this stuff and there's really a lot you have to do, but after you get... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once you get started... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...started, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know you have to do it the way... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and at least kind of take a... [inaudible at 0:32:55.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] Really. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...so you can do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like in some cases [where you are coming to a something] (ph)... [inaudible 0:33:04.4] I don't know... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...at least something is related to the love (ph) that you may feel, so that that's...pretty nice about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. I don't know what, what's the difference then, why am I sure of myself in some things and not sure of myself in others? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It still is really a part of you that maybe you can't really tell the difference. After having experience you might be able to see... [overlapping voices at 0:33:34.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...bad experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like...you never, never even known what you can handle, so he could be... [inaudible at 0:33:45.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like... [inaudible at 0:33:48.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you're going to have to be [dependant again and you see maybe something besides smoke] (ph)... [inaudible] ...so if anything happens then... [0:34:00.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because it's kind of a peak (ph), it's a kind of usual thing...the usual kind of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true; it couldn't be bothering me with sex (ph). (chuckling) It could be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know, I know you're thinking that you [can just put it] (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [It may do me a lot of good, huh?] (ph) (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't know that, no...that we fixed your, fixed...a kind of sense of you and just that you are kind of interfering with... [inaudible at 0:34:33.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know and kind of...like just being facetious about this is probably... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really the same, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's really similar, [like I don't mean do you feel the way you do.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah, there isn't, there isn't any cut and dry answer... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...there really isn't...maybe that's it, to at least be and with my other...other things I had to do...accomplish and...conquer I could see the answer... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:35:02.9]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I knew what to do, you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I knew what to do...I could get started and go and do it...but here I don't know where to go or what to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, kind of like you're just, when you look ahead of yourself you probably see... [you're on this hitting board...you just see maybe something you like] (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you're going for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, it is, (chuckling) that's the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're just bored with it and maybe seeing everything [less scary in these times, you'd like to see it like your brother faces it, you know.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not really less scary...no, (chuckling) not really less scary, no. You know maybe even...like I, I...like I know hurt, like I said, I know her too well...like I said, and that's, there's, there's a lot, there would be a lot more at stake with her than there would be in someone who I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just didn't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...just didn't know...that's why it's more scary as a male.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But also...that you're heading into that with someone you know that would like going off again seeing that other person... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and so that you think... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that's what you're so upset about and see that's the [whole issue.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, I can see that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it's not like you can...she has more folks (ph) too... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and sounds likely to, I mean be...caught in it. She, it's going to take a whole lot more for you...in terms of her and you have to really like, you'd love to be more close with her but you want it suddenly (ph) in your life... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...even though if by the way you must be more faithful when you... [inaudible at 0:36:38.7] ...how you are revealed (ph) too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true, that's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to hold all this [in you] (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right, that's true too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and maybe in some sense that you need control the status.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, (chuckling) I do. I'm just, I'm not the most optimistic person...and usually...more meaning to it because of this experience (ph). [0:37:01.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd say if you impart that attitude that you could at least become a small... [inaudible] ....that you have felt this way and talk to her and be pessimistic about something that she [might even like some old bear at you.] (ph) I mean because she's talking about, if you approach it, it's kind of like it's not going to work... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and effectively...you are what you do and [she's actually seeing 'I'm more like him, too'.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why do you feel so pessimistic about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I guess from past experience it's...just like...she was kind of pessimistic about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But...like you also have to...when you have bad type of experience [that you don't need to run] (ph) and I think it's the whole up and down like with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, uh-huh, personally that Tanya's just more experienced in it, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I know you've kind of experienced freedom (ph) with Tanya... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but she's only one experience and she's the only one you have, but...there's every proof (ph) she's looking... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[and she's...perhaps she's just been thinking really...that she's acting too] (ph)... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because like I know she's going to say that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [She doesn't really have to really say that.] (ph) [0:38:26.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's something for the church to [say about marriage then I think.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like it...kind of like, just kind of overcome the whole thing and say, "well...I don't think I'm going to depend on this", you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because if you depend on too many people that just means the stake... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Stake, right, yeah, really, kind of just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...just like you imagined there's some trouble about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, that's it. (chuckling) That's it...if I could do that it would really be kind of nice, it really would. I don't know why I should take it so seriously...and so strongly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Because you really used to think...like with the whole, like you don't have to stay.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and kind of like really out of proportion... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Probably, yeah.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...with the way that as it is, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then in the one way maybe that it is kind of bad, [like with making love] (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know like you [put that emotion into it and then go on thinking.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know I think that this is what it's all...kind of like the way I've been brought up...like this is it...this is the ultimate, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ultimate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, relationship as far as a man and a woman is concerned and it's nothing to be taking lightly...they really must consider this very strongly and all this stuff...[it's just the way...they'd always just leave that up to me] (ph), you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you feel like that you're endangering (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...like I couldn't, I couldn't just shrug it off and say, "well okay, what the hell, let's go", you know. (chuckling) It's just...something that's always been told and taught to me. [0:39:58.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like being like the scoop (ph) of the story, what would be so scary about that I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I don't...I don't know what would be scary about it, I don't know why I'm scared about it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you scared like that maybe you won't actually personally satisfy her or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Scared of that and scared of I might not know what to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feeling insecure (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know...it's just all that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like...being a human you just feel like... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's just like feeling the ground swallowing you up because you're just... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm scared that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...just like a little kid you just have to learn how to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Scared that...like now that you're good...like, you just can't go your separate ways now...you're just, you're one now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're wedded?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know you're wedded, right, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of you expect it to [mean a whole lot more than...just Tanya loves me?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it's not as if, but you want to go in there. [audio blip at 0:41:10.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I can't help them, I didn't mean that... [audio blip] ...you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to me it's kind of like...you do have something going... [audio blip] ... or you let yourself think that you have something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like you know that's the way you've been brought up and that you're willing, but...you can say this [and you might as well just let it happen for yourself.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's doesn't, no, but it well could, I just...it's the way that I...I think I didn't even just, from not going...don't go into church...I know that's wrong, but I don't do it...I, I, I, I don't go to church...but it's...like I know that it's wrong...and I know that I should go to church...but I still...I don't go, you know. It's the same thing...I, I can say that because then...I know it's wrong, but I could do it anyway, (chuckling) and just say forget it. (chuckling) I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And as far as your not knowing what to do, I mean that's really, it's just the way you fit with those people, you pick people, people who you like for [their very, who respect your relationships but that's because...you're there working]. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And...your doing that type...people with whom have had their focus in the [rest of you...have started just respecting] (ph) a person, it could mean "they're not sure like me" but that they're feeling nervous about it... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...unsure of how they've been [read, just like to look for the reaction you know.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just it has this mystic or something where it's supposed to be something that is or isn't and it's great. I mean it's like when we... [inaudible] ... and it's...so the more you deal with it the better you feel about it... [0:43:09.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and then so maybe the less nervous you feel about it and it's...it is a natural feeling you're feeling, it's just you don't know what to do... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...so maybe you're not feeling any different than everybody else, except that you think you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. (chuckling) Yeah. You know I just - I don't know. (chuckling) I was just thinking...I just...when you were in, oh, in high school and college...and all the boys would be talking (chuckling) about...who they went out with this weekend and who they laid this weekend...boys always say that, and I'd think to myself..."wow, I wouldn't..." I was just like..."I don't want to eat this bullshit or are they really telling the truth", you know. And I...I, I just...sat, I couldn't say anything...I couldn't even tell a lie (chuckling) you know about this or that...just be, I'd just...I couldn't say anything...tell a lie or bullshit about...taking out this girl and doing this to this girl or doing like sex and all, and just wondering...like, "wow, (chuckling) is it the truth or are they really bullshitting or I'm just, or am I just being that naive or that far behind or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you might have differences.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, yeah, or being that different from them, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know and well you've probably heard them talking to you and saying...you can't feel... [inaudible at 0:44:34.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you're optimal (ph) in these situations... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, I'm different again, you know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see and the thing is that the whole time [it seems there really is much more meaning in it] (ph), instead of going vigorously just to make the best of things, for things like... [inaudible at 0:44:49.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...how is she talking (ph) to you because she's leaving.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean that's the thing, she's making you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What type of action do you take, having the [prettiest girl and having a primitive] (ph), it's like an effigy, you get all defensive because I know, I know how you're feeling with...[courage with walking in] (ph) so you stay away from it. You never learned to take the step just to see if you can see, find out that it was wrong, maybe this can be your lesson.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if you let, let yourself feel these things like this and you can kind of picture (ph) yourself... [inaudible at0:45:28.7] ...you'd...could create [just happy feelings] (ph)... [inaudible] ...and not be that [at risk?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We've got... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay. [audio blip at 0:45:44.7 - maybe a new session] You know what I'm saying, that's a big effort, because we tried to do this different, in a different way. Oh, I met this, this...met this girl [at the lecture this morning, she was gleaming (ph). (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, I know.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, "Wow!" [0:46:08.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I gather she's not Tanya?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She said, "Oh, are you going to see Jay?" I said, "Yeah." She goes..."tell him to have me over for this..." [Oh, and started saying like...you have summer reading.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, she just thought I was a great guy. (chuckling) Yeah, and she was really nice. (chuckling) That was nice. There must be some rewards in this world. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I want to know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You must have liked this girl and it shows.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's nothing much, nothing really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that kind of make you feel bad, like there she was doing it and [you'd like to know you're doing it somehow like her?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I really didn't. I thought, "Wow...it's great", you know and I thought, I had that before, (chuckling) she was all beaming and everything and I thought, "Wow, that's nice." No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Sheila wasn't there?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (chuckling) Why, you don't feel that you're making me beam or something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...it doesn't have to make... [inaudible at 0:47:09.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh! (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you're, you get...defending sort of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I see...like you're under it when it starts it. (chuckling) You have to work at it the whole time. I don't know, even at...like in my line of work too, there aren't too many... [inaudible at 0:47:27.5] ...too many people seeing what you're going to... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're going to see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...see. Yeah, right, that you can put your finger on and say, "well, that's it", you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:47:34.2]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (chuckling) Something to...give you a little push and say, "okay, that's great".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but that was nice...of course even sometimes a simple thank you or something is kind of nice... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it suffices. I never look. (chuckling) So, what's new? [Are we there?] (ph) I had the weirdest dream yesterday, last night I should say. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which was, I don't know, it was really...at any rate, you may remember I, and I told you about this, this guy...who I had...had slept with and all this stuff and I hadn't seen him for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is this the one you had a little... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...got together with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] That was...like, like I said, and he called up and I was like really surprised to hear from him...and at any rate, when he calls up and we were talking and all this stuff and he wants to come over and all this stuff...(chuckling) and I said, "Well, I don't know." "Oh, come on over." So anyway he didn't have to twist my arm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. [0:48:49.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I, I had gone, I went over there...and he was pretty on, he had a couple of drinks in him...and all the sudden like he - I don't, have you ever heard of poppers before? They're, I don't know, it's, it's some kind of thing that gets you high and you sniff them. I don't know what it is, he called them poppers or something but it's some kind of a thing that gets you high and he was going, "Do you want to?" And I said, "No." And he was, like...it's like it's really great and all this stuff and I said, "Forget it." And he was really...just, just lifts you...fantastically if you're having sex and all this and I said...like, "No." And so it turned out ultimately that...he tried to force it upon me, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like physically force you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...to do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, "You fool!" Kept saying...he's twisting my arm...and physically forcing me to try this. And I said... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...like he's rough and I was getting scared...because - oh, in the meantime he said, "Well do you mind if I?" And I said, "Well...go right ahead that's your business...if you want to that's fine", I said...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And you're right.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."it's just not for me." And he said, "Okay." So he did and in the meantime he, I guess he must have been getting higher and higher or something like that...and as he's getting...on to me, so he was...physically forcing at the time. And so I, I don't know what made me think of it or why I said it, maybe I was - I said, "I'm getting sick." (chuckling) I said, "I'm sick to my stomach." And it stops... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you were?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, when you said... </p>

<p>CLIENT: No! (chuckling) I wasn't...but I said, "I'm getting sick to my stomach." And he stops...I guess nobody wants to go and throw up all over each other or something. And he said, he stops and goes, "Oh, is that your excuse?" And I said, "No, I'm getting sick to my stomach." I said, "You'd better let me up because I'm getting sick." You know, so he did and I left. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Tell him to get with a shrink.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just...just...really just pinning me down and try to force me to take this stuff, and for...like it was like...I could smell it...but like I wasn't smelling it...you have to put it up to your nose like to get - and I, and so I left. Then he says, "Oh, you need..." He said something like, oh, he was sorry, and I said, "Well...I'm sorry too actually...if that's the game you want to play...well then goodbye." (chuckling) But then I was kind of glad afterwards, because then I, I'll never assume...again now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it sounds like, is it part of like you may be seeing it as kind of like you won't feel tempted?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, I feel tempted to do it either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you could just be more [nervous around him..] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and kind of, like he persuaded you to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I bet you were kind of feeling bad about being persuaded.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was...and I thought to myself, "Oh, God!"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it, if I'm going to have sex with him and I'm going to feel probably awful afterwards... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I mean it shouldn't have happened that way... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[if this guy knew what you were feeling.] (ph) [0:51:47.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was kind of, it was, it really worked kind of well afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I thought to myself, "You know I should've thanked that man." (chuckling) I was really... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank him for forcing it on, he kind of forced it on you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...so he probably wouldn't realize... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and then here you'd probably be sitting today feeling awful about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would've, I really would've...and that was just something, I really have thanked him...and said, "You know, really, thank you, you just kind of straightened out the whole thing." Like I said...I haven't even talked to him in months...and I was really surprised that he called...and I was really kind of floored that he did call. But, it's there and...I felt probably kind of sad, afterwards I thought..."it's kind of sad that he...that he's kind of found this whatever it is...and really...getting this high or whatever you want to call it." But it was an interesting experience I think, I mean feeling like a wrong (ph). What else is new?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing much...Tanya was saying - I went to a wedding, oh, I went to a wedding with this girl that used to live across the street. Tanya was pissed, I'm sure she was...but I...well she...like I've known her for really a long time and she was going to this wedding for this, some girl at work was getting married...and I had, I knew the guy from high school, I didn't know him that well but I knew or I knew of him and...we know one another to say hello and I knew him, he was...a guy who was really nice. And anyway...she invited me to go and I said, "Yes." And so at any rate I went, it was kind of a ordinary (ph) wedding, but afterwards it surprised me, well I...we had been drinking all night and it was about two or three o'clock in the morning...and like she's like...like the fact that like it was either, it was... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you went to the wedding with the girl across the street... [overlapping voices at 0:53:36.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, who used to live across the street... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, so it wasn't her wedding?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't her wedding...like it was a friend of hers that got married. But I said, anyway it surprised me and I said, "Oh, Marge I'm going to...walk you up to the door and we'll do the whole bit." And I said, "Well at least...how about a kiss goodnight?" You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:53:50.3]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: And okay...and I found myself getting aggressive and, yeah, that's when she walked inside. (chuckling) I thought I really didn't...it didn't upset me...to be shut down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I thought, "Well...okay Marge." You know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of like feeling kind of like you got a kick out of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, (chuckling) it was kind of a gas really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's just kind of like you didn't care much whether she did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It did, it was funny...it really was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like... [inaudible at 0:54:16.1] ...you get aggressive... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you do that and you knew in fact that she didn't want to be aggressed (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, she didn't, no. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And...it wasn't so upsetting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it wasn't... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was like a rejection?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But I'm...yeah, well of course it was a girl that I've known...practically all my life...and so it was kind of, it was funny that...that I would be standing there with her...after a girl and walk up with Marge, so. But that was, that was interesting too. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Any of this concern Tanya? [0:54:51.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: When did I see Tanya, oh, I saw her Monday night and, oh, I saw her Friday night too, but nothing...really spectacular...a friend and I that used to - Friday, yeah, Friday it was kind of a drag, everyone was tired...I mean after working all week...and she was... [inaudible at 0:55:09.4] ...so there wasn't much to do. Monday night we went to, oh, a music thing where, in... [inaudible] ...we met one another there...and I just thought of it, but...nothing has...developed since then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You haven't really talked to her about... </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...maybe what you're feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I haven't talked to her...about anything usually (ph) - well Friday night we weren't alone...we were out with a couple of, a few other people and then...Monday we just sat there and listened to this music and there really, there wasn't really much of an opportunity to talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like they tend, Tanya tends to kind of be this, kind of for you this [walking comment for you like?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't - I don't know what - she's a strange person, she really is. (chuckling) She's really strange. Like if you met her you'd probably dislike (ph) her right off the bat...like... [inaudible at 0:56:00.5] ...you'd go through the halls with a fist you know. (chuckling) But most people feel that way...and they're saying, "Who the hell is that?" she has this, I mean arrogant air about her...at first...but after a while...she kind of cools it off. So it's kind of bad...like it's...like when I, I offer to - with my family and with friends...I mean but she...she has this arrogant air and they get the impression...like she's really a bitch...and I don't want them to get this impression...that I would be associating with a bitch or something like this...and...the get, I'm sure...most people, they do...they get this feeling of, "Oh...who's this bitch?" You know and with...the way they feel about her...and she's got a quick tongue. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she doesn't, she isn't afraid to say to anybody, anything...which is a - she has no tact at all (chuckling)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...none at all. Well we were at a, well we were at a wedding and some, I, something - I had a cigarette in my hand and I don't know if I burned somebody with it or something like this, and this woman was, Sara...this ex nun, and she's standing there and she goes, "Oh, do it again." You know or something like this or maybe I burned Tanya, I don't know. But Tanya turns around and says, "Fuck you." You know, (chuckling) and I thought, "Oh, Christ." I thought, "Oh, no, right out here in the middle of the floor it's going to happen." You know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It didn't but I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you like just say like not much is going to happen with them (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'no']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you want them to just go on having [these sorts of feelings then?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know. I want...I want but I'm...like even in talking about anything...like well after - a Friday...where there's, after...we - we were...driving home and stuff like that very long...and I...I, there was kind of a lull in the conversation and stuff like that. [0:58:06.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt like bringing up something...like the questions and all this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I thought...I felt like bringing all this stuff up...and then I thought, well I don't know, but like I said, who am I to...bring up any question like that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that it didn't quite feel right and with...the timing... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like you sound like you were... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...even driving home and this time there's a lull but... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...there wasn't a real feeling of closeness there... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, no, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it was kind of something like that Tanya's just maybe more right... [inaudible at 0:58:33.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does, it does...it just...like I said...it was Friday and we had been out and everybody was tired and just kind of a lull really. I don't know and...like sometimes I really want to see her...and other times...I just, I don't want to see her...and just I don't know if you can, (chuckling) and I don't, it's just that sometimes like I said...I really want to see her...and then other times...ah, hell, I don't even want to be bothered. (chuckling) And so it's kind of - I don't know. And then I think to myself, "Well if you're really..." and I thought just, "if you're really in love with a person, you want to be with them every moment of the day", you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I could never...like no way (chuckling) that...I want to be with Tanya every moment of the day...maybe this was a fallacy too, probably...in a way (chuckling) and nothing else, but, interesting. [silence from 0:59:42.4 to 0:59:55.2] I have nothing else to say. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean there's nothing else going on or you mean... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, there's nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you don't know if you're feeling much of anything or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look kind of down...a little, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You think so? (chuckling) I'm tired, it's been a rough day at work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and you kind of look like it's been tough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. I did...I went up to Connor's and had a drink... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...before I came here, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because I was just kind of sensing you have this thing with you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you don't feel like talking about much, you don't feel like doing much today... </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know, like really going to sleep or sitting and watching television.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're doing this tense, like I have a sense of you don't feel like you can do it, [feeling it real good.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's I sleep too much...I don't, I know. I can sleep an awful lot...when I, and I force myself to stay awake...which is really kind of lousy. I shouldn't and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you force yourself to stay awake?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I think I'm wasting time...I could be doing so many other things and there's so many other things to be done... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I really should...and I can, and for a while I got in the habit of...coming home and...lying down for an hour or an hour and a half...and sleeping and I really feel great afterwards though. And then going to bed at night, of course, was a very, it was a sleep but it was a very restless sleep. [1:01:19.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I just, and I keep...I force myself to stay awake until it's time to go to bed so I wouldn't [make a mistake] (ph) And in fact, I woke up a couple of, oh, a week before last or something like that, I had gone to bed one night, I took a nap and then gone to bed that night and I woke up and I had bruises all over my arm and I said, "What the hell is this?" (chuckling) You know, I don't know and I thought, "Well...this has got to stop." (chuckling) But I don't, I could...very easily but I, but I'm trying not to, (chuckling) which is smart sort of but...I mean it's just, you really don't need that much sleep and you can...more or less gear your body towards...a good seven or eight hours of time and it should be adequate enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so kind of...you're left with that feeling like... [inaudible at 1:02:08.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (chuckling) No. I guess that's just kind of...like, at this time of the year it's, I'm getting kind of down on all this sort of teaching and stuff, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of feeling like quitting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm ready to quit, hang it up, oh. You know like I've been through the New Year...gone home and felt... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:02:30.1]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...exuberant and excited and really getting it started and all this stuff and the kids are the same way and, but...like there's only six weeks left (chuckling)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's kind of like sure and passing you through there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] Getting there...and I mean with everybody... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like when you were a kid in school, only six more weeks of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, that's right, you're counting the days, but that's the same thing with all the teachers though...we all feel the same. It's like...and in the beginning everybody's arriving...15 minutes early to get all their work done or something like that, and now nobody gets there on time anymore. (chuckling) It's like everybody's just down, down, but it will be over soon.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like what will you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, what do I do? (chuckling) I really don't have a job and I don't know if I'm real interested in finding one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean a job for the summer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know I just - like the last two years I never worked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You went to the beach?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would lie on the beach all day when I could. It was really nice...and I wasn't - I read a lot...and I wasn't bored...I went down there...took off to California and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...just spent about three weeks on a trip, three or four weeks on a trip and then lied in or on the beach in New York for the rest of the time. After a while it did get...to the point where I...had to get away, so then I'd just take off...but it's real, it's kind of nice, I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's the same as spending somewhere you last avoided something.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] Like just...at night you go around...and go places and see people you haven't seen in a long time and stuff like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:04:06.9]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, (chuckling) and I come out with fantastic dreams (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably, probably. There is a, this teacher who is a principal now who I know, he's looking for people...to work. [1:04:23.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean teach summer school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which is really surprising because there really aren't that many jobs but, and I have thought about it but I, I'd really enjoy just teaching one month and then going away for another, because I can sit by this with one month and the rest of it I've chosen to - they don't work it that way, if you teach school for a month then you don't teach long. And I...like after you teach all summer you're just kind of hoping that you don't...like in September you're back doing the same...and it really gets to be kind of a drag. And there isn't any, there isn't any...spark to go back. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, it's a nice way of life, very poor but (chuckling) you need to cut corners but it's worth it. (chuckling) What's that building they're building next door? I mean...that's just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's called the international [studies building.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It will have like departments with...sort of promotionals.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. [inaudible at 1:05:38.5]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are they going to take over this building?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, this building is like free (ph) for just med students.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I see, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I mean it's better than nothing.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Are they, they're going to stop this program in June?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The last part of June I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why, they have no money?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well like there's not enough money that is coming in to like... [inaudible at 1:05:57.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of just been a shortage of government funds in which... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...the commissioner is letting us provide it through the university.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] So it will just be diverted to class study, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, class study and research. And it's kind of like... [inaudible at 1:06:18.0] ...counseling I guess you'd say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's kind of sad. So where will people go? (chuckling) To professionals I guess. But you're a professional aren't you, you've done it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I've done this for a couple of years here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I won't have my Ph.D. for another couple of years (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, you're writing in it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So I don't know when you're called a professional.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's professional. (chuckling) Hey, if it doesn't mean anything to me... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And you're here, I know.] (ph) [1:06:48.6]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a formality.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like a ritual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. It's kind of sad, I, so many, I mean...I know a number of people who are just - all they have to do is write a paper...and they're finished (chuckling) but they just can't...they just - I don't know what it is and they just can't get started or they start it and they can't get through with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, they're in the midst of and they're really having a horrible time, and it's sad (chuckling) [you know, achieve without something.] (ph) Well I can, yeah, that's a first. I'm trying to think of something - I don't even know what else to say. [1:07:30.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kind of sensed like you had drawn a blank.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was really...I don't really know what else to tell you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sometimes...people feel that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:07:38.2]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. Really, really. (chuckling) We were talking about...you walk down the street...and like a number of teachers that I teach are there...left by myself (ph)... [inaudible] ...and so there's, it's so cold...I mean...the people are just in the north, and coming up north and...walking down the street and saying, "Hello, hello, hello, hello, how are you." You know and all this other and... [inaudible] ...and just, she was really strange.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:08:10.1]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not her (ph). I said, "But it's really kind of funny to be." I said, "That's..." I did it one morning and...like just walking down the street saying hello, hello and I would just kind of (chuckling) stand back and see this - like this one...I, this one woman was walking out of a building and...she was a very elderly person and I said, "Good morning, how are you?" "Just fine, how are you?" And I go, "Well really just kind of nice." You know, it was really kind of nice. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like it was reacting to them and being responded to by others.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, being responded to. But like the thing is that I made it a point, like if they didn't...I thought to myself, "You know a lot of people are just going to say...they're just going to ignore you or give you some queer look or something like that...but you, and you have to get to the point where it's not going to bother you or I mean, just maybe...if they're going to be insulted or ignore you or something like that." You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:09:00.1]... So like if it was something like that, you feel like it's their loss... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...if they're going to be so cold.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, it's, it's, it's funny though it really is. (chuckling) But that's why I think a lot of people, they're afraid...afraid of other people and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably haven't really had the time to and just kind of missing it in themselves somehow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] It's just, it's when you... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like in your view of people like that they're not going to be nice to you, so...when they are they, they don't know how to react to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] Like starting it...like they're very, they're living through and they're very afraid of what...people like me or somebody - and it's like they were saying like, some of the women were saying like, "If you went down the street and said hello to everyone you saw", I mean she said, "man, you'd be running down the street before you know it because there would be...some guy chasing you down the street...he'd probably think that you were some kind of a prostitute or something...walking down the street just because you said hello." You know, so it's kind of difficult. And so I said, "Yeah, I guess I can see your point." (chuckling) But...like I found it, it's kind of, kind of a gas to do. (chuckling) Even when like if someone is waiting on you or something like that...and when they say, "May I help you?" Just to say hello...it was kind of, and I was, "Oh, hi." You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was just kind of these were courtesies and niceties that just really are a part of life for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh-uh, they're not, they're just...like everyone... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like there's a sense in you that you really want to share.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] And no one would...like sitting on the bus or the train or something like that or sitting there, no one offers to be friendly...they just, no one says anything to one another. I think it's really kind of sad...so then everybody [isn't maintained for like systems] (ph) or lives within their little shell and that's it. (chuckling) [1:10:51.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So kind of like you feel a little rotten if you were living in a place where teachers... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I mean you should respond to each other and...you'd think like when, if you're shy it's okay and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and just these people would be friendlier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know they'd say hello and I say, "Oh, hello, how are you?" You know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's kind of like they want to be valued as an orphan.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] That's the truth, that is, really. (chuckling) Like everybody would get along much better I know, I mean just to - if you, if you strike up a two-minute conversation you have, you left with more than you came with, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Right, and it's just kind of lets you down.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...it just, at least...you met this person...and you may talk about the weather or something like that but...it's really, it's a lot nicer than just sitting there and saying nothing to anybody, but a little psychology. (chuckling) Then I thought also about maintaining your cool...if you ever see if a person who comes up to you is really mad or excited...you just...kind of sit there and agree with them and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you'd be very calm and cool and just put them down right then and there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of if you're famous not to be responsive is perceived as being cool (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [That's not anything cool...that's cool and maybe should be nice.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they go away feeling much better anyway...they're just...they feel, "Well, that wasn't so bad." (chuckling) You just need...just go along with them...and just maintain your cool and never get excited, they're just - I find it difficult at times but then maybe everybody does. It's an interesting study though. (chuckling) [But I still made it out here.] (ph) (chuckling) [inaudible at 1:12:47.8]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And then maybe it feels like?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really, nothing to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...I mean it's...it's okay to say nothing or jump in, like if you feel like...you're sure you don't feel like talking to me one minute and... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes those times can feel kind of... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and sometimes you're like if you're not into it then... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...probably you can like let things happen and just, you're not feeling very much today and so that presently it's... [inaudible at 1:13:28.0] ...sometimes we just sit like... [inaudible] ...and whatever you think is nice, [so it means you were very... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I hate to even a waste the time. (chuckling) I just, really...I mean I just...like I've thought to myself...about my whole problems and everything else and it's really, it's kind of nice that I've been...able to rationalize much better at how I live...and...like it's getting to the point where I'm defending myself, always, it's either you do it or nothing is going to happen. [1:14:07.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, it's kind of like some, coming to the point of law and...it's my problem... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...my problem and just specifically we're talking about sex.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, yeah. Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's my problem and...it's, I'm the one who plays equal (ph) and so... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I mean if I want to do something then I should do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right...that's a... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it doesn't get solved just with us sitting and doing nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've done that too long already.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the truth. (chuckling) That's the truth, really, really. (chuckling) But I've...I've really, I've thought about it...and like I said...I, I...I've - I don't know, I just felt different about the whole thing and...there's just a different feeling about the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:14:53.3]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like and I'm, maybe I am less afraid of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it's I'm less afraid of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I could sense that just from the first time I saw you that you were fighting with these... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like...having sex with another man, kind of like I kind of sense that it's still scary but it just kind of feels more like down the road ahead of you when you get there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, and...I can see it, it's there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, within the realm of possibilities.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, it's there...which is a lot better. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Sure, I hope it is.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really, [it's kind of like that.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...I think it can happen and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's kind of a faith (ph) in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] That's true. Of course believing and doing something about it is a different story too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess that's what you're saying, is like, "Well I feel pretty good about it and I really have got to do something about it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: But doing something about it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, what am I doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess in a way just kissing that girl, [at the time you had this little thing about it.] (ph) </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's, it did, it really did, it really did, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can, it's kind of like, "I can take this step..." [overlapping voices at 1:15:57.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right, and not... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing leads (ph) to sexual personality, be aggressive... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, right...and not being shot down. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was, yeah, I did, it was...it was kind of nice. (chuckling) But, yeah, that's when I just...like I've said, I know now, I mean just to do something about it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you, what are you thinking when you may do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know, becoming more aggressive...that's the only thing, that's what I have to do, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which, with respect to Tanya?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and...at this point, yes... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...or maybe later... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...in respect to, I mean every other woman, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's kind of like, it doesn't feel impossible to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not at all. (chuckling) Not at all, but like I said, just to do, (chuckling) that will be interesting...like, but...like I'm not, like I'm, there is kind of an anticipation about it now too...like the even looking forward to it...this, there's not a thing...like I don't want to sort be... [1:17:11.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like I want to and all these conflictions (ph) and things over... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it and I know what's going to come and I... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, you know. And it's just I don't know...like - and then...then I know I... [1:17:23.9]</p>

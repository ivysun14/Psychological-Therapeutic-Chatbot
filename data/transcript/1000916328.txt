<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I delve into this nausea, ah, investigate this nausea, which, you know, for so long you have been ah, taking medicine for is a sinus drip, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The last couple of months.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, last couple of months. You've been taking medication for it as a post-nasal drip or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, this morning before coming here, you didn't take the medicine and you felt nauseous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why I threw up. Even in the bathroom...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh you threw up. You actually threw up. Right. Now ah, that we're relaxed a little bit and you seem to be okay, let's relax a little more. Let's use a little hypnotic relaxation, and maybe we ah, can get a few clues as to what's going on as if, you know, work on that. Uh hm, you make some brief comment but with, you know, but we'll get to that later, some brief comment about "I did something wrong," and, ah, just to that point. I hooked up the tape recorder anyway. But, let's-- why don't you look at-- well, it's-- in several ways. Anyway, we can do with, you know, many ways we can do hypnosis. Mostly, it's a matter of relaxing yourself. Ah, just the way you're doing now, practically. See, you're holding your breathing over the belly there. You can feel the breathing going up and down nice and good. Well, close your eyes and reach up and down breaths, you imagine a nicely relaxed place and really breathe that way, nice and comfortable in the belly. And let yourself get a little more relaxed with each breath. That's right. Your eyelids are fluttering a little bit. That's a good sign. That's fine. We're getting there. With each breath, you know, let yourself get a little more relaxed. And in order that we have some kind of signal or recognition when you're really ready to go into a hypnotic state, ah, why don't you hold one hand out in front of you at shoulder level. Ah, you know, hold your hands straight out in the couch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, straight out, ah, well, well touch it down to the couch first. That's right, straight up in front of you, on the couch. Now, raise it up about a foot, let's say, the whole hand and arm, and the shoulder. That's right. You can do it with both hands if you want, even though the other one's kind of feeling you're breathing. Well, you'll be able to see a difference between both hands. Now, you're relaxing all the time, and breathing nice and deep and, you know, letting yourself relax and you have this nice relaxed scene in your mind, right? Now, pick a hand to get heavy and, ah, drop down. When it drops and it touches the couch or you, that's your signal to yourself that you're ready to let yourself go as deeply as you dare into a hypnotic state, a hypnotic trance of a sort, okay? Imagine filing books, maybe, on the back of one of the hands, see?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What about rings?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Rings? (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is my heavy hand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah? All right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though I don't have the have the ring on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, pick whichever hand you want and you picture whatever you want. So, anything that will make it heavy. You wanna make it heavy with the rings? That's, that's up to you. But when it touches, that's your agreement with yourself that you'll let yourself go into trance as deeply as you dare.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's interesting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's getting heavier.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's getting heavier. Ah, that's interesting, huh? Okay. Now, all right, I wanna try it again. Just go along with it, you know? And it's very easy and quick to produce these states if you really want one, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think I want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there you want to. All right, fine. I mentioned so much about it. Good, that your left hand and arm seems to be almost touching now. Now when it touches, you know, try to heave a good sigh of relief and kinda let all the muscles relax as best that you can without trying too hard. Fine. Now, the other hand that stayed up without any trouble at all, if you want to, sometimes we just ah, again, out of kind of a curiosity, if you want to, you can get that one rigid, you know. You gotta imagine it's tense and rigid and stiff at the elbow and imagine vividly, even though the rest of you is quite relaxed, imagine vividly how it would look if you couldn't bend it at the elbow for a short time, you know. Imagine how it would look if you couldn't bend it at the elbow and say to yourself, you know, strongly, that "I cannot bend it at the elbow." Just think that way. Don't change your mind. Think that you can't bend it at the elbow and imagine vividly how it would look if you couldn't bend it at the elbow. Uh hmm. That's fine. It's very stiff. Now, give it a little try but think that you can and picture that you can, a vivid picture. That's right, and of course you can. That's fine. All right, now, first, you know, let it go. Let it relax. And as it goes down, such as you let yourself go even deeper, because you have convinced yourself, you know, that you really can produce physical things in your own body. See?</p>

<p>CLIENT: With confusion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With confusion also?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Saying that I can do it and I can't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) Uh huh. Is that what you said to yourself? You can do it and you can't do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can do it and then I can't do it because I'm not supposed to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can do it if I wanna.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to, you know. If you want to picture it, you wanna imagine it, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I want to give up, I can bend it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. If you wanted to, you could bend it. Yes, that's true. We're not doing anything, you know, that you don't wanna do. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wanna try to help myself and get a better... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.Uh hmm. Well, all right. Fine. Anyway you want to. Now, (coughs) just as easily as your hand went back through space as, as it drops down through space toward the couch. Just so easily, you can drop back into time and perhaps, some clue about, you know, nausea and throwing up will come to mind. Now, if you wanna, you know, ah, will count with each breath and give yourself time to think of it. But no matter how bizarre or strange it seems to you, whatever the thought that comes to your mind ah, don't hesitate to express it. It won't bother your, your relaxation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was when I was pregnant</p>.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was while you were pregnant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I knew I was pregnant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you knew you were pregnant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Four days after my period was late, I got up about...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...six o'clock in the morning and threw up for no reason. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So that was one time. Uh hmm. Did you want to be pregnant?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not really. Right. So ah, maybe, you know, the vomiting or throwing up, ah, conceivably, at least, or speculatively, we did guess maybe that it had something to do with not wanting the pregnancy, too, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it wasn't so much why I didn't want it. I was just that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... marital situation wasn't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it wasn't mutual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You knew there was trouble on the marriage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Okay. Now ah, however, right now, you're divorced. There's no marriage trouble. What else might there be right at this point? Let's go back, you know, there has something been going and you think you're pregnant?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Right. Why isn't that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've taken precautions against it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So there's something else going on. Maybe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. There's just always ah...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...the confusion in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who I am. I was thinking about it. Uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...(beeping sound) mother of (beeping sound).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or am I (beeping sound) playgirl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm (laughs) I see. You're a little confused. Are you a playgirl or are you mother, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what is going on right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now. Right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can see very clearly now... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that that's what is going on. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible [00:09:24])</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, it's causing quite a bit of this...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is, yeah. Is there something about your playgirl activities then that's disgusting? You know, getting you sick to your stomach.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not satisfying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not satisfying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but-- right. Now, how would that get you sick to your stomach is there more than just that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, it's just that, maybe, if I was more willing to be myself and being the mother of (beeping sound), ah...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I could be married again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Yes... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And be pregnant again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And go through the sickness, but again...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it would not. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that it would be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This time you would enjoy it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be worth it, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Uh hmm. All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And with what I'm doing with the, uh...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...fooling around. I'm not getting anywhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Right. The fooling around is kind of disgusting or nauseating to you, possibly. That's, ah, it's that a possibility, let's say, or am I leading, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, let's see how it used to be, ah...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or somebody used to compliment me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: .. how nice I looked, uhm, I didn't like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it can, you know, it's-- sometimes, when some people said it, like (beeping sound), it would make me sick to my stomach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it was not, uhm, a relationship where I could do anything about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where, uhm, I felt anything for him...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... which would give a reason for our relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it goes with, ah, I guess everybody else who told me to a certain degree...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that I had what it takes or something like that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that's right, I didn't like it, 'coz I didn't, I didn't feel it inside of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet I've changed about that, uhm...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I feel well. If so many people like last couple of weeks... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... by getting outside instead of, uhm, hiding in my apartment... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible [00:11:46])</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see a lot more people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I begin to realize that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... they're not judging me just, ah... (crosstalk)<p/>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... by my looks. It's whatever my actions are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That really means something to me and not to them. If I, ah, behave like I'm a playgirl, then... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... even though I'm good-looking, I'm still a playgirl, and they will treat me as such.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. What's with this playgirl that seems to be bothering you? What do you mean... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... by playgirl? You know, there's a lot of definitions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: By my accepting relationships with men that, ah, I know we can't go anywhere or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If they're realizing like ah, (beeping sound) then (inaudible [00:12:34]) that the problems were just... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... so heavy and for the one night stand or one night a week, uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why should I have to put up with it? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And why was I?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now, I'm a little peeved or angry with him for not getting in touch with me and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... because I was. I went out with-- looking for trouble with somebody else... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and I thought, you know, if he doesn't want me, somebody else does... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I will... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's this trouble during the past week. They were looking for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Ah, uh huh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had, uh, I met (beeping sound) down seaside... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... accidentally...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... in the restaurant... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... with his wife.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he had taken my name and address, with his wife sitting there... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... for what I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, ah, I thought about it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:13:30).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I thought, what, you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sit that down a long time ago, that since he's married, I'm not... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... going to bother with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I hadn't really made up my mind that, uhm, I wasn't going to be this type of person and yet... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I accepted. We'll, I went out with (beeping sound). I went to the, ah, place where I knew he worked... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... looking for trouble. And I thought, while I'm here looking for it, and I know it's gonna happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so who's this (beeping sound), I'm not sure I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: He lives in my apartment building... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and he had come to my apartment before drunk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Uh hmm. Drunk. Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he had accused me of teasing him or (inaudible 00:14:17). I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't. But this night last week after seeing (beeping sound), I went looking him up... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... because I guess I knew what was going to happen. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I could accept it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... at face value that I was miring in a, ah, dirty affair with a married man, which meant nothing... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and no satisfaction to me. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well(ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if I could be in bed with him, then, surely I wasn't in love with (beeping sound).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's what I think I was wrong, in using that kind of... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... ridiculous reasoning that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... now I'd be going there... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort(ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... (beeping sound) and to prove that it was over. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... go back to the same thing I did before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, that certainly sounds, you know, as we talked about before, very self-destructive to someone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is no satisfaction at all... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and then I knew it before it started and I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... just thought, well... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I'm making exceptions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, or is there something particularly disgusting about this sexual relationship with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The other night?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm. It was just all one-sided again, for his satisfaction. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't have a... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... You didn't have a climax.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I didn't have a chance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there was just no uhm, affection or anything at all, like... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was very distasteful. And very... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's very distasteful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What did I do this for?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it's, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Want(ph) to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... why I may have gone to him was because he was one that, I accepted oral sex where (beeping sound) I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tried... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... spent years in trying to accept that, that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... anything goes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you had oral sex with this distasteful guy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Now, let your mind again go back in time. Just as easily as your hand went down through space. What about oral sex as you go back through time? Was there some nausea or vomiting about it way back, way back in time, maybe that first time you had oral sex?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh the one time that I remember uhm, was with my brother... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With your brother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... uhm, he came in my mouth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember if I got sick of it but I didn't like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't like it, surely. How old were you then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Must've been eight or nine. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nine or ten(ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Must've been eight or nine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eight or nine? Uh hmm. I see. And ah, what do you remember after that? What else happened with oral sex that might have been disgusting at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember so much more of that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... if I remember that ah, when I had intercourse with a boy after I had started my period. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I, you know, jumped up and realized, "My God, I could be pregnant from... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... something as silly as this." (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I backed away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you feel then? Did you feel nauseous or disgusted or... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember feeling nauseated, just scared.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, scared. And when was the next time you felt nauseated, threw up or something you know in (inaudible 00:17:55) somewhere. We seem to be tracing it somehow along... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember. I satisfied uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... one of my boyfriends that I had... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I remember I've, I wouldn't have ah, intercourse with him, but I remember I took care of him that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then there was, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was there any nausea with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's, let's picture it now. Let's remember. You know, we can if we really want to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (beeping sound) just to accept it too... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... before we were married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before, and, and how it got there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember nausea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't remember any nausea?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (beeping sound)I didn't like it. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's because you know you're-- huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't like the oral sex?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't because he used to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: uhm, well, I don't know. The way he was brought(ph) out or in his ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... language that was... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... because he was in love with me, and that, you know, he was going to marry me, and then he get...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and that's what happened through our whole marriage. That was the way he insisted on being satisfied most of the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Most of the time he wanted oral sex even though he find this was, you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when we were-- when we had intercourse... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I can't remember being satisfied...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... except when I was in bed with (beeping sound) that night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Or does he get involved in orgasm, didn't involve himself long enough? No? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. He wasn't considerate of my feelings at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He wasn't considerate. He didn't care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't know any better.(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know what an orgasm was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. All right. Uh huh. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:19:52)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or was there something else. You'd say at nine your brother ah, you know, had this urination ah, you know, with the penis in your mouth, and certainly that doesn't sound like a kind of thing, you know? Ah, it wouldn't make you feel so good and it probably, you know, it might be if that would make you nauseous or vomit. But you're not sure. You can't remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't remember being nauseated. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except when... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How clear is it in your mind? Let's try to clarify that picture.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still remember the field we were in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, all right. Uh-huh. And you're in a field. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ah, that he wanted me to get down on him and when I did... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he came in my mouth, and I remember running to the house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. You couldn't tell anybody, of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just probably called him a dirty rat or something like that. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did call him a dirty rat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I might have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You might have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, I don't know what I've said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was there something else after that around that time? With your brothers, did he do it again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, my brother, when he-- another brother (beeping sound) when he came home from the Navy... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or times... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I think it probably could have been counted on one hand and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that my reputation was shot... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... after that. And my brother came home. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he wanted to come into bed with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your brother from the Navy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, when he came home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. How old ah, were you(ph) then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How old-- he's in-- 50, I was still only about 10 years old.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were 10 years old. But he was a full-grown man, you know, 18, 19, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think I got angry with him and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... told him to get out of my room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And whether that made me nauseated, I don't remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It may have, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When something doesn't agree with you, something you don't like occurs, you say ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a lot of times...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... it turns your stomach, uh huh, at the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... approaches me or backs me up in the corner... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I feel like, a, a trapped animal... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... trying to escape, and whenever he touches me... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh, how old (beeping sound) seventy... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Seventy-nine or eighty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seventy-nine or eighty (beeping sound) years old. And when he touches you, you know it turns your stomach?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I agree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do feel nauseous. Suppose you go further with him sexually, what happens then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never did it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You never did? Uh hmm. It's kind of interesting but (beeping sound) still keeps, you know, in many ways uh, you know, he gives you a lot of money, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... kind of ah, accusation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's just feeling that he's ah...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... because I still have about... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One hundred thousand dollars, you've never had intercourse with him and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:24:17)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... all, all he does is chase you around once in a while. Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's right. (inaudible 00:24:22)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's going on between you and (beeping sound), this ah, man almost 80? Any idea what the attraction is on both sides?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think he likes to be in my company... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... because he now receives compliments, or I receive compliments and uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and that he is there to know that everything that I have on, he threw on me. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, no heart... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No heart. Yeah. Uh huh. All right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or whatever you want to call it because I don't run up to him and throw my arms around him and kiss him and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Besides the money he gave you, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't even stand when he touched me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That disgusts you when he touch-- when he touches you. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost nauseating, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, because... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I feel his money didn't, didn't buy me if I want to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But my family has given him uh, the attention I guess... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that his family doesn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Your whole family isn't really, you know, plays up (beeping sound) or gives him attention, right? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, they don't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just on the times, right? But he's done things for all the members of your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're playing up to him... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... my mother and father, I think, genuinely care for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think your mother and father genuinely care (beeping sound)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and are grateful for what he has done for me and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... the rest of the family. They hadn't received so much, but they... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... watched what he's done for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What has he done for you, I mean, beside the money?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's about it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... but what I have to do... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... was learn how to handle it. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And use it to my advantage instead of ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Instead of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... squandering it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I never had so much money before... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and a lot of times I feel I don't deserve it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's move in to the future now. You know, this is easy as your hand can go down, you know, into the past, as you have and get memories from the past. How do you see yourself a year from now? Let's move in into the future. I'll ah-- we'll have a hand raised from the couch a little bit. Just imagine balloons are tied to the fingertips, okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Either hand or?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Either hand, you pick the hand and just imagine balloons pulling it up, you know, just the opposite of going down, we're gonna move ahead. How does it look a year from now? Where, you know, what do you think you'll be doing then? Let's, let's count, uh-- let's get the balloon to move a hand. That'll give you an idea of, maybe, a bit little different feeling, you know, what the future.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, I'm just beginning to feel now that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... if I don't really realize what I'm doing now. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... take stock of what I have. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And who I am... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that, uhm, next year... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I may have a few more dollars if ah, (beeping sound) gives me a few more dollars... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... but it will make it that much worse. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I'll be a year older. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that will be a year later... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And another year that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I have done nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. You know, let's look at it. Let's, let's-- rather than just think about it now. Now, let's, let's picture-- see if you can get a picture of yourself a year from now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it just depends on which way, which... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... period of what I am in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... let's, let's see what the picture is. Let's try, you know ah, let's use the imagination now instead of just words. That's right. Your hand is up, that's fine. You did very well. Okay. So, let's say it's a year from now. How does it look now? Where are you as far as men are concerned now? What does the picture look like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard for me to say. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right we're in May, uh huh, or in April. End of April, right? April a year from now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I find it difficult... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you picture?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... to make my decision.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, no, don't make a conscious decision. You know, just, just see a picture. Look, ah, like looking on a blackboard, you know, or looking at a movie stage. What do you see?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, somebody about... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... thirty-five years old.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, well... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... a nice specimen for a man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What kind of person is he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, well, just by being with (beeping sound), it's like a Saturday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I was first thinking about it, about... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I think I took it for granted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. For granted you are married.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it was, uh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A year from now, you're-- will be married or are married, as you see it with this fine, you know, this guy who's a good father to (beeping sound)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and who you can feel also the man is a, you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's why...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... a good man.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know that's why I'd-- why I married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, very good. All right, suppose now we count to five or count backwards from five and come out of trance. And, uh, you can keep, you know, any comfortable feelings you have if you want to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, but (inaudible 00:31:14) (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can remember-- huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel like I am in one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's all right. Don't worry about that. Uh huh. You don't feel nauseous, I'm sure. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I just feel nervous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel nervous. Oh? Something new?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, now, it's for me to be in that position when I used to be married. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, with this married guy? Uh huh. Oh, I see. Getting married, you mean that? Well, all right. Let's go back to the present now. We're coming back to the present. The hand drops down. You're back to the present now, okay? You can remember, misremember or forget the things we've-- you know, discussed. They may work to help you nonetheless. Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'll just count from five to one, and then you'll open your eyes and come right out of trance. Five, four, three, two, one. (Snaps fingers.) You see it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I remember. Now my eyes are watery.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your eyes are watery now. Why? You think you felt, uh, emotional about this scene maybe that you remember or what? Make you feel good to see this guy a year from now that, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that it's too good to be true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's too good to be true. Uh huh. Well, that was your picture. I didn't, you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if I want it, I gotta work for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want it, you have to work for it. Uh hmm. All right, well, maybe. You think you will work for it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: After we're done?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After today, you intend to work for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the, the playgirl stuff is stopping, or you wanna stop? Or what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I'm not glad I did it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that what I was really doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Right, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what I did was wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And building something for next year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I shouldn't have uh, backed off... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... from (beeping sound), go back to something like that. I should've looked... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... for something better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something better, right, like this guy you saw a year from now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. That, that definitely was better, you were sure. I mean as sure as you can be about these things, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure as it can be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, you can say he, he was a good man with (beeping sound) you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... look like a good, responsible citizen, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, even though he wasn't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though he wasn't what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... dressed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He wasn't dressed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My God, was he all nude or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Casually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, he's dressed casually, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:34:03) dressed... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... not like, uh, well, men that I would see in bars and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... men in business when they're putting more on that. They have businesses. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. This is a, you know, a real honest-to-goodness guy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm, right (inaudible 00:34:19).</p>

<p>CLIENT: He lives in Milan.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [laughs] You were there while you're watching the picture, right? You might have been sitting in the bleachers or, you know, in the, in the ballpark.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Uh hmm, but this picture does help you, you know, direct yourself, you think, now, gives you a better idea of what you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. This picture seen this, uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I love (beeping sound)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...for (beeping sound) future and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, you're there, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I'm not doing anything bad... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... except money-wise.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I should... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... really know that money is not... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... not happiness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See if that'll help, you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure(ph). (beeping sound) the education. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (beeping sound) education, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's a smart little cookie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) All right. Well, how do you feel about this session? The nausea is all gone, isn't it? Throwing up and the nausea?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm nervous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're nervous, though? The thing-- when did you get nervous? When did it happen? When you saw this guy? Is that when you got the nervous thing? You know, the guy a year from now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well(ph), what, what... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I, when I started to think if it-- am I just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... going out with men again, and uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Why should that make you nervous? Why are you so frightened? You know uh, just because you had trouble in one marriage and you're afraid of another failure or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe because I just think it's too good to be true. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's too good to be true. You don't deserve it, you mean? You're a bad girl because maybe you had sex with your brothers, or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I, uh, would like to think that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... uhm my past has made me what I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... a lot of things I've done don't contribute to a very good future.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. So, you're, you're nervous in a way because you like to see this picture we had a year from now, but you think you don't deserve it. Is that-- am I putting, uh, saying words correctly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm thinking that I would have to nearly put my mind... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To it, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... building constructively instead of... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... revolving and choosing-- or being choosy... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... from being a playgirl when it doesn't make any difference whether I'm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... if I go to bed with every married man I see... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or just pick you up and want to do it. so I'm saying...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Still ends up nowhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's still the same... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... no future. So why do you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:37:03) right. Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... choose it? Which is where I think I realize, you'll never know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why we choose it, it's not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No satisfaction or... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. All right. So, the nervousness came on when you pictured the decent guy who could be a good father to (beeping sound). That's when you really started to feel a little nervous, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my eyes watered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your eyes watered. Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That one night, just said that I could be about anything, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, I see. That really would make you happy though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would, all right. You're sure it would, you know, you're saying it would? Uh hmm, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With what I know now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With what you know now, uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I should expect in a man... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and he should expect from me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If we're compatible, if we... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... both work at it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You should be happy and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Reasonably happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, that would work for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It takes two.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So the picture that we saw a year from now is what-- you know it makes you nervous. You recognize that's a direction you wanna go. Am I putting that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. You think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) What's the doubt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... still toying with the idea because it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What's the doubt? You don't deserve it or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I can, I can say it and yet... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and not do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I turn around and do things and don't do it. But... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it may take a little work, you know, we're gonna work at it in treatment, we have a little bit, but... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not used to working at it so... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm trying, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try, try, try.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm gonna try even harder to, uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Okay. You know it might be less than a year. Or we just picked a year, and you know, we could do this again and see if we can make it a shorter time. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:38:43). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... Or would that scare you too much, huh? Or longer you say? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh? Or longer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:38:49).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But even a year scared you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was (beeping sound) once and that was wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like I said, with what I know now... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... if I start looking seriously... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... process of elimination... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... there should be somebody that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... finds me a better woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Now, that's the part I would agree with you. Yes, I think you're right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I still remember it takes two. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's my decision.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Fine. Well, how do you feel about this session that we did today? It was helpful or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Scared me a little bit when... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scared when what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... just when I first went in there and laid down and uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... completely took hold of me, that I was relaxed, and then...(crosstalk) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Uh huh, scared you a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... when I came in here, uh, my eyes didn't water. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I was, when I was... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but your eyes seem to water when you thought it this pleasant scene with this guy, who maybe you're not sure you deserve.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe the last couple of months when I was in the other room my eyes... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... watered and that was when I was relaxed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're relaxed, your eyes water.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe, you know, you think you're sad underneath?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which would-- is-- well, it's my own fault.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's your own fault? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:40:07) You know, get on that marriage thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you mean, the playgirl thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of what I've done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Okay, well, it won't help to beat yourself or blame yourself, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You understand that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What will help will be working in, you know, toward the right direction. You know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't cry over spilt milk (inaudible 00:40:21)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Crying and all that stuff, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and proceed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And possibly sometimes understanding, you know, why you do what you do. We might try that, but basically, first, the important thing is, if you see the right direction, the thing to do is to work toward it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You can see it now. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, all right. I guess we can stop now and make an appointment for next time, huh? Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'll never forget the time I walked in (inaudible 00:00:06)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a little different seeing that person before (inaudible 00:00:10)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it was. And you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: How can this big deal, so I thought about it. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Well. Uh hmm, all right, uh, no big deal and that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seemed when I thought about it, I remembered it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:00:30) Huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I thought about it I remembered it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. But what did you remember if saying life's such a big deal from the hypnotic thing we had done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't worth it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't worth it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was? What seem to be, uh, so important, you know, in the hypnotic thing that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I cried.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You cried?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, something about my... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... my feelings of letting loose, of finding relief in the, you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... of why I'm-- why I hold back these tears, of why... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I've got such a strong control of my... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... real feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, that's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I broke down, you know, I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... started... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... talking about it, about it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... the way I'm thinking, not being... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... realistic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm, yeah. Right. So, we got a lot more feelings out using that hypnotic approach. What else do you remember from it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean about my mother?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About your mother? What, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: These big feelings that I had about being a... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... not the-- now I see, what was that? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of not being good enough to marry somebody good. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or somebody that might be worthwhile.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Yeah. That came out the last time, ah, all right? (clears throat) Uh huh. Ah, yeah, that came out the last time, ah, the, ah, but even though you had-- under the-- I guess the, the time before that, when we used hypnotism and moved you into the future, you know, when you're picturing, you remember?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You pictured this fellow, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who was going to be a good father? He was a nice kinda guy, and not the, you know, ah, as you looked ahead and saw yourself a year from now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was playing with (beeping sound).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He was playing with (beeping sound), your son, and he looks like the right kind of guy for a change, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, ah, at that time, you didn't know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:03:26)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... probably you had met him, you met now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Okay. Ah, and then last time, ah, we can, you know, after you had met him, peculiarly enough, he'll probably look very much like the fellow, right, in the hypnotic future... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... thing, you know, all right. Ah, then, you felt really all right. This is a good guy. He could be a good father (bell rings), and off, uh-- but what you said (bell rings), ah, ah, then, ah, what came out then in that session with us, ah, was that you weren't worthy. You don't, you don't deserve a good guy, you know. And you thought this for ah, many, many years, all right? Is that the one you remember now? Is that? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know if I thought it, but that's been my pattern of selection.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Yeah. And then we trace it back. I think we used hypnotism to trace it back, is that all right, to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or we use him as it only traced back, you know, why is it you-- why you felt so unworthy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could trace it back now with hypnotism.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can trace it back with (inaudible 00:04:49)? Well, okay, you trace it back now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. This goes back to my never feeling that, ah, I was good, good enough for anything. Nobody ever told me I was. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I always heard that I wasn't. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As if it worked on me more than I had thought... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I had always felt, you know, that they're wrong. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... kind of person, that I don't behave that way, but, uh, I took the remarks on the, I guess, on the defensive... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or something like that, not-- I didn't, ah, try to prove to myself or to anyone else that, uh, they were wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Uh huh. It seemed to me though there was something else, ah, some other things that might have made you feel like you were no good, or it might have been, ah, because you felt you knew you were no good that you're engaged in this activity and you were called were you? You, you told me, you know, your mother and father never really told you you were any good. This was the impression you got last time and you're pretty sure about it, too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then also, ah, your brothers and the kids you went to school with, kinda spread the word that you were no good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right? (crosstalk)</pl></p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you remember that part?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? Why did they do that, all of them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of my sexual experiences with my brothers... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and his friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Because of your sexual experiences with your brothers, ah, even before the age of 12, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, which weren't very frequent ... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's all right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... but they were enough to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... get around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, as you told me, I think as, ah, you recollected last time under hypnosis, it was somewhere around, eight or nine years of age that your sexual experiences started. And apparently, they had the need to tell the other people at school... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... or at least the other boys at school, I don't know. Maybe they told the other girls, too, I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know either? I see. So this hard-- hardly made you feel like a real worthwhile person in school apparently?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. As far as associating with other kids.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Uh hmm, okay. All right, well, I certainly have that picture. (beeping sound) Uh huh. All right, well, now, today, we're-- we have decision problems, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of. Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you're-- here is this guy who is, ah, not that, you know, ah, I've checked him out or anything and-- but you, ah, you know, ah, and you-- and inside you, you feel strongly this is the right of kind of guy now for a change, all right? And you thought of, you know, a gangster, a gambler, you know, the whole bit, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now you're running and you were in this accident with your car last week, you know and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: This week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... this week, yeah. And it may not really have been so much of an accident, as a way of trying to get out of something, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I was careless I use(ph)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you were careless, uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... took my brother's station wagon and I U-haul it to Washington and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... in reverse, it worked opposite of the way you think it is, and then I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm sure, yeah. Never do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and, and doing it without really... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... really being... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, yeah. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... so (inaudible 00:08:36) enough. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let's not nag on that point, but certainly, you were aware of your feelings now that you're pulled in two directions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. I ran down there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your friends out at Washington.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I looked for, you know, a day when I didn't have... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... appointments, so I could get away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. Your idea of going down there was so you could have a date with a guy again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I wasn't dating that night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn't want to date. I'm not... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... doing anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Uh hmm. I see. You're kind of just running in general because you feel you can't live with yourself and think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, I see. Uh huh. Well, where are we now with this guy? You know, what-- where do you feel you stand at this point?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Confused.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Confused?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but I was talking to him last night. Ah, I really like to talk to him. He's, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he's got, I guess, all the self-confidence that I don't have. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when he, he talks to me... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... could be, ah, it's just like in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I asked him, "Why me?" (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why is there-- he love me or why does he want to marry me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that's all right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... of what I had to offer or... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I can't see what I have to offer to him, and then he just says, you know, "It's, it's chemistry."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He says, it's chemistry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Chemistry makes it quite work well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, that it does but, uh...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Yeah, but you had plenty of other... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... it can't be that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Chemistry, uh huh, it didn't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but this... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you asked why... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... is a bit different. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... why is it different, right? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's, ah, uh, he makes a person, uh, you know, it, it brings complete satisfaction. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is no... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... feeling of frustration at all... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... except, uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... afterwards, when I think about it, I can't think of why, you know, he loves me or wants to marry me. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With sex, it's, you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That feels great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... pretty good on both sides.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, in other words, there's no longer the, the other kind of sex, which was more like masturbation. But with him, it's somewhat-- you really feel the whole thing and he, he cares for you and you have much more complete orgasms?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most of the time anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Well, most of the time, it's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... pretty good right now. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... afraid of what I felt, so, so, like last night. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. All right, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, we're going to tie horse now... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... instead of getting even with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, why is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I didn't have any orgasm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, because you didn't have an orgasm, you know, so...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he told me it wasn't important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not-- it's not. I was, I was a... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... strange feeling. I wasn't even frustrated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, all right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just fun... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and very enjoyable just to, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... to be able hold him close.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and the night before we watched... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... we lay in bed and (beeping sound) and ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he removed (inaudible 00:11:58) work. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And get over little things. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, ah, I guess he didn't want to hear or say it, and I fell asleep because... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... after that long ride... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that there (beeping sound).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I slept. It was just good just to hold him. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least, now I got him, ah, talking... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and-- but he won't tell me why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He won't tell you why he cares for you, you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He-- I don't know if he realizes it or not. Maybe he does, but, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that's my biggest problem, where... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... you know, why I'm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What could he tell you really, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he must have logical reasons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but, you know, I'm just wondering, are logical reasons going to satisfy you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, at least, I could agree with him or think more about them... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or, uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I'm guess I'm just looking for ah... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... reasons in myself, but... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... when I think about them myself, I felt I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I bury them. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I say, "You know that's not true about me." And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... my feeling of, uh, not being any good is, uhm, burying... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... what I do had to offer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And for me to hear it from him... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... what I do have to offer then... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, I'm thinking maybe it's, uh, an outside way of, uh, making me realize it myself without, uh, hearing this, uh, outside influence from other people saying that I'm not any good. I'd rather hear, uh, why I am. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And see if I can, uhm, agree with that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or finding uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... comforting feeling in that, that it's true, it's true, and he's basing the relationship with something that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... is really true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. I see. Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ready when it's time you know but, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... for me to know and I wouldn't have to ask him. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's smart, he's smart for work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And uh, his first wife, and he, and he talked about her a little bit. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, he was married before, I mean, before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:14:39)He was, he was married for four months. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said he knew this woman all his life... (crosstalk)</pl></p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and she was married before with a little boy. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But instead, they woke up, you know, like "yesterday, we're married four months" and that decided they didn't love each other anymore... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... which is one reason why I wanna know why... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he loves me and why he wants to marry me. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSEL: Well, I know, this is... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's wrong with him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, well, this, is something a little newer now. I can see, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, when I wake up and... (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, sure, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... having to say logically... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, uh, yeah. Well, this is new all right. It's somebody we didn't know before, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I knew it now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At least (inaudible 00:15:24), uh huh yeah. Uh huh. Now, you've checked the other things or have you? You know you found out that the employees says he is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had it figured out how to really check it first.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The, the more he... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... yeah, the more I see him and the more I hear... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... uhm, the more, you know, how could I just believe him... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that he, you know, he names the doctors he's worked there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I don't understand is their (inaudible 00:15:53) (beeping sound).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (beeping sound) who was the man (inaudible 00:15:58).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet he is, uhm, what you call it, uh, toying with their practice, uh, for GP experience... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and he's the one called for them or something. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, oh, it's so unusual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he said, uh, as far as he knew... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he was going to Baltimore, and it's a five-year residency in neurosurgery. That much he explained to me last night. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he had another year to go, and he thought he was gonna to go to Baltimore for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's if you're residents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. He had one more year to complete his residence, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I don't know how to react with it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... five years in neurosurgery.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, well, so it's immediate. Let it go. And you should start thing (inaudible 00:16:53)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, correct I could always call up (beeping sound).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, uh, which is, well, I'll do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Saturday, he missed the family, and, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I called up (beeping sound) Saturday morning... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... Fourth of July and, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... told him, you know, that really was true, somebody did ask me to marry me? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, uh, and, and yeah, just married him. And, uh, here's another slip.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (beeping sound) was, uh, upset. You know he didn't know whether to believe me or whether I was kidding or what. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, uh, I told him if he was going to the fireworks Saturday night with (beeping sound) she would meet him... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and of course he said if we made me do this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just couldn't believe it. So sure enough, Saturday night, we came looking for trouble, and I told my sister the same thing that (beeping sound) should be there. So he met, uh, my brother (beeping sound), my sister (beeping sound) and her boyfriend (beeping sound) came with, uh, another one of his girlfriends who did the same thing there three years ago, got married, and, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he was very upset about that. But he still caters to the, uh, husband and wife. But anyway, and her husband is very intelligent and had done research at John Hopkins... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and, uh, (beeping sound) got to talking, and, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but I had to back away from that conversation. I didn't understand where it went. But... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...(beeping sound) took it all in and, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... loss stock (beeping sound). You know I played a dirty trick on him that, uh, he knew that we were gonna be there together, and four years, I didn't let him touch me or touch him and, uh, now, just let (beeping sound) touch me. And here, I let (beeping sound) put his arm around me, and, and that upset (beeping sound) great deal. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... And, uh, apparently, he thought I was gonna change my mind about marrying him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I told him, I don't know how many times, but I guess he just didn't listen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, uh, I wouldn't let him touch me with a 10-foot pole. And that's what I told (beeping sound)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And of course (beeping sound) didn't understand why the relationship or what kind it was and, uh, if this is where my financial independence came from or dependence really... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and, uh, why just because he showed up with me that I should be fired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (beeping sound) And now, I told the family I was gonna be cut off and no more money and all these, and, uh, he was brokenhearted, and I did a dirty trick and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's calmed down since then, uh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I told him I was only asked. I didn't accept... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and, uh, I hadn't known him for that long, so it wasn't that, you know, something that I've been hiding him in the closet for a year? And now, all of a sudden, I'm springing them on the family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's when, uh, when I felt comfortable about the relationship and I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go on. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... introduced him to my family... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and it, he had to be (beeping sound) eventually... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and with that story straightened out, but, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you know? Uh, when you say that story, does he know, uh, you know, (beeping sound) kinda giving you money or stuff like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he-- I let him read a letter to my brother. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (beeping sound) hiding it, that, uh, I was getting my mother teeth and my father hearing aid and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and that I had hoped (beeping sound) would reimburse me for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we've spent to, like, a thousand dollars this month and then... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that and (beeping sound) gave me (inaudible 00:21:16), but he just gave me the other half today, but as of Saturday, he wasn't going to give me another cent... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... you know, let (beeping sound) take care of it. It is his responsibility and, uh, which had me a little concerned... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... because of the, uh, money's cut off that short, uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... especially with the 500 (inaudible 00:21:40) dollar bill.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be cutting into my, my-- quite rapidly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah? How about getting a, that sort of saving? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I do, but I also know how fast they can go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if I don't have a way of replacing them, it would, you know, be almost like forcing me to marry (beeping sound) for the, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... support.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll always get a job. You know we talked about (inaudible 00:22:09).</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what? And I do it. You know I'd rather think of, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... marrying (beeping sound) and doing something that I really wanted to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And uh...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... use that as an excuse I guess because... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... with, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm still not sure that, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he can support me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh. You're not sure about (beeping sound) supporting you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well, first off, he's got another year of residency, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He says he can, and uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, yeah, yeah. They don't make bank accounts... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... not for the style you've become accustomed (inaudible 00:22:47). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's not, you know, we're going of that phrase before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know it myself quite well... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... this (inaudible 00:22:53) like, that accustomed as, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... very expensive even... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... even basically it is... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... because I like nice things and, uh...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know at least for a year on a resident's salary, you know, uh, you'll live on his salary. You're... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I have enough for, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and, you know, a year's expenses, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. I'm sure you don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're concerned about, uh, cutting into what I have... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and not having it later.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.(inaudible 00:23:32). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it seems to, uh, he doesn't understand why I've questioned him so much you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he's got so much, uh, confidence in himself or something he can't understand... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... my, uh, doubting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Doubting, you mean where it seems were two kinds of doubting, doubting, uh, you know, that he already represents himself to be, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: With the years, it's great. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if, if he isn't, you know, I, I would rather know about it. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I could, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah. We don't repeat previous mistakes. Right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because if he wasn't able to support me, I would rather know it now than here later 'coz I told him I'm not used to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... money problems... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah..</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and I don't wanna start them again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. They're obvious, the money problems. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not recently, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... not having the money to pay for bills and scratching for next month's rent. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. (inaudible 00:24:34).</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... marriage (inaudible 00:24:34) problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right. But the second, ah, there's a stronger line, you know, about that any decent guy could love you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't understand why anybody with... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... the, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... ability that he has and, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... the intelligence and all he has done with his life... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and with his intelligence that, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I could complement his life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Uh hmm. So this is about... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That point, I just don't understand, and he wants to come back. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's his problem as I understand. He's sure, I mean he has no doubts that he wants to marry you, right? Or should he? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I know of now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Now, you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said last night he likes confusion, you know, as if...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He came to the right place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. All right. As you're pretty confused, I mean with all this (inaudible 00:25:31)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... are, you know. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not only that, but you know my apartment too was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not meticulous, and he is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... you know he said something about must have something to do with his first wife. She was, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... intellectually on his level, and, ah, shared a lot of things with him and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... ah, was a good cook... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and a good seamstress and probably an, ah, excellent...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he said housekeeper but, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (inaudible 00:26:09). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically, I think maybe she didn't, ah, care for him. It was enough... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... of a business deal and put the money on the table and, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whose money, I mean, he... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: His money, the money that he was making.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She married her-- him for his money.(inaudible 00:26:30)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's-- well, what I hear about it, it sounds that way. She ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You know, why it only last four months if they had, you know, these things in common and all that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, from what he says, they just didn't love each other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:26:45).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where it's, whereas, you know, mine is, ah...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have a job and know him so long either now, right? How long it been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, if she know him well as, you know, if I should admit it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:26:58). Uh huh. Yeah. Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But from... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But he's only known her... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... my knowing him... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... ah, short time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but mine is all, ah, basically feelings... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah. Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and, ah, sharing there that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I really do care for him and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... probably he feels it. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, uh, he cares for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So whether-- you know, when I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I just, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So, you've known him how long now totally?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A month.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Month.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Told me (inaudible 00:27:37) she will marry him when I met him that I wouldn't be... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:27:38)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I won't have this problem. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:27:41) Yeah. Well, I don't know. Yeah. It might be a, a divorce. I'm sure of it. Uh, what's the deadline on this now? Or is there a hurry? I-- you know, ah, does he want you to decide to marry him before he goes to take his residency... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:28:00)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... you know, finish his residency or as (inaudible 00:28:00).</p>

<p>CLIENT: He did times, times that I have heard... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... you know, and that's, that's going to (beeping sound) in September and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... October is a good time to go Vienna(ph). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's where he wants to go on our honeymoon. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is where I wanted to go. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I could care less and, ah, he said, Vienna... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and he, that October was the good time to be there which was... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:28:29) so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if it is or not... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:28:32).</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... which just let me know that I guess he wanted to be married in September. But if he's in residency, then, he's not taking any church on October.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah. That's fine. And surely, you were in a hurry, didn't do that. That sounds all strange, yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then he's not, you know, so sure... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:28:49)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he's going to Maryland anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he sells insurance too... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... for money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But regarding the, recently we talked a few times and you are not usually the gal who you know, stalls and puts things off that much. You haven't really investigated him as much as... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't figured it out... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... how to do it. I sort of, ah, ah, calling (beeping sound) for, you know, somebody... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... to check it out who knows how to do it. I don't know how to do it. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... But then I thought, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, if you got to call, that'll be bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then he'll (inaudible 00:29:33) well, it's not that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, ah, you know, as far as (beeping sound) is concerned... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I don't care what he says about it. It's for my own... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... ah, protection. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Protection, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he should, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... understand it... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... after what I've been going through and what I'm trying to prove ... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. You know, I'm saying which is untrue with different men, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and that, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... being set on so confused, that's why I did it. So I don't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's why you did what? You mean, you have started uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why if I did it, that's why I did it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, oh, you mean if he found you had an investigator on him... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and he found out... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and you will explain him that way. Yeah. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's even if they all turned out right, I would probably tell him. I would... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... tell him that it's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh. Yeah. Well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... you know, "and I investigated you and, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah. All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn't want (beeping sound) to, uh, know my business. (beeping sound) (beeping sound)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Finding the investigator.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or to, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean know your business? What's he up to now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why do I want this investigation?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Well, it's-- with you, no big romance with (beeping sound), right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll pay him for his services?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, whoever it gets-- yeah, I was. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that's no way to excuse it with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I could tell (beeping sound) that I had it done, why couldn't I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, let's just... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... stand up to the rest of the world then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and, you know, your job and, you know, you're paying us, he is not a (beeping sound) stranger exactly is true. I mean, you know, that's the only thing... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you trust him, but you know all of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's not that I trust him. I remember the (beeping sound) detective. He was a scatterbrain from the... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... way back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and that's all I would, you know, I don't wanna... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you don't want that. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... date somebody like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But this is guy is (inaudible 00:31:19).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I thought if I ask (beeping sound)... (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:31:23)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...(inaudible 00:31:23)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... I see (beeping sound) can recommend somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, was he even better then? But he doesn't have to know. Sure as (beeping sound) has recommended somebody who's really confident and have him check it out, could be done in a short time, seems to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But somebody knows how to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Ah, letting you have your own emotional problem and that would be all. That's all, yeah. There won't be this doubt, you know, is this guy legitimate or is there something shady or... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: If (beeping sound) hadn't said anything, I wouldn't have doubted it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But first, she's the one who introduced me to him and she... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... doubts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She doubts that he's a... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... brain surgeon, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, she doubts his, uh, medical career.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he explained that to me, you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... a little bit in a raised voice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: She never saw him... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that kind of work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Okay. Well, I knew what they were. Supposed he were an insurance man, it turned out, you know, and he's, uh, in order to impress you, he had stretched the thing. How would you feel then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, it would depend on why... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why he stretched it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. Supposed he stretched it because he felt that's the only way he was worthy of you. Maybe he's got feelings of unworthiness, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. Then we'd get along good together, wouldn't we?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) Well, how would you feel about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It hasn't happened. I guess, I, I wouldn't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doesn't happen yet. That's right. Okay. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know I wouldn't condemn... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Oh, okay. We got time that anyway. Apparently the-- you know, ah, ah, we got, ah, at least a month or two before you really have to make some decisions-- final. Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's smart. And I know he's smart. But it's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... it's possible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He complimented me on being intelligent. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I began to wonder where I used my intelligence, but... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently, I have used it, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... in a direction that, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... satisfy him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know a little bit about everything... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and not much about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I do from reading this. You know, when he walked into my apartment and, and he looked around I think... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he realized I was very much aware of... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... what was going on in the world, and I was interested in it and, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... like to know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... what was going on, and I'd put my hand in, my hand in a, hand in the (inaudible 00:34:33)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... avoid(ph) what's going on around me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I want what's best for (beeping sound)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That must be, you know, what he sees, you know what I mean? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Ah, as I recall, we were discussing the scene (beeping sound) going well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very well. He accepts quite a bit when he's around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) What do you mean accept, meaning?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't listen to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But he doesn't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: More than the, ah, usual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Yeah, right as far as with, ah, but... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: More uncontrollable. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. When he walks in, he says, "When you're gonna marry my mom?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. It's all right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's a karate expert. And, ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who's a karate expert (beeping sound)? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (beeping sound). (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I'm sorry, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (beeping sound) He likes that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know what, you know, with respects his voice when he, you know, tells him to go to bed or put his shoes in there (inaudible 00:35:46).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. All right. (inaudible 00:35:46) that's all what we got.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why I (inaudible 00:35:50). He fits along so well with (beeping sound) and that's why that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... scares me. Always... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scares you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He told me once and, uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... I could tell him six times to do something and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... he wouldn't do it. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't like to hit him because I'm afraid of hurting him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. He doesn't have to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't have to, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I do, still hasn't been doing well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I that, that I'm afraid of, uh, hurting him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Right. Okay. Well, I guess we have a little time to work on this again, uhm, for more information again, huh, before we start making any final decisions, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think logically as you (beeping sound).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Okay. If you wanted to...</p>

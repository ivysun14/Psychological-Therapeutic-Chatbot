<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview three, interview three.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been thinking about (inaudible at 0:00:15.5) stuff that we've talked with me and I was... well I guess I left sort of (inaudible at 0:00:22.8) but really very confused, probably more confused than upset because I wasn't sure... I wasn't what or where we came out or where I came out with it, but it also occurred to me that all of the stuff I... that much of the stuff I've been talking about was... all, is all... really pretty negative things and I, and I guess I've discovered myself getting rather wrapped up in negative things about myself. Like in the last year so to speak, maybe longer, I don't know, and becoming less and less aware of positive things about myself. [0:01:03.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you mean it's like kind of the bad things that upset you about yourself start to loom large and kind of, good things kind of get lost by the wayside or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they, I don't even look anymore. I don't even know... well what I'm thinking, it's like looking at myself again, but I didn't even see, the negative things that I feel about myself or that I see myself as sort of become overpowering. Which is I guess what would sort of has, become the concern is because like looking at those kinds of things about myself or the... like it's easy to be depressed about it, too. And I guess it just dawned on... well it didn't just dawn on me, I'm sure I've seen it, seen it before but that, that, that I, that I don't know what's positive, that things are positive. [0:02:09.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean that... do you mean it's like you can't see the positive things, is that what you mean? It's kind of like you really doubt yourself and doubt that there are positive things and stuff (crosstalk)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well like, yeah, it's just the... the thing I can't get away from it, which I guess is what was really disturbing last time is to really say to discover that I don't really look into myself or look from myself as you said, it's looking at myself and I continue to do that and I say I'm looking at myself and I can sort of see some positive things but they don't really, doesn't have much effect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like you don't really feel the positive things like you can say there's one, there's one. [0:03:04.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and they just - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like they don't really feel alive in yourself so they don't kind of really feel like they push you up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I, when I, when (inaudible at 0:03:14.7) happens and I feel like I've done something positive or been effective, I recognize it and I feel like I guess a momentary confidence about, or competence, but the things that that's they're sort of rare, isolated incidents and I'm more aware of things that are negative then I am of things that are positive. I, just, that's kind, just kind of a statement and I just kind of, I guess what really begins to bother me is the fact that I... that what you pointed out is about looking at myself and observing myself, rather than really, I don't even know what it is, like you used the terms talking from myself or being from myself and I guess that's really disturbing that I don't know, I don't know how to deal with that. [0:04:24.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you look, you looked very disturbed at kind of the disturbance come when you looking at yourself, talking at yourself or something, is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I don't - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really upset you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I don't know, it's just, it's the, what, it goes back to, well I don't know what it goes back to, it's just that discovering that and like, and I'm just... I feel very uncomfortable about that and I don't, I don't know what to... it's like, yeah, I mean, like I don't know what to do with it because I do really feel uncomfortably. That's been going through my head, like you just keep looking at yourself, talking to myself, but like talking to myself about somebody else. And I don't think I feel like a connection between that, talking about myself and myself as I may really be or whatever. [0:05:37.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean, especially when you don't know what to do with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well I don't know how to deal with it and I feel like, I guess the feeling I have is that I, that I need to deal with that. I need to bring myself together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see, I see what you're saying, like you kind of want to bring yourself and the part that talks at you, blend it into one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like you really feel disoriented because you just don't know how to do it. (inaudible at 0:06:06.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, yeah, that, I don't know how to do it, I don't know that, yeah, I just don't know if what to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Has it been upsetting because like since we've talked you been seeing yourself do it or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I'm a little more conscious of it in the last couple days, just aware of it. I, yeah... I don't know where... where to go from, from here with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of, is it kind of like it there it is and it almost feels like this wall that you're up against and - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  - dead-end. [0:06:55.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like coming over, like feeling panicked about, well I don't know what to say because that was still in my mind and I, and it's like I really don't know what to say except that I'm, like that that's sort of it hit me and it hasn't made me depressed, like I haven't really been depressed but it's bothersome. And then, like I teach a drama course at a pre (ph) school in the lower east (ph) like this is where I come from on Wednesdays and what we did today was (background noise) [I have some kind of interesting connections I guess] (ph), like I took a bunch of emotions like love and hate and sorrow and joy and anger and I said now I want individuals to look at those, think about it, see what it, what it comes to your mind and act on it, express it in some way and like what was really strange is that everybody sat there. You just can't, you know I can just sit here and feel love, I can't express it and I was saying, well okay, but when you're, if you're going to get up on the stage and act or something to an audience they have to know you're feeling it, they have to see it in some way or another that you're feeling really hateful, or that you're feeling anger. But it was very hard for anybody to get up and show it, to find a way of expressing it. [0:08:25.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And did you see yourself there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, I all of a sudden felt, like there's a real identity cation (ph) that it isn't, maybe it's just very difficult for lots of people in a... to express what they're feeling. And one kid came to [audio gap] point saying, well I have to have somebody else to show it and she was doing love, and I suggested, well maybe to express some of these things we have to do it in an interaction with somebody else. But the point about it is that I saw other people having a great deal of difficulty, even, even though it was not necessarily a sincere feeling because we were trying to act it, it was still to try and figure out how you express it, how you show it, was really a hard thing. And I, maybe I felt comfortable in knowing that -  [0:09:33.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Knowing that you had company.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, knowing that, wow, I guess it really isn't very easy to express things. And even expressing joy wasn't an easy thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kind of the feeling there was, it kind of made you feel a little more relaxed about it all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess, yeah I guess it was realize (inaudible at 0:10:01.2) and I felt comfortable to recognize that it's just not easy to do that. Even under sort of pretenses of acting, to think about what you're like and kids would say, well when I'm angry I just sit and stew sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you feeling a little nervous like the, are you (inaudible at 0:10:29.6)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. (inaudible) my nerves. I'm just, I guess floundering for what, what to say if, I guess I maybe that's what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Meaning you kind of feeling that dead-end again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I feel a need to pick up on something else. I don't know. Although I don't feel resolved about the kinds of things we've been talking about. I feel like if we continue like doing, talking about where we got to last time we talked, it's just going in circles with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what feels most important for you to talk about? [0:11:17.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (Silence) Well I g... yeah I guess there's, there's an issue, but it's a really hard thing for me to talk about because I, it's a really uncomfortable thing. I'm... it comes in I guess relationships with men. And I guess it's very much connected to the kinds of things we've been talking about and it's a thing that bothers me very much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can tell.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it really does. It's a really hard thing for me to talk about at all and I guess it's a thing that, like I can objectify and talk about things we've talked about before to other people. But this is something I don't. [0:12:27.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really just you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess it's something I keep more to myself than anything else. I don't know what... where... where to, I was thinking just before coming in and I was thinking where it... where it fits in and, and why I have, like I have sort of a kind of weirds (ph) it's not necessarily a fear of men per se, it's a fear of closeness more, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You talking about physical closeness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm, physical closeness, as well as emotional closeness. Like I have some very close male friends, but they're very safe relationships because they're either married or have a girlfriend or I've just known them well enough and know that we're just friends and there's a certain degree of... well, I didn't, I guess that the emotional closeness doesn't go very deep really either, it's more of a just an acquaintance friendship type thing. [0:13:55.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some, something kind of on an even keel, but not real gutsy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And anytime I feel that a man is attempting to get close to me - more so physically than emotionally - like I get really scared and I get really scared about it and become really cold.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: and it really makes you really tense inside?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Clam up/</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feel very tight (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm very cautious of how I, how I react.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you really step way back kind of (inaudible at 0:14:48.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I... it's not the same, I don't... I don't see it as the same thing in my relationship with Don. Probably because we've worked through a lot of things, like I've... I can feel close to him because I... like I really believe in him and I believe in his love for me and it, but I... but when it comes to any other males, it's just a really, really difficult thing. I don't like... I don't like feeling uncomfortable about that and I don't know why... I like to feel I'm an equal with people, men or women and I don't know if part of its because I'm afraid of being used, afraid of being dominated. But something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I don't, I'm not sure I understand why, but I would like you to talk more about when you say it's more of like physical closeness, like what, I mean, like it's more, more of a physical closeness, isn't that what you were saying? [0:16:11.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it like when there's sexual overtones?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I guess it's just a fear of being involved in a sexual relationship with someone and I, and I carry these thoughts that a lot of men I've met, since I've been in New York, and I really get the feeling that they're very much interested in a sexual relationship. And on occasion I... like I've... on one hand I'll say, well, yeah, it might be fun and it might be exciting, but I get really scared and I can never really allow myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you scared about? [0:17:04.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure what I'm scared about. Like I've always told myself I'm always afraid of getting pregnant, but I don't know if that's just a rationalization, I'm not sure. I don't know, I'm not sure. Maybe it's partly because I... I don't know if I feel anything, in a physical relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel attractive? Do you feel like you have trouble, feel like sexually attracted to (inaudible at 0:17:37.0)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I used to more so than I do now. I mean I used to not, not feel physically attracted to people, to men. I'm not so sure that's true now. But I don't... it's not a, it's not a, it's not a... I don't know, like I don't... if I see a man or I meet somebody and I'm not... it doesn't... I don't feel physically attracted to him. I may watch them for a while and notice something about whether he appears physically attractive. But it... but it's not something that ever... I'm aware of consciously, aware of when I first meet someone. Maybe part of it's just a ph-a physi-a fear of not being physically attractive. [0:19:12.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is the fear in there something like fear of yourself as not being a woman?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess, yeah, I guess that, that's part of it. Yeah. Like my, like my sexual relationship with Don is the kind of thing is going very, very slowly like I've... I had to move very slowly in being comfortable and like he's a physical person and he's had a lot of sexual relationships with women and is very comfortable, and I'm not. And I, I don't know, I don't know what to say. [0:20:23.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can, if you want a minute, I realize it's, it's hard for you, I mean I realize kind of talking about this is making you uncomfortable. I mean if you want you maybe can... it might be if you could say more about what you mean having to move slowly with (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, before I, before I knew him, I really hadn't had much of sexual relationships with anyone because I'd back off from it... from it anytime it came close and anytime.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were afraid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I never...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were you afraid of, do you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What was I afraid of? I guess just sex, I don't know, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scared you, you didn't know what to do with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I didn't know what to do with it, didn't know how to act. [0:21:24.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:21:25.9) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no, no, oh, you're not - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid you wouldn't feel anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like I wouldn't - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you wouldn't feel any sexual arousal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid kind of you'd see yourself as an asexual (ph) person, not a woman.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that's it because, because I don't feel... I don't always feel warmth or anything in coming physically in contact with someone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it really worries you, (inaudible at 0:22:09.6) it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does, very much so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something wrong with you. [0:22:13.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I've given that a lot of... I guess I think there is something wrong with me. (Silence) You know which is something I really want to do something about. I don't... I guess I feel like I have... I believe that I have the potential to feel things for people but what's wrong is that I'm not, I don't. Or I don't allow the feelings to come out. Like I, I know what I'm saying is going back and I feel like I'm backing off, but I guess I want to, I don't know. It... the fear I have of not feeling something sexually goes along with, with what we've said and it's like running into a brick wall again. That's it what I feel it, like that's what I feel like is really wrong with me as a person. [0:23:31.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you're saying. You... are you saying, well if I can get in to talking about what's wrong with me sexually, we're just going to hit a brick wall, where it comes back to that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so, I... well yeah, because I'm making a connection with what we've said before and seeing that is part of what I feel is wrong. And maybe it's also a fear that, well there's nothing to come of it, noth-nothing to work through it and, which, which makes me fearful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Talking about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is also part of the fear that, that also feels very upsetting to talk about (inaudible at 0:24:28.6)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah, it is, it's really, yeah, it's really hard. It's very hard for me to talk about it. Like oh, I guess all kinds of... all kinds of things are going on inside and I don't know and I'm afraid to say anything. I'm not sure what to say ne... like it's, it's also very confused.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say all sorts of things are going on inside and I'm afraid to say anything, you mean like what's it going to sound like? What's going to, what's going to come out? How much is going to come out? What's it going to do - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I... and yet... well like you said it's really hard to talk about and I'm afraid to talk about, about it. I'm, mostly that, I'm just afraid. [0:25:28.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you afraid it's going to... may overwhelm you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When it does... and in a lot of ways it does. Because I can't talk about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Keep it inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like must pound inside at you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes I, like I guess I want to, but I... it's that thing like I just can't get it out and I... and I'm like I've been able to and, sometimes, talk about it when I'm with Don because he has a real closeness to it, to our sexual relationship and, and I feel comfortable, more comfortable talking about my difficulties with him because, because of our closeness. But we just come into it and we just really kind of come to a dead-end about it. We've, like we've had sexual intercourse and we've been sleeping together, like probably for two years, but that hasn't, like I still have a lot of hang-ups about it and it still... like it isn't, it isn't the pleasurable thing for me that I, that I want it to be and that's what really d... like makes me feel like there's something really -  [0:27:07.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something wrong with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - very wrong with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why, why is that that you (crosstalk) - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's, well it's kind of (inaudible at 0:27:24.0) feeling and I guess what becomes so frightening about the sexual relationship is I guess I look at that as being a very close thing and that that comes to strong, really strong feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you know (inaudible at 0:27:46.7) feelings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that they're not always there - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Crosstalk). Yeah it's like your, yeah, it's kind of a thing (inaudible at 0:27:56.1) saying it's like you're not always there and I'm afraid you're seeing (ph) that they're not always there, that they're not there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I do see them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but the p... but I think what the... it's what you're saying it's so upsetting because like what I do see is the, is that a kind of, the feelings aren't there and that really, I see the (inaudible at 0:28:23.8) this is kind of, it's kind of complicated, I'm not sure I have it clear. I see that the feelings aren't there, but what I'm really upset about is the seeing that they're not there. That's kind of why it's upsetting to talk about because...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's upsetting... well that's just most upsetting is because when it comes to, to an intimate relationship and I, and I love him... I'm... sometimes I have doubts about that but as much as I can... as much as I can identify with that feeling -  [0:29:01.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm that you love him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I love him and when I can't... when I can't feel that closeness and love and sharing kind of thing in our sexual relationship it's re... it's that's what becomes really frightening because it seems that that's... we're closest coming together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and you just don't have that inside you that (inaudible at 0:29:38.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't want to think I don't have it inside of me, but maybe that's... maybe that's true, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:29:47.7)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I've gone and I've... I don't believe it's not there, I just believe it isn't free, it doesn't come out. Like I... like there's something that keeps me from feeling things and that's general, not just in a sexual relationship, but all of the kinds of things we've talked about and when it comes down to that closeness and that much sharing and I still can't feel... sometimes I feel that I, I think I can, but - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well when you're feeling - </p>

<p>CLIENT:  - it's like it doesn't come natural or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, when you feel like you think you can, do you worry about if it's going to, going to be there? I mean like, like, like when you're having intercourse, are you constantly worried about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah, I am about what's happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you, what goes through your mind? [0:30:55.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well sometimes I... sometimes I'm thinking about other things and then I think and sometimes I have to concentrate very hard on what we're doing, our own touching and feeling and just be very conscious of... like I have to concentrate and I don't feel like I ought to be having to concentrate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you feel like you kind of have to tell yourself what to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah, sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't, sometimes I can feel the closeness and I... I guess I think that I felt like I... I'm like a, growing to feel more comfortable and enjoy... enjoying myself more than I used to. You know like I used to even dread going to bed. [0:32:21.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because then there's sex in bed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and really uncomfortable and I don't feel that s... very much anymore. I, I think I, I do, I do enjoy myself, but I still run into, to, to fears of having intercourse and having to concentrate on what's going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, can you say something about what are, what are the fears like when you feel yourself fearing, what are you thinking about, (inaudible)? [0:33:05.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm not enjoying then what the hell am I doing. You know, why do this if I'm not enjoying myself and sometimes I get jealous because Don is enjoying himself and I'm not. Sometimes I... I'm fearful because he may not be enjoying himself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you're not enjoying yourself, because you're (crosstalk) - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm not giving of myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like when you're in there you just really kind of worrying about how you are and what's wrong with you. [0:33:59.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, when you say I'm worried about how I am I was thinking about looking at myself again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you're... yeah, it's like you're not there, you're worrying about being there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I just, that really gets to me like I don't know whether I ever feel myself or if I'm always looking at myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well like, looked everywhere - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  - (inaudible at 0:34:30.0) just kind of standing back and watching yourself, like watching you (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I, that's, that bothers me because I, I don't know whether that's true. You know, I don't know whether I'm really looking at myself or if that is the way I am and that maybe I'm not looking at myself but that's the way I've put it. I don't know. [0:35:04.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you're not sure what you feel. I guess you sure know like when you're in bed having sex is going to be safe. If you're not there then maybe why aren't you there because you're worrying about being there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yes, that, wait say that again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what you're saying to me is like when you're in bed, it's like what you do know is that you aren't there in part maybe because (inaudible at 0:35:30.6) you're really worrying about being there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: worrying about how you're doing, what you're feeling, not just kind of relaxing. It's like you're tight, tense you're looking at yourself. You look scared. [0:35:56.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I... yeah, I just... like that's just, I, that, it just comes to the same thing, like I just that's frightening to me, I don't like it, I... it scares me and I don't know what to do about it. Except for the... for really defining it or identifying it is... like things that we've said about looking at myself and the way feelings come up from looking at myself rather than from myself. Those... that has been there for a long time and, and it, it's what I see as being really wrong. [0:36:54.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it's kind of like when you kind of... when... when it all happens and you maybe feel like you feel that the only... like you, you say, you get scared, you get worried and all you can do is really kind of look at it. Is that what you're saying, kind of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's kind of like, is that some kind of like you back away from like those feelings of scaredness and upsetness and look at them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I back away from them as much as... I don't think I back away from them, I think I know they're there, but I - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't let them come (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no it's not that, it's more that they're there and I, and I'm aware of being very frightened of all that and, and it's that it's not right and I feel like I (stomach rumbles) - need something for lunch - and I feel like I want to work that through so that I don't have to be scared of that. That I... of feeling anything in any kind of a situation and most particularly in my sexual relationship with Don and I want to... I want to work that through because I don't feel like it's right, it's not normal, it's not the way I -  [0:38:34.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right, but is your fearing like it's, well okay let's - </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think I back away from it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let's say you're feeling really scared and frightened, let's say you're, you're feeling bad. What do you do with that scared and frightness (inaudible at 0:38:50.5) you say it's wrong, I want to work it through? Do you say it when -  [0:38:56.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No I don't say it. I keep it inside of myself. I don't think I ever expressed saying that I'm scared or I'm frightened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:39:15.7) you really do keep all those kind of doubts and fears inside yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, yeah, although I, I think that, that like Don and I talked about it and I talked about it in terms of saying, well I don't know what I said, but I, but I know that, that I've said to him in one way or another that, that I'm not always comfortable and that, that I don't always like to be making love. And he can... and he's an understanding person and he doesn't usually get upset, like he's pretty supportive, but, but doesn't really provide anything that, that helps change the way I feel about it. [0:40:36.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say you told him with (ph) in one way or another, what, what... is the feeling there kind of like if you were to really say kind of when you're feeling scared, I'm really feeling scared, and say I don't (inaudible at 0:40:48.0) another time I'm not... I don't feel quite comfortable, do you think like he would know what to do with that? Believe you or - </p>

<p>CLIENT: No I don't, and I'm not scared anymore. It's not being scared anymore. Of sex. It's being scared because I'm not really satisfied and, and sometimes cheated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like he's had a normal feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:41:22.4)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (silence) and I guess I don't so much as say anything as like, maybe my face just shows that I'm not very comfortable and I don't feel very good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I can't say it, I guess I really don't say it. Well if I do, it's rarely, rarely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Disturbed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Disturbed, why? Because you keep it inside?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. That it doesn't get resolved. Yeah, I guess I don't... if something is really disturbing me, I don't usually go to somebody else to get help with doing something about it. I'd rather work it out by myself. Yeah, I've said that, so it's not something that I... I've talked of to anybody. Maybe because there's also a fear that there's nothing to do about it anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you can tough it out and (inaudible) then what do you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just the same place I was before only feeling probably a lot closer to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feeling a lot worse because...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I can't do anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it seems while that you've tried everything? It's like - </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think, no I don't think necessarily that I, that I feel like I've tried everything, it's just that I don't know what else to do. I don't know what else to try. I don't know if I've tried anything. I'm just very much at a loss.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel lost right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I... confused and lost and I don't know what else. I guess that's just where I am right now. I don't have anything to say, I don't know... I don't know what to do, where to go. It's just being, I guess empty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel empty (background noise)? It's kind of like that all seems so confusing and where does it... where am I going with it and... is it hopelessness then, too? You know and I kind of sense bleak-looking - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it is. I don't like to be hopeless, but maybe that's where I really am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Feel like, what the hell can I do with all this stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It... yeah, and I guess I'm seeing that I guess there's nothing I... I don't know. In one way, just very confusing that all things have just piled up and I can't even sort them out right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you feel kind of deluged by the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they don't seem to... it's kind of like they all come down, but you don't get clear of any of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I don't feel comfortable. I don't... may, may... I guess I just feel really helpless, but I don't accept that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like you say it, but you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not really ac-I don't really accept that. I g-... it's just I guess I have belief that there's some... someplace, but that something has to come out of me that will help me see something about myself sort of having... it's just so confusing. I just feel like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now is this (ph) going to mean to you but it's like I think what might be... really might, might help you to come, when you say see somebody (inaudible) yourself, it's more almost like letting something come out of yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sort of - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the door (ph) - </p>

<p>CLIENT:  - know what you mean and I sort of don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are feelings there, there are worries and there are fears. Feelings of hopelessness, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're there, but not quite, do you understand what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was... I just said that I was thinking they're there, but I can't... I don't know how to express them, I don't know if I can in any way and I guess maybe there's a question of whether they're really there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or - </p>

<p>CLIENT: But they are they - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  - they're there potentially, but whether (ph) you really letting yourself feel what's there. Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think they're there because... I guess what... I think they're there because I wouldn't, I wouldn't be trying to do something about what I feel is wrong if I hadn't... if I couldn't feel uncomfortable or afraid about that. One thing just pops into my mind is I... it scares the hell out of me to think of going through my whole life the way I am right now. And I, and I don't - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Never being... never having changed, never... always being this way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I just don't want to do that. I - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you scared - </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just really scary to think of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that you may be stuck with the way you are for the rest of your life. Like really (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what scares you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It scares me and I don't like it and I want to change it or grow. Like I guess I have a slight bit of faith in growing and maturing and maybe changing. Maybe I'm too impatient, but it seems that I... it seems that I'm in some ways I can continue to grow, but because I, I'm not doing anything about those kinds of fears that they aren't going to change and I don't want to... I want, I really want to do that because I don't want to be stuck with where I am right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a sense that it's kind of almost a fright to kind of... your sense is read, your fate is sealed, and you may end up that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think that that's it, I don't, I don't want to stay where I am right now. Unable to, unable to express feelings, unable to feel close and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say unable to feel close, do you mean unable to feel sexual, as well as close?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And probably even... probably more have feelings sexually than feel close because I - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't feel (inaudible) - </p>

<p>CLIENT:  - I feel close. Yeah. I feel very close to Don, but I, but I don't feel very good about my sexual relationship with him. Sometimes I thought of what I ought to do is have some sexual relationships with someone else and I don't really want to, but that's also scary because I'm afraid I'll... well, I'm pretty sure that a-nothing's going to change. I have a much closer relationship with him and if I'm going to feel sexually, it's probably with him than it is, rather than with somebody else, who I don't give a damn about. But also because I just really don't want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like you don't want to, but you sure as hell do want to really feel like a sexual person, like a woman.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a live sexual woman.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Get turned on] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Silence) It's not so much that I can't be turned on as much as I just don't get a full satisfaction out of sexual intercourse. That's what's... like I can, I can feel turned on and I can be turned on when I'm with Don.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean sexually excited.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't (ph) have orgasms.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When, when we're having sexual intercourse and maybe it's just a, and maybe it's just a thing with fears of being pregnant, although I don't really have them anymore. I don't think basically because Sarge is sterile and I don't have to worry about getting pregnant. Sometimes I keep thinking it's things that were kind of inbred in me when I was growing up. There wasn't a lot of physical feeling, emo-in my family. My parents are physically kind of cold people, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of somehow see it that may have had an effect on you (inaudible) - </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The feelings kind of like the physical stuff is not a warm stuff, it's cold stuff, kind of made (audio drag)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like you grow up with sexist, taboo kinds of things and I don't know whether that's really just ingrained in me someplace and I can't overcome it. Like I feel like I come away from my family with very little emotions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. They, it's... they've been (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my father is a minister and so he's like a giving person when it comes to other people and helping other people and doing something for them. When it comes to house (ph)...like family kinds of things, it's a concern and you know he cares, but I don't know where the warmth is. Where... okay, we can hug each other, but I don't know there's nothing... I don't know - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You don't know if he... it's warm inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We do need to stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so I've got to start from scratch with you, hold, let me get a piece of paper.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What happened to the charts?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know, we purged a lot but we've got people, you know, up to 3 years, we put them downstairs but you </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well the first time I was here was in, right after December 11th, uh, September 11th.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> September 11, 2001.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But right, I saw you last year, I mean I saw you </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm here because my doctor wanted me to see you because I take the medication</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So he thought it would be a good idea.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, anyway, since I saw you last, how have you been?  How's your mood?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, I mean one of the, one of the reasons I came is because I wanted to say hello to you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For the Christmas season, huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The other reason is that my doctor wants me to be coming to you because of the medication</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So I can monitor the, uh, -  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He says, you know, you're taking all</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What are you taking, remind me what you're taking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking, I take a sleeping pill, I take the, uh, that white diamond, 3 pieces I take 1, Trazodone</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, Trazodone, that the 150 mg daily dose, you take a third?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, the whole thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You take the whole thing, 150?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you take Trazodone 150</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then Ambien</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Plus Ambien, good</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Ambien 10 or the, uh, 12.5 controlled release?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Ten, I think.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, what else?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, I told a Zoloft, the little one now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The 50, the blue?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The blue or the, uh - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's like light green</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh the green, that's 12.5, that's 25</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah is that the lightest</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You take 1 of the 25's?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, does it help?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, it helps</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean the edge?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It takes the irritability down a notch</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Do you want to know the other stuff I'm taking, for my heart or</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Cozaar and that kind of stuff</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let's leave that</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, that's fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's your mood like in this past year?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, you know, sort of an acceptance of reality which, you know, I mean that's not being cynical, you know, I understand that life is -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're still with your woman, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we're married.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You got married</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, 3years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're in the same apartment or you still keep the 2 apartments?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We still keep the 2 apartments because of her cat.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you still</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And because of the size and because of the rent and that maybe I'll be going off stabilization so who knows, maybe I'll move to Israel.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why are you going off stabilization?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I reached $2,000</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But it's both that and an income test.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you've got to mess with your income to get below.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If I can.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can't mess with -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I can't, I just can't, I mean you know it's not a lot of money that they and it's ridiculous because I take care of my daughter, her place which is</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's not like $200,000?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's $175,000</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can't push it below that by moving?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm still sort of, and no it's not a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, it's not enough for you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Can you move it into your wife's name?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't want to move it into your wife's name?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't, I don't</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, ah, have they told you that they're going to</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I know they will, I mean it's just a matter, I mean that's they're business, they'll do it.  I mean, hopefully, they won't go crazy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right but it'll be immediately market rates.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So they say.  I mean it won't, it won't be disastrous.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where do you live?  [INAUDIBLE]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] and I have a one bedroom.  I mean, you know, it'll be all right.  I know the owner, the landlord.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Anyway you could move it to someone else's name?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's such a shame to lose a rent stabilization, you know, it's like a crime against nature</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, ah, the thing is that when you get to be older, you know, I mean there will be a certain amount of time I'm not going to making this kind of money</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So who knows, I'll worry about that when the time comes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you can't get it back, you can't get rent stabilization back once you lose it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, [NAME OTHER], he was talking about moving that number up to 2800 instead of 2000</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so your mood is okay.  Your relationship is okay, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is she busting your balls or you're all right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she's a, she's a woman.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, we'll leave it at that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we travel a lot.  We're gonna be going to China this year</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In January, China.  We're going to go to Singapore and then fly to Beijing for a few days to see what it's all about.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then go back to Hong Kong and take a cruise from Hong Kong to Viet Nam and wind up in [INAUDIBLE] where the tsunami was, and you know, we're going to be away for, I don't like to go to foreign places, it really is very depressing for me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I'd like it if it was 1950 but, um - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well things have changed in [INAUDIBLE], I mean, you know, yeah it's</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Everywhere</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Florida is not for you, you're a</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not for me.  I mean I hate the cold, I mean but it's not for me, so as I say, we go away</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is she dragging you to Florida though, does she want to go?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, she hates it</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She hates it too, good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she hates it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's a good match for you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  We go to the theatre, you know, we do a lot of stuff here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Do you have the mojo, do you have the drive to do things?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get pleasure?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> To go to the theatre</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so you're not flat?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you irritable?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not too much, no.  My biggest problem is, you know, why I'm really here is, um, every once in a while I just get over the edge and I get these anxiety attacks and I just can't be anywhere. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get the physiology of anxiety, fast heart rate, sweaty palms, can't catch your -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's more mental?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All mental.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're just in a state.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just don't want to be anywhere and I can't put myself anywhere.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What seems to set it off?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Probably enclosure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So a claustrophobic type of thing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Had you had panic attacks in the past?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so this is a close cousin to panic attacks?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Very.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But it's not actual panic attack because it doesn't have the physiology.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I never had a panic attack with the heart rate.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You never had that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> None of that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Never, never had that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When did you start getting these?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 1970 I had - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I mean lately?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I'm always pretty much on the, you know, it's always, it could always, it could always be, I had one, I get it sometimes when I go swimming in the pool, at a beautiful pool, the Chelsea Piers, it's open, I go there particularly because it is open and sometimes I just get, I've got to jump out of the pool, okay.  I got one the other day in bed, you know, I just, it was terrible, I just, and you know it lasts for maybe 5 minutes, sometimes it lasts longer, so I'm going to be on this plane for like 20 hours so I'm only concerned that I don't - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Lose it</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Flip out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well we'll slug you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We'll take a sledgehammer of medicine to your head and knock you out.  We'll just, you know, we'll drag, you can't be totally knocked out - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For the check in but after, once they start boarding, you're going to pop your meds - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you're going to stumble your way to your seat -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean it's not going to be terrible, I mean I can do it when I'm sitting down too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can, you know, some people get a lot of anxiety at that moment when they close the doors, when they start pulling out -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I never have.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Never have.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you really don't have a flying phobia?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You just have enclosed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean I'm always  I mean I just can't sit still, I've been that way since I'm born.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My whole life I just couldn't sit still - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Focus.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, absolutely, so that was, ah - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So that's basically my problem - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That gets a little better when you're on the Zoloft, right?  It's far better being on the Zoloft</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I took another 12 that night that it happened; I know it doesn't kick in right away but maybe - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it can, it can - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well anyhow, so anyhow I did.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And did it help?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I guess so, you know, as I, you know, I had mentioned to you before, you know, it's um, I was on a much higher dose and, you know, I cut it down, we talked about it, I cut it down as much as I could cut it down, I cut it down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But I think you're getting more panicky on the lower dose, correct?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean it could be, you know, but as I say, it's not all that terrible, I mean if it's lower I just go up and take another one but I, you know, I try not to do it 2 days in a row</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you like the Zoloft, you don't want to switch to something else?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It works.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  How's your appetite?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Too good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you gaining weight?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping okay with the Trazodone and Ambien?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Fair, sometimes, you know, it used to do a real number on me but now it's sort of - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you wake up in the early hours?  Can't get back to sleep?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I, I wake up, I, I can get back to sleep, I mean I have no place to go so that's a very good thing, you know, I don't have - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have to go to work.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Have an appointment that I have to be somewhere so I'm not thinking about that, so I don't really care if I stay in bed a little longer or whatever, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I don't do anything, except when I go to play golf then I'm happy to go, I look forward to that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is your energy decent?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, decent.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not dragging?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hey, I'm 74 years old, I'm banged up from all my athletics and bruises and so on, I drag but I understand that.  I mean I hurt like hell all over.  I go swimming, I get it the pool.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You ache all the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> From what, arthritis?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Arthritis and knees and, you know, all the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you take anything for that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I take a Celebrex, I take it until I don't want, I mean like I'll probably take it every day on the trip because I don't want to be in pain.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But then I'll stop and then when I, because I know, I believe the stuff is really no good for you, whatever.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So anyhow, I'm not, I don't take it as much as, I don't take it every day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's your self esteem?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Good, very good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You feel like you're okay, you're not guilty, you're not down on yourself?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's your daughter?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's fine, I mean she's, ah,  the one that has problems with her self esteem.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is she giving you a hard time still?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  She doesn't give me a hard time, she, ah, she never really did, she's, you know, I take care of her rent and I try, you know, we had talked about last time was being an enabler okay and we talked about how not to be an enabler, so she wants to be a physical trainer now, I said fine, go for it.  I mean I don't, she's coming with me on this cruise, okay?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She gets along with your wife okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and there's another woman coming who we met on another cruise so they're going to be roommates, I mean only because it's going to be a lot less.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hopefully they get along, I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do they sleep in the same bed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Same room.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they make separate beds.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they've got very nice accommodations.  It will be a real good trip, trip for my daughter, she's never been on first class, anywhere first class, never, so it'll be good for her, it'll be good exposure for her and, ah, so I bought her, you know I said go out and buy clothes.  And she went out and she said well you owe me $700, I mean you know, she doesn't spend money, that's one good thing about her is that, you know,  I don't really worry about her as far as her providing for herself.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because she doesn't, she's very frugal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She's down to earth.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, everything is a rip off for her, so you know, everything is too expensive so, ah, I think she's beyond.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you'd like to marry her off already?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean I would but I don't press it..</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does she date?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think so, she's very secretive, who are you going out with, a friend.  I don't know if it's a guy or a girl, or you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where does she live?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Near me, a couple of blocks down on Central Park, so, ah, she's, you know, I accept her for what she is, I don't expect her to be, I mean I never did, you know, I told her, I said look, you know, life is, you know, if you want to lift a thousand pounds you've got to start out with 10 and go to 20 and to 30 and find out how much you can lift and you get to that point then try to lift a little more, if you find out you're hurting yourself then that's your capability, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Do you have any suicidal thinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not at all.  The only anger I have is at cab drivers.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's normal.  The lingering issue then is this panicky stuff that doesn't seem to be different, high dose of Zoloft, low dose of Zoloft, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think it does.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You think the high dose suppresses it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so you're down at a dose below threshold for you, below a dose that will suppress this thing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean in a way I equate it with drinking, you know, I mean how much do you have to drink to, you know, I feel fine with it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you drinking a lot?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How much are you drinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not as much as [NAME OTHER].  Like yesterday, I had like a little vodka.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A shot or more than a shot.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A shot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> About how many shots a day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean sometimes I could have 5 and sometimes I could have none.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How about on average?  Most weeks, how many days do you have 5?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Four.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Four, so about half the time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Five, I mean it's not - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Five days a week you have - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have 5 shots?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, there could be 5, there could be 4, I never measured it, you know</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so most days - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If I go out to drink, I'll have 2 martinis and a glass of wine</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And do you think you're drinking too much or do you think it's about right, you're not getting drunk?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I get a little happy, you know, I feel good but I'm not getting where I don't know exactly what I'm doing, I certainly wouldn't want to, um, you know, do laser surgery or anything like that but, ah, um, you know, I know what I'm doing.  You know, my wife doesn't like it, she's - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, she's getting on your case?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, always about that, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you do things that you shouldn't do when you're drinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  You know, I may be more, ah, more sociable or something like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, gregarious.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and do you think that affects the panicky stuff at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not at all.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And can you make the panicky stuff go away with a shot?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't even try to.  I don't even think about that, it doesn't enter my mind.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What do you do to make it go away?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I, um, just have to wait the time for it to go away, you know, um, it doesn't really last that long, if it lasts 10 minutes, it's a long time, I mean 10 minutes is a long time when you're going through that stuff but maybe, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And does it happen any certain time of the day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, rarely does it happen in the morning.  I don't think it ever happens in the morning, you know, it usually happens, you know, closer to the evening.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> After you've been drinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Closer in the winter, you know, daylight, that whole business.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right, you're a little seasonal with these things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mostly it's better in the -  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When the days are longer</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When days are longer.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When it's sunny, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but I haven't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is your equivalent of your depressive illness wanting to bring it back in - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sorry.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is kind of your brain, your depressive illness.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, it's depression that gets worse with the shorter days.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know what happens is, what really happens is I have thoughts of, you know, sentimental thoughts or I have, like you know, things of the past, um, enclosure as I said before, ah, you know, just very maudlin, you know, melancholy about certain things and what it was.  I mean I don't know how normal that is, you know, as you get older about, you know, ah, I mean sometimes - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How frequently - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All the time - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean I think about, I mean it could be one day I'm thinking about all my old girlfriends, a friend of mine, that's not funny but he passed away the poor guy, you know, he got sick, a bachelor, he had 5 different girlfriends come to the wake.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> God bless him.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I got a call from one of his former girlfriends, you know, she called me from Georgia, she asked if it was me, blah, blah, blah, she's married and she still spoke to this guy everyday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, once a week, whatever, how you doing.  Um, but you know, I think about that stuff and when I was younger what I did.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Five old girlfriends still had positive feelings for him, this is a special guy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, a very lovely guy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know what, I mean why break up if there's still positive feelings, he found a way to slip out of those relationships.  He's the king.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's the king. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How did he do that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uncle [NAME OTHER], he was unbelievable, he really was.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Listen, I have a few folks that, you know, are not going to call you old but I have a few folks who are later on and they kind of have this drive that you're talking about, to almost put their life together, their life narrative to let it make sense for them and what I do is I send them to psychotherapy and it goes really nicely sometimes, just to have, it's almost like taking a course about yourself but in later life to kind of put things together, you know, to work through the life narrative and where you've been, what relationships have meant to you and attachments and mommy, daddy, girlfriends, wives, whatever, to just make some sense of it.  It's, you know, it's as good as watching a ball game.  I mean you have the time to do it and the means, you could probably benefit or at least enjoy a little bit of psychotherapy to work through these things.  Any interest?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Then don't do it.  When you develop interest, if you develop interest, we'll, we'll get you some but it's, you know, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I mean that's probably with everybody, it's</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, a lot of people aren't, don't go there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With the memories and all this crap?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is there anyway I can just forget about, there's nothing I can do to forget about that stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why would you want to, it sounds like it's, um, pleasurable or enjoyable.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well if it's your sense that's it driving some of the anxiety and that there's something - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, and there's like a lot of, like there are certain movies that I see with, they're cutting up people and this, I can't take that, I mean I really have a bad, I have a real bad problem with that. Guys, you know, cutting up people and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Which movie, Hostel, did you see that movie Hostel?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I'll tell you what I did see, I saw Atonement. Did you see it?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Very very heavy movie and very good, you should see it.  I don't know if you go - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't like heavy movies, I like light. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or killing, you know, good aggressive stuff.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, this was, there's a lot, I don't like it, okay, too violent, I don't like violence.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And that's new for you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I never really liked it, I don't get off on it.  I never used to, I don't like scary movies, I never did, I always was - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Too scared?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I would never go, I'm a coward, I'm a faggot, I don't know, I don't like it</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, well listen, if it's giving you trouble, you should go work it out with a therapist.  If you really get the sense, just think about it over the next few months.  If it's really something that is recurring, if you start dreaming about it, if it's starting to set off the panic things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have the greatest dreams.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, but if your sense is that these panicky things are being set off by that churning, then it may be worthwhile exploring what's churning, what's percolating and just to, you know, take some of the juice out of it.  For now, I would, if you weren't drinking so much, I would give you a medicine that turned off the panicky stuff, just turned it off in a second.  Right, you've been on these Valium type things.  Have you ever been on Ativan, Xanax, Klonopin?  Anyway -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think Valium, I took that but I drank when I took that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We don't, we don't really encourage people to drink while they take these meds.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I understand that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because 1 plus 1 equals 5.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's what happens, that's why I don't like to take them because I like to drink.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  The Ambien also, we're not crazy about using that with this level of drinking but I'm going to give it to you anyway.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> How about the Trazodone, is that - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine, that one doesn't bother you.  I'm going to give you, ah, Ativan and the reason, I'm going to caution you highly that you really shouldn't take it with alcohol on board but if you get into one of these panicky states, you take an Ativan, you put it under your tongue, let it dissolve, within a minute it's gone.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Will that, I also forgot to mention I have this restless leg and really I  - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There's another medicine we use for that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but I don't get it all - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does it keep you awake at night?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well sometimes I get it and sometimes I don't get it, like right now I sort of feel it coming on that I'm thinking about it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Try to ignore it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I will</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Ignore it.  The Ativan will help it by the way but there's another medicine we use if it really interferes with sleep, if it really gives you trouble at night we can use, you know, people who are kicking at night and - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do that, I do that a lot.  I've got to get my leg outside the bed, over the cover, over the blanket.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, do you want to be on another drug?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, right, so if you need it, we'll give it to you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Ativan is something I would not take all the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no, something you have with you and the funny thing that happens is once someone has it with them, they don't need it.  As long as they know that they can turn it off.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because all the anticipatory anxiety is gone, they don't have to be afraid that they might get into that state, it's really very good and so you do it once or twice and then you won't even use it anymore but, ah, just let me caution you about the alcohol interaction, it's as if you're taking an extra 2 or 3 shots if you take one of these, okay, it interacts.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What about the Zoloft, does that - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's one of them - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> My inclination, no, no, Zoloft is nothing, Zoloft doesn't count with this type of medicine, totally different. But my inclination is to push the Zoloft up at least a touch so we can get you above threshold for these panicky things.  You don't have to.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But if you want to, 50 mg isn't so terrible; it's not the worst thing in the world to take a blue one instead of a green one</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What are the yellow ones?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yellows are 100, so that's 4 times what you're taking.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But I think a 50 might be enough to suppress these things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Go to 50.  All right, so we're going to crank up the Zoloft to 50 and we're going to add some as needed Ativan and then you're going to come back whenever you want, 6 months, you know, whenever you want to chat.  I always, always enjoy seeing you.  By the way, there's also medicine for alcohol craving, if you really think you've become an alcoholic.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not an alcoholic; I just love to drink wine.  I just love it.  I love it.  I mean I love to have 2 or 3 glasses of wine, is that an alcoholic?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well an alcoholic is often when you lose control of it and most alcoholics start increasing the dose, so they start drinking more and more to get the same effect and then if you stop, you get the shakes and you get, do you ever get the shakes when you stop?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I have the shakes all the time.  I've had it, I mean maybe I -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe it's because you need a drink.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know that - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, that's age related, with age you get a little of the shakes.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I, you know, let's put it this way, I, I, I've been drinking my whole life and, you know, to have 1 drink, you know, it's like having - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not like a Jewish guy, you're like an Irish guy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I know a lot of Irish guys like that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the fact that, you know, I tell them to try to stop drinking, they look at me and say, you know, this is my life.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I can remember my father, I mean he used to come home and always have, the wide label was, he came in and maybe had a shot glass</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Of course, he checked out when he was 52 so I have no idea.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you beat him by a couple of decades.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, believe me I was thinking about that when the day came.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, when you hit 52?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, before.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to write for 90 of these.  This is actually quite a small dose of the Ativan, so if you need more than 1 to turn it down you can but remember, let it dissolve under your tongue, that's the way it works, boom and if you need more, just give me a call.  What's your address?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's your age again?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My age?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll be74 next - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So 73.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want a Zoloft prescription?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess for that.  What did you say I should take, 50's?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So should I take 100's and break them in half</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that avoids going to the pharmacy more.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But I'm writing that you take 1 a day of the Zoloft but you take half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So now - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you need the Trazodone?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I have all that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I have it from, will this, will this um, you know, I get it from Medco, this stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Oh, so you - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, will this, will this supersede even though they sent me the pills because this is a different prescription than the - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, this you bring to the regular pharmacy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want me to write for a 3 month supply, you can mail it away or often they fax to us the request and then we can fax it - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll take this to the pharmacy.</p>

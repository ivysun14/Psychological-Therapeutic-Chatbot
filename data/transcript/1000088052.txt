<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay you guys. Client 042600251/8 number 2. 0426002. Second tape number 105. Have fun.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. There should be kind of a way to bring up the subject. Like they get an agenda or something because seriously

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that it's like hard to start?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I really - yeah you're just kind of picking it out of the air and...and you know the things I've been thinking about you know when you get here in the cold light of day they don't seem that important. Or you know...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Sort of I guess the agenda you've been carrying around with you just kind of melts and - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. No it - yeah I'm just wondering if I was going to have enough to talk about. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: 20 sessions. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That seems like a long time from what you have.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I can go over the same things over and over and over again. See what it means. We'll both be bored to tears. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And what's, and boring repetition with nothing new.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I guess it's - you know I've been thinking it's sort of like if you stay - the later you stay up the longer it takes in the morning to get up. But I'm really, I'm really a witch in the morning. You know I'm like drastic out there. He'll say, "What's for breakfast?" And I'll say, "You're too late." Or "Do we have to have it again this morning? We just had one yesterday." He wants to be near me. I think actually one of them - that is one of the topics that I'd like to get solved. To start the day and learn to kind of, to go to, you know, learn my limits. Like I can't stay up 'til 12 every night. 'Cause I know what I'm going to be like the next day. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. But you - it sounds like you wake up sort of kicking and screaming and not wanting to - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh I never want to get out of bed, no. No. I think like the girls are always so cheery in the morning and it turns my stomach. It's so sick. You know to get up in the morning and go "ah."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Gotcha. And the air around your face is -

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's really deep, yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Nice and pleasant in the morning.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But they're happy. Well you know like when I make - I hate to cook because nobody eats my meals. The girls don't eat breakfast, they have a bite of toast. But I have to get up. If I make pancakes they eat, you know, one lousy pancake. Same with my husband. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So what's the point of having to get up and make a whole spread when they just nibble?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But they have to have it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: More for their minds than their stomachs.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's - you know at 8:00 you have to eat breakfast whether they're hungry or not. And they're never hungry. And that's the way - but then I was thinking well, you know, like everything I do I like be complimented on. And nobody compliments me on my meals they just sit down, they eat what they want, picking, then get up and leave. You know it's really kind of a disgusting thing for a woman. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well I'm hearing you say that I like to be complimented for what I do. And I only - not complimented and just taken for granted, then I'm insulted.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I am. I'm not that bad of a cook, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But they - or like one night we had sandwiches and Jim was extraordinarily hungry. "Oh, oh no, I don't want these." The next night I make this big meal and nobody eats a thing. What am I doing this for?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It makes you feel enraged doesn't it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Oooh, I could break their heads. You know that's - I wish, you know, I just know but I would like to be able to anticipate what they're going to need. It seems like I do something and they decide it's - they should do it differently. Every - everything I do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sort of sounds like every time you zig they zag.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. I can't ever understand it. There's always complaints, you know. Where's this, where's that? You know, the washing, the ironing. I'd like to see a man try. I'd like to have Jim feel it. How it is to do everything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel like they could do -

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's taken for granted that you'll do it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well he says, "Well I know I couldn't do it either, but could you please do it better?" And you know he doesn't say please. I mean he admits that he couldn't do it, even attempt as well as I do it but I'm not doing it good enough for him. I don't think the girls really know or mind what happens in the house. That's just life. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sort of sounds like you say that like kind of making fun of what you said or -

</p><p>PATIENT: It's really been a bad day. But I had a chance, got to take - because I was looking for a babysitter when Jim was supposed to be home at noon. You know he didn't phone, he didn't say anything. I'm just sitting there waiting for him to come in the door. I'd like to hear that excuse. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're getting farther from your goal. I'm frazzled and tired out and irritated and part of that is his - like he lets you down right now.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Had he have come you could've taken an aspirin and not have the hassle of the babysitter. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes he did. He did let me down. Well it's not that bad. It's just been - it's just been a bad day. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Getting hot outside. I don't like the heat. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just don't like anything today?

</p><p>PATIENT: No! I really don't. Oh I, you know I saw just a - a horrible thing today. 


</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hm.

</p><p>PATIENT: This old man got off the bus, the bus driver was straddling the brakes and knocked him down and he cracked his hip he couldn't stand up. There were 2 guys holding him up. But he just left him there. He had to like crawl off the bus. I didn't see that. But these 2 guys with my friend came out, they were picking him up. This world. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Crippled, maimed, wounded to fend for themselves. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I do. I feel its - I don't think I know anybody like that. That would do that. But there's got to be. I mean somebody left him laying there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's not even human.

</p><p>PATIENT: It isn't. And the other day Jim said he was riding on the bus he said "I met a really good bus driver." I could hardly swallow that one until I saw that old man today. What do you mean? He let everybody on before he shuts the door. Don't you generally? I mean it was either the man fell - slammed on the brakes and he fell and cracked his hip or he gets his leg caught in the door 'cause he's, you know standing up waiting for the bus to open. I never heard of such a thing. I've lived a sheltered life.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It makes you feel as indignant as all get out. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well and then what do you do? There was some lady standing there said, "Oh well he should've got the number of that bus." Here this old man is bent in pain just screaming - he can't even scream, his nose is running and I just, I just couldn't take it. And they asked them did they need a car and these two boys, they didn't really know what to do with him either. Well you kind of hate to move him. You know, what do you do with this old man? You might move him and really, I don't know, you have to move him. But they were, well at least they stopped. Everybody else stood around and looked and said, "Isn't that horrible?" 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: 'Cause they walked off.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, no they stand around and watch everybody in pain. 'Cause it's you know kind of a diversion, I guess. But I don't know what's one to do. So that elderly man, he looked like, you know, that's it. You've cracked your hip at that age and you're done for. And nobody has the decency to do anything for him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You also said that in that situation you saw what was happening and -

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh yes. I said, "I have a car here" to the boys and they said, "we have a car too." Well I thought well use it! I really do get irritated when people stand around and so many of them do, they just come and stand. I mean, if they have a car and then they went to get the car and I suppose they would take him to the hospital. But in the meantime he'd have stood, or he couldn't possibly stand, I mean you couldn't stand in that pain. This man is holding him. And just - I just think people are so indecisive. You just look at it and see what has to be done and you do it. Or let somebody suffer like that. Jim says I'm so naï¿½ve that I don't realize that the risk...anybody would ever do that. It started out as a bad day. I was supposed to take the kids to the park, my neighbors and I. It started raining so my neighbor called and said, "Let's go to the store instead." So we were all prepared for that and the other neighbor comes in and. Like you know, and there was another lady that I was going - that has an apartment taken. And so here, the friend that first suggested it and the other lady go off to a venture and here are my kids, whining that they don't want to go to the store. You know? But the girl that first mentioned it didn't - It really - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you must've felt like let down or -

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Probably you'd think that I was jealous because I wished that I could've stopped at ____ because that's a lot more fun than going to the grocery store. But I had this other lady who was all set to go, she didn't want to go shopping. And she had, like I had to take her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were stuck. I don't understand that, it's like you were stuck with that other lady, you were committed to her so you were stuck going to the store with her. While you know this other one who's like free to go off and adventure.

</p><p>PATIENT: She had mentioned it to me. She's the one who wanted to go.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Who started it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And so I - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were going to the store with the other lady.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I bought her groceries for her 'cause she went to meet.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay so we went. But they had this evil fit 'cause I took the kids. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But they didn't even go.

</p><p>PATIENT: No! It's just so irritating. I take everybody's kids while they go.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You also just feel used.

</p><p>PATIENT: I do. I really do feel used. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Stuck with the kids and the grocery shopping. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's really ridiculous. I mean I change my plans, and then she changed hers to do, like, you know - it's more fun.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. For her.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was going to help her anyway.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that view - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I feel like anytime I help her she - it's like that man on the bus. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like - so about one thing after another and, like -

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just one thing after another. But I just don't feel happy. Not at all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You can't get rid of her 'cause it's - 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. And I don't like that. Sombody'll do something to me and I just, I have no idea.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: I wish that other people that don't get involved, everybody likes them. They really - they don't -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that's best of both worlds.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. I'm one of the few that do see it but they just kind of do their own thing, don't change my plans for everyone who asks, do what's best for my family for a change.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And it's hard, it's really hard live your own life when you need everybody to think you're a good girl.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay. As far as living your own life I guess you could say it's the real terror of what people think of you. And these things really stick in your thoughts.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. If there were any good way to change. Although I don't know, I just assume I could feel these things. I just would like to get out the change into other people and I do this constantly. But I'd much rather be doing something else. I need to.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sounds sort of like you're living for everybody but you.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. It doesn't make me any happier. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't make anybody like you any more.

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm. It always seems like the more you do for people the more they ask you to do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The more you give people the more they kick you around and take it for granted.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know that they even really know that they're doing it. I mean every time Elizabeth thought that she was offending me, that she was the one who wanted to go.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: Even if they don't know it it's still difficult for everybody. Taking the children, she's babysitting for everybody around. And she has no children. I mean she can leave though after -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She's kind of fortunate.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah! 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's easier to be unselfish.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I wouldn't mind babysitting for some kids every once in awhile. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean when you're the stranger and it's someone else's kids.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure it's for some babysitting.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Every once in awhile would be nice. Things will be better when they get into school, I think. I hope. I'll be finally wondering what to do with my life then. Now that they're out. I got a letter from my parents today. We haven't seen them for a year. And they just - they know how I feel. And that really hurts me. And my house, they can't believe it's so nice. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why does that hurt you?

</p><p>PATIENT: They're just so cold at me. And I can't stand it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They care more about the house than they do about your daughter?

</p><p>PATIENT: We're losing money on the house, I think. They haven't even seen the girls for a year. I don't know how else to respect my father being a different time when I was growing up they were around. My father's so angry... It is a sad world.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They're your parents. It's your parents that you're stuck with people around you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And that he has no idea that they would yell at me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's a really...nobody ever thinks. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...and that no one really thinks about you really. No one in your world knows how you feel.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I don't think my parents know me. Sometimes I think that I don't think that anyone really knows me. I'm complicated...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're pretty much alone and at a turning point. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess so. And I still have a strong attachment to my younger brother. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: When he came through last time I found that there just wasn't anything to talk about. He had been away too long. And my older brother doesn't care about anything. He just...we've gone there and I still get nervous and talk too much. He couldn't believe it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Couldn't believe that your being there would make sense.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. When we were younger we would joke that...you know I'd fight with my younger brother and he's fine. So they would never go back. And they don't - when my sister in law came to New York and we went to see her. And it was just, it was like meeting a perfect stranger. She talked about Sammy and she...to New York, what we were doing. We asked her a few questions which she wouldn't - she didn't talk about anything that really mattered. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And before all I wanted was to meet them. Nobody really cares anything about what I felt...Nobody cares. So why should I feel affected by that?..wakes me up. Nobody else cares. It's a long family problem. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So how do you sucker yourself into caring? Or get suckered into caring. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I don't really want to care. I just wish someone else would so I...

</p><p>COUNSELOR:...because like, at least it mattered.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm the only one that sheds tears while everybody else just trods on in their - doing their own little business and it just doesn't affect anybody. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I told one...I'm really you know, afraid 'cause the....is going to come. And she doesn't really care but, you know, but then maybe...she's just very curious what happens, what goes on. I'm totally....

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're tired of what?....

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah that's what she doesn't care to go out....

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sure it is with her. 

</p><p>PATIENT: She's so curious. She - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Avoid her.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. And it does. You know what it does? He's not really needy because, you know, I function fairly normally and they go, "Oh, mom!" You know, like we're going to...over the...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Appearances can be tough to get away from.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah but I mean nobody...I mean she's never been real quick. I'm sure she's dying to tell somebody. She's...I don't know really about her either. Although, but she's been great for my dad. You know, I will say that it was kind of mean though, to go through her good day and actual...and not be any worse for it. I wish I could not care about whether my folks care about me or not. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You wish you could just be impervious.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Could just jump on a little cloud and float by everyone in life. But I don't...You know sometimes I guess it just doesn't seem like they've ever gone anyplace. ..And you let that time pass. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm.

</p><p>PATIENT:...I just think I could, you know, I don't want to be that way...stay in one place for 30 years.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I don't think Mike would wants those things either...You know, to make some show at least.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT:...she thinks that with me and the kids that she knows best...And don't want to bother with trying to...But it's not like I demand it. And I feel like he owns me and...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's the same thing...and not having anybody.

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe that's - no...I work hard, I put everybody else first...The only way...in school...his voice during class...They always ask how he's doing in school. I know the rest of the family does. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like she...and evokes emotions of 

</p><p>PATIENT:...because we're the only ones that live out of the state...within this 45-mile radius where he lived for all of his life, it's good enough for him, it's good enough for us. And you know like when...used to go to my house when we lived much closer. You know it was an easy trip for the children. But now from New York to Wisconsin it's a long way to go in a car with 2 kids.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And it's not fair. It's so exclusive...and they have more money than we do and I think that they should come. I know I'd like to go there...You know it's kind of like, it's cutting off your nose to fight what they fight. I don't want to go there until they come here. It would be much harder for us to go there from, than it is for them to come here.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it would be better for you to go there, that you're furious with them.

</p><p>PATIENT: I would just like them to prove that they love me and wanted to come and see me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know if they aren't going to do that then...He really wants the girls to come to the house but all my other...so why don't you come and show them. For, you know, for a week and let me take care of them. My mother has never offered, even when we were home, to watch the children for...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She doesn't care that much for your children.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I heard you saying that as you look around and compare how other grandmothers react to their children -

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's like she's a cold person. She gets along with...fine. But she you know she...but she's never said anything sweet to my girls or to me or to my brother...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like she does a heck of a lot more caring...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes she does....care too much for anyone but herself. She was always handling them when we were little. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And not you.

</p><p>PATIENT: And not me. And she still does that I think. Instead of paying any attention to the kids...just doesn't even count. He left us alone when we were little. And my mother would ask him to take with him when he was going someplace and he would always say no. And I didn't even think about it, really. I don't think about him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR:...

</p><p>PATIENT: He was much nicer to everybody...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT:...the whole day, practically. He never said anything to us, at all. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: When we had started out he sure wouldn't tell a daughter that she did well. Otherwise he might look conceited...

</p><p>COUNSELOR:...you know that everybody on god's green earth always gets...a cold fish sometimes.

</p><p>PATIENT: There's no need to say it like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR:...where he is now...they don't mean anything to him anyways.

</p><p>PATIENT: No...My father wants me to make such a good hit with the girls...But when my father plays with my girls, it's for everyone else to see. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's putting on a show.

</p><p>PATIENT: You bet he is. And it's the same show that's been going on ever since I can remember.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know...he did to the boys once they got of age. So they play baseball and basketball and stuff. He was very mindful of their time...I mean I think he really created anxiety for them.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He forced them into his mold. 

</p><p>PATIENT:...I mean if they did something good, that was ignored. But boy if they made a mistake playing ball he let them know about it...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He'd sort of be like a - it almost sounds like a football coach when the team loses the game he's showing them the movies and pointing out all the dumb things that they did and humiliating them. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, every time. But I just think that he must have had a bigger influence on them than he did on - I was never really around him that much that, that it really mattered. I mean - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were more submissive.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well you know you can sort of understand why he's like that, I guess. If you don't - if you don't really love him you could look at him kind of coldly and say, "Well that's why he is, I mean look at his folks."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I mean that's my mother. And to have her act like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You can't dismiss her that - 

</p><p>PATIENT: No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Her coldness is really offensive.

</p><p>PATIENT: And she acts colder to me. So why should I expect her to be warm now?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You can want her to be.

</p><p>PATIENT: I do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Want her to care. She doesn't.

</p><p>PATIENT: No....buried in - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's nothing you can do. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Or the girls. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Safety in odds. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm hmm. Just that nobody in our family ever has anything against their mothers. They really ride that. I mean you just can't get along with them. Because if you reach one thing and that's right then you can never persuade him to change his mind about anything. And that's all we do when we go there is argue with him. I think my mom's gotten more and more like that. We used to be able to talk. And now we just see her. About anything that - well about how it takes...you can't talk to her. She's getting to be like my fa - she's listening too long, I guess. But you know like everybody says, "Oh, Dad." But they don't to my mother. Or like the boys look up to her too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. I don't know what that means to you though.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know what that means to me either...talking about her. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like some kind of contest. You say - contest between your mother and your father of what your mother - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I mean she's no better than he is. But everybody talks about Dad.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean everybody like within our family.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And they just all think that - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: But he's so bad - well not, so bad but like...And it's always been that way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's always going to be the same way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. But it's sort of off limits to talk about.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I never heard anybody.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean they're always ready - my younger brother Chuck's always ready to talk about Dad or my older brother. Although I never heard my older brother talk about Chuck. And he will talk about Dad. But his wife will talk about - you know Jim and I are here in the middle and the families don't get along. And we always thought we were a close family until you couldn't get away from it and you see that... with us.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I don't really know what to do about it...they gave us plenty of affection, I know my mother did. But this is a different kind. It's not anything bad or...You know like people will weep, that haven't seen each other for 5 years, and kiss and hug. Not us. We're so - I mean we started it when I got married and went away. But it's so awkward. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just terrible. Everybody turning their cheeks and hitting everybody 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Turning away. It's like nobody wants physically anything to do with anybody. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's been so long that nobody knows how.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's not a natural act with our family.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. The natural thing is to turn away when you greet each other.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's just so hard if you haven't seen them for 5 years.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Act as though...yesterday.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: We should be stopping here...

</p><p>PATIENT: It's much bigger than...Maybe cut down on the...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because they just used it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah...that's what I thought too.

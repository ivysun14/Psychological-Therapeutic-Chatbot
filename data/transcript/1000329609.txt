<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) I was thinking about MSCZ and the fact that (clears throat), despite everything I know or that I've been learning about myself and that I've been talking about concerning the 2 of us, it still doesn't seem to make any difference because this week we've been back in the same pattern again that we always seem to get into during the week.  And I think he's decided that he's just not even going to be nice about it.  And usually he sort of accepts that when I kind of keep a distance from him and, I don't know, I mean we don't really see too much of each other during the week anyway.  But he seems to generally realize that that's the way it is and so he doesn't get angry himself.  But this week he's been acting very annoyed.  And this is the time when usually I get upset enough so I try to do something about it myself.  And, and even though I'm upset about it at the same time I feel sort of relieved, too, that means he won't keep asking something from me that I'm not going to be able to give him and, or, or that it, there won't that, I don't know, conflict within myself on not wanting to do anything and yet, on the other hand, feeling that I should, therefore maybe I should just make myself.  And, and then it bothers me that I feel that feeling of relief, too, when things are so quite unpleasant.  It's not anything's being said, but just, it's just very unpleasant. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's just been sort of a general feeling of, I don't, disquiet or I don't know exactly what it is.  And I don't really know if it has anything to do with the dreams I was talking about.  But the whole week I've just felt sort of discontent about something.  And, I don't know, each day at school it gets a little bit worse.  And today, especially, I felt like, as I do withdrawing from other people, I felt like withdrawing from the children too to the point that I could hardly stand teaching them.  And it wasn't that they were misbehaving or anything.  And it's just I didn't want to have to cope with them.  And I felt maybe more so yesterday, but I felt both today and yesterday that I could barely make myself go through the conferences that I had to, that I just felt so tired and I felt as if my mind wouldn't work.  And I hadn't felt that way before.  And I prepared for them so it wasn't that I didn't have any idea of what I wanted to say.  But I don't think I've been doing anything more than other weeks and I have just felt much more tired this week.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And when you wonder what to attribute this, eh, feeling, especially this week, to, what comes to your mind, what do you think of?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I hadn't really thought of anything specific but just that there must be something that I don't want to face or that I don't want to handle and that I'm sort of escaping from it.  (Pause) Because I do realize that, although sometimes I am legitimately more tired than at other times, if I'm feeling I'm coping with too much or if things are becoming, things, things that I find hard to do, therefore don't want to do are happening or, or about to happen, I always feel more tired.  And it's sometimes a good excuse either not to do things or else just not to think about things because I'm so tired I can't.  (Clears throat) And I'm sure that for this week it's that rather than that I'm just legitimately tired.</p>

<p>And I don't know how much this dance that my sister is giving has been on my mind.  It hasn't been consciously on my mind except for my thoughts about when we're going up and what I'll wear and things like that.  But I haven't really thought about it consciously at, any more.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When is that coming up?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Next weekend.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But in a way I don't want to go.  And in a way I do want to go because I don't want to miss something that might turn out to be very nice.  But I don't anticipate it to and I'm sort of making myself go through with it.  Because I often do when I (clears throat) don't want to something because I think that it's really that I'm afraid to do it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, when you mentioned it before, I recall you said you were horrified at the thought that, eh, you might have to dance with someone other than MSCZ.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I've s—, that thought hasn't been as strongly on my mind lately or at least not consciously.  But I'm sure by the time we go up it would be because I've always hated dancing with other people that I don't know.  But I keep thinking to myself if I don't do it then I'll never feel more comfortable about it so that I should do it as much as I can.  And then it seems sort of ridiculous to me to be going to something like this that should be either you go because you want a nice time or else you just don't go and here I'm making it a test of character for myself or some kind of a strength builder or something like that.  And it just, that seems ridiculous to me.  Me too much but I think it probably does, is the fact that I haven't yet  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I imagine, too, something that I haven't really let upset yet found what I want to wear.  And I don't really know exactly what would be appropriate for something like this so that it's been harder for me to find what I want to wear.  And I don't have the daring to see something I like and just say well, I'm wearing that regardless of whether or not it's appropriate.  And in fact, as times come closer when we're going out to something that I'm feeling nervous about, what I'm wearing becomes extremely important to me or the fact that I don't feel confident about what I'm wearing.</p>

<p>ANALYST: As though what you're worried about is that you might literally feel ridiculed.  I say that because you describe the circumstance of going to a party that you feel the way you do about, as ridiculous.  So quite literally that's your concern, that one way or another you will feel ridiculed or be ridiculed in your view if you're not appropriately dressed or if you feel you don't dance well, something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I suppose it's, I think of it in terms of just looking very clumsy and, and dancing clumsily and therefore in a, I suppose in a way, it would be being ridiculed.  And in a way it's just not being feminine that I, I used to always tell myself well, I didn't care about clothes and being stylish and everything but I do.  And therefore I now feel sort of caught in the middle of not knowing very much about it and not feeling confident in what I do know and yet still wanting to be good at choosing clothes and dressing well and then it, also just fitting in without being like everybody else but s—, I mean, I, I do have this feeling that I want to be some kind of an individual and not just dress like everybody else because that's the fashion.  And yet I don't want to stand out from everybody else.  And I think in this whole thing in, in a way it's because I don't feel confident about being feminine and all these things that seem to me are part of being feminine because they're all things that I rejected learning about earlier.</p>

<p>Well, I decided I didn't, I couldn't dance anyway and there was a period I went through when I wanted to learn to dance.  But I didn't know where to go to learn except to my father who can't dance and a friend of ours, the, FGR BBP.  And she could only do so much because she isn't a dance teacher and so I just decided, I guess, that I would never really know how to dance.  And yet if I've ever been in a situation that I felt completely relaxed about it, I've loved the feeling of it.  And it just, that bothers me too, the feeling on the one hand that I'd like to be able to dance and enjoy it and yet feeling that I may never be able to. (Pause)</p>

<p>And this is something that I think has bothered me more than I realize about joining conversations at times when there are a group of people, how it is, a feminine way to join a conversation that I'm not sure about.  And in the end I just get extremely aggressive, beyond anything that's feminine.  And I think I've come to realize that there is a certain type of function that a woman can have and still be something, be an individual and yet I don't know exactly what it is.  Because for so long I just hated the whole idea of being feminine.  I think for a long time I couldn't imagine well, I couldn't imagine being married and I, except that I wanted to be, in a way.  And I, I assumed I probably would be in a way.  But in another way I didn't.  And I used to think of all sorts of exotic careers for myself and the last thing I ever thought I'd want to do would be to have children and keep a house.  And even now I can't imagine stopping working forever and, and just staying home, taking care of a family.  And it's only recently, too, that I've had any interest in homemaking kind of things.  And I think I feel very mixed about having children too.  I can't ever quite figure out how I feel about it.  But sometimes I want very much to and I guess I feel extremely envious of friends of mine who have their own children.  And then other times I think well, I could right now decide that I'll try to be pregnant and then I just can't do it. (Pause)</p>

<p>I suppose it's just like, sometimes I have sort of a feeling about how I should be if I'm being feminine, again, and being a good wife and I just can't do it and that, in a way, I want MSCZ to be the compliant one and I'll be giving the orders.  And I've always told myself that I wanted it sort of an equal give and take but it's really that I kind of reverse the normal idea of what the masculine and feminine role is in marriage.  (Pause) And I, and going back to having children, the thing I don't know is whether or not I'm afraid of the actual birth of the child or if it's my relationship with the child and what this means my life will become, how it will change it.  And I'll be sort of going into the unknown again.  It would almost be like quitting my job and then saying well, I'll wait until fall and look for a job.  And just what would I be doing with my time then?  I can't tell if that's what bothers me about it.  Because I think, I can't imagine myself having a baby but the times when I want one, the thing that makes me want one is the — well, maybe it's because I want something dependent on me.  Because I think I'd find the actual relating with the baby a very pleasant thing and that that part wouldn't bother me. (Pause)</p>

<p>Although I think I do have a certain feeling about wondering if I won't have to get away from children for a while if I had some of my own and if I don't, or if I didn't, I'd be just like my mother had as I remember her as having been, when she used to be so, sort of tired of us and tired of all the different things she had to do and frustrated and just kind of annoyed.  And I don't want to feel that way and I certainly wouldn't want to become like that. (Silence)</p>

<p>I almost think, though, that if I were just afraid of the actual birth I wouldn't not have children but it's the whole feeling about well, what will I do with myself if I do have children and I'm not working that makes me feel that I can't even consider it.  Because when I try to picture the situation the thing that I find most upsetting is trying to picture what I'd do with myself.  And I'm just afraid I'll end up sort of becoming nothing and not, I won't have any interests, I won't get involved in anything and I'll be kind of vegetating at home and making much more of a job of just keeping house and taking care of children than really would be necessary and, of course, hating it.  Because if that's all I was doing then I know I would hate it.  And the only other solution I can think of from working, having some kind of a part time job would be getting into committees.  And, and this is what my mother did as a solution and I have found that very distasteful so that I just don't have any feeling that there'd be anything else I could turn to.  And I know I don't have any confidence in having any interests that would develop and lead me into something else. (Pause)</p>

<p>I always used to be so bothered by questionnaires that we had to fill out and they'd ask either, what hobbies do you have or what other interests do you have.  And my interests always fell within ones that they assumed everybody had and would be covered.  And it al—, it always bothered me that I didn't have a hobby because it made me feel very unnatural and very unlike other people.  And I wondered, well, what was the matter with me that I couldn't have a hobby as other people did, naturally without forcing it.  (Clears throat) But of course what I would do, that I really did like doing was just reading a lot and, and probably just escaping from facing my own life by always be reading.  (Pause) And I think I'm sort of afraid of that aspect too, if I stop work, that I'd end up just sort of sitting around the house, either plodding away at the few jobs that there'd be or else that I'd just do an awful lot of reading and that it wouldn't be reading for a purpose, really.  It would just be kind of escaping again.  And then I'd get more and more so I wouldn't want to be around people and I'd withdraw more and more.  Because that has happened to me and as long as I'm working I'm having to get out with other people and just the fact that s—, I'm expected somewhere does get me out and then I enjoy the fact that I've been in association with other people for part of the day.</p>

<p>Or at least, somehow, even if it's been frustrating, it's, I've felt better about myself than I do when I've, when I just stay by myself and feel I can't go out and see people.  Because then I find it even hard to go into a store and communicate with the person I'm buying something from. (Pause)</p>

<p>And of course the other thing about having children is that in a way, having them says to me that then I can't work part time.  And if I do think about the fact well, I would anyway, I have this other feeling about where would I get another job and, and how can I leave LKC.  And I don't have that kind of a feeling of freedom that I can stop for a while and then start someplace else and it wouldn't be any great trauma to go through.  (Pause) And I imagine that another part of it, too, is that I can't imagine that being the way I am — and I suppose it's the same thing I talked about yesterday — that even though I'm 28 I don't feel it at all.  And I just can't imagine the, myself being a parent when I have enough trouble just handling myself.  I can't imagine that I'd be responsible for somebody else too.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You notice that today your thoughts started off with what you feel has been a difficult week, eh, between you and MSCZ especially, of tension and unpleasant atmosphere without anything being said.  And then your thoughts turn to a number of things.  And you have now been thinking a good deal about having a baby and children and staying home and should you stop your job and things like that.  It makes me wonder if you have the idea that this is what MSCZ would like or if he's said so even, or so—, if this is your idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, I think the feeling of any pressure that way is more from me —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Aha.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Than from him but the thing I, that I am feeling that he would like is for me to just show a certain concern and love for him that I am very sporadic at doing if I do it at all and that that has to come first before we can even consider having children.  And he feels extremely strongly that way and I agree with him when I'm, when I will admit that I do have to face the way I do relate with him.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah!  So then it would follow that these concerns on your part are not what you consider to be the primary issue.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  As far as between me and MSCZ, no.  But I just don't know what I really do think about it because I don't let myself think about it very much.  Because I don't, I don't know whether being much softer and, and more a loving in my attitude toward MSCZ and my relationship with him would mean to me that then we will have children and I just can't handle that whole thing or whether I feel that the same kind of problem that I'm having with MSCZ will come out in a different way with children.  And therefore that's on my mind.  I just don't know exactly how I connect the whole thing.  But superficially, I, I think sometimes I would like to have children just as sort of a diversion, that maybe then that would help things between us, though r—, I think when I'm honest I know it wouldn't.  But it would be sort of then that I wouldn't have to face so much how I am with MSCZ because then I'd have something different to give my attention to and he'd have to understand that I'd have to give my attention to a child.  So it would be again a sort of an escape.</p>

<p>And, anyway, I think the only time I've been able to really show affection and, and give it out and, and really care is for things that are dependent on me. And up until this point it's just been animals.  And perhaps at times I've tried to force MSCZ into being that way, although I do—, I doubt I would have liked it if he had been.  But this is sort of what I've been probably trying to make him be.  And maybe it's my concept of what a woman, if, if she's being feminine, is with a man and why I don't want to be that way.  Because I don't want to be completely dependent on somebody.  But conversely, I think I'm more dependent on MSCZ as things are now than I would be if I could be more feminine.  It's just — so then I get too confused and I say well, I'm not going to think about it now.  And then I just don't. (Pause)</p>

<p>It's funny.  I was just thinking about the fact that (clears throat) because of this, I, I know right now I still can't even consider whether or not MSCZ and I are right for each other and whether or not we really should just get a divorce.  And I suppose in a way I have to be able to face that on and decide one way or the other before things can change between us.  Or maybe I think this because MSCZ feels that way.  But then it made me think of the fact that I can't even think of being divorced from him partly because then I'll be in a new situation again and I, I just don't have any confidence about what I'd do with myself having to start out again and living alone, finding a new place and really taking care of myself.  Although I could very well have taken care of myself.  I mean, I've been working previously.</p>

<p>And it made me think of a boy at school who was, uhm, the type that has to be able to visualize every single situation before he can get into it.  And sort of his lack of confidence that he can't.  And that made me think of a report I once read of myself when I was in kindergarten and when I read it, it was years and years later but I was very upset when I read it because the report didn't say I didn't have imagination or I wasn't creative but it indicated that I didn't.  (Clears throat) And it indicated that I wasn't too creative.  And this really bothered me because I suppose that I've always felt I'm not.  And yet this is what I want to be most of all.  And I think in some way I tie that up with just having confidence in myself, that I could think of new ways to do things or develop my interests or whatever it is and that if I don't have it, then it means that I am nothing..  And I'm sure that however much this influenced the attitude my parents had toward me — it may not have but that basically this has been part of their attitude toward me, that where I can best excel is just by working hard and getting good grades and that I'll never really do anything too startling or very different or that's individual but that now if I can have a job where I'm considered a good teacher and just sort of plod alone again — that's all I can really think of that would be their attitude: kind of plodding along.  (Clears throat, pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose the reason it bothers me, too, is that just from the children I've worked with, I've fixated on the whole thing of having confidence, partly because of myself but it does seem to me that if they do have confidence in what they can do, that every child has some aspect of being creative.  And so for a person to think that they aren't — I don't know, in a way I can't really believe that people aren't.  (Pause) And I suppose, in a way, this is another aspect of how I look at having children, that I can't really believe that I could create a child.  (Pause) Because I think, in a way, I've sort of overreacted to FYC's 2 children in that, in that she was the one who gave birth to these 2 children and it, and it isn't the wonder and the, just birth process and the development of a child in itself but it's that she was the one who had children and that they're hers and that she's responsible.  And so that somehow makes me feel that I must think I can't. (Silence)</p>

<p>And lately, that, that I've been teaching reading I've wondered (clears throat) how much of this comes out of the way I learned to read.  And I don't, I don't know, I suppose there's so many things that contribute to it.  But I have a memory of having some difficulties in learning to read.  Just, I used to think it was because I needed glasses and I didn't have them.  But by second grade I can remember that I wasn't in a particularly good reading group.  I wasn't in the worst one, either, but sort of in the middle.  And very quickly it became very clear I was a very slow reader.  And I just accepted that, that I was and that I couldn't take things in very quickly and of course I used to do terribly on those, those tests in high school.  But (clears throat) then in college, I had some courses where you just had so much reading you had to do it fast.  And I would skim it and then realize that I had picked up essentially the same thing as I would have gotten anyway, if I hadn't had the pressure.  And I'm quite sure now when I read it's if I'm reading slowly, (clears throat) which is generally true if I'm reading for any purpose other than just my own pleasure, then I'm going over it and over it.  I'll read it several times over just because I don't believe I've really picked up whatever it was I was reading.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time is up.</p>

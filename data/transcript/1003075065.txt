<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  No problem.  Well how have you been doing lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm shaking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me what has been happening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Let's see.  I've been hearing voices sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And I've been seeing people that are not there.  They're there, and they disappear.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has that been more so since, um, the Seroquel adjustment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Could be.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Because I know we did a couple things recently.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You had been on the Prozac and the Seroquel for quite some time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then we started thinking maybe the Prozac had some side effect or hasn't been as effective, and we switched over to the Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, um, for a while there we had talked about possibly taking more.  But I think you had been on the 10 mg for a while.  True?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I've been shaky, but I'm always shaky.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, [NAME OTHER], this is [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, I know [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's in for an interview.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's very nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thank you for coming.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you for seeing me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, well I'm glad you made it in, because with what's happening, you know, this is important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And this has nothing to do with you, but I'll tell you anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And inside my vagina, it hurts, and, uh, my urine doesn't burn.  But I have to tell [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] that in, I think I see her in September.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think you should see her before then, because you may have something like a yeast infection or something like that.  Or sometimes even with a urinary tract infection there isn't always pain, um, but if you're feeling the presence of something that's not —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well the ye —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ordinary.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I urinate, it doesn't burn.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I have an [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And when I lay down —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you're seeing a urologist on the [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's important.  Make sure you get to that appointment, and be sure you say exactly what's going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's in September, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.  That's on the [DATE] of this month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So in other words, 4 days from now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  This being [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So is that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in 4 days?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  That's what [INAUDIBLE] told me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because they thought I was taking you to your urologist or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that's excellent that you got reminded though, because that's going to be important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, when I lay down my, uh, vagina doesn't hurt me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the fact that it hurts at all means that it needs attention.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Sometimes it hurts, but not all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has the shaking or the voices gotten any worse since you've noticed that there's a, a physical problem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Would you say, compared to a month or so ago —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The voices or the shaking are worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  Now I'm so sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Has it been pretty similar since the last time we met?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  In the past, has any of the medicine that you've ever taken, does any of it stand out as being more helpful than what we're doing now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.  When you have the sensation of, um, you know, hearing the voices —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so forth, is it connected with anything that's happened in the past?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It just calls out my name, and I go, "What?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just calls out, "[PATIENT NAME]."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I go, "What?"  [LAUGHING].  And they don't answer back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you remember the first time you ever heard that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it had to be months ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I would think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  How are you sleeping at night these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I toss and turn, and then when I finally fall asleep, I sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Through a lot of tossing and turning, though.  In other words, I sleep on my back, then I'll sleep on my side, then my back, then my side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you in physical discomfort?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But very restless, it sounds like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I also have a crush on this black guy, he's very light skinned, named [NAME OTHER].  He's, I call him Gorgeous.  "Hi, Gorgeous.  How are you?"  "Just fine.  What's up, [PATIENT NAME]?"  We both like the Phillies, and we listen to the game, and we watch the game, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Are you 2 good friends?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He says we're pals and friends forever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Isn't that nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've got all the advantages of dating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really wish I could date him, but, you know, he's not interested in me.  I'm [AGE].  I think he's a lit, he looks younger, but I think he's around, um, [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  But it sounds like nice companionship, a good friend.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Someone that's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Someone I can talk to.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And whenever there's a relationship, the person who is not as inclined toward the romantic relationship, you kind of have to go with that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah because [NAME OTHER], my daughter says, "You still like him?"  I said, "Yeah."  Uh, "You still have a crush on him?"  I said, "Yeah.  I can't help it."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's okay with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's not giving you a hard time or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.  Not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sounds like a terrific companion.  You have some similar interests, and he's nice to be with.  He treats you well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He has a lot of respect for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's, that's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought I'd bring him up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Absolutely.  I think having a nice friendship is great.  It's okay to have a crush.  You recognize it for what it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I call him Gorgeous, and he is, he's really gorgeous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well and it's nice that, that you like him for who he is, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He's a nice, nice guy and he respects me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now, [NAME OTHER], he's on the staff.  He's black also.  But he, he didn't treat me so good.  But [NAME OTHER], she's staff, and she had a talk with him, and he treats me better now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He used to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I remember there were some difficulties.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Did I tell you that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He used to put me down, cuss at me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Definitely not okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not okay, so I think she had a talk with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He seems to be nicer.  But she don't have the time to talk with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the guy I have a crush on, because he respects me.  He's nice to me, and that's what counts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what counts.  [PATIENT NAME], let me go way back in time.  I'm going to go all the way back to 1997 when you were working with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Review some medications, and if anything jumps out as, "Yeah.  You know, that medicine, really worked well for me," we can revisit that.  You know, I want to be able to address that things that, that are giving you difficulty now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now back when you worked with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In the spring of '97 —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were taking Wellbutrin —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Trazodone and lorazepam.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Wellbutrin was helpful?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is certainly something that we could look at again, also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And then you were on the Wellbutrin for quite some time, and then in August of '98, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] switched you over to Paxil.  And it looks like he gradually switched you from the Wellbutrin to the Paxil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Paxil was good also.  I remember Paxil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Um—hum.  And that can be a good medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You mean Paxil?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then when you walking, working with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], you were on Paxil together with Risperdal and Depakote.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was decent, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  And then, um, for some time you were on that combination, and then [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] discontinued the Risperdal, and changed you over from Paxil to Celexa, and you were still on the Depakote.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Celexa and the Depakote continued for quite a while, um, and then, I think we're going to catch up to where you and I started working together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Depakote and Prozac came into the picture with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Prozac is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  And when I started with you, we decided to stay with the Prozac, because you have mentioned that sometimes it was hard to remember to take the medication.  The advantage with Prozac is that it does tend to stay in your system for a while.  So if you miss a day or you're late taking it, it doesn't completely go out of your system.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That can be an advantage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] had stopped the Depakote, because you ran into some liver problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think I have an enlarged liver?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And actually, you never really had the kind of mood swings like we often use Depakote for.  Um, I think [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], for a time, used it as kind of a way to try to help antidepressants work better.  Um, but once she took you off, as I recall there wasn't a big difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, except that, you know, it w, it was healthier for your liver.  So then you and I worked together with the Prozac and Seroquel for a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and then just recently decided to try the Lexapro instead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the sense I'm getting is, the Prozac was better.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Prozac is very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now the big question for us is, when the voices happen —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it because the depression is a little worse?  That can sometimes go with it, when someone has a severe mood disorder —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm having depressed times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have battled depression for a long time —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm still battling it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That can come on.  Now, Prozac and Wellbutrin can be a nice combination together.  So can using Zoloft and Wellbutrin.  Do you ever remember trying Zoloft at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Except I, it sounds familiar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  It probably wasn't here, because I don't have a record of it, um, but I actually think that based on your latest blood work, you could probably handled Prozac and Wellbutrin together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That sounds great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that's probably, for now —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A place to stay.  You still have that small amount of Seroquel at bedtime, if you need it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You used to take 50, but last visit you went down to 25.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel like you need the 50 back?  Twenty five is enough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's up to you, though.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm trying to protect your blood sugar and your metabolism.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if the problems with sleep and what you've been hearing do have to do with the worsening depression —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's a chance that Wellbutrin and Prozac together could address it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  Sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wellbutrin and, uh, the Prozac.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] Lexapro?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I'm going to discontinue the Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Seroquel is at 25?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  At bedtime, I'll go ahead and renew that exactly as it was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you're going to write me up prescriptions, is that it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  I certainly will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I will indeed.  So, and then, um, I'm glad that you have that appointment soon.  Be sure to let them know, because you could have what's called a silent infection where, you know, you feel there's something going on, and it doesn't have —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  But I thought that was in September.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  I'm glad we had that talk, because you need to be seen for that, ASAP.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We've got that, so you're definitely going to get there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] taking you to your urology appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But, uh, they're responsible for taking you here to [NAME OTHER] —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And then [INAUDIBLE] appointment there.  Remember the guy was telling you, you didn't have an appointment there, and I showed up and I said yes you do have an appointment today.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, [PATIENT NAME], last time I called in, um, to [DEIDENTIFIED].  Would you like me to call it in again, or would you like me to write you a prescription?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You could call it in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't I do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> While I'm here, please.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She can have Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  And, um —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Along with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Back when you took Wellbutrin, it only was very short acting, and you had to take it a couple times a day.  This time, now they have a once daily available.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And all of the forms are generic.  So what I'm going to do is start you back with Prozac.  I'm going to go back to 20 of Prozac.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  Um, the Wellbutrin XL, which lasts all day —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The smallest dose they make is 150, and that should be about right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  That sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we'll do that in the morning, and I'm thinking if you take it in the morning, it should be out of your system by bedtime and not interfere with your sleep, and you'll still have the Seroquel available, if you need it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And the Seroquel is just at bed?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's just as needed.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Seroquel is as needed?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then so I'll be taking Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Seroquel?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  The Seroquel is optional.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And the Prozac once daily?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Exactly.  Twenty mg once in the morning.  Um, and Seroquel also can have an antidepressant boosting affect, as well as, in some cases, treat voices also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, good.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, I'm glad it, I'm trying to, not to lean on that kind of medication too much, just because I don't want to throw of your metabolism, your blood sugar, you know, unless you absolutely have to have medicine in that category, we can kind of keep it as needed —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At this point.  So let me go ahead and call [DEIDENTIFIED] right now, so you know I got it called in properly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it's my pleasure.  Um, the line is busy, but we'll try again in a moment.  It sounds like things are working out well with, with where you're living now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some of the bumps in the road have gotten ironed out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, you know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I used to like [DEIDENTIFIED].  Now I don't know, but I'm staying there.  If —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] wants me there.  I don't think I'm a mental case.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  I think it has more to do with coping skills with depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, you know, being able to get to the doctor when you need to.  Look at t his whole support system you have.  You know, she happened to check in, they said, you're taking her to her urology appointment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What urology appointment?  Then we talk, and we realize, it's not September, it's 4 days from now.  This is good.  When you were in the other situation, you know, everybody else was so busy doing their thing, you didn't have that kind of back up, so to speak.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So what's in September?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Maybe your primary care physician is in September?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would you like a calendar to keep track of your appointments?  You sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Positive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I think I have some extra ones, if you ever want to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I've got [NAME OTHER], I've got [NAME OTHER] and I've got [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How nice is that?  Yeah.  I came across some extra ones the other day.  Let me see [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I've got [NAME OTHER] and I've got [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's right.  And you can call me whenever you can't get hold of [NAME OTHER], okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I always say "Yes," to calendars, because I know somebody can use them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.  And I like to keep them in my bag.  They actually [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  All right.  This is a beautiful one.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Puerto Rico, 2009.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No problem.  Sort of a month at a glance, you know?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'll try [DEIDENTIFIED] again, and see if I can call that in.  [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is it ringing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's ringing, yes, it's ringing, so I think we'll get through.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we'll get somebody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  This is [PHYSICIAN NAME].  I need to call in a prescription for a patient, please.  Thank you.  Hi, it's [PHYSICIAN NAME].  I need to call in a prescription for [PATIENT NAME], please.  Do you need your date of birth?  It's [DATE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We have the same birthday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you kidding?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> My birthday is [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah, happy day of your birthday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?  [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you, [AGE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I'm going to renew Seroquel 25 mg tablets.  She takes one by mouth at bedtime as needed.  I'm discontinuing her Lexapro.  She'll be taking Prozac 20 mg capsules or tablets one by mouth daily.  She can have a month's supply and 3 refills.  Actually of everything.  And then, uh, lastly she'll be taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg.  She can have generic.  She should take one by mouth daily in the morning, and she can have 30 tablets and 3 refills.  And this is [PHYSICIAN NAME].  I'm probably in your system, [PHYSICIAN NAME].  Uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME].  And I'm at the [DEIDENTIFIED].  And the number here is [DEIDENTIFIED], if you ever need to, you know, follow up on anything or get access to her chart or anything.  All right?  Thank you so much.  Take care now.  Bye bye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, from where you're living, do you need this on a hard copy also?  So they can see, "See I'm taking a different" —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So let's do that.  Yeah.  I had a feeling —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's one thing just to call it in, but then, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They need to see the, "Show me the money."  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So who do I give that to?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can just give this to the staff.  And I'm actually going to put it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On it, already called in.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For a reference.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Already called —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I can't even believe it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a, quite a coincidence.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I've never met anyone with the same birthday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  Me, too.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That is something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to let that pick up, because I've got to get that in a minute.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If I've got to do too many things, I'll get distracted, and I want to keep you on track.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  So then the machine will pick it up?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's so nice to see you.  Thanks for seeing me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I'm glad you came in.  I mean, actually this was important, because your symptoms did change, or at least they're more prominent since you've been on the Lexapro —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's making me think it does make sense to go back to the Prozac, and then add something to help the Prozac work even better, like adding the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Because you remember from way back, even before you and I were working together, that that was helpful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And another new thing about the Wellbutrin, it tends not to predispose to weight gain.  In fact, people usually lose a few pounds, and it can help with attention and concentration —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I sometimes use it with attention deficit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you know, it just can be very, very useful.  It works in a, in a rather different way from the Prozac.  And that can be an advantage, because you've got 2 things working different ways helping each other.  And we can meet again in a couple months —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See how it's going.  Usually it's good to give a new combination a month or 2, you know, to see how it's, it's, um, kicking in.  Sometimes it can take 2, 3 months before we see all that it can do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I think you'll start to feel like you're getting back on track, you know, within a couple weeks, actually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that's great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  All right.  Well it's very good to see you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The same here, and take care.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I look forward to seeing you next time.  And good luck at that appointment, remember tell them all your symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I will.  Thank you, so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You bet.  Okay.  My pleasure.  Take care now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bye bye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Bye.  Oops.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

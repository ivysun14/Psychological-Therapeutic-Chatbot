<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client Grogan, interview 6, Client Grogan, interview 6. I fear I have to say something entertaining in the introduction now because I see here that the therapy itself isn't going to be very entertaining. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that coffee? I've never seen steam this way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No? It's probably never been hot before. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking about the way that I was feeling when I was coming here. And I remembered that I was in here trying to parallel situations that I've been in. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I felt the same way. And last night I realized one prominent situation. But I couldn't draw any kind of a correlation and I'm not sure it's that important to me right now. But I suppose I should just say it anyway. Maybe, I don't know. </p>

<p>When I was going out with a man that was married I got pregnant and I had to go to Michigan and give up the baby. And I was going to a Christian Family Service Center Adoption Agency. And when I had to go in and see these social workers every couple of weeks, it would be exactly the same feeling that I have when I was coming in here. Really under pressure and really tense. And I don't know why I correlate it with you but it's so, so I guess I'm good. And that's really all that I can say about that. 0:02:16.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It's something hard for me to get a feel for this similarity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard for me too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have that under pressure..</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like I kinda wanted to go but I felt more obligated to go than I kinda wanted to go. It was something, if I could have gotten out of at all, I would have. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that was just an extreme pressure situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're feeling this too about this visit. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if there's some way I could not come, if I could get out of coming..</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel better about it now. 0:03:00.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So that, so that's not so true for you right now at this point. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No it isn't. No. But it sure was. And I guess that's the closest thing that I can come to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now you don't feel under that much pressure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I felt good. However as I was walking up the stairs I was beginning to clutch, but I really do feel better. And I decided that I wanted to talk to you about my relationships with men.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way you say that makes it sounds like you don't know where that comes from. Or that amazes you or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, because it sounds mundane to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I guess that's something that is done. I think about it a lot. I'm involved in it all the time. And I wanted to talk about it. And I wasn't sure what I was going to say at all. Oh, let's see. I think that I feel that I have a wrong attitude. I guess that's it. Like I have a relationship now. This one's very nice. And there's a lot of affection and we both love each other. But I don't think that it's a permanent thing. But you see, I really want it to be. And I think that that's unhealthy. In my mind I think that's unhealthy for me to feel like that. 0:04:57.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something wrong with wanting this to be permanent. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Because?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's it nice now and I don't brood about it a lot but I do at times. And I wish that I didn't at all. You know like let whatever happens happen. But I can't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I know, I'm hearing a number of things currently. One is the last thing you to me was, "I wish I could just sorta take what I'm getting and let it go at that." You want to check out, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you can't. Like you want more, and I don't, other than the, well, so what's wrong with that? I mean given, why should you be able to just take what you have and not want more? I mean you're, maybe I'm not asking it in a helpful way but it sounds like you really, you care about what you've got with this guy and it feels like it's not always going to be there. What's so crazy about wanting it to always be there? What's wrong with that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, see I don't picture, I don't picture it like getting bad and wanting to leave him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't hear you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I said I don't, I don't picture it in my mind like getting stagnant, I guess that's the word, and still wanting it to be there. Although I mean it's possible that I would still. But I don't know what I think is wrong with it. But I do. I don't think that I should be so worried about it. That's what I think. 0:07:15.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. I see. That makes it, ok that is just a little different than you said. One of the things going for you is like you really get concerned about this relationship ending. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You see I'm going away in the summer. And he's going away in the summer. And it might end. And of course I don't know how I'm going to feel after the summer's over but I, I don't know, I guess I want the reassurance that it won't just end in June. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you'd like to know you could come back to it but you're at all sure that that's the case?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I realize that I might not even want to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know you may not want to but you'd like to know that if you do want to that it'll be there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It sounds unimportant now to me. Very unimportant. I was so neurotic in, I don't know about neurotic, I don't know what neurotic means. But I was so terribly insecure about my last relationship that I don't want to get like that again. But, so I guess I don't let myself worry too much about this. But it is in my mind.0:09:17.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sorta sounds like you're afraid that if you really start thinking about it then you're going to start clutching and just grabbing the way you did last time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's better to kinda push it out of your mind. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. Because I know that he doesn't worry about it. He, I'm sure he doesn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He doesn't care whether the relationship...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't know if he cares. He probably cares. But I mean, he doesn't worry about very many things. That's all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like he'd like it to continue sorta, but he doesn't get all twisted up inside thinking about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I think that his attitude is a little healthier. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like if you could be like him you'd be a heck of a lot better off. 0:10:26.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes, I think so. See I don't think I went out very much when I was younger. I don't know. I didn't start dating a lot till I turned 21. Maybe that has something to do with it. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's sorta hard, you're saying to me it's sorta hard to take men for granted when it was so long that you didn't have them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think so. I don't think people, I don't know. Maybe other people take men for granted. I don't know. Not too many people that I know do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I always wanted to be like somebody else. In reference to this, my boyfriend's roommate is going with a girl. They've been going out quite a while. Not as long as we have, but quite a while. And I know that she's happy to, she's happy that he's going away this summer. But I know that she cares for him, or a lot about him. And I wish that I were like that. 0:12:36.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. That you could both like care for him and also like that he isn't going to be around for a while. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I didn't want him to go with me on my trip either. [That would've effected it.] (ph) I don't know. But I didn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. You mean when you had the opportunity to, what, you didn't, on which trip?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to Europe this summer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, that..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That trip. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it's like you did have the opportunity to have him with you and you didn't want that when you had the opportunity. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. I mean it didn't even enter my mind. That's it. I just made my plans. And didn't even think about him going. Probably because I didn't think he'd want to go anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably because I feel that he would be glad to get away from me for a while. 0:13:54.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's sort of, he's sorta glad that you're going away. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He is? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought that was what you were saying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. He wants me to take a rest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Not necessarily from him. He wants it to be by myself I think. Like he wanted me to go to Texas in February. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. (inaudible at 0:14:44.9)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (inaudible at 0:14:47.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought, the reason I'm asked it, it looked like what kind of crazy thing is that? He wants me to go to Texas in February. 0:15:02.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was nice, it was, really it was nice. I was under a lot of strain. (chuckles) I was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And you see all this sounds silly to me as I'm saying it to you but I guess it's important to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What sounds silly? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That problem that I had. It's probably like it was, not silly to him, and still not worthwhile. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean not worthwhile? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:16:28.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. If you were a better person that kind of thing wouldn't bother you all that much. You might have a problem but..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That wouldn't get you down. That's sorta like being incapacitated by a hangnail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Like I'm very sure that I can, you know, go on living very healthily if I never see him again. But I'm not sure that I want to at the moment. That's the way I feel at the moment, and.. 0:17:12.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's the big issue? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just disgusted with myself because it's like I wanted to talk about it. I really did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now it sounds stupid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you're disgusted with yourself because you were really concerned about it but now that you start talking about it, like you can't, it doesn't seem like it should have concerned you or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Um hmm. I think so. 0:18:20.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Almost as if something about telling it to me trivializes it for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to check out, without the why, whether that's right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it kinda does. I came in here, well I thought of this last week. I mean it's been on my mind. And I thought I wanted to talk about that. And I didn't plan anything I was going to say. Maybe that's, maybe when I said what I did it sounded trivial and I didn't have anything else to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was horrible at my job today too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened? 0:19:55.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: I lost my temper. I threw a little girl out of her seat and I tipped her desk over. And I was ashamed of myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was going to say it sounds like you really don't like yourself very much. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I was pretty ashamed of myself. I don't remember any teachers doing that to me when I was in school. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not a very teacherly thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not very professional. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like she must have really made you furious. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was coming after a long time. And yeah she did. And so I just really lost my temper. I lost my temper once last fall and I punched a little boy several times. I was pretty ashamed of myself then too. 0:21:07.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's very hard to take about you when you do that kind of thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you shouldn't take out your frustrations on these little kids, that's all. Which I'm sure is what I was doing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It really wasn't her today that you were..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably not. She's obnoxious every day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can usually cope with her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But like you were really down today about something else. And she just happened to come along. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. See I live with my boyfriend Joshua in this apartment. And it's pretty big. And there's one other guy, Luke. And Luke's girlfriend has been staying more and more. Now she there almost all the time too. And then a third guy moved in.</p>

<p>And last night I was feeling like I lived in a commune and I felt like there was no place for me to go. And I couldn't go to my own apartment because my, I took a roommate and she had to work and [nobody I knew didn't know where to go.] (ph) So I think that's, yeah I know I was real upset about that. 0:22:21.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorta being crowded out of your life in some way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What am I going to do (inaudible at 0:22:35.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well it sounds like there's no, at least sounds like there was absolutely no place for you to be where you can have peace, any peace. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I felt unnecessary for sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unnecessary? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I did. I don't know. It sounds really silly. It's like the other girl, who I like, was now the lady of the house and I just over in a corner. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah sorta like she moved in and kinda usurped you or your position. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. Which probably isn't true but..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like she's sorta the queen bee. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's because her boyfriend owns all the furniture. That's probably why I feel like that. But it was ok with the four of us. And then when the fifth person moved in and all, that's (inaudible at 0:24:03.6) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The guy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I felt last week like, I felt a lot better after I left here last week about coming here. 0:25:23.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think I must have pictured myself relaxed and talking and then not doing it. Because I can't think of anything I want to say. And I don't feel, not, probably not, I don't feel disgusted I just feel sorta stupid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because there's stupid also like the picture of what it's like to be here doesn't correspond to what it's like to be here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah well I thought it was going to be stupid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel better. I thought it was going to be different. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you feel better. But it's still like you're not kinda unleashing or something, unfettered..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way you thought you'd be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's good. Yeah, arranged though my mind and I just come up with trivialities. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The trivia of your mind is like what holds you back. It's like who wants to spontaneously share that trivia? 0:27:14.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you had profound thoughts or feelings for something then you could spontaneously utter them. But there's something about the trivia. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and you know there's something else that bothers me. It's that, I mean this is really silly too. I don't know if I, I don't picture myself as one. I can't quite imagine myself as one. But somehow I feel that I should be more intellectual and, I don't know if profound is the right word. But I feel like I should be interested in something other than I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Like somehow your interests are mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. Um hmm. Yeah. Like I'm sure that there's more to, more, there's a lot more going on than what I'm into or what I do or what I even think about. I just don't think about those things at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You live in some narrow, narrow little world. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like, I don't know. Wars and poetry and painting and ideas that you don't know about you don't ever even dream about really. Except for real dimly that you're missing something. 0:29:11.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's right. Like late last fall, I think. I decided that the cure-all, my cure-all, was I was going to just start reading, I don't know what, I guess this philosophy book. I think that was it at the time. I mean it really had a soul to it. It even (inaudible at 0:29:42.8) at the time. And I didn't do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But somehow it seems like that would, that would make up for the lack in you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. In some ways, yeah. 0:30:01.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or do you really feel sorta empty even though you don't know what to fill it with. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess that's right. I don't know if empty is the right word. Really just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said I don't know if empty is the right word. But I guess...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Missing I guess. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, missing. But what bothers me is that I don't care. Really I don't think that I do care. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get as far as thinking well, I'll read philosophy, that's the cure-all and you dodged it. Books I don't read. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Many times I've gone to the bookstore and bought books that I thought I should read and I've never read them. Many times. 0:31:05.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just.. About four or five years ago I used to go to Party Pier (ph) And I really felt stupid because I didn't know anything that any of the people were talking about. But I didn't, maybe I did care. But I didn't think that I really, I mean I didn't care enough to want to do anything about it. Maybe I feel it's wrong to be just ordinary. I don't feel (inaudible at 0:33:04.1) helpful to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying right now, right now I feel sorta unpleasant and uncomfortable and if anything I feel worse than when I walked in. Or what? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. A little worse. Disappointed in me. I guess that I must do that a lot really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fantasize ahead of time how something's going to be and then, I don't think about, usually don't think about the fantasy while I'm actually involved in it but maybe halfway through or even afterwards, probably happens to me while I'm into it. 0:34:06.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you think about your fantasy right now for a minute? </p>

<p>CLIENT: For what? For here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Can you think of what it was going to be like? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't specific but I was going to, whine, talk about things that I consider trivial. I think that's it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand, I'm sorry. You were going to want to talk about things you consider trivial?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I wasn't considering them trivial before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, that's what I wasn't understanding. In fantasy they weren't trivial. It's when you walked in that they became trivial.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. I think I'm terribly afraid of you. 0:35:42.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I really do. I think I feel very vulnerable with you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Frightened of me because you're open in some way? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and you'll reject me. I know that, I mean I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Because that's the last step.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think in my fantasy I wasn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry I can't hear you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I said I think in my fantasy I wasn't. Maybe that, without consciously thinking..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like in your fantasy you're telling me something and I wasn't snorting with laughter or saying that's stupid. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. I wish I would have brought a Coke. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wish what? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish I would have brought a Coke. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Brought a Coke? The reality of it must be something that the fantasy, the reality must be like somehow I am doing that. 0:37:00.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: No you don't do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you don't catch me at it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't even if I saw you in my fantasy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think I did see you. I think I just saw me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but the thing that's throwing me is it sounds like, you know like your expectation or fantasy or whatever like you had a different set of feelings about me. It was like I was really not going to hurt you. Not going to something, I don't know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't. But I think that I constantly, I know that a lot of times after I say something I kinda curl up, yes, right. And if you're going to do that, then I'm going to crawl into the wall and never be seen. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really, the more I think about it I know it doesn't sound at all likely, but I really think I do equate with that social worker. I'm not sure why. Because I really thought, and I don't think that I think this about you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She really, I liked her or I kinda trusted her and then I didn't. 0:38:45.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was a horrible experience for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't see, well I don't remember what she did but I know my feelings really changed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't really (inaudible at 0:39:07.9) I mean I don't think (inaudible at 0:39:12.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hear you, I hear you today you know like, it's nothing you're doing. It's inside me. And I guess like that's ok or something. That's not what's relevant for me or what the concerns that you might, who's doing what but I don't know how that makes you feel or what kind of things it does for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't understand. Say it again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well ok, more concretely. I guess like one thing that it does for you is it makes you think of what it was like with that social worker. You know regardless of whether I'm like her or whether it's in your head or out there in Rockefeller Chapel. One thing it sounds like it does. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is like it awakens that stuff. 0:40:07.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn't realize that. I really think that's it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you were, it sounds like you really had initially a positive, positive reaction to it. Like spontaneously you found her, no?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I did. You don't have (inaudible at 0:40:42.0) I think that I did that, I had to pay them. And I didn't have any money. I just had gotten out of college and I was really broke. And this man didn't send me any money. Not a cent. And I had to tell her at some point, after I found out for sure, that I couldn't pay her then but I would pay her later. Which I did. </p>

<p>And maybe for a while before that I knew I was going to have to say that to her and I didn't have enough nerve. And when I finally did, she went into another room and she, I don't know exactly what she said but she said to somebody else in the room about my not paying. And then she came back and was very sweet and I think that really..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry I didn't hear you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which didn't you hear? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After you said she was very sweet. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She was. And then she went into this other room and said something derogatory about me to somebody else and then came back in. 0:41:54.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I guess I wanted to feel like (inaudible at 0:43:05.9) At least..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At least so long as you can pay your bill. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. No, at least I wouldn't hear you say it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Our walls are more soundproof. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what you think about me is (inaudible at 0:43:32.0) and wouldn't tell me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I was thinking about that in my mind if that was true. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah probably. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But not, yeah probably but not super transcendently important or yeah probably..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it probably is very important. I'm sure that it is. I don't want you to think that I'm stupid. 0:44:03.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. So also it was like I am thinking that or I might be thinking that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And keeping it to myself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Thinking?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thinking that you're stupid but keeping it to myself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something bad about you, I'm not sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably. What I feel about my boyfriend is that I'm not bitchy or naggy but I feel that, I don't know. I guess the question is do I feel under a certain amount of pressure and that after a while he's not going to be able to stand it any more and I don't want that to happen. And I'm not sure why I do this. 0:45:31.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry, you're not..</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure how I, what kind of demand that I make on him. I'm not sure what they are but I feel that they're probably very strong. And part of the reason that I feel like that is that like he tells me. He like sometimes is very careful about the way he says things because he doesn't want to hurt my feelings. Things like that. And that really bothers me that he's like that.0:46:09.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Bothers you that he feels like he has to handle you with kid gloves? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Because he's not going to want to keep that up for a long time I'm sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Who wants a fragile hothouse flower? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or for how long does one want one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I don't know what to do about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying you're not one and you don't want him to think that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm kinda one but I'm not one as much as he thinks. Really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think when I first came here he asked me if he should go in and see you so you could see what he was like. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you laughing about? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought it was funny.0:47:21.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just didn't think there was any reason for it. I mean I didn't think that you'd be interested. That's what I thought. I told him it wasn't marital conflict. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that really, that whole thing amuses you and I..</p>

<p>CLIENT: What? About him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It does. Maybe it's because, no, he's so good to me. See? Like I've never ever gotten, I can't get angry, really angry at him for very long. I was angry at him one day when I was here because I had to go walk in the rain. But that wasn't his fault. He hadn't done anything wrong. And he was home when I got there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's like, yeah he's like a child with a toy. Yeah he is. 0:48:24.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I really think that's how he is. Like this is something really different for him. He hasn't had a girlfriend for a real long time. He's just gone out with a lot of different people. And I, I think that he, he's really enjoying himself playing this role, I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I, yeah. There's like two things in that. And I'm hearing, one is like you're super special to him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm not clear about playing the role. Like that makes it sound like he's sorta less involved with you as a person than he is with sorta having a steady girlfriend. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's probably not true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And actually it wasn't even steady girlfriend at all. It's just the role of, I can't explain what he does. It amuses me what he does. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like on the days that I'm going to come here, he knows how I am when I come home usually, which is kinda upset. And he just goes out of his way and it amuses me. That's all. That's the kind of role that I'm talking about. 0:50:01.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's, the role is like super considerate or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. I have recess duty on Tuesdays. I hate it. And he knows I hate it. And today, probably because I was coming here, he came outside to keep me company during it. Which I would never do for him I'm sure. I mean. And I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sorta sounds like when he senses that you're feeling bad, like coming here, he kinda jumps through hoops for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he does that other times too when he thinks I'm feeling bad. 0:50:45.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't think it's natural. That's it. I don't think it's natural. Probably because I don't think I do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if you weren't feeling bad or if he weren't worried about you, then he wouldn't do it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's still always very considerate. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's super, crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Super. And you're saying, "I wouldn't be that super crazy considerate."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I feel like when he's that way it's like some, put-on isn't right. He's not acting but like trying. He's trying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like maybe he's having fantasy, I don't know, about how he should be. I mean I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my coming here and having a fantasy about how I should be. Maybe he's having a fantasy about how he should be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Still not. Like he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's totally..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I don't understand what you mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I picture the way I should be sometimes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So yeah, when he's that super considerate way, that's when sorta he has a glimpse of this person that he should be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. 0:52:08.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just didn't know what you meant. The image I have is like, when he's that way it's like he's looking at himself in a mirror. "Oh yes, this is what."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just real speculation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But anyway. Yeah. I mean it amuses me but I like it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can't imagine anybody keeping that up, that's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's too much to endure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How much can you knock yourself out like that? 0:53:02.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I'm not sure, some things he does because he wants to do them or [the love of me.] (ph) That's all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say like when you feel bad like those bad vibrations are some kind of extortion or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. Sometimes. And although I like it, I think that I really don't want to do it and..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sorta like it and feel bad about doing it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's because I don't want him to get tired of me. That's why I feel bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it's a bad strategy is why you feel bad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sure it is. If there's strategy</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If there's strategy this way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. I thought you were saying something like, "Well the reason I don't feel badly, I don't feel bad about it because it's intrinsically bad in any way, I feel bad about it because I'm going to push him away." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. 0:54:54.3</p>

<p>Good bye. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good bye. 0:55:49.8</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Saying it because there wasn't a prior authorization that they're not covering most of it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's strange.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think if there's a mistake - or I've scanned a good bit of them already. Can I e-mail them to you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, I probably also got them. They're probably also sent to my billing service, but, yeah, that's weird 'cause you're on the PPO, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. Um...[pauses]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sounds like flipping a soda tab] Wh — like, I said, you know, they're probably...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Just making — they have something. This has happened, not with this specific problem before, but I've had things that were authorized that they, for some reason forgot until they were reminded otherwise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So... [Clears throat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, um, there's another way I can check, but I'll just try that later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, great. So — [sighs] oh, gosh — um, so I interviewed down at the other store.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, I think I did a pretty good job. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I think, we'll see. I burned some video that I did... [00:01:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Which I felt like — I explained to them, like, they can look up my resume online through the system.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they asked to bring a resume. I said, "You could look it up online, but, quite frankly, my resume has nothing to do with what I do for my living...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Unless you really have a need for electrical engineers." Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I explained that to them, and they understood that. So I said, "But let me show you something I've recently worked on." And I described it to them, and, um, I think I did OK; I'm not sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm really, really nervous about it, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not supposed to hear for a little bit. I think the biggest reason why I'm nervous is because of the fact that I did let my guard down a little bit and did talk about things I probably shouldn't have, but I was sort of pressed to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. Like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, they'd give me some questions about things like about challenges in my current store, like how we're handling this or how we're handling that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, "I don't like to talk about it. Like, I don't like to talk [about another school] (ph)."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Finally, they're like, "No." Then I'm like, "OK, well, I'm going to talk about them in very big forms." [00:02:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so [pauses] — and I was very open about certain weaknesses that I have, that I think that are very important for me to — to be — not like to inform them of it, but to show that this is something that I'm actually working towards.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I am numbers-driven, you know, that kind of thing, as opposed to behaviors-driven, that kind — you know, things like that. Um, people will save — we have systems of being able to ask our customers how they — how we did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I will look at numbers like you wouldn't believe. I like to find patterns. For example, I can tell — they already have a lot of statistics for the first half of the year right now, and I can tell that there are two different types of people doing my job — myself, and then there's these things called FRSs (ph), which are sort of a less educated group. They do more poorly first thing in the morning and right after lunch, on weekdays. That sounds like to — when I tell it to management, they're like, "That sounds like — like these are correlations, not causations." I'm like, "No, this is not, and I can show you why." [00:03:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Why — if those are correlations, then why would it be only them, and why would it only be at 8 a.m. and 1 and 2 p.m.?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "And it sounds like they're — when they're out of the store, they don't come back fast enough to be there, to greet the person and then make sure that they are well focused enough." I'm a numbers-driven person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most people are — and that's how I find my things, how I find patterns. A lot of people are behaviors-driven, and they think if they talk about the behaviors more often and less about numbers, then the numbers will come, and people will be happy, if you just focus on being perfect all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm more strategic about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like to see where we're falling apart. So I suspect that the reason why is 'cause they don't know how to use Excel as well as I do. [00:04:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] That's so terrible to say it that way! But, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, everybody takes one look at this, and it is like — like people I know, that I really thought I [pauses] respected their knowledge, took one look at these - no — and they're like, "No, that's on a spreadsheet. That's a lot of information." Like, "Yes, you don't have to look at it all at once."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "You can do a search, and you can give — and say, 'Show me all of the things below this number, that have to do with 'this,' 'this,' and 'this'."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they're all so obsessed over how big and scary it looks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Wow, this is — this is a very big divide between myself and other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. They're just not used to looking at data.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and seeing patterns.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So [pauses] they make it look like I can read binary or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I — I can't. I can read hexadecimal, but I can't read binary. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Coughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But yeah, so I don't know. It just is kind of weird. But, so far, I'm — I'd like to believe that I'm going to be able to make the switch. It'd be nice to — the commute is killing me. [00:05:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is just too much. And if all else — I mean, yes, it is true that I'm going to have to work a <i>lot</i> more, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what — three times more?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Whispers in exasperation] Yeeeahh. But I've got a plan, and — and I've got a plan in motion, if that's true...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you have in mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am going to make a trip to Cincinnati...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, specifically to get myself — with the kinds of medication and treatment I need to be able to slap myself together to get there, to keep going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, my doctor down there has known that I've had that situation happen before, where I had to be able to stand that long...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And whatever, and maybe I can get some more epidural injections, maybe — do something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm just going to go down there and just get it done... [00:06:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So that I can — and say, "Hey, I just need to get into a holding pattern long enough to be able to do whatever I need to do." So [pauses] [sighs] — and I think that's going to probably be the way to do it. I didn't — I don't want to go back on pain medicine, but, at the same time, I can't even get not — I can't even just get analgesics right now 'cause — and I'm actually kind of worried that I'm ruining my liver this way. Because, if I just take over-the-counter stuff — you know, I keep insisting - my doctor here keeps insisting — and I know it is because it is — like the student healthcare stuff — he keeps insisting that it is not that much different than Celebrex, and Celebrex is raising my blood pressure, and Celebrex is too expensive. I love being told it was too expensive for me right now. [Slaps surface] And so I am taking — you know, when I can, when I'm in pain, I take a decent bit of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...NSAIDs that are over-the-counter. [00:07:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That stuff's supposed to be really bad for making your stomach bleed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why they invented — yeah — Celebrex, just 'cause it doesn't make your stomach bleed. And it is supposedly really bad on your liver, and it is supposed to be — you know, you're not supposed to be taking that stuff every day, and so — but, you know, I — potentially, if I need to, I can get something that's stronger. So I found out that there is a, um, shortage in some of my medications all of the sudden.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, it has only spilled down into retro-FRS (ph) patients that apparently has been a — sort of been a problem for people with cancer for a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I take methotrexate. There is a methotrexate shortage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Humph.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they were only in very, very high doses injectable before. Now, it is getting worse, and other things, so it is like....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Humph.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that is going to be kind of a pain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not good for it to be. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I'd like to have a doctor who — last time, when I was taking thyroid medicine, it became very scarce. He found a pharmacy that could compound the stuff that I needed... [00:08:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like — 'cause most — there's two different types of thyroid medicines. One is Synthroid, which doesn't really work well with me, and I need a natural-type, and so he found somebody that is going to compound that for me. So maybe I — you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I very - trust this guy. This is — you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you've spoken about him before. You say he's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's really great. He has — he's known me since I was a very small child.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't believe in, like, things that are good enough, but he also talks about, "OK, so if you're going to do 'this', you have to trade 'this' out." You know? Like, when I went on methotrexate, at the time, he said to me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."OK, there are two different types of things that have a warning about drinking — ones that get you too drunk and ones that get you a transplant. This is one of the things that says, if you drink, you'll end up with a transplant."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, [chuckles] that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. [00:09:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface] Very, very straightforward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't get that very much around here. I can't even get anyone to admit to, like — I don't know — like they don't know what's wrong with me sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So [pauses] I just get sent to somebody else. [Sighs] So that's pretty much, in a nutshell, what's been going on with me. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you're kind of — in as much as you want to be working more and making more money, and not having to deal with a commute and some of the people at your current...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Store, that, like, you're also pretty scared about what it would be like to try to work full-time. I'm not saying anything that it would not be a good idea...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It is just you sound a little worried.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm worried, and more because, if I do this, I kind of fell into this numb — like literally go into this very - I have to be very focused, and I sort of lose who I am. I sort of [pauses] — the type of focus that I need to keep going means that I sort of have to shut off a lot of emotions. You know? [00:10:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm in pain all the time, so I sort of have to just sort of focus on keeping going with the task in front of me. And I have these micro-tasks that are sometimes keeping me going 30 minutes at a time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm scared because I don't like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me into kind of an asshole, but not like in a good way, like as in like [pauses] — um, [pauses] there is nothing that will make me happy. You know? It is just different grades of — different shades of being angry. You know? [Pauses] But I don't have any need to. I mean, I, at this point, have — this is the first paycheck I've had that actually has — what's it called happening to me? — um, [pauses] — oh, I've been having a lot of aphasia lately — the word, um — it is when they take part of the — out of your paycheck to pay for debt. [00:11:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably "garnished," you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Garnished.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For what debt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, um, [pauses] there's been quite — we have a lot of debt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like credit card debt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, credit card debt, student debt, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently, now, I can be — have my wages garnished for my husband's student debt...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because it was consolidated at some point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I had no idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, on top of it, I don't think that's what it is, if it gets debt related to that but not directly through loans.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really have a good grip on what it is right now. [Inhales] But it has just been — it is like one thing after another after another, and it just [sighs] [pauses] — yeah. I need to find a way to make more money. [00:12:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] I'm sure there are good reasons; I just don't know them. How come you never plan on going back into research?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, a couple different reasons why, one of which is I can't go back into the Energy sector because I've been blackballed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, that I knew.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The other one is that, um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see there's no time limit on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. It is kind of like [sighs] — it is kind of like being a terrorist; you never get to get not to be a terrorist anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, [pauses] to be honest, [pauses] other than doing consulting, um, [pauses] ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are — there are a lot of non-Energy...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, no, that's true. Um, I don't have the capabilities to do it anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So... [00:13:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like [pauses] how so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The mental capacity to do some of the things. Some of them are the physical capacity of my hands and arms, um, [pauses] that kind of stuff. [Pauses]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is up to you, but [pauses] you could get neuropsych testing that would help, um — like kind of clarify the picture and — and sort of determine...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's my plan of for June.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...What kind of decline is — you know, because of the medications or whatever, and what's dealing with pain and anxiety. And [pauses] you know, often, that leads to suggestions about things you could, [pauses] uh, sort of do strategically. Um, [pauses]... [00:14:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I — I know you have a million things going on...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And not exactly a whole lot of bandwidth, so I'm not — I don't mean to push you about it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I just - I'm kind of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've actually looked into doing some things, actually, with one of the universities related to that, lately. Um, there is also — I have — it depends on what it is, but I also have a, uh — a non-compete on certain things...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So it would have to be a different — the company would have to be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Compatible. I can work for the universities, technically, because I have a rider in my contract that most people don't, saying that I need to be able to work in — in that industry so that I can get a Ph.D.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — so if it is with an educational institution, I can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would they pay for any of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Microsoft?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some of it, but I'd have to work full-time.</p>

<p>[Sound of a muffled slam]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, they have paid for it in the past. The [pauses] — but, most of the time, there are certain conflicts of interest there (ph). [00:15:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it depends. [Shifts in seat] I mean, I have [shifts in seat] definitely looked into it. There's a couple of companies that actually are right up my alley in terms of that, specifically in terms of the way that product development would — you know, for — used to be. There is one of them, that is not a conflict of interest 'cause it is not a technology company; it is an ideal company.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, what is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, they are the consulting company behind almost every unusually designed thing that you've dealt with recently, including the double-decker — like the double-decker shopping cart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, the way that toothbrushes are — modern toothbrushes are?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They are the — they're the think tank that does — that consults for all of the stuff all over the world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They — the original laptop came from them, the design. Um, the — just lots of stuff like that. [00:16:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they're a think tank for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got you. [And you like it] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's one right in the Square.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is not a big one, but it is — it is one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've actually thought about just showing up there and charming the pants off of them, which sounds strange, but I do that really well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have done — I am — gotten myself more consulting work in my life by just showing up in the right place and having conversations with people than I ever have by sending a blind resume.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, 'cause everyone's blind resume looks good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Coughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Um, [pauses] so there's a lot of things like that. I am getting involved in the mobile market again, which is the mobile, um — it is the [pauses] networking organization around the world, but here, for companies that work in the mobile enterprise, so — but I have, uh, quite a bit of stuff [sound of muffled slamming] that I would like to be able to do. And I don't know if this is a disaster, but I sort of have a job if I want it, with my husband's research group. [00:17:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The only problem is, is that I'm concerned about the toss-over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — and that has to do with the concept of turning tablets into [pauses] eh, the right — basically, in terms of doing this for electronic notebooks, but when you're not in the right domain, you don't have the data, so if the goes missing, it has nothing on it; it is all, like, they are just dumb terminals that get information.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they also have geolocation stuff because, uh, where he works, there — there's — they're always into — they're really concerned about intellectual property and being able to prove after the fact that you did this is — is sort of a trouble. People will actually go back behi — ah, behind — [chuckles] after the fact and fake lab notebooks to make it seem like it was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This happens a lot. [00:18:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot-a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's horrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, in fact, enough that there is, like the old-fashioned thing or the idea of writing an idea to yourself and mailing it, and keeping it in that envelope is actually still actively using the bio — biological world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it doesn't work to win a case, but it does to — to force something to go to court.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So with a sealed envelope — yeah. So, um, being able to do these lab notebooks such that, if they leave the building, they are worthless, that they have geolocation and geopositioning for when their things are being written. The collaboration — you only get the things that you — you only write to what you can, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is going to be all driven by one server, and everybody just has tablets that are just dumb terminals...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That get — and you log into it, and you get what is relevant to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:18:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I talked with the head of his department office, and if I ever wanted to, I know I could; it is just that I — I'm really concerned about [pauses] [sighs] — how do I explain this? Um, [sighs] having too much of our — you know, because when the two people are in the same building, then it becomes like a — having to be put on the spot for things related to him like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like, if he's not there, [sound of muffled slam] and they wonder where he is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...They'd ask you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I could say, "I don't know," but they're like, "Well, can you text him?" - you know? - or just anything like that. You know? Or if he says that he's gone somewhere, I don't have the right answer. You know what I mean? Like, "Yeah." So, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You become accountable for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So this is something where — and this is part of my summer things, is just trying to, along with everything else I'm trying to do, is find the right research group by networking, that potentially could take this technology and use it. So.... [00:20:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even the tablets things (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To do it your (ph) - oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's something I could develop for them very easily.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not very easily. It would take two months of really hard work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and, obviously, they have to pay for the outlay of the actual places.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, this is a really big deal because, like, lab notebooks go missing, they get sent to somebody else, they have — like stuff, data always — is always problematic like that, so [pauses] this is something that, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is sort of like a smart cloud...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...like an tablets? Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is mostly in charge of, like, uh, keeping track of who has done what, and making sure that you can oversee the things you're supposed to be able to see?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But also, in terms of making sure procedures are done absolutely correctly for a system, making sure that, like, if you need to be told, "I'm titrating this," you can push on the word "titrate," it will go to a master video or checklist to show you that this is the proper — this is the acceptable method for that. [00:21:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whether or not people ever press on that, um, for certain types of standards — and this is where this spillover from the Energy world came into the real world — this is something where it is — you know, they like to show that this is where [kita bowling] (ph) and measurable and all that stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm — I'm very good at that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, that being said, um, you know, it is — it is not really what I like to do. I like to build hardware.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But you know what? I'm more than willing to do — it is not that I'd do it for free because I like to — I like the attention. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that true in the — like, in [by hearing world] (ph) that it is a little more macho (ph) to build hardware?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Supposedly, but I have no — that's not the reason why. [00:22:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] I have a lot of my — a lot of my analytical skills are dependent on kinesthetic. Like, it may actually — they're not like actually — they're not even always directly related to the task at hand, but, um, definitely, it is easier for me to be working on something and thinking. I guess I could probably be programming one by using it at the same as doing, like, a...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, a...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...A Rubik's Cube or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, is it a physical intuition kind of thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] Um, that and I just — I don't know — I — I like physical instantiations of things. That was my — my — at the time, one of the most unique things that I had was that I was doing physical instantiations of neural networks, which all — was very rare.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very, very rare. It has almost always been software [where I] (ph)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the reason why I did — mine was perfect (ph) concept as to show why in the world this can't work. Um, the thing is, is that we don't actually understand this biologically. I mean, we are electrical machines, but if you have that many circuits next to each other, they'd get this crosstalk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I did a lot of, um — I mean, literal gates, like tiny gates, like, "OK, to this, and then this," and then making decisions. And so I did a lot of experiments to understand is the crosstalk actually something that is helpful? Is it — is it a — is it a chaos that we have overcome? Is it something that we can manage? Is it something that we can — you know, different pieces that — you know. It is a — it is an explanation of failure actually giving us new information, but we don't really understand how in the world — um, and I don't — I have no background in biology at all, but I had colleagues that I worked with, whose — basically, there is no real reason why we can understand the explanation, because I was doing this model of, eh, L2 and L3 in terms of autonomic function. There was — basically, I was just doing a, [if this is yours, it is one] (ph) — I only — that's all I saw, but they were trying to describe it like that, and we don't really understand how in the world we don't have magnetic problems, as people. [00:24:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It is a little bit like — like the proving-the-bee-can't-fly sort of thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, very much so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like — I mean, they're — just like when you bring a microphone next to another microphone, or a speaker next to another speaker, sometimes you get these terrible...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We don't know why we don't get feedback...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Not a clue in the world. And so this was like a big deal back - back in the day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — and that's actually — like, my academic interest of various different things that I've done, um, really, unfortunately, the artificial intelligence world has gotten — has changed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I mean, the closest thing I have to neural networks that I work with — with anymore is Voice activation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So [pauses] — and, usually, facial recognition, which I do neither. You know? [00:25:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is — those are — those are tasks that are different, so — but when you end up being the grad student of somebody else, you end up sometimes being part of a giant project that you don't truly understand the background of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because you're — that's not your — that's not your — I'm getting — I'm getting papers of methods out; they're getting papers in terms of, you know — in terms of the neurology.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Content? Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So — and that's fine. Um, but, yes, it — some people think that hardware is more macho.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just — I've been a build — I — I am more engaged when I am — if I do a physical activity that involves spatial perception at least once a day, I am more emotionally and nicely engaged, which is probably the number one reason why I do dumbass stuff like fix the air conditioner... [00:26:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...One, because we couldn't afford a new air conditioner, but, two — and it has nothing to do with the air conditioner...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it is me reasoning through, "OK, so I think that there's —" — you know, I — I'm trying to figure out why the terrible noise. "This noise has to be vibration. What's happening in the compressor?" That helps me be able to linger on, go, and be able to have, um, a more productive day in completely different tasks that have nothing to do with it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And most non-spatial ones.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, exercise might be for somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words, like going riding for five miles or whatever — uh, it is not like that in some literal way translates to being calmer or being in a conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It is actually the integration of — and I do better, actually, when I'm talking my way through it, so I'll often get an audience. I joke that I'm — I'm stuck up and I like an audience - it is really not that; it is actually 'cause I, by visually seeing it, moving this around, and then — it is almost like accidentally working for Microsoft because I'd have to explain to somebody what I'm doing at the same time — the act of saying it out loud, doing it, and seeing it, like, for some reason, really engages my thought process. [00:27:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so [pauses] — um, that's sort of — it is sort of a weird thing for me, but, um, [pauses] [sighs] — so, yeah — so I actually will occasionally do all kinds of random stuff, which is why it drives me crazy that I can't work on my car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — because that was the number one thing that I could save a lot of money on and probably just go out and just like tinker with if I could, but it seems like, between the fact that they don't really like you to do it and take things apart — they make it harder...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And, two, 'cause the police don't like you to fix things on the street.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know that until I was informed by them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it was an embarrassing situation. Um, they — yeah, so I really can't do that, and that's something that really kind of makes me sad. [00:28:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I — I know nothing about cars. I mean, I know the concept. I know what a cam is. I know about levers. Like, I'm not a mechanical person, actually, but I like trying to figure it out. So, um [pauses] — and I feel like it is, as much as I don't have the strength in my hands to do certain things, I can still — like, for detailed points, periods of time, I can. Like, if I have to do something that is only a couple of seconds long or a minute long...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That is super detailed, I can do that. Um, I can't type all day long. I can't write anymore like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I did experiment with using voice commands. There really isn't a really good system yet to program out loud.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's too bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would think there would be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You would. The problem is, is that there's a couple of things that there's a problem with, and one of which is that it doesn't understand the lexicon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I would think you'd need something that's sort of — electrically (ph) and work flow-specific... [00:29:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...To write in code.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A good exper — like, experiment with this is that my dad — I don't know if I've told this story yet or not — as soon as Voice activation came out, he was dictating an e-mail about — he's an attorney, deals with estates. When somebody is a person who handles the estate, if it is female, the name is "[inaudible]." That is an actual word; it is absolutely used, and Voice activation, every time, will put "dominatrix" in that word — for that word. We don't know why!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was [why I sent you a client] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and, actually, once you did, luckily, it was a great client that had a good sense of humor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They turned it into a, "Look, I was trying to dictate this." Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, [chuckles] that's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's — it doesn't understand a lot of things like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] it is a very weird thing, but there isn't one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I've actually thought about, since I know that the people who nuanced those [dragging it by here] (ph). [00:30:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Again, showing up at the right place, at the right time, which is harder out there.</p>

<p>[Door slams in distance]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did this in Cincinnati all the time because they were urban areas where you could just kind of be nearby at a restaurant or bar where they would hang out, and start conversations.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which sounds really strange but — trust me — it has gotten me some really, really great jobs. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] — yeah, so — but the — the — in Cincinnati — there that's not uncommon. You know, but the, um — [sighs] they're just — and this is the problem that I have, is that I have this belief — and it has worked way too well — that, if I just show up on somebody's doorstep, that, often, I can get what I want out of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've done this with Adobe before. When I was out West, um, I had just — basically, I had problems with certain things, and I found people at Adobe, and I'm like, "Hey, do you know the person who works with this?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The next thing you know, I'm getting an e-mail address directly to the person who is — deals with this situation, and I'm getting help. [00:31:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The Adobe out here, that — you know the one on [East 1-90]? Not so much. And that's not a common way of handling things, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it is mostly the suburbs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you're in the city, you can run into people, and it is OK. So [sighs] — because I've run into people and asked them questions about backup, and they gave me the right person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. Um, [pauses] so it is [sighs] — it is a weird thing, um, but I think that [pauses] — I think that I really need to — the summer is maybe a lot easier on me, in general, for my joints. It is also a lot easier for me to just get out and randomly do things. So I am hoping that, if I get this job, that I can convince them to let me have a [lowered work] (ph) for a little bit, explain to them that I have to get some things taken care of... [00:32:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So I can get this taken care of. Um, I don't know if it will work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — um, I did tell them that, if they did have a part-time, that I would take that, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They vaguely asked me if I was interested in a genius position, and I said, "Probably." But — because I'd been screened and trained as one years ago, but, um, to be honest, I don't because the personalities that are down — yeah, I'm looking for a job, basically, so I'll say just about anything, but, um, having had to deal with a lot of people of those personalities, it is different. It is — the people that work in Repair are very difficult to be with at times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is not — it is not me; it is them. It took me years to figure that out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They have poor communication skills.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they don't — what drives them is different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — but — so that's been [pauses] — you know, I've got a couple of projects on the back burner, just in general. Um, I don't know. We'll see. There — my husband is on and off doing tutoring for a company around here... [00:33:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That I have gotten kind of — I talk socially with the owner, but he — I think it is around here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, that's — we've talked a little bit about it, too. Him — they'd only — they only really need people who need tutoring about once a semester. Like, they have one client (ph) a semester, who needs it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And it is usually someone who needs, like, refresh for MCATs because, usually, they're looking for something where it is like — or somebody who is trying to get into grad school, basically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, whereas my background is a little bit more so, so I'm probably going to go and try to touch base with them and see if they need a tutor, because that is only a few hours a week, but it pays very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, although I don't have a Ph.D., I do have a lot of other things — you know? — so... [00:34:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I just — I don't know. I'm always so awkward about talking about my background because of the fact that that always changes the conversation I have with people. I feel as if it should be common around here 'cause, I guess — they call it the Bomb when they mention they were — they're there at Yale...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like, [pauses] there are details about my life that, if I let people know them, that they treat me differently. Like, I accidentally told my boss that I was a member of Mensa, and now she tells everybody. [Chuckles] Like, not everybody but, like, random people...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like, "She's not a genius. She's better than a genius. You know? She's a member of Mensa."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Oh, I only did that to get into grad school. I haven't actually been active in many years."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I was just making a — I don't remember exactly how that came up. Oh, I think she said something like, "Oh, you're so smart. You should join Mensa," or, "You ought to look into getting a Mensa test," and I think I told her, "They're really — I mean, they are tests, but that's not really the way that they take this. There are other standardized ways that they can find this." And I was trying to explain to her, like, twos — like how many, what the norm was, and standard deviations, and two — two and a half standard deviations from the norm..." [00:35:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And all that stuff, and I don't remember — if I just shut my mouth up and said, "That's a really great idea. Thank you," I probably wouldn't have been put through that, but [clucks] I [pauses] — I've never been able to do that when [sighs] — I don't know — when put in certain situations. And that was like — that was over Thanksgiving dinner, so I kind of didn't really think, really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whereas, at work, I probably wouldn't have mentioned it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were a little — sort of [inaudible at 35:47].</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she's absolutely fascinated with my life outside of work. I was like, "Yeah, I used to be somebody really cool; now I'm not. That's all you need to know. " [Slaps surface] Oh, [speaks weakly] I used to do a lot. So I don't do so much anymore, and that's OK, I think. [00:36:06]</p>

<p>There are moments I wish I — there are things I wish I could be, but, aside from that, not so much. I mean, [pauses] they were — those things had their time in the sun, and now they're not. It is not that I'm disinterested in them anymore, but, you know, I've done that before. You know? [Slaps surface] So — like, no way in hell am I wiring up hundreds of thousands of circuits again in my life to simulate something. I mean, I did it. I proved why it can and cannot be done, and nothing in the world — not just because my hands can't do it anymore; I just — you know, quite frankly, what — it seemed like a great idea at 22.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, I've been there. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Been there, done that. [00:36:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so [pauses] — but [pauses] [sighs] you know, I — I've got to — I really feel like I need to carve a niche out for myself in creating my own job, which is sort of something I've done before. I just need to figure out how to do it for this time around. [Pauses] I am [pauses] — on the side here like that — I mean, my dad's writing a book, and I aim to help him publish, and, I guess, part of — like, one of the things he mentioned is — on the side is that I've done it for free for people, but I really ought to — like, because of the [sighs] — because of the prevalence of a very particular group of fiction that I find absolutely annoying as hell, [slaps surface] people think that, now, anybody can write something. I don't know if you've heard about this — there are these stories written by this housewife, that are [sighs] — they're adult in nature, and they're poorly written, but now everyone who thinks that they can do it because you don't — because there has been a series of five or six people who have made millions off of e-publishing... [00:38:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, the particular ones that everybody comes into my store about, is they've all seen the <i>Shades of Gray</i> book.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it is — the one thing that really bothers me about it is, is it is deep sadomasochism....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And that's the reason why it sells, is 'cause nobody wants to have that book around the house. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] But seriously! Like, that's the reason why it sells on e-books like crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I saw something like that in the <i>Times</i>. Where was it? I don't remember the [inaudible at 38:37] or the <i>Times</i>...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But they were saying that, you know, 60 percent or something of people who own e-book readers admit to reading things that they'd be ashamed to have other people see they were reading...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Because it is usually either, like, dirty stuff or a children's book.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bad fiction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, or bad fiction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: <i>Harry Potter</i> or — right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so, um, there was like this list, like a whole outline of this, and so this is always — just when I thought my job couldn't get any weirder, now I've got people that want to write like vampire-beating-each-other-up fiction with me. [00:39:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean S&M vampire fiction?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's very big.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And so — and then it becomes a, "So what do you think?" I'm like, "I don't have an opinion on these things." And then they go, "Oh, come on." I'm like, "No, you don't understand." And I've got this whole shtick: "I'm a researcher. I'm a problem-fixer. I can tell you if you have the tense wrong in your sentence, but I can't tell you what is beautiful." That's not true. I actually made a lot of study into aesthetics, but it is the only way I can get out of that tactfully because what am I supposed to say? You know? I'm just here to teach you how to put this on Amazon, not like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, not to be a critic...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or an editor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And at least with the people that have — with the books, it is worse because of the fact that it is not able to be seen from far away, I can't even do the, um, "This is a family-friendly place, and we can't use this anymore." [00:40:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I have done in situations where there are people that have things that are objectionable to do my work on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but it is like, what am I supposed to say? Go into my - my [claps hands] — my boss and say, "I don't want to work with this person anymore. She's writing dirty books?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Whispers] Yeah — so — and this isn't like a hang-up thing; this is actually like, to me, kind of creepy and demoralizing to people, in general, but that — that's not like a — like, "I'm worried about working with these people because my husband has an addiction?" This is nothing to do with that. I don't like the concept of hearing about, like, auto-erotic asphyxiation as part of my job; I think that's well within the bounds of normal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm hoping this will be over by the end of summer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Swallows like sipping a drink] <i>Ahhh</i> — and so then people will be onto something else. There was a phase where people did memorial videos when somebody died.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That — that burned out, so that was good. It was very depressing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I would imagine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um, I'm hoping this will burn out in just a few months, too. [00:41:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, my dad's writing a book right now, and it has nothing to do with that kind of stuff at all, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I didn't think so] (ph), from what you said about your dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah — no. Um, but he seems to think that it would be of — it would really be helpful if, um, in terms of this and in terms of being — we talked to other lawyers in general who want to publish certain things...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...To have somebody who has a background in this, to act as somewhat — not truly like a ghostwriter but more like copyediting, but copyediting on a level that is, um — you need to have a background and knowledge for that. And so he seems to think that, if our collaboration works, that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...He might be able to work out something with somebody else, so that would be nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, he has no idea if there is a market for it yet, but — like, he knows that, at the very least, that the person who helps Grisham out with copying — like makes more money billing than most lawyers than most lawyers he writes about. [00:42:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is really interesting to think about, like a copyeditor being — billing $1,500 an hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Swallows like sipping a drink] So I don't know. We'll see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just — [sighs] I am — [sighs] I guess I'm just loath to put myself in a situation anymore where I could be put very vulnerable, and I have to tell anybody, really, about my proclivity is in terms of having memory issues and things like that. It is really obvious when I have scars, and that — you know, it is — people understand when you have — or at least mostly understand when you at least tell them that you have artificial joints.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People do not — nobody, <i>nobody</i> understands when you tell them that, due to a vitamin deficiency, you've done brain damage, especially when you tell them that it is not really easily well defined, and that is, again...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Part of the reason why June is going to be... [00:43:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ....The time I've sort of set aside to do this, is because of the fact that it just — it — it is something that is difficult for me to talk about, but it is <i>extremely</i> difficult for <i>anyone</i> to understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We should finish up for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, we'll talk more on Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I — [slaps surface] so — [pauses for 5 seconds] and I will, um, send you some of those bills so you can see, at least, which of the codes are...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure it is like..</p>

<p>[Crosstalk]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I probably have them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, but if you want to wait 'til Thursday, I can't take a look and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't do paper. I just can't. I can't have everything [inaudible at 43:43] because I'd — I'd die from paper overload.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I [inaudible at 43:49].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. OK.</p>

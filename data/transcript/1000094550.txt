<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.  Good.  So Heather, do you want to go ahead with the work that you just did on the getting out of the denial part?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.  Sure.  Blaire, did you get it?  I just sent it like 20 minutes before the group started.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Oh, no.  I didn't think to look at my email. </p>

<p>HEATHER: Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you guys actually do know each other, right?  </p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... didn't Heather refer Blaire to me?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Yup.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, got it.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yup.I did not want to imply that "getting better" is good enough.  First, I wrote, "I don't get this one." (laughs)  I didn't want to get it but then when I started writing about it, ah, I'd got it (chuckles) as often happens in your homework, Josephine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: So, what did you mean, though?  Did I get it right?  I guess that's what you meant?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I meant that the addiction usually tells us that, "getting better is good enough... don't spend time doing all the work of recovery"... </p>

<p>HEATHER: ... getting better is good enough? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... yeah.  The addiction chatter wants us to believe that "getting better is good enough." </p>

<p>HEATHER: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  But, in other words  say from the drug and alcohol perspective, you know well, you know, nothing's going up your nose, you know, nothing's going in your arms, that's good enough, when the old marijuana didn't hurt, you know... </p>

<p>HEATHER: Or like not throwing up is good enough... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  The eating addiction tries to tell us not throwing up's good enough... </p>

<p>HEATHER: (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... Then another lie... the next one says, "It's the best that anyone can do."  "This is hard enough," or "I'm doing the best I can do."  And then... </p>

<p>HEATHER: That one kept me in my eating addiction probably for years longer than it had to do because I'm like, "See, I'm not throwing up anymore..."  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... that's the best I can do... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and, you know, you see some people who quit dieting and now, and just say, "That's the best I can do, I just don't diet anymore.  That's the best I can do, I don't ban foods anymore."  And so in both cases that's good, you know, but it's not the solution.  It's not arresting the eating addiction, it'll just get you some other way, you know, just as somebody getting off a heroin, that's good, but Is it really doesn't to solve or arrest chemical dependency.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  the next one says, "One bite right now is needed to just get through and then we can get back on track tomorrow." </p>

<p>HEATHER: Uh-hmm</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the one that is probably the most common especially in our first year of abstinence because, we have the dieting history, you know, "I can start tomorrow, I can start tomorrow." </p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.  When I was first abstinent, I remember thinking, "Why can't I just have popsicles?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Why can't I just have a piece of fruit in between meals? What's the harm in fruit in between meals... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... or just popsicles?  They're just frozen water.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... and it took me a long Time to get that out of the addiction chatter trying to get me to essentially eat between meals... to break my abstinence.  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. Right.  To not have a hard bottom line, like sobriety.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Right.  To not have a solid bottom line.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: To have an exception...  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.  Yup. And how long did you say that, that took you to-- 'till you kind of felt that was clear?</p>

<p>HEATHER: It was probably when I was talking to someone from my former group a lot during the days.  She really shared her experience of having fruit and breaking her abstinence on fruit in between meals and then a full on breaking in her abstinence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>HEATHER: And I think though it was around 5 months. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.  Did you have your one year of abstinence birthday coming up in April, is it?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi, who came on line.  </p>

<p>NATALIA: Hi, guys.  It's Natalia.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey, Natalia.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Hi, Natalia.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah... yup... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... did you have a hard time getting on Natalia?</p>

<p>Natalia: No, I didn't... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>NATALIA: ... I just had to get the last kids to bed... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No problem.It's just Blaire and Heather and I.  We're still waiting for another new gal, June... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and we're waiting for Marge and Kim.  </p>

<p>NATALIA: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... I've talked to everybody in the last 24 hours and I expect everybody to be here. </p>

<p>NATALIA: Oh, Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... Natalia just recently moved from the Los Angeles area to the New York area.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So,  she's in another Time zone, so to speak and, but she's been a real valuable part of this group.We were just going over the homework...the getting out of denial stuff and... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Oh, that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... Heather had done a good e-mail on feedback about it. </p>

<p>NATALIA: Oh, did you send it out today, Heather?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.  Just 20 minutes and-- for the group though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  so I think, Heather, you were kind of talking about, when you realized the seduction of, "it's only a popsicle," or "it's only fruit," how could that be a problem?  Until you really got that, that's it's the eating, it doesn't necessarily matter what the substance is, it's the eating in between meals that seems to keep the addiction alive.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so any other comments?We were talking about the lies the eating addiction tells you like, "getting better is good enough."  And Heather made the analogy with vomiting, you know, "I'm not vomiting, that's good enough, that's the best I can do."</p>

<p>NATALIA: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, then the other one I put in the homework is, "one bite right now is enough to get me through, then I'll get back on track tomorrow," that dieting mentality that would undermine our commitment to our abstinence.  Okay...</p>

<p>NATALIA: Hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then, the last part of the homework, Heather,  is about the visualization which I know you wanted to talk about doing the visualization as well but,  I wanted to talk about the verbiage that we use to talk about our eating addiction and I thought you also made some good points.  Do you want to talk about that section of your homework?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Sure.  I just said that sometimes I do say "my food things," or other times I'd say, "my eating addiction," it depends because I've disclosed to some friends but I wish I hadn't, because I've perceived their subtle judgment and, so that when I'm around them, I tend to minimize it in my verbiage... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... so that I don't have to get that backlash from sharing it with them in the first place.  I'm just like, "No, I wish I hadn't said anything." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: But it's good for me to remember how I phrase it and for me to remember the disparity of my eating addiction.</p>

<p>NATALIA: I like that Heather.  I agree with that 'cause I've done that, too.  Like this week, I've noticed that saying "eating addiction" over and over to myself has really helped me because I have baked and cooked a lot more this week than I've done in my whole life. You guys know I've been helping my friend who has six kids while she's in the hospital having number seven and I'm constantly in the kitchen and everyday I get on my knees and say, "I can't believe I'm abstinent."  I'm not saying that there haven't been moments that are hard like, "Oh, I could just lick my finger," you know.  And I'm like, "No I don't want to take the chance of it going the other way 'cause I'm so glad I'm abstinent."  I think that verbiage really does help because when I keep saying "eating addiction," it's helping.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  How about you, Blaire?  'Cause I know you're a little bit newer than the other gals but does that seem like a hard label to put on it?  Or does it feel like the best or... </p>

<p>BLAIRE: Uhm.  I felt kind of stupid saying it 'cause, you know, for me I never was bulimic or anorexic.  And so when I say something that has to an eating addiction, I've kind of feel like, I don't know, judged-- or like my problem isn't as bad, or  people would think that it's not the same as people's problem.  See, I mean, you could see I have a problem.  You could look at me I'm like a whale, (laughs) you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: ... but it's not the same it's not the same thing.  It's like throwing up is going to kill you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well in my opinion, vomiting just might kill you "quicker" that's all.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alcohol kills you a lot slower than say, street drugs, but street drugs might 
kill  you faster than prescription drugs, depending on the drug.  You know, I mean, so they do all kind of have their own timeline and yet the addiction takes away a life worth living.  </p>

<p>BLAIRE: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... There is what I call  "The Hierarchy" you know, everybody looks down at the pot smokers and the glue sniffers and, you know, everybody is arrogant around their heroine and use-- or their cocaine use, you know, and so we have the same kind of silly hierarchy with eating addictions, the overweight people are at the bottom, and then we look up to the starvers or the vomitters which is so crazy, you know.</p>

<p>(somebody laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really there, you know.  I've heard overweight people say, "Oh, I just wish I could be anorexic for a week." </p>

<p>NATALIA: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... You know, it's like, "No you don't... " </p>

<p>NATALIA: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... How crazy is that?  You know, so-- ah, Blaire, you're probably right, there is that kind of innate hierarchy that's, ah,  only these people have a problem, these people don't, these people have the best part of the problem, these people have the worst problem.  You know, that kind of thing but I think if we just think of it as an illness... If people say they have diabetes, they don't, you know, they don't get in to how bad is yours, you know.  So if we can kind of leave it alone, within ourselves but I think Heather had a good point about be careful who you disclose to... </p>

<p>BLAIRE: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: I learned it the hard way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think when we're newly sober, it takes us a little while to figure out who to disclose to and how to disclose... </p>

<p>HEATHER: I did the same thing, thing with my sobriety. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: (chuckles) The same thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  And we just get better just figuring it out.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the... </p>

<p>NATALIA: But that whole sharing of your heart with the people that can handle it-- and you just have to learn...  Really, I think the only way to learn is to do like Heather and I are talking about, (giggles) you know.  Just be-- disclose, you know, just share with the wrong people and then you get burned, you know, like, "Oh, that's didn't feel so good."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.  Well, Blaire, were you talking about it being more of an inside situation like it's hard for you to say because you don't feel yours is as bad. Is that a judgment within you?</p>

<p>BLAIRE: I was talking about-- when I talk to people like,  the girlfriends that I have told... I haven't told very many people... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: ... they don't give me a hard time.  But It's like my husband, who is sober in A.A. but has no food or eating problem... he just doesn't get it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: You know, so he doesn't criticize me and say, "Oh, what a dummy you are," he is like, "Want a bite?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) Oh.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't... </p>

<p>BLAIRE:  It's that kind of thing and like... I'm sure that I won't discuss it with my family.  I mean I told you that I mentioned something to my mom... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: ... and like, when I told my parents that I was alcoholic, they told me that I wasn't... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: You know, I mean, my family is very threatened by me doing anything like this, so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: So part of it is talking to other people and part of it is,  also kind of just feeling sort of awkward and not exactly knowing what to say.  So... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.  I think it's worthwhile and maybe we can talk about that in our individual session, Blaire, to brainstorm some words that feel the most comfortable.  You know, the inner circle, the outer circle, the casual circles, you know.  That-- sometimes we just have a  different approach with each setting.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Uh-hmmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I think,  Heather, what you said, "It's important that you don't minimize it," is very important.  </p>

<p>HEATHER: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: And it really helped that I've done the other worksheet and stuff like where we talked about how it affected us physically, how it affected us emotionally... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... and that's where I could separate out my thoughts about my eating addiction from my purging.  I mean... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... 'cause I think of them in separate camps, even though, without my eating addiction, I probably wouldn't have needed to purge but the purging itself was a separate process addiction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>HEATHER: I-- that's how I've come to view it, through working with you, Josephine but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: but I think, I didn't know all of that until I got to the writing assignment about how much my life has been affected by both.  But not just by the purging 'cause I was still sober and still not purging for 11 years before I got abstinent.  And my life was still unmanageable... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... in relationship to my eating addiction.  Does that make sense?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  It does to me, it does to me.</p>

<p>NATALIA: Well, I think like what you said, Heather, is critical.  That hard line, I mean, not minimizing it.  We don't have to minimize it like the rest of the world might want to minimize it.  And you know what?  Maybe 99.9 percent of the people in my life won't ever get it, but I do! (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>NATALIA: ... and you guys get it, you know, when I talk to Josephine, she gets this, so I guess I'm not alone.  But that's kind of what I've been holding on to right now.  When I hear the chatter, I stop it because it's the addiction, you know, it's just the addiction wanting you to believe that it me ... my voice... that I'm screwed up... but once I know it's just addiction chatter, I can calm down.  Or like, you know, a lot of people out there have a snack in between meals and it's like, well, that's fabulous for them but I can't, you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) That's fabulous for them, huh? (chuckles)</p>

<p>NATALIA: Yeah.  I mean, even this week, you know, I heard the chatter say I can't have, like an apple with the kid, you know... wanting me to feel bad about that.  It says,  "What's that apple going to do?"  But I just say back, "why would I want to do that and give up my recovery."  You know,  I think in society eating problems are so minimized and that's  when I'm worrying not to disclose so much 'cause, you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that the end of your sentence, Natalia?  Or just... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Yeah.  Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>NATALIA: ... I'm just... I guess I was agreeing with everybody... (chuckles) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. (chuckles)</p>

<p>NATALIA: ... Well, I'm trying to make my thoughts go together, but I think I'm so exhausted that I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs)</p>

<p>NATALIA: ... that they're not coming together.  (laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  Well, how long are you staying there helping out?</p>

<p>NATALIA: Until Monday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 'Till Monday. Whew!But she came home, right?  She came home with the baby today?</p>

<p>NATALIA: Yeah.  Yeah.  That was good and tomorrow I'm going to have some time to myself in the afternoon but it's been so much fun.  We really had it's a great time, but exhausting too...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just exhausting, that's the truth... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are their ages, from what to what?</p>

<p>NATALIA: Sixteen to a new born, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>NATALIA: ... there's nine-- well, the-- they're all like-- well, they're, they're  almost like, they're next age, so 16, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3 and then the new born.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the older ones, do they pitch in?</p>

<p>NATALIA: Uh-huh.  Well, I'm kind of running it like a marine squad so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gosh, how cute. (chuckles)</p>

<p>Natalia: ... and so (chuckles) it's been fun, you know.  It's been good, but we're all ready for mom to be home and I'm going to go home now... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: .. There was something on the Today Show about four sisters -- I don't know if you guys saw it -- four sisters who are all CEO's of companies.  And I guess they did some research on how they were raised.  Did anybody see it?</p>

<p>HEATHER: No.</p>

<p>Natalia: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anyway, I might not, you know, summarize it, as well as I'd like to, but one of the things that they said is that everybody had their chores and that they weren't paid for doing them... they did them just because they're part of the family and they're part of the household and everybody had their chores and everybody pitched in.  And they all got their chores, they drew it out of a jar or something, I think and then you could negotiate with everybody else.  You know like, "I'm going to be working on that day," or "I've got practice, can you trade chores?"They just all kind of negotiated with each other and... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... I thought that was a very nice touch.  And the other thing was, they were taught to embrace failure... </p>

<p>HEATHER: ... I think that's great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and by embracing failure, it pretty much squashes perfectionism, you know.  </p>

<p>HEATHER: I love that, I love that... </p>

<p>BLAIRE: ... isn't that great? </p>

<p>HEATHER: ... like embrace failure.  It's, true, yeah... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... 'cause I know, I went to college and that was my hardest thing, the first time I failed.  It was like, I didn't know what to do... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... my whole world fell apart and then (chuckles) then my eating addiction-- my friend, it was there... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ...  and a whole other level of the addiction came out... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure there were a lot of other points but those two points really,  ah, really struck me strongly.  That feeling of " you're a kid, but you're still an integral part of a family" and... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Hey there, somebody came on line.</p>

<p>NATALIA: Hi.</p>

<p>KIM: Hello?</p>

<p>NATALIA: Oh, hi, Kim.</p>

<p>KIM: Hi. I'm so glad, I need this... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorry.  Ah, Kim, did you have trouble getting on line?</p>

<p>KIM: Yeah, I did.</p>

<p>KIM: Am alive and well, but I think I'm going to listen at this time, 'cause I'm not formulating sentences, so (giggles)... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Oh, well, that was my plan, too.  I suppose Heather going to have to talk. (laughs)</p>

<p>HEATHER: And Blaire is on too.</p>

<p>KIM: Blaire is on too.  Hello?</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Hi.</p>

<p>KIM: Oh, it's great.  Welcome, Blaire.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Thanks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, ah, Kim, welcome to the group and welcome, and introduce you to Blaire, who is one of the new gals that's joining us tonight.  June is the other one and she's the one that's trying to get on line.  So... </p>

<p>KIM: Oh, shoot.  Kind of she's having trouble but welcome, Blaire.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kim's, in the Chicago Time zone, two hour difference, right?  </p>

<p>KIM: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... yeah.</p>

<p>KIM: Where are you, Blaire?</p>

<p>BLAIRE: I'm in San Francisco.</p>

<p>KIM: Oh, where the sun is still shinin'.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... We were, Kim, we were just kind of going over the denial part of the homework... </p>

<p>KIM: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... Ithink we were just down to almost the last paragraph of it but the second to the last paragraph was about how we talk about it and how the addiction wants to minimize itself and, Heather's homework had made a good point which is being aware or careful about who you share your recovery with, what version you use to share with your inner circle, what version you share with your extended family circle, uhm... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and... Kim's been sober really long.  Kim, how long have you been sober?</p>

<p>KIM:  eleven years now... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So Kim and Blaire, you're both about that-- aren't you... aren't both of you about ten or eleven?</p>

<p>BLAIRE: No.  I'm nine and a half years sober. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nine and a half.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: ... Kim is ahead by like several years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then Heather, you're about eleven, right?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah, be-- twelve years sober next month.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.  So all you guys are pretty much a decade sober which will really, really help.  And I think Marge has been sober about 18 years?  Does that sound right?  </p>

<p>KIM: Yeah.  You just sound right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... yeah she was pretty young.  Ah, she actually got sober by going into treatment for her eating disorder.  And they challenged her about her drinking problem. So if our new gal ever gets on the call today, her name is Cammy, you guys might  remember to kind of include her by writing a paragraph about what you got out of the group and then emailing it to her.  She felt pretty bad about not being able to get on the call today.  You know when you take notes in class and then you transcribe your notes, it helps to integrate the knowledge better.  And so doing a little paragraph summarizing the call, it would help you and it would help Cammy too.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  The last paragraph is about the visualization.Heather you said you tried it.  Had anybody else had a chance to try that one?  It's where you visualize yourself meeting with God, you know, the God of your understanding and then you hand over the addiction to God,... you take it out of your body and hand it over and place it in God's care.  And then God hands you back packages that are spiritual principles like comfort and self-respect, self-love... </p>

<p>BLAIRE: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... strength, commitment and I just find it so comforting.  So,anybody else tried besides Heather?</p>

<p>NATALIA:  I've done it, this is Natalia, I've done it before, I think it was last summer when I first tried it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>NATALIA: ...  you know, it's one of those things, you know, I probably need to do again and again... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>NATALIA: ... and try to think of it that way but, I know what was-- when I was doing that, you know, the recovery work of step writing on the third step last summer?  That's when I did the visualization's the first time... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a good one but anytime we have any kind of a problem that seems too big we can do the visualization and see ourselves hand over the problems to God... see it in God's care and then let God hand you back comfort and peace and love and serenity, whatever spiritual principles you pick, I've found that they work for me.So, yeah, try it more than once, try it on some different things, so Heather, do you want to talk... </p>

<p>HEATHER: Well, the first part of that, I was thinking, well, I can't really hand over the addiction because it's always there but now I realized as I hear you talk, I'm handing that, the addiction even though I know I still have the disease within me but that's right... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.  We're just placing it in God's hands... we're just placing it in God's care.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Well, what was that you were saying? I still have the disease, but I just place it in God's care?</p>

<p>KIM: Yeah.  I was struggling with the visualization... I'd love for it to go out of me but I know I still have it...  with alcoholism, I always have to remind myself I have it but I can place it in God's care.
  
COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>NATALIA: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would have guessed with you being sober as long as you're sober, you really have placed the addiction in God's hands... </p>

<p>KIM: All completely, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... yeah, yeah.  And that's just the same thing, it doesn't mean we pretend we don't have it... </p>

<p>HEATHER: And Kim, I did it and I thought about my perfectionism when I say to myself, "Hey, you can't give up everything... you don't even know what it all it entails," you know, like that's in my head. (chuckles) Then I go, "Honey, you don't have to know everything, just give it to God."  You know, and then a bunch of stuff went through my mind as manifestations of my disease.  And so I was able to give all that to God... I gave all that to God too... but I was knowing full well that I'd probably need to do this again, (giggles) you know, 'cause I know that there's going to be other stuff, that's going to be uncovered... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>KIM: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or as we go along and we do the body image work, and then we get to place the care of our body in God's hands, too... </p>

<p>HEATHER: Oh, man. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and that doesn't mean that we will be the best mom we can be to our body 100% of the time... it just means that we place it in God's care.  </p>

<p>HEATHER: I'm not feeling good physically.  I have an inner infection in both ears... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Awww...</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... and  I've been battling with depression again.  So, oh, man, you know, like it seems overwhelming right now... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... the whole body image stuff... the whole body image stuff of my eating addiction... I'm not ready to tackle it tonight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  And we don't have to.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And even when that homework assignment hits you, you still don't have to tackle it all at... </p>

<p>HEATHER: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... you can tackle it piecemeal... and you don't have to tackle it on your own.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Right.  That's the whole point, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yup.  That's the whole point.</p>

<p>HEATHER: (giggle)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so has work been going a little smoother for you, Heather?</p>

<p>HEATHER:  I've been sick and I took two days off last week but went to a bunch of doctor's appointment and got wiped out again.  And then worked all weekend and then got sick again.  Or, you know, admitted it again and went back to the doctor yesterday and she gave me two days rest and I gave myself two days of just rest.  Except for being on this call today, that's all I've done for two days... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh good.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... just rest... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good for you.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... and so  I was prepared to work a double shift this weekend to cover for a co-worker who's going out of town and my boss was unaware that I was going to do that until I got sick.  And then she said, (giggles) "Ohhhh."  Then she got upset with me for making those arrangements but it's just myself and this other guy in our position... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... so I'm the only other person, you know, to cover for him and she'd known for week, we put it on the schedule, we put it on both calendars and I even asked for clarification.  Anyway, I got some more information about how to deal with her as far as little things go.  'Cause she was not aware that I was going to pull a double shift and did not want me to.  And so I'm not, I'm going to work his shift only this weekend... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... which is more sane.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>HEATHER: That's the long answer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good</p>

<p>HEATHER: Oh, it's still very difficult learning the new thing and like when you said, "Embracing the failure..." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... I feel like when I make a mistake, I really don't embrace my failure yet, that's for sure... it's really hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When other people are involved, for most of us, we often feel even worse... but as long as I know my intent is to live or act from spiritual principles, then God can pick-up the slacks for any mistake I make.  I had to believe that God is bigger than any mistake I can make.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And just hang on to that.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Okay.</p>

<p>NATALIA: I love the part of AA's big book, page 449, that talks about "acceptance is the answer to all my problems," you know, I had to accept the worst thing that could happen to me, I mean, become an alcoholic you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>NATALIA: ... and, you know, now I look back and that was the best thing that happened to me 'cause I was changed. (giggles) So obviously, I don't know what's good for me, God does... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>NATALIA: ... and I think of that and, I know I've made mistakes, you know, but they're all a part of my life.  </p>

<p>HEATHER: What was the-- one line that you said, Josephine, "before about God"?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: God is bigger than any mistake I can make.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the one?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, one of the, the things I think I've shared recently that I heard at the meeting that I loved and maybe you've heard it, "Instead of telling God how big my problems are, I'm going to tell my problems how big God is."  Isn't that great?  </p>

<p>KIM: I've heard that in meetings too... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like, "Of course, of course," but I haven't ever heard or put quite that way and I just love that concept.  My one liner that I put on my affirmation list is, "God is bigger than the IRS."  Because I think the IRS just scares everybody (laugh) and you know, it's like, "Oh no, I'm being audited," that kind of thing.  And so, you know, I just would tell myself my affirmation, "God's bigger than IRS," and I'd calm right down.  Kim did you want to check in at all?  A little bit, no?</p>

<p>KIM: (deep sigh) Yeah, I actually did want to tell the group,  I actually separated from my husband on Sunday and I'm just going through a huge amount of overwhelming feelings about it and I don't want to discussed it, or talk about it but I did  want to let the group know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>KIM: ... So, in terms of my eating, abstinence is fine... that's what I wanted to share with the group.  Please keep me in your prayers.  Tonight I'm calling from the Bed and Breakfast... it's in the same town as my home but I'm not at home.So, I am feeling vulnerable... but one of the things that you said Josephine, was about the old pattern of turning to food for comfort and now not being deceived by the disease chatter that the addiction can offer us comfort, and I'm so sorry that I missed the first part of it because I just want to hear what other people are doing for comfort. (chuckles)I know prayer is one and I know I used to talk about how that and does help, ah, when one really does need comfort and soothing and it does seem available thru prayer, you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, somebody just jumped in and said we didn't talk too much about that, but that might be a good topic to make sure we touch on... so who was it that jumped in and said, we didn't discuss it much?</p>

<p>BLAIRE: It was me, Blaire.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Blaire.  So-... I think that it is a good idea.  You know how we talked about the three elements of the addiction chatter: the tormentor voice, the I'll-be-your-best friend voice and the little girl voice, which is the more minimizing one.  The best friend is more the comfort one.  And so if we are going to quit pretending that the addiction is bringing comfort to our life, when all it does destroy our self-esteem, how are we going to get those comfort needs net... to feel comforted at times when the addiction lies starts to tell us it's the comfort?  So, anybody want to jumped in?</p>

<p>NATALIA: I was going to say just one thing I thought about, Kim, number that we have is that your home or  your cell phone?  'Cause I was thinking comfort for me is connecting to the people that I know I can be honest with or cry, you know... </p>

<p>KIM: Right.  Actually though I'm not a phone person,  right now it's just been hard for me to put, you know, too many words together and ah... but, that's such a comfort for me to know that I can call.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There you go... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Uh-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Well, if you just wanted to listen, maybe some speaker tapes... </p>

<p>NATALIA: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, what a great idea.</p>

<p>KIM: That is wonderful.  Yeah, and even-- you know, I've been reading-- I did bring from home our notes from the group and Josephine, your handouts and I brought all that from home and, it's my life saver and it really helps out to read the big book...  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.  
  
KIM: ... and I found in the notes, from one of my talks with you, Josephine, you had given me words to tell the inner child or any in the family member,  to say, "Oh, I'm sorry to be shoving coffee at you, you know or, or any of these other foods when I really do want to listen.  I know that's not what you need."  And then you said, "I can't imagine, you know, if your child came home and she started talking to her about her day at school... that she had a horrible day.  You wouldn't say, you know,  you know, you know, I can't listen but go get a cookie."(chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>KIM: You know, because that wouldn't help and that wouldn't give her the comfort she needed... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>KIM: Those words have helped me. And then I wanted to be out in the sunshine, taking a walk-- and God just gives us a very cold stormy weather, so-- that comfort hasn't been available.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, do you have the privacy at home where you can either have a bubble bath or read a book while you're in the bath or listen to music while you're in the bathroom.</p>

<p>KIM: Oh, that sounds nice.  </p>

<p>NATALIA: Just schedule a massage-- like human touch, I know for me it's like...  'cause I've gotten back to the gym and massages again every two weeks, you know and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>NATALIA: I need it... </p>

<p>KIM: Those are really big ones.</p>

<p>NATALIA: ... on meetings and get hugs. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sometimes just meetings where you can just listen, you don't have to talk, you can pass if you want to... </p>

<p>KIM: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... you know you can use one comfort tool one time and use another comfort another time.  S keep your list of ways to comfort handy so that when you feel kind of overwhelmed or out to sorts, look at the list and see which one might fit that time 'cause it is absolutely true... the addiction does not bring comfort in the long run.</p>

<p>KIM: And then, what about waking up in the middle of the night?  I, I have tried what you said,  to just say the serenity over and over... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>KIM: ... and then all of a sudden that doesn't work anymore and I just don't know what to do in the middle of the night... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have Ipod or tape head set... </p>

<p>KIM: ... yeah and I just got that charged today.  Thank God.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.  Good.  Then I definitely would either have those speaker tapes in there or  some kind of a soft music or... </p>

<p>KIM: Oh, that's a nice idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... book that you find enjoyable. </p>

<p>KIM: Oh, that's a good idea.  Okay.  I was... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, we'll just send you a big hug trust that you're going to  reach out and get the kind of support you really need when you need it.</p>

<p>KIM: Thank you so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>KIM: And I love what you were talking about earlier that, you know, I think it was about a response to something I needed... if there were problem, I can trust.... or it only, you know, it can bring you grace that you don't know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.  The seemingly bad can be one of the best things that ever happen to us... </p>

<p>KIM: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you guys have all heard me talk about the lump that I-have down on my breast at 35 and that worked out to be one of the best thing that ever happen to me as well, and I know that that's hard to believe for a lot of people but... </p>

<p>KIM: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... but I-- I'm not the only one who's had something like that happened and who has had that experience changed their lives  in an important and wonderful ways.  And so all of us probably who are sober now feel that way... and hopefully the longer you're abstinent the more you feel like how lucky am I. 'Cause that's how I feel about my eating addiction, "How lucky am I, I've found a solution? Oh, my God!"... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you can walk in to any office, any business, any restaurant and just listen to other conversations about everybody talking about their weight, and their eating, and their carbs... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and I feel like, "How lucky am I?" You know... </p>

<p>KIM: I have felt good definitely this week.  I feel so grateful to the abstinence and I feel that this is definitely giving me my strength. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great.</p>

<p>KIM: 'Cause, you know, I work in an office that's open and ah, at the other side of the open wall  is a woman who was diagnosed with diabetes and she's on insulin and, you know, she's only 47 and  she's been doing really well on her, so called diet.  And ah, today I could hear her going back into eating the chips and hearing her crunching, you know, on the other side and it just reminded me so much of that terrible feeling of the torn self-- that you don't want to do it, you know, it's not good for you.  And that whole self hating that the addiction brings.  Oh God, every crunch of those other chips, I could hear that with her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yup.  Yup.  And we know what it feels like inside.</p>

<p>KIM: That's what I meant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yup.  Yup.  Blaire, do you have any questions?</p>

<p>BLAIRE: The thing that I wrote a lot about was that comfort issue... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: ... because I was trying to figure out, before you described it was... I thought that we were supposed to write about what the younger self was looking for comfort in food... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: And I wrote couple of pages on that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good for you.  Can you kind of give us a short version of what you got out of it.</p>

<p>BLAIRE:  well, what I got out of it is that, for my whole life, when I'm afraid or when I'm angry.., and sometimes when I'm really angry about stuff that I just can't do anything about...  like, when there's a person in a position of control over me that I have no power over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  Example, whom?</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Like a parent or boss or something like that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE:  ... when it's late night eating...  physically it makes my body feel different, I thought about the way that different foods make my body feel different... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: ...and actually it gives you result kind of like alcohol gives you a result... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.  Certainly chocolate does...  that's for sure, 'coz chocolate and coffee have caffeine,  I mean they, they've got some pretty immediate results,..  you know, sometimes sugar too... </p>

<p>BLAIRE: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... pretty immediate.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Well, in some cases with the food  like when people in AA or NA say, you take the first drink and it's like, "Ah," it's that "Ah" relief ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: ... you know.  And in being sober I get that "ah" feeling... usually from meetings.  When I go into a meeting . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: ... It's that same kind of "Ah" relief feeling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: . . . but sometimes eating gives me the same thing.  It's the same kind of, you know, when I'm very stressed out and I purposefully overeating... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm. I think most of us kind of identify with that problem... like say, an drug addict, but the momentary "ah" you get has pretty big price tag on it (chuckles)... </p>

<p>BLAIRE: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and so it's the same with the eating addiction.  So what we  want to do is to find other ways to get the "ah" feeling... that feeling of relief...  like you found by going to meetings, and we've kind of made a list for Kim too.  I still remember, I've been sober, you know, 32 years and I still remember what that first swallow of wine feels like as it goes through your cells and every cell in your body starts to slowly relax.  And you just can sigh a sigh of relief. I still can remember that.  But you know what?  But the consequences for the rest of the story were so profound, that I just had to find another way to get that "ah" you know, but I totally got what your talking about and I think most of us do.  But, again, getting out of  denial that, that  "ah" from the eating addiction or from a particular food you eat, doesn't carry a big price tag is important 'cause it too carries a really big price tag on our self-respect, on our self-esteem and on our body and our weight.  In the last couple of minutes of group, does anybody have anything they've got coming up this week that we want to make sure that you have a plan to walk through or support to walk through?</p>

<p> KIM: (laughs) With the food no, I don't have any place to cook at the bed and breakfast... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you eating out all of your meals?  Or... </p>

<p>KIM: Well, actually... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... do you have a little fridge or what?</p>

<p>KIM: ... the place I'm in, they kind of have breakfast... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>KIM: ... so, it's figuring out lunch and dinner... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>KIM: ... and actually, tonight for dinner, I just had a bowl of cereal in my room, I just got some milk on the way home... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>KIM: ... so, normally I never have cereal for dinner but I wanted to make this call and I was late from work and all that.  And then, I'm actually starting to do my bigger meal out at lunch. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>KIM: And then I'd like to get a bunch of salad I guess, and have it here for dinner I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, do you have a fridge there at the, at the B-n-B)?</p>

<p>KIM: Pardon?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A fridge.  Do you have a fridge?</p>

<p>KIM: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>KIM:  I don't have any kind of fridge here... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.  So if you picked up a salad, you'd need to eat it that night?</p>

<p>KIM: Well, you know, a lot of the lettuce, and the fruits and vegetables I could keep for three days or whatever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>KIM: And then I have, you know, peanut butter and bread.  So that's all I was thinking of just having a light dinner, I don't know how satisfying it would be but it seems like okay, 'cause it probably. . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like for the first couple of days that's the best way to do it, is to keep it really simple.Since you've made a commitment, I think you said you're going to stay there 30 days, right?  Or about that... </p>

<p>KIM: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... then you probably do want to brainstorm a little bit more of what's going to work.  Maybe you can get a cooler from home so that, you know, you can have things a little bit refrigerated.  </p>

<p>KIM: Yeah, that's true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do have one in the garage at home, or storage?</p>

<p>KIM: Yeah.  Actually, yeah, and there is ice here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.  I definitely would see about.</p>

<p>KIM: Yeah.  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm just going to encourage you to check in more often.  Do you have your laptop there?  Or do you have only the computer at work?</p>

<p>KIM: I only have it at work ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>KIM: ... I can't get online...I couldn't get the conference line number earlier but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>KIM: ... but I did find it.  But I would like to make another appointment with you this week, if I could, Josephine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.  You can stay on the line after group and I'll grab my book,  but I suggest that you kind of check in by e-mail with us.  Maybe to, you know, to do a little synopsis for yourself too.</p>

<p>KIM: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... So alright you guys... I think you guys all ready got the invitation for next week, didn't you?</p>

<p>KIM: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>BLAIRE: Yeah.</p>

<p>NATALIA: Right... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  So... </p>

<p>HEATHER: ... you going to be sending out the worksheets too?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going to send out the step one and I'll put a little direction on how to use, step one, two and three, so I'll be sending them all out.  And then I'll be sending out the next homework assignment.</p>

<p>KIM: Oh, great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright, you guys... </p>

<p>HEATHER: Josephine, can I ask you something really quickly?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>HEATHER: You've mentioned the tormentor voice, the best friend voice and the little girl voice of the addiction uses... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>HEATHER: ... are those in your book? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.  No.  They're not in my DDD book, but they are in the workbook.The concept actually came from watching the movie "A Beautiful Mind" about schizophrenia?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and I just think it's the best representation of an eating addiction I've ever seen.  Even though, it's talking about schizophrenia.  Did you see the movie?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yup.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: . . . I think it was beautifully done as well, because you don't kind of get right away that the tormentor character and that best friend and that little girl are really his schizophrenia.  The film portrayed as if they're real people.And in a way... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... that's our addiction, feels like it's real to us... it feels LIKE it's us and recovery is about realizing it's not real, it's just the addiction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.  Yeah.</p>

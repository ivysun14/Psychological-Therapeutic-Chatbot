<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>[00:00:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm talking too much. Yeah. That's it.</p>

<p>[Interposing]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, I mean, they're both signed, I just want to–if you leave the real ones and I'll take the photocopy ones.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Okay. Great. And the treatment contract was clear?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great. Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was fine. And you've got the intake form that I did?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Yes. No, I got that, you know, before we met the first time. Or no, right after–</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right after I did it, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. No problem at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, how are you doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, I'm doing okay. Doing a little better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah. It could be–I think I got a lot of stress relief when I turned in my thesis last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And presented it. Thank you. So, I think that relieved a little bit of stress. Um, just the line of communication between me and my girlfriend's been a lot easier. Um, we communicate almost every day, but I think the day-to-day interaction where we don't communicate, I think is kind of helping a little bit.</p>

<p>[00:01:00]</p>

<p>Um, I started soccer last week as well. Or no, this week. So–no, last week. I don't know day it is. So yeah, so, I mean, part of that's, you know, been going really good. Um, but yeah, I mean, overall, things are starting to look good. Uh, and kind of had a little setback on Saturday with my girlfriend cause she did attend a family event with me. It's like an annual Christmas party.</p>

<p>And you know, we stayed there and–you know, I stayed back in the house with her, you know, overnight. And it was just tough because that we–you know, we each have a drink or two, and then, the emotions just came out about how, you know, we have this act on in front of people of how everything is fine. And working. And in reality, it's not. And I think that kind of bothered her a little bit. I kind of regret taking her now because I don't know if they moved too fast or, you know, if not, but she kept telling me it was fine, but really I don't know if it was fine or not.</p>

<p>[00:02:15]</p>

<p>Um, I mean, there's a lot of things that, you know, but we're hesitant to do. Just because, you know, it is–and our situation, it's kind of like we're just dating again. Well, at least I feel like that, is we're just dating again, and I kind of want to take things slowly again. But I don't want to jump into things where, like, everything is okay. And then, the mixed signals are sent in. Where you know, I start feeling bad like well, why did we do that? I mean, I invited her just because, you know, I–if she said yes, I wanted her to be there. You know, I mean, and then of course, she said yes, and I brought her and I thought everything was fine.</p>

<p>[00:02:58]</p>

<p>But then again, you know, after jumping into the situation, you see, you know, what's going on. How, you know, in reality, it's a good cover-up from the reality of, you know, there's still issues that need to be worked out. I do think the timing of this was better than Thanksgiving because Thanksgiving, our separation was really fresh. And it just totally would've been awkward in my eyes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you move out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I moved out–the Sunday–so, the 24th is a Thursday, right? Thursday, 16. I moved out the 11th. November 11–12. Twelfth or thirteenth of November. The weekend before Christ–uh, Thanksgiving. But not the week of, so it wasn't that Sunday, it was like the Sunday–yeah. So, it was two weeks before Thanksgiving, I moved out.</p>

<p>[00:04:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what–it sounds like you guys weren't getting along for a while, but what led up to your specifically moving out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Again, it was like what I, you know, wanted to talk–what I was talking about last week was in my mind, I thought it was the right thing to do. I never really thought–well, and here's the messed up thing is when we first, you know, when we had our disagreement, and it all started off that I was going to move home for a little bit just to clean my head. And then, I went back the next day and just grabbed all my shit. And I left. Because in my mind, I thought that was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And–and I'm sure it was just a total shock to her. Um, I just don't know where it came from. You know, like I said to you last week, I kind of just like blackout and I don't really know what I'm thinking. I just do stuff.</p>

<p>[00:05:01]</p>

<p>And then, after it happens, and I figure out all the pieces of it, I have to then [chuckles], you know, go what the heck was going on? Because, you know, in my mind, like, I was physically doing it, I remember doing it, but in my mind, I don't know why I did it. It was just maybe a reactionary thing, I don't know. That's why, you know, when we're talking I'm trying to find the middle point. As opposed to just making reaction decisions, having stuff come out and then, dealing with the consequences.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know when you're just reacting without thinking, what you might be reacting to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. And I always wondered this, too. I don't know if there's like trigger words, or like tone of voice. Or something that just triggers me. Because a little bit of background from my family is there's like trigger words for, like, my mother that really sets her off.</p>

<p>[00:06:05]</p>

<p>Like, there's certain words where you just mention it or names, or people, it–it's over. It's done, the explosion starts. My older brother, same thing. With me, I just wish I could identify them. I mean, me being the other person, I can identify with my mother and with my brother with what they are. But, you know, when it's yourself, you usually–you can't identify them. Because you're like I don't do that. That's not me. I never did that. I don't know what you're talking about. You know? But I kind of feel now that, you know, I've had time to look back on it, I've had, you know, time to analyze it. I kind of look back at the words that trigger, you know, me with her. And, you know, a lot of it has to do with her job, and the fact that I do have a lot of anger towards it.</p>

<p>[00:07:03]</p>

<p>And the people that she works with. So looking back on it, that was part of our ma–like, most of our fights was because of her work. A lot of it has to do with her just questioning why, you know, I choose to do the things I do when there's no, um, reward or compensation for it. I guess you'd say. Um, because I do a lot of volunteer work for athletics. And then, I think that just, you know, irritate–it irritated her a little bit. And I got really defensive.</p>

<p>Um, I guess it's things that I'm passionate about that just triggers stuff in my mind. Do I know why they go off? No. But there's–after looking at it, there's definitely a trigger that just [snaps] it snaps.</p>

<p>[00:08:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, is it being questioned? Is that part of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's part of it, yes. Definitely being questioned. Um, certain words, certain people that I've had bad experiences with, again, probably going back to the loyalty. Going back to the trust, how I give, you know, everything I have to people. And when that is gone, gaining that sort of loyalty/trust back, um, is really difficult. I know her and our situation right now is the reason I have been–had been pushing her away, and you know, kind of a little bit don't trust her is because I felt like I was–you know, not trusted. I couldn't trust anyone at my whole company. I felt anyone associated with that company after, you know, mentioning–I did report my boss for stealing from the company, and then, it turned out for them attacking me when I thought it was the right thing.</p>

<p>[00:09:03]</p>

<p>So, I think maybe automatically in my head, it triggered anybody that's associated with that company is not trustworthy. They're not loyal to me. And I–I think that's where the anger comes in. Do I want that? No. Do I want to be able to move on? Yes. Can I right now? Honestly? No. I cannot. I have a lot of anger towards that company, towards the people there. And then, it kind of sucks because, you know, in a way, I do have that anger towards my girlfriend a little bit. Which I don't know, I don't want to feel that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's she's part of the group that betrayed you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Correct.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of guilt by association?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Correct. And I do feel that because she is still loyal to them. Because I mean, it's not that she's loyal like that, but she's loyal to the fact where she still works with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she–so that her loyalty to them will sort of undermine her loyalty to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To me? A little bit because I don't have the–they weren't loyal to me. They stabbed me in the back.</p>

<p>[00:10:16]</p>

<p>They, you know, did things behind my back where I thought I could keep stuff, you know, that was in a concealed room. That I thought I was doing the right thing as a person. And they made me realize that, you know, I was just another fly on the wall, and they truly didn't care. And everything they talk about, you know, about how important you are to the company and to the business was a crock.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, that you felt ultimately like you were expendable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much. Pretty much. And in a way, I kind of feel like I'm being mocked. Because it's still all around. Like, all the people that, you know, did all this to me. She still works with. It's just like they have a job now. But like, I know I'm in school for the better, it's what I want to do, but I don't have any income either.</p>

<p>[00:11:08]</p>

<p>And I feel that that opportunity was taken away from me. I don't know if I really wanted to pursue insurance because I never really got the opportunity because of the way I was treated, and, you know, just the situation I was put in. I–you know, and now that I look back on it, I definitely am in school doing my internship associating with what I'm going to be doing. I realize now that I could not be a part of that.</p>

<p>But back when this was all happening to me, when I was working for the company, when the turmoil was coming against me, I–you know, I just didn't feel anything. I was trying to look for a new job, I didn't do it. You know, and I kind of felt down in the dumps because everyone said well, you need experience for this job.</p>

<p>[00:12:03]</p>

<p>And my argument was well, I can't get experience unless you give it to me. And I kind of felt like I was down a dead-end street, where it was just so frustrating where I was staying at work, even though I didn't want to, for a paycheck. And to me, that's not what work's about. If you're not passionate about what you do, or passionate about, you know, the people you work with and who you work with and, you know, what your goals are, then, it's not–it's not worth, you know, being there.</p>

<p>And believe me, I tried leaving. I tried leaving for, you know, a year and a half. And I had nothing. I had interviews, had nothing. And a lot of it had to do with money because I was just making a ton of money. Well, not a ton of money, but you know, above average salary for a person in my position. And that was difficult. That was really difficult.</p>

<p>[00:13:01]</p>

<p>So, [sighs], I just–I need to work on myself, I need to work on letting go of this anger. This–you know, and trying to find the trigger words, or trigger words, phrases, people, you know, stuff that just makes me snap. And when I say snap, I mean, I know what I'm doing physically, but subconsciously, I have no recollection of it. I know the events that unfold, but if you ask me what I was thinking, it's not clear. It's not clear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long do you feel you've had this anger for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, probably–I've left there for a year, probably two and a half, maybe th–yeah, probably two and a half, two years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about even before the job? It sounds like you feel like you've had anger for a long time.</p>

<p>[00:14:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I–well, again, I've–and yeah. I do have a lot of anger. I have a–I've probably had it for most of my life. It's not that if I don't get my way, I'm not angry at that. It's just if–I guess you're right, I guess even, you know, when I was a little kid, when people say trigger words, I just get angry. And want nothing to do with it. I know, I may seem like I'm running around, but I really think that experience with my grandmother and my mother really might've affected me, too.</p>

<p>Where just seeing the nastiness of my grandmother towards my mother. And I kind of–now that you mention it, I kind of put the two together a little bit as how she was nasty to my mother. And pretty much just, you know, put my mother on that side of her life. And I–believe it or not, now that, you know, I've had time to think about it, and since our first session, I know it's–it had only been one session.</p>

<p>[00:15:04]</p>

<p>But I thought about how–that's how I am with people. It's people that I really don't care about, I lash out at them, let them know, you know, what I think. And that's it. And then, I sort of just avoid them, and act like they're dead. And I can see where that's coming from, maybe, you know, back in the day that's–that–that trauma really was what bothered me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it was coming from–because–yeah. It sounds like when you say where it was coming from, it seems like complicated. It could be coming from several different places.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It couldn't come–it could be–that could be one of them. But I can see the tendencies where it could come from that situation. Where my grandmother was really angry at my mom, yelled at my mom, called her every name in the book. I'm a little, you know, six, seven-year-old kid downstairs, nobody knew I was down there listening to this. And then, the next thing you know, my grandmother's not around in my life.</p>

<p>[00:16:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, is this your dad's mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Okay. I just wanted to make sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It was my dad's mother. I had a really close relationship with my mom's mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she just–and did your dad's mom just basically disappear? Or what happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She didn't disappear, she lived next–she lived next door to us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what was frustrating and–kind of after that, I mean, it was kind of like forced because we used to be, you know, it was weird because we'd go to my mom's mother's house for dinner every Saturday night and everybody would be there. But then, when we go to my dad's mom's on Sunday night, it was kind of like forced for us because after this incident, you know, and then, her not coming to our birthday parties, it was really difficult. You know, having–like, you'd have a birthday, you know, say on, you know, a Wednesday or a Thursday, you'd have a party on Saturday, but you'd have to go to your grandmother's house on Sunday.</p>

<p>[00:17:02]</p>

<p>And then, she'd give you your gift.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you would go every Sunday to eat there, but anything–that was the only contact you had?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Only contact. I would not go out of my way to go and see my grandmother. Which, I mean, was weird that she lived across the street. I never thought of it. But it was funny, like, when I got a car, I'd always go to–you know, I'd always want to go see my mom's mom. You know, because I loved the way she like taught me how to cook, she taught me how to pick out groceries, you know, stuff like that. It was just–I had those grandmother/grandson experiences with my mom's mom. I just felt my dad's mom never offered that to us. She did a little bit. But not to the extent as my mom's mom. My mom's mom always made us feel like she did care about us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, do you feel that it was like your mom and your dad sort of communicated that it wasn't okay to reach out to your grandmother? Or was it all your grandmother just saying, you know, basically, get away?</p>

<p>[00:18:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't–[sighs]. My dad forced us–well, he tried–I can't say that he forced us, but he tried to get us to have that relationship with his mom. It wasn't as emotional as my grandmother on my mom's side. But [sighs], I don't know, it's really difficult and confusing when it comes to that because I don't–I don't really have many emotions towards, you know, my grandmother or my dad's mom. I really don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you get the sense that he was unhappy with how things were?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did. I really did, and I think that's why he did it. Is I think that he felt bad, but then again, like I said last week, I never felt the fact that he tried to defend us. Or tried to defend, you know, my brothers and my sisters.</p>

<p>[00:19:02]</p>

<p>My dad was always there, he was a great dad. But he never, well, at least I never witnessed him trying to defend us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And defend you against? I'm not sure I'm clear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Defend in the fact that how hurtful she was towards us. I mean, when you have children ranging from four to nine, and their grandmother's never coming to their birthdays, and your dad's just like well, she's not coming.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's sort of complacent, he's–</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: –not doing anything about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's not doing anything about it. And I guess that was–that's really frustrating. You know, it's the point we're like well, my–I mean, how is my dad okay with it? I don't know if he was, I don't know if it upset him or not. Um, I know my mother didn't care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She didn't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She didn't care. She–but I mean, the offer was always extended. She was always invited to our parties, to my knowledge. And never came.</p>

<p>[00:20:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, she wouldn't come to your house at all, it would just be you coming there every Sunday and that's it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think it was sort of on principle for her? Like, I'm not–you know, they can come to me, but I'm not going to them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Because my grandma's old school, very stubborn. Um, she is a very tough woman. You know, she grew up, you know, she managed a restaurant for 30 years. You know, my–my grandparents had a restaurant, you know, in downtown Providence. She used to deal with all the drunks and all that stuff. So, she was a very tough woman.</p>

<p>But when it comes to family, it's different because she treats my dad's sister's kids differently than she treats my dad's kids and my dad's brother's kids. There's like a pecking order. It goes my dad's sisters kids are one, two, three. My dad's brother's kids are four, five. And then, we're six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Which–it's frustrating.</p>

<p>[00:21:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And did she show that pecking order by her not attending your part–like where did you get–how does that pecking order manifest?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just because that's all she talks about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is the other–</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's never proud of any of our accomplishments. Um, whenever we, you know, we'd graduate college or do any of that stuff, she would–she would always acknowledge my cousins. And, you know, not really, you know, want to celebrate with us. Um, she constantly ridicules us, just, you know, brings a negative spin to us all the time. I don't think I've heard many positives from my grandmother towards my siblings or myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And is your dad around for these sort of–</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. He is. And he–he snapped once. And then, my mother snapped, you know, a little while back because she does say these hurtful things, and there was only so long that we could–it was only a matter of time before, you know, people's breaking point would happen.</p>

<p>[00:22:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And was it about you and your siblings, or was it also about your dad and mom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think–and this is what I've been told, so I don't know, so I kind of have the one version of it. Is my mom told me that she believes that my grandmother tried to get my mom and dad divorced. Because she just wanted my dad to get married and have kids. And then, she wanted him back. Because my dad was pretty much the provider for my grandmother after my grandfather died. So, I mean, what does that mean? Well, my dad paid all the bills, you know, he shoveled her driveway, cut her grass. You know, she had an in-ground pool, she, you know, had all this stuff that my dad took care of. She needed stuff, you know, worked on on the house, my dad paid for it.</p>

<p>[00:23:01]</p>

<p>You know, stuff like that. So, when I guess that was taken away from her, I guess, I don't know, maybe she felt jealous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's what it sounded like to me. Like, she was almost competitive with your mom, like she wanted her son back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And that's what I hear it was, too. And I look at it and I can see that. I can see that. But I mean, then again, there are tendencies where I kind of felt like I was let down as–as a kid. You know, because, you know, every kid, I don't know, you know, if most people feel the same way I do, but you want that relationship with your grandparents. Because usually, your grandparents are proud of like what you do and it's part of the lifecycle.</p>

<p>I mean, I'm a big fan of history. And I just look back at all of the old Christmas like home videos and stuff like that. I'm like the 50s, 60s of how families are together and they seem happy. I mean, nowadays you don't see that. There's no family orient now. Everybody goes their own way.</p>

<p>[00:24:06]</p>

<p>And, I don't know. I just–I just think I'm always constantly confused, and there's just stuff going, you know, there's stuff that's just out of my control. And like I do say I do have triggers that just set me off. I don't want them. Or I want to learn to be able to control them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel that your parents gave you that positive feedback that your grandmother didn't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I–and my girlfriend told me this, and I realize it because in the household that I'm in now, there's a lot of negativity. There's not much positive. And I guess when you're around a negative environment all the time, it's hard to put positives on things.</p>

<p>[00:25:01]</p>

<p>And it's a constant struggle to try and be positive. To try and be the one to bring the positive attitude to the household, to my siblings, to my mom, to my dad. [Chuckles] I guess you do take on the personality of your parents when, you know, you're surrounded by it all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are your parents negative about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, well, my mother's negative about, you know, my cousins. My dad's sister's kids. My mom and my dad's sister do not get along at all. It's–it's noted that they hate each other. Um, my aunts made up lies about my mom. And that's what started the fight with my grandmother was she told my grandmother that my mother didn't invite her kids to my little brother's party, which was a total lie.</p>

<p>My aunt is canaving–conniving. Whatever it is. [Chuckles]. She does lie a lot. But then again, I see myself lying an awful lot. I don't–I don't know if it is hereditary or what. But I catch myself, you know, constantly lying.</p>

<p>[00:26:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anything. Saying I did stuff that I didn't do. Not saying I did stuff when I did it. Saying stuff happened this way when it didn't. When it does happen the way that it's supposed to happen, I tell it like that. And then, I guess what I'm trying to get at now is–now that I said it is I have a very, like, weird personality where I'm constantly joking. And like, you know, make jokes and say things happen when they didn't. But when I'm serious, people have a hard time taking me seriously. And I think that's part of, you know, my struggle now, too.</p>

<p>[00:27:01]</p>

<p>It is–I do like to joke, I do like to laugh but when I need to be serious, I'm not taken seriously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And do you think that's because you joke a lot, people don't realize when you want to be taken seriously?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's part of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the other part?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, part of it is when they do find out that I said something that wasn't true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can't–it's hard not saying that stuff. I guess. I guess there's no filter for me lying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it follow like different trends? Like, do you lie about things that you're ashamed of? Or is it just like feel really random?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like a little bit of both. Um, I guess I learned as [inaudible 0:27:47] because I was constantly in trouble. Um, I was–I was very rebellious. Um, I was constantly doing things I wasn't supposed to do. [Chuckles], um, I was, you know, as a student, I was always in the principal's office, always getting in trouble, stuff like that. Um, just doing things out of curiosity, I guess.</p>

<p>[00:28:09]</p>

<p>And then, I tried to weasel my way out of it. So, I guess it is random, but part of it's planned. Um, if there was a plan where I really wanted something, and knew I couldn't have it, but tried to take it anyway, I just say I didn't know. But I knew what I was doing. You know? It's kind of that, you know, twisted thing a little bit where you know what you're doing, you know that it's wrong, but you do it anyway. And then, try to play dumb. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Laughing].</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And I, as an adult, I've done that to people. I really have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When? Or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I used to do it in college all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you do?</p>

<p>[00:28:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, people asked me if I had stuff I ain't never said I had it. Or like when I'd get in trouble with like booze or drugs, that's not mine. What do you mean? It was in your room. How do I know how it got there?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you're also trying to stay out of jail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a good motivation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. But I used to do–and this is where my thinking comes in, too. When I was at parties, and you know, if the cops came, I'd hide the drugs in the other people's house. Because the cops came, but I'd only hide it in a place where I knew. So, if they had any suspicion at all and they found it, and I'd say that's not my problem, that's their problem now.</p>

<p>Because I guess I was always looking out for my back, I guess, you know, there's kind of a way where I only trust me. Um, to the point where I'm always looking out for me when I did put myself out there for others, I kind of got screwed over. So, I do have a hard time opening up. A little bit, which [sighs] is difficult, I guess.</p>

<p>[00:30:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it seems like you do just fine here opening up. You seem very candid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do because I want help. Because this is all the stuff that I want. If I was just sitting here when–and it's actually funny, I'm in a class right now called group dynamics. We're talking about group therapy groups. If I was in a group therapy group session, like, you know, the ones that we acted out and–I probably wouldn't open up as much. I would tell bits and pieces, not all. Just because I think there's a comfort level where I'm more comfortable speaking one-on-one than opposed to big groups about very personal stuff.</p>

<p>Um, it's even funny because I can't really open up, you know, and I don't know why–why this is it because, you know, you know, talking about the lying, when I meet one-on-one–or not meet–but when I talk one-on-one with my parents or my girlfriend, I don't tell them everything. I should be able to have that relationship where I can.</p>

<p>[00:31:18]</p>

<p>And I want it to be that way, it's perceived to be that way, but it's not. Um, there's certain things I won't tell them. And there's other things I will. But I'll twist it a little bit. Um, going back to the drug issue. My parents never knew I was on drugs. I mean, when I was snorting so much cocaine that I was constantly snorting, my parents thought I had a cold. And the next thing you know, I have cold medicine.</p>

<p>[Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which when you're snorting coke, cold medicine doesn't do anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It doesn't. It doesn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's pretty ineffective.</p>

<p>[00:32:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And that's–you know, that's what it was is my parents thought I had a cold, or I'd tell them I had allergies. They didn't know what I was doing. They didn't have a clue what I was doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But in general, people aren't born feeling like they better watch their back, or look out for themselves. I mean, I imagine that it comes from a sense of feeling well, nobody else was going to be looking out for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's true, too. And I get a sense of feeling where I kind of feel like I have to be a leader. So, I do have a lot of followers. And I don't want to let people down. Like, I feel like if me is supposed to be the example, if I get taken out or if I show any kind of weakness, I–I just don't know because I've never let that happen. Do I want it to happen? Absolutely. I do want to show that I am, you know, a human being. I do have these feelings. I do understand what's going on, but do I know how to express it? No.</p>

<p>[00:33:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Would I like to figure out how to? Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm just [sighs], I guess I'm just like, I don't know. I do have some trust issues that I am trying to work on. There is only one person I trust, you know, with everything. And that's not even a sibling or my parents. You know? Just because I feel that, you know, we have that bond where we connect, and I have opened up to him a little bit, he knows it. So, I guess that's it. I guess I'm also looking for that third party comfort because I can't go to my parents or my siblings because they're going to, you know, always sugarcoat it and tell me what they want to hear.</p>

<p>[00:34:10]</p>

<p>And support me, and tell me, you know, all the positives that I need to hear. But with this person, I can say that, you know, he tells me how it is, he tells me if I'm F'd up, I'm F'd up. He tells me, you know, to move on and just not let things bother you, and just, you know, tries to, you know, he kind of keeps me on the path that, you know, as hopefully balancing stuff. And I feel like I opened up to him because he is a friend, and–but he's not a friend where he's, you know, constantly consulting.</p>

<p>Excuse me. He is part of–excuse me. He is, you know, giving me the tough love. Where he's a realist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who is this?</p>

<p>[00:35:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is a guy I coach with. Um, he's also a cop. So, you know, he's known a lot about me even growing up. Because he was a cop in my town. And he's one of my really good friends. And he just, you know, he tells me how it is. He keeps everything real.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You like that honesty.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. I do. I do like people being blunt with me, too. I get to the point where I want people to challenge me. Like he does, and not back down. Where if I do something that pisses him off, he'll tell me about it. And, you know, he'll jab at me, he won't talk to me. And then, I have to go crawling back to him, you know, and it's tough to find him because he's just like you know what? Forget you. I think I need that. I think that's part of me what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>[00:35:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like tough love.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tough love. I agree. Um, and–and my girlfriend and I had this conversation the other day where she feels that, you know, I take advantage of her because I feel that she is weak, in a sense, where I can explode on her, do all these things, and she won't challenge me. She won't challenge me. And to me, knowing that, you know, what I know, what I've been dissecting, I don't want that. In order for us to be compatible and to succeed, I need her to challenge me and have a tough foot. And give me the tough love.</p>

<p>Um, I guess growing up, you know, and even now, like I live sometimes off intimidation. Where I know if I can–I guess it's part of the competitiveness with me in sports. If there's an advantage I have over you, I'm going to expose it until you fix it.</p>

<p>[00:37:06]</p>

<p>So, I guess [sighs]... I guess that is, you know, like what I do. And I never noticed it before, but after she mentioned it, I did trigger it, I'm like yeah. You know, a lot of our arguments will be where I'll be the dominant one. And I would get no pushback. And then, you know, I'd just watch her feel guilty about herself, and you know, cry and do all this stuff like she was the problem. But it wasn't her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you get pushback from either of your parents?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Not like I'd like. Because it's–it's just not there. It's not what I'm looking for, it's not real. Like, in–you know, like if I tell them something happened, and they try to tell me well, why don't you–you know, it's just a shouting match. I'm not looking for a shouting match–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are they shouting about?</p>

<p>[00:38:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just–I don't know. To be honest. Like, there's just constantly yelling, like, the other day, my mother yelled at me because I didn't get in the shower. She was waiting for me to get in the shower.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's random.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has she always been like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. She has been to an extent, but like lately, like, my grandmother–my mom just–I really am concerned about her health because she's just very, you know, aggressive. Just, and I mean, she'll be calm as anything one time, and then you say something, and the next thing you know, she's down your throat. And I am really concerned because she does have high blood pressure, you know, she does have, you know, a disease that runs in our family, but it's just like well, because you're mad about something else, why are you getting mad at me?</p>

<p>[00:39:09]</p>

<p>You know? It's just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like you're upset, you come home you're upset from work, and you kick the dog.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The dog didn't do anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. That's–and that's what it is. Like, you can't have a conversation and then, I guess, it's kind of like me though, too because, you know, in my household, my mom–and I say this to her all the time and this is what she gets pissed off about is I tell her she needs a hobby. Because she sits around and thinks about all the negativity that's going on in her life. And it just constantly builds and builds, and builds, and builds, and then when we get home, it explodes a little bit. But not all of it. So, whatever she exploded, if no one's there to talk to her, it builds again, it builds again, it's builds again, and then, it erupts again on whoever else is there.</p>

<p>[00:40:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do your siblings live with your parents, too? Or are they out of the house?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My older brother and my younger brother never moved, they were always there. I just–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. And so, they still live there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just recently moved back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I know. I know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my sister's having health issues, so she's moving back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it's...kind of chaotic because I didn't think I was moving back into this situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how old is your older brother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My older brother is 30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's never moving out of the house?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Never moved out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's pretty unusual in the–well, at least in this country.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, my older brother had kind of a problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does he have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He kind of was like me. Was into drugs problem. But he got into the–more debt than I did. I never did stuff I couldn't pay for. He, on the other hand, had the different gene where he had a lot of debt he had to pay off. And he's still kind of paying that off now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he had never move–I mean, he wasn't like out at a fancy place because he's still living at home.</p>

<p>[00:41:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he's still living at home. It's not like that now. But my brother used to be, you know, me with my paychecks, I'd spend, you know, probably a quarter to half of it and keep the rest for myself for savings. Where he'd spend all of it. And there'd be nothing left for savings. And then, he'd still use credit cards and spend that more that he could afford, so. And then, my younger brother just, you know, he was–he was the baby, so–I mean, he's still 24. I mean, people like well, it's time to move on, but he's another one who just, you know, he's been in trouble with the law.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did he do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was arrested for driving while intoxicated, and he got, um, arrested for possession of marijuana.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aside from you and your siblings, does drug use run in your family at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who else?</p>

<p>[00:42:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: My older cousin got bagged for selling and using. Um, my other cousin got arrested for distributing. And my other cousin, I don't know if she got arrested, but she was involved in it. And this–their drug use is strictly on my dad's side. I don't know any of my cousins on my mom's side that, you know, had drug problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's your generation, not the older generation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about alcohol use on the older generation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: See, we don't really abuse it though. I mean, I–from my experience, it was more towards the narcotics. As opposed to alcohol.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's striking to have so many people in–I mean, sort of things run in the family kind of, but–I mean, not kind of. But to have so many of your siblings and your cousins using and dealing, it's really like–it sort of sounds like a family business.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That–well, but you know what though? It wasn't. It was all individually based.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's–right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my oldest cousin that was doing it, he's three years older than my older brother–no, five–six years older than my older than my older brother, and nine years older than me. Ten years older than my younger brother. My</p>

<p>[00:43:23]</p>

<p>My other cousin is ten months older than me, three years younger than my older brother–two years younger than my older brother. And then, my cousin, she is same age–a couple months older than my little brother, and a year and a half younger than me. So, it was like all different ages. But again, it was all within my grandmother's, like, her grandchildren was from what I understand, the ones with the drug problems.</p>

<p>As far as alcohol abuse goes, it's not like my girlfriend's where everybody goes to events for family, and is smashed.</p>

<p>[00:44:06]</p>

<p>The only time we do it is, you know, maybe weddings. But like, at like Christmas, any of that, we'll have a cocktail or two, that's it. We will not abuse the alcohol. But it is weird because I used to go to family parties all high as anything. My brother, too. I don't know if my cousins were not, but it's weird. You know, and that's what my mother jokes about is, you know, drugs run in the [CLIENT LAST NAME] family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she joking? Is it a putdown, too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's reality.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, so sometimes people speak the truth and it's the truth. But sometimes people speak the truth, but they say it in a condescending way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what? It is–it probably is in a condescending way, but it is reality, that's how I take it.</p>

<p>[00:45:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Is she trying to kind of put your dad's family down when she says that? I guess that's–</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think there's a lot of hostility towards my dad's family. And I think it's just another negative to add towards his family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And all that hostility toward your dad, too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. They say they're happy, but I mean, yeah, they're happy, but they have like any argument that anybody would have. I mean, they've been together 36 years. So, I mean, I guess it's normal to have some hostility towards someone. After being together that long. I mean, I really can't answer that. I mean, I can just go by what I see and, you know, I hadn't seen enough in six months, and now I, you know, I'm constantly run around with my own life. So, I don't see that. But the times I do see them, they are happy, but then there is times where I see them where my mom's just constantly ridiculing.</p>

<p>[00:45:59]</p>

<p>You know, a perfect example, my grandmother's house, my cousin lives in there. My cousin is currently on probation for seven years for something he did. He's not allowed to leave the state. Not allowed to do anything. He's living at my grandma's house for free. Which really aggravates my mom. Why, I have no idea. Um, to the fact that, you know, back in the day, my brothers and I inquired about living there, and we were told no. Not by my family, my parents. They didn't want to get into it. Fine, no big deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Both your mom and your dad? Or just your mom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, my mom said–my mom said no, my dad went along with my mom and said no. We're not going to do that. I said okay. And then, my cousin does it and we kind of get pissed off. We're like what the hell? If I knew I could've had a house to live in for free, I would've done that, too. You know? It's kind of like, you know, it's kind of like my dad's been walked over his whole life by his family.</p>

<p>[00:47:01]</p>

<p>And it's just like more and more, like, I kind of feel like we're getting walked over, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, "Patient C", I just realized we're going to need to stop–</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay. Wow. That was fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it go fast? Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. That was fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Laughs]. Well, we'll see each other next week. Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Definitely. Did you think about price? Same as last week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, wait, you said that you could afford 100.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm–I'm taking you up on your–you know–</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well, we can do 100 for–and did you look into the insurance?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you do have an HMO–right. You were right. So, it's not covered–</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not covered? That's fine. That's perfectly fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, yeah. So, you know, you tell me what you can do, and I believe you. And I have no reason to think–you know, just with a [inaudible 0:47:45], when I do reduce the fee, that if something's changed for you or whatever that we–</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Interposing] absolutely. I don't–and I'm just letting you know, I'm on unemployment. I–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I appreciate it. Finances are tight. You know?</p>

<p>[00:48:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't lie about that. I'm on unemployment. I don't know, you know, when the restaurant opens how much, if I'm going to eligible for unemployment. Um, and like I said, I will keep you informed with my finances.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're cool with the fee we discussed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Beautiful. Thank you. I appreciate that. Because that's really [inaudible 0:48:20].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and you can, you know, it's fine if you pay me today. And then, you–I think in my, um, treatment contract, I let you know that after this, you know, I'll just bill you, at the end of the month is fine. Unless you prefer to pay–I mean, it's up to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To me, to be honest with you, I can't go more than two weeks. Just because I'm on a budget like, $400 at the end of the month is a lot of money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. So, you'd rather do week to week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd rather week to week, that way I know it's–if that's alright with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine with me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I could do every two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever works for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Laughs]. Today is the fifth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you very much, Dr. Feldman. Looking forward to next week's session.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great. Take care. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Bye-bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

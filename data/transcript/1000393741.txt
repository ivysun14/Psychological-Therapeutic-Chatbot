<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence)  Just before you came out to get me I was thinking about something that had made me angry at school, and since I've come in (deep breath) I don't know, I— I guess I've been sort of wondering if that was the mood I was in all day.  I knew I was sort of feeling (clears throat) there's not that much longer left of school.  The play's two weeks away and then reports come soon after that, and I was feeling very much I want to be organized so I don't have a lot of last minute things.  But I don't know, I hadn't felt that I was particularly tense and feeling angry or anything, except this one thing made me extremely angry and, uhm, I'm not sure I know why.  What it was is that, uhm, because FBS and I are working together the same day for the play, but we have different plays, I suggested on Friday—, I had thought of the fact we'd better together and do costumes together, because we might have needs that are the same, so on Friday I mentioned to her that we should work together on it, and that maybe we should start thinking about it next week.  And, uhm, then today I'd spoken to the person who (clears throat) is in charge of dramatics and knows what the costumes are, and she has them spread out, so we'd have to probably get in touch with her anyway.  And she said she'd come tomorrow and work with us on it.  And as soon as I told FBS's assistant that, and as soo— FBS was out of the room then, and as soon as she returned she and her assistant went down to start getting costumes without a word to me.  And, uhm, I don't know, it just seemed so much—, I might have misunderstood things, but it just seemed so much 'I want to get there first and see what I can get and then we'll work together with Miss FDJ afterwards,' the dramatics teacher. And, uhm, I suppose I'm angry because my inclination is often, if I think of it first to do something like that and yet I hadn't done it this time, because it wouldn't be fair and we both might need the same thing.  And because I hadn't done it this time, I suppose that's why I'm really angry.  (pause)</p>

<p>So that, w_ I_, because I also had the feeling she hadn't even thought about questions yet, and so, I don't know, it seem like there might be something I—.  She took advantage of something she has an advantage over me now, and I gave her that advantage, and—.  Because I, I don't know, I do—, I think if I hadn't already had spoken to her about it and thought about it, I don't think I'd feel so angry.  I'd probably be more angry at myself for not having thought of it first.  (clears throat)  (pause)</p>

<p>And I think one reason why, whey I did think of it I didn't rush down and grab things is because I didn't want to feel that kind of piggy feeling that it gives you or— (exhales).  Or, I don't know, being out for myself and that's, eh, somehow very unpleasant and unfriendly and uncooperative and—.  After FBS did this it kind of makes me feel maybe I should be piggy or else I'm going to lose out.  And so it made me feel competitive, and then I feel I lost the first, the first advantage in being competitive.  (pause)</p>

<p>But I don't know, somehow up until this happened, and it surprised me because we are going on the same day, but I haven't really felt that competitive.  And I don't know exactly why, whether maybe I feel already I'm better at this than she.  Because last year, when we did it the same kind of way, we had different days and mine definitely went better.  And I think that was due then partly because she was copying my idea of how to do it, which was fine except she didn't—, she hadn't thought it out and didn't, I don't know, feel it as much as I had.  Because I had worked it out after having done more plays than she had at LKC.  So it meant more to me to do it the way I did.  But I think this year she feels it more so. I don't, I don't know whether it's I already think maybe I'd be better that I haven't felt so competitive, but—.  I've also had this feeling that I knew I could feel it, and I didn't want to.  But that means I don't want her to either.  And as soon as she does I can't control it anymore.  I don't have—, which I guess means I'm feeling really competitive anyway.</p>

<p>And then I think of—, because I always think of, at some point or other, of being pregnant or having a baby, if I'm thinking about being competitive now and—.  I'm not, uh, I'm not sure if this is why I did it, being in this mood today, but MSCZ, over the weekend kept saying he wanted me to go find out if I were pregnant and I kept thinking, "No, I want to put it off for a while."  So I don't think it's entirely because he was after me to check, but today I just—, when I got home I just suddenly decided that I was going to call and find out—.  I di—, I didn't know exactly how you went about finding out.  I thought you had to go and see the doctor.  Apparently you don't if you use—, just leave a urine specimen.  But in any case I wanted to definitely do something about finding out whether or not I was pregnant.  And it's the first time I've felt I really wanted to know.  Before when I've thought about wanting to know I've thought, "Well, do it as soon as school's out," or something like that.</p>

<p>And something else that just makes me think of it, too, saying when school's out.  But a_ also it was on my mind today, and again, I've mentioned it here before, that I'd thought of it, but I don't know, today it was on my mind in a different way.  I really wanted to now ask you about being—, if it would be possible to change the time once school is out.  And it—, after last week and the week before, just several weeks how I've been, that would be the last thing I would have asked you. (pause)</p>

<p>But then I think of that mood I was in this morning that certainly was anyway I wanted have my affairs in order, anything to do with my part of teaching.  Organize enough so I knew it was coming, and I knew what was happening and so forth and—.  So then I can think of it in terms of I want to know about, if I want to change the time, is it going to be possible, and i—.  So it becomes, I don't know, somewhat different from asking a favor of you.  I mean it is asking a favor of you, but it somehow, if I look at it that way much more self-centered.  Because somehow then the emphasis isn't on asking a favor it's on just what I want.  (pause)</p>

<p>And that makes me think of (exhales), well I remember Friday talking about how I felt and—, I think it was Friday and, uhm, thinking of my mother and my feeling being so close to my mother.  And then, I don't know whether it was this idea didn't enter the book until after I'd been talking about that here or whether I just began picking it up.  But over the weekend I kept thinking about something that may or may not be a universal thing in people's feelings, or at least I don't even know if it's psychologically sound, but it's a big point in this book about people's feelings toward their mother and toward nursing.  And all these patients this doctor's working with now seemed to have had a basic problem way back at that point, and anything else stems from that.</p>

<p>And I, I don't know, I keep thinking about that and then mixing up with (deep breath) thinking about intercourse and, oh thinking about the fact that when you're nursing It must seem to a child that it's the closest you can come to being part of another person, not being alone, being safe and all.  And that intercourse is sort of a substitute.  I mean that makes it sound less important than it is, but—.  And I don't know there just seemed to be a tie there and—.</p>

<p>And then I just began to wonder, well what feelings did I have, and I have such funny feelings about with my mother because I kept thinking, or I, I don't know I sort of didn't want to think about my mother over the weekend.  But I kept remembering that I was so puzzled at the end of Friday, because on the one hand I could feel just like her, and therefor understand to some extent how she was feeling, and yet on the other hand, have such violent feelings against her.  And yet also feel she was better than my father, and I don't know, it just (hesitates) made me—, I guess left me wondering.  And plus this other idea.  How do I feel about my mother really.  And I was thinking, too, of all these—, In this book all these patients—, any attitude they have about themselves stems from the mother's attitude way back at that time.  And it made me think how I've always attributed most of my feelings to my father.  (pause)</p>

<p>Except he wasn't around that much until so much later, I must have gotten something first from my mother.  And then I, I was just thinking, too, that before, oh I don't know, I don't know when I stopped having accidents, but my mother used to talk a lot about how when I was little I was always having accidents and she didn't think I'd live beyond the age of 6 or some—.  I mean if she—, n_ when she told about this later she'd pick some young age, so I must have always been hurting myself and— (clears throat).  Since I'm not necessarily clumsy.  I think I'm only clumsy when I'm—, something else is going on, like my being insecure or having some other feeling about myself, it just made me think—, it always has made me wonder why I had so many accidents all tho—, all those times.  (pause)</p>

<p>Also I don't, I don't know how much this could really matter, unless it kind of goes along with something you're feeling anyway from you parents or from your mother, but I know FYC was very antagonistic right from the start.  And at one point they had to get rid of the dog because FYC kept trying to get it to hurt me, and it would.  I mean it was the kind of animal she could have gotten to hurt me, and that was why they got rid of it.</p>

<p>And then I was just thinking of—, when I was thinking of accidents I was thinking of a time before we moved so I was a—, I think was a good deal under 5 ½.  We were playing a game,I don't know what exactly it was, something like hide-and-seek or something and—.  I was hiding behind a door, and FYC was hiding behind the door, and I came in and she shut the door out.  Anyway, she moved the door and it crashed into me and cut my face.  And somehow when I think of it now, I think of it as she had an evil intent in doing that.</p>

<p>Just like that time when I was sleeping alone on the third floor on the house we did move to and then I heard the noise I thought was FYC coming to tease me, because she was always teasing.  And somehow I think I felt—, because I used to take it and I used to go back for more, that I deserved what she did to me.  That FYC was better, and I don't know why I'd think that.  And of course FYC meanwhile thought that I was favored by my parents.  But of course my father's sister who had taken care of her was not asked to take care of me.  She was a nurse and, uhm, I think she was very angry about that and told FYC that I was favored.  So I don't know whether FYC felt that more from what my aunt said or whether she would have felt if anyway.  Because that's the way a child would feel it, too, when another baby's born or just what.  But it seems odd that both of us could feel that.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, for some reason I want to know what I thought it was like to be nursing z____, to remember, and just can't.  And all I can do is imagine how I think my mother would have been, and I can't imagine her being anything but very much on schedule, and that the schedule said at this time she nursed me for so many minutes, and that I better be on schedule.  No sense of relaxing and just enjoying it, which may be very untrue.  (clears throat)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But it may be explain why it's important to you to find out, uh, whether I'm going to hold you to your schedule.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean because I do have that feeling—</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  —about my mother?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you say you imagine how important that—</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   — that be and that that's the way she was. And earlier you were wondering, how am I?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  (pause)  Well, it is true, uhm, I didn't go through this today, but sometimes when I've thought about it I've had to fight myself to be rational in thinking there's absolutely no reason why I can't ask you.  Because if you could do it, and wanted to, there'd be no reason for you not to, except then the feeling I would be having was there's a schedule, and I don't have any right to try to change it.  (pause)</p>

<p>And that somehow you would just have, uhm, an emotional reaction against me if I asked.  (silence)</p>

<p>At first I was thinking about how it somehow seems to me it would be easier if you asked me when I'd like to come than for me just to state out of nowhere, or without your asking when I would like to come, but—.  I feel more presumptuous or something, just saying I want to come at this time.</p>

<p>And then I began to think about (deep breath) I don't know, one aspect of the mood I was in today, anyway, that I sort of was aware of at school that involved not wanting to be involved with any other teachers, not wanting them to be asking anything of me or, I don't know, somehow feeling the exact opposite that I want you to feel.  And it's sort of a vague thing.  I can't— (deep breath), I don't know, I'm not sure exactly what that feeling was except one thing in particular I know was part of it.  That when we were leaving school, eh, the boys were in the elevator, uhm, I always have trouble with them, because they can't stand to be squashed, and they won't take it.  They just, well, get very wiggly.  And they'll bother each other, and they're very tired and they always get very annoying physically each other when they're tired, whether—.  It's not, I don't think, so much to annoy me.  They just don't want to be so close together.  And, uh, so as a result, I get annoyed when other people try to get in the elevator beyond our class, because it's filled just with my class.</p>

<p>And today we stopped at the 1st grade floor, and there really weren't that many—.  There was a mother and a boy who goes by bus, and so they always give them to one of the f_, beginners, but usually they bring them up, and another teacher that I thought was going to try to get in.  And several boys in my class were carrying things that meant they couldn't be squished.  And so my attitude was, just anyway, here we were filled, couldn't possibly take anybody and they shouldn't ask.  And yet I was thinking, in a way, that was very, well, I don't know, selfish, I suppose or just—.  I wasn't seeing their side it at all, and I didn't want to be friendly and let them in.  And I wouldn't be the one to be squished.  It would be the boys, but somehow that was me in that case.  (silence)</p>

<p>I started thinking about something that happened over the weekend, and—.  It reminds me, because this is what I was feeling at the time, of, eh, struggle of doing what I want to do and what I don't want to do, no matter how selfish or unselfish it is and—.  I mean what I want to do being selfish.  And, I don't know, I—, at this point it's not a thing that's hard to say.  It just somehow is something I don't want to think about.  It involves our having intercourse in the end, but I don't think I'd be holding back on saying it because of that.  It's somehow a feeling I don't want to feel again.</p>

<p>Because when went to bed I didn't want to have intercourse with MSCZ, and knew it was a possibility, and—.  He started talking about—, and I don't know I think in a way I was doing this, how I use ideas that I get here, or the fact that I'm coming her as an excuse for my behavior at home.  Because I sort of wanted to talk academically about why I didn't respond well to intercourse or something and—.  I mean it was a—.  I can see it was a way to avoid everything and it—.  And still making it sound good, except it didn't fool MSCZ and—.  I didn't want to face that.  I know, I don't know if at one point I started talking about how the feelings I had in the last few weeks were th—, feelings that I felt, well, I felt somehow I didn't want to control them and I couldn't exert that kind of effort to control them.  And I—, but I was saying to MSCZ something like if I tried to repress those feelings or pretend I had others, then I wouldn't be letting my real feelings out.  And, I don't know, as if I could just be anything I'd have license to be any way, because that would mean I was really getting at whatever feelings are really there.  And he got mad at that, too.  And I can—, I mean it meant I was taking absolutely no responsibility for our relationship.  I was expecting him to foot it all and putting up with me in any way I wanted to be while I go through this and—.  So I felt badly afterwards, when I thought about it I guess, because I realized—.  I don't know what I realized.  But I just suddenly felt I don't want to be so alone and (clears throat) I want to be with MSCZ, and so I asked him to make love to me, really.  I mean I didn't say it in so many words, but I did something that— (pause).</p>

<p>I don't know why it's so hard for me to say this, but I was starting to make love to him, and I find it very hard to say that.  Just like I find it very hard to say I love him to him.  Because somehow I think I don't really believe that I do or can.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it's that same thing, I think—, I don't know what day last week, but—, and I don't remember if it was just in terms of you and my parents or whether I spoke about it with MSCZ, too, then.  But a feeling that I could be anything and that I know he loves me and he'll put up with me and he's stuck with me and can't get rid of me.  And I don't have any responsibility back.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You don't say what you did when you started to make love.

PATIENT:  (pause)  It seems like I think I was aware of staying general at the time.  But I—, at the time when I was thinking more of what word should I use, rather than the fact that I really didn't want to remember exactly what I did, because I didn't want to remember the feeling.  And it seems strange because it was a nice feeling.  I just wanted to be close to him and I wanted to kiss him and put my arms around him, which is what I did and, and I don't want to remember that.  (pause)</p>

<p>And from there I tho—, I thought of just that it seems like I much prefer remembering angry or unpleasant feeling.  And then I thought of something I thought of something that happened when I was home today.  One of the cats was asking for more attention than she usually does and then she did something, clawed up something that she's not supposed to:  a chair or, yeah, I guess it was a chair.  And so I had to—, I don't spank her I hit a paper against my hand that—, I don't even know if she's afraid.  She acted like she thought it was a game today.  But in any case, I had an angry feeling toward her for a minute.</p>

<p>And then I thought again of the fact that I want to ask you to change the time.  And I don't know whether I connect it with angry feelings that I think you'll be angry or if I'm getting ready to be angry with you if you don't.  (pause)</p>

<p>I think maybe I'm getting ready to be angry, because I just started thinking that (hesitates) "How could I ask this?"  Because what I want to ask is to change it to the morning, as early as possible.  And it's such a radical change, that I think what I'm thinking is—, first of all I don't know whether you would take patients in the morning, so my assumption is that you might say no, because it's such a radical change.  And then I'd be angry.  And I also can feel I don't want to admit that.  Not because that I'd be feeling angry, but then I keep—, it does run through my mind that if you that that would make me angry (laughs), you might refuse.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why so?  On that grounds.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because somehow I should have better control over myself or I should not use it as a threat to you that I might be getting angry if you don't do it or—.  I think I somehow connect it with my feelings about paying you or not when I don't come.  Because I think sometimes the thought has occurred to me then, too, that if I'm having a problem over it, that you decide to charge me, because how am I ever going to work out the problem, if you don't.  And then it, then I start wondering why I'm thinking this now, if maybe it's not another strategy which I'll—, just makes me think about the fact that I'm trying to outguess you.  Or, I don't know if outguess you is the word, but just guess before I say anything or do anything what your reaction will be.  And I go through such complex imaginings about it that I never just simply ask and find out. 
 
ANALYST:  Well, it seems to me the central thing is that, uh, the very idea that I wouldn't do what you want makes you mad.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Somehow that—, when you say that, it just makes me think of the feelings I'd had in the last few weeks and—.  I don't know, the w—, uhm, maybe that was just a continuation of feeling angry about paying you when I hadn't come.  I don't know.  But somehow that seems to be part of the feeling with MSCZ, too.  Of, there was nothing specific that I was angry at him for not doing that I wanted him to do, but just this feeling that I had to be angry at him, because he wasn't doing what I wanted somehow.  And if I didn't get angry, he'd do less what I wanted.  Which again was sort of a emasculating thing and that by being angry I'd beat him down.  He'd become more compliant.  (pause)</p>

<p>Somehow that—, again I was thinking about talking about my mother's feelings, mainly because I was feeling them.  And, especially this idea that she has always wan—, been sort of a castrating female like I know often I've felt like being and—.  It seems that this feeling of anger, that I'm very aware of today is part of it.  Just feeling that men aren't going to give me something that I want.  And they have things I don't want, or one thing in particular.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Don't?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  That I, no I don't know why I said that.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Sour grapes?

PATIENT:  Hmm (said laughingly).  I don't know. I was thinking "want."  I don't know, maybe it is part of this attitude of, "I don't have it, but I don't need it and I don't care.  I can do just as well without it, and I can compete with men without a penis."  I think that's part of the attitude, too.  But then I never really feel I can.  And I always feel angry because I'm not getting a penis from some man.  I mean he's just not giving up his masculinity to me.  And, and in any way that it means that I think that's one reason why I get angry at MSCZ.  And that that whole feeling of trying to make him take on my roles as a woman, doing dishes and that all that kind of thing, because he'd give up some prerogative as a male, that he doesn't have to.  And somehow if he gave it up, I would get it.  And I don't know how I'd work that out, but—.  Well, I'd be more managing.  I decided that he was going to do the dishes, so I guess that would be it.  (pause)</p>

<p>But I just started thinking of, again, a thing that puzzled me Friday, because at one point you pointed out that the 2 feelings I was having at that time—, it was earlier than when I started talking about my mother in particular.  And you'd mentioned that, I can't remember how I was describing the feelings, but on the one hand—, I mean it wanting to be a male and wanting to be a female and—.  You talked about, here my mother had had a baby and yet the baby was a boy and—.  The baby was—, the boy was the favorite, or it seemed so to me and— (exhales).  I kept thinking, well that was right around that age of being 6.  But then when I started talking about feeling the way my mother feels, I couldn't put that together with the other 2 things and that feeling became feeling like my mother, became much more real.  And must have started much earlier.  And that left me not knowing is that a third feeling, or does it work with the other two I'd been talking about or, I don't know, I just felt confused by that.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

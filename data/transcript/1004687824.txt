<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where do you want to start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like I'm all over the place this week. I started my new job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's crazy. I'm doing mostly overnights. You know how we were talking about, I guess, the function and not form thing last week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Patients at the emergency room are much sicker than patients at the rehab center. Even the first day, we had this one patient where people were actually, like the doctors and nurses, were all crowded around the x-ray like they'd never seen anything like that sort of thing. It was this woman whose esophagus and trachea were displaced. They were like this because there was so much liquid on one side of her chest, and her lung was gone. I was like "I don't have that." (chuckles) So that was sort of an interesting —</p>

<p>[01:01.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it shows a real contrast. The ER function is usually not very good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yeah. And so it's been — well, it's sad to see other people go through stuff like that. But it definitely sort of makes me appreciate a little bit more. [I've been wearing sleeveless scrubs], which is new. But I'm also sort of —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel in it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel uncomfortable, but then I also think I hate farmers' tans even more than I hate wearing sleeveless shirts. So it's almost like I'm tricking myself into doing it at this point. But I feel like doing it is like half the battle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you're stretching your boundaries.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. And I wore a dress yesterday which was also new.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well good for you. You're taking a lot of risks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying. (chuckles) It's hard, but I mean — I don't know if I told you this before, but I used to ride horses and train them and teach people to ride them and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I didn't know that.</p>

<p>[01:59.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I used to do that. The reason I got into that was because I was randomly riding one day, and I had a really bad fall. I bruised a lung and lost part of the feeling on one of my knees and stuff. So I was horrified, of course, because —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How old were you when that happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thriteen, I think. I was really scared. (chuckles) So after that, I was really scared of horses. But I really don't like being scared of things, so I asked for lessons. So I tried. I mean, it was really hard. They started me on like a 42-year-old horse. (chuckles) It took me a while, but after a while they put me on the tough horses and I started training horses that were troubled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a big shift.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So doing it, I think, is part of — like sit on the horse and you just sit there for a while. So I think that's helpful for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did your feeling about being around horses change?</p>

<p>[02:59.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I miss it. I love horses now. I mean, it sort of went the other way. I started to be the one, like if a horse was bucking or was a troubled horse, they would give it to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you felt okay with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it wasn't like pleasant but I was like "I can do this, and it can be good after I do it" sort of thing. I started jumping. I jumped bareback too. These are all things that — I had I think nine falls after I fell that one time. Then I would be like "Okay, well, let me catch my breath." I fell during a competition one time, and it was really embarrassing. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you got up each time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. I guess literally I got back on the horse. (chuckles) So I guess maybe I'm sort of thinking about that and being like "Well, that sucked at the beginning, but it wasn't that bad afterwards."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's exactly the same process. Just like you were talking about swimming and challenging yourself to stay in the water, to go under slowly, to actually swim a lap and to keep at it until you could do it. It's the same exact process because you're challenging yourself to sit in a situation that's uncomfortable, and the discomfort eventually fades.</p>

<p>[04:16.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It just takes a while to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. Yeah, sometimes it takes a lot of sitting there to even notice that the discomfort has even shifted a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because when it's so overwhelming, little changes aren't always noticeable to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I guess that's been happening. I've been tricking myself into doing that more and more. I even went to a wedding which was the most awkward situation I've ever been in my entire life. (chuckles) Because I was supposed to be babysitting for this wedding, so there was a kids' table at the dinner and everything, and there were no kids. (chuckles) So I was literally sitting alone at a table at a wedding. (laughter) It was really awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can imagine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess I was thinking a lot, and one of the girls came up to me and said "My mom says you look sad. Let me sit with you." It was like the worst thing that has ever happened to me.</p>

<p>[05:11.2]</p>

<p>But anyway, I was wearing a dress and I wasn't wearing leggings, which was a huge deal for me. So I tried (inaudible at 05:19.1). I guess the other thing I wanted to talk about was — like I said, I'm all over the place this week — was at the ER again. The note-taking is actually easy. The part I'm having trouble with is the computer system. It's a completely different computer system, and learning to use a different system is a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>So I was trying to learn stuff and I was a little bit behind, so I just followed the doctor into one of the rooms and I didn't know what we were going to see. I was still trying to finish up another patient's chart. It was a woman and she talked about —</p>

<p>[06:00.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The patient or the doctor?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the patient. She talked about being raped a couple days prior to that. I didn't know what to do. I was like frozen. I mean, it took me forever to finish that chart. I couldn't even think straight for a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why — go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I sort of thought that could be me, or that was me. You know, that sort of situation. I didn't really quite know how to handle it. So that was hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Didn't know how to handle it in your professional role or personally or both?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think more personally. Professionally, I just pretended to take notes. It was more automatic, like I was just typing what she was saying verbatim, even if it wasn't relevant. I was just like, I have to do something, so it didn't look like I was having a hard time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's more about how it was affecting you, or how it's still affecting you on a personal level.</p>

<p>[07:02.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I thought about before, like how would I be able to handle this? I mean, it's kind of far-removed. Like it was a couple of years ago, and I'm feeling much better about it. But when it was closer — for example, we did this RA training. I was an RA in college, and we did RA training. They had this thing called "The Real World" where it was like this one day where you get like four or five scenarios of real things. So like one is you catch some residents smoking pot or whatever. It's kind of a rite of passage because old RAs enact these scenarios, and sometimes your teammates will make fun of you. It's kind of fun.</p>

<p>But one of the scenarios that I got was a girl who just been sexually assaulted. It was right after, right at the end of the summer that it happened to me. So I was really uncomfortable, and I really didn't know what to say. I mean, I think I got through it. I was like "Well, we have these resources," you know, whatever. But then even to this day, it was like I knew it was fake but it felt so real to me.</p>

<p>[08:12.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it is real for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, but it was like a fake situation, I guess. I think I put my hand on her hand or something and then she went nuts. She was like "Don't touch me." I was like "Of course I know not to touch someone." Like this makes no sense. I just beat myself up for it for months. I felt so — I still feel bad about it, you know, even though it wasn't a real situation. So it was a mistake but it wasn't like a huge mistake because it wasn't real, you know. So it was like a safe place to make a mistake.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's exactly why they have this day, in addition to giving people a chance to kind of razz you. It's because when you're faced with something like this, we often don't know what to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. So I guess I was just having flashbacks of that, even though I have no interaction with patients. But like she started to cry and I was like "Oh my God." Like, I don't know, it was very strange for me to be there, especially because it was out of the blue.</p>

<p>[09:18.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes up for you in terms of your own assault?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I remember for me it was this, like afterwards — I don't quite know how to explain it. It was like the mood, it was like that was the only thing I could think of for months. It was almost like living in a different world. It was like everything was tainted. It was almost like everything was a different color. I don't know. It was just a different world, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, a very unsafe place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But maybe not even just unsafe. It was just like really depressing, and it was almost like being underwater. Sometimes when I was with friends and I would momentarily forget, that was sort of like putting my head above water, but then I'd remember and sink again. Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does.</p>

<p>[10:15.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's kind of how I felt for months, and then slowly, I think over time, maybe like a year or so, it sort of turned the other way. I remembered occasionally, but not all of the time. But it was definitely like, I don't know. It was like a gradient, like those pictures — not pictures — those color schemes, like black to white. It was like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you still feel like the world is a different place than it was before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not in the same way. Not like that gray heaviness, no. Thankfully. But I feel like that's — I don't know. That's sort of what came up for me. I was just like in a different world again, for like a minute. Well, not a minute, but like a little while when I was doing that.</p>

<p>[11:11.8]</p>

<p>It was just hard to — and then I felt bad because I was like, I'm going to be a doctor one day and this is eventually going to happen and I have to be able to not be all in myself, you know what I mean? Like it's not just about me, it's also about other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds though like you were able to do your job. You were impacted and you were affected and you remembered your own experience, but you did your job. You took notes, which is what you're there to do. When you're trained to be a doctor, you'll do your job as a doctor. But you'll still be impacted by some patients' stories. I don't think that's a bad thing. I don't think it gets in the way necessarily of doing your other job too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have to be able to empathize with other people, and as a doctor being able to maintain your empathy for patients is really important.</p>

<p>[12:16.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, going into it, that's definitely something that I want to be conscious of doing because I have felt like some doctors haven't really had a lot of empathy for like "Oh, my stomach hurts." "Oh really? You're like the 50th case I've seen this week." It's easy to do. But I also — I don't know. I just wouldn't want to relive it every time that happens, or I wouldn't want to make it about me when it's not, you know? Does that make sense? I don't know if that's selfish.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much did you feel like you were reliving it, having to relive that time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think — so I was being trained to do stuff, and so this guy was over my shoulder so he didn't quite let me, but I think he noticed that I went kind of quiet. He was like "Hey, are you okay?" and I was like "I'm fine." (chuckles)</p>

<p>[13:13.5]</p>

<p>And he was very talkative, so he sort of kept distracting me which I think was good. But I think that on my own, I would have been a lot worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you needed help. So that might be something important to remember, to seek out — if something like that happens and if there isn't somebody, finding somebody to seek out. Like being able to say — if you don't want to reveal personal details, you certainly don't have to. But being able to say "Can we talk for a minute because that case was hard for me to listen to." Or if something is particularly hard to see that you're not prepared for and haven't seen before or is just —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which also happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: — really horrific. Self-care is really important, and part of that is coming here and having a chance to talk about things. But also seeking out somebody that might be a little more in-the-moment and being able to say — like even if it's "Can we just talk about something silly for five minutes to distract us?" or "Can we just talk a little bit about what just happened?"</p>

<p>[14:21.1]</p>

<p>Part of being in that field is making sure that you also have really good self-care. Clearly anything related to assault is going to be a soft spot for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I hope that eventually I can — I mean, I don't want to be unempathetic, but I also don't want to go the other way. It's almost like finding this weird middle ground that's like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to keep the focus on the work and the current patient.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and the patient, which I think for me is the most important part. That seems like the most important part for me, like it's about them and what they're going through right now. Just like I did and I wanted someone to talk to about what happened to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of response did you get at the time, because we haven't talked much about it.</p>

<p>[15:15.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don't know. It was a while ago. I was in college. I saw a therapist, but I didn't really click, I guess. So I mentioned it and we talked about it and she gave me some resources, but I think it was —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you follow up on any of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not really. Not really. But I think a lot of it was I ended up healing the wrong way, but I did it. I don't know. Does that make any sense? Like I ended up doing a lot of things that I regret afterwards, but I think it was a way of — I don't know. Like, I can do this. I ended up hooking up with a lot of guys after that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was that like for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sucked. (chuckles) I don't want —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it didn't really actually feel empowering.</p>

<p>[16:08.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. I also did a lot of drugs too. That sucked too. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was that something you had been into before or was that a direct result?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not really. Not before. Yeah, I think that took a year or two where I was on and off one or the other. But then eventually graduated and I was like "Alright, I'm done." There was actually a really bad day where I think I overdosed, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you using?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, cocaine. And I actually woke up the next day and I was like "Oh my God, I can't believe I woke up. I'm not doing that ever again." (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's scary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was really scary. And actually — this was stupid, but I was like "Oh, I'm not done with my thesis yet." (laughter) "I can't waste anymore time." So I went to the library the next day and finished my thesis.</p>

<p>[17:22.9]</p>

<p>Well, maybe not that day, but you know, I did work on it. So I think that was really helpful. Work was really helpful, and it's sort of always been what I do. It's just like "Okay, I'm having a fight with my mom. I'm going to do my homework." (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was a really healthy way to distract yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess somehow I never got that — I mean, you never really got any support. I think when you told me, we sort of passed over this whole time of your life really quickly when we first started working together. I guess I never questioned you further about it because it doesn't sound like you really ever got good support or good therapy to help you deal with not just the assault, but all the ways you tried to cope that were also painful.</p>

<p>[18:22.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think — I don't know. I mean, I do a lot of things on my own. Maybe that's not the most helpful thing. Like, I never told my mom. That's just not something that's going to happen, you know, if I have anything to do with it. I remember feeling lonely because I didn't have the family support, but I also felt stronger for getting through it by myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think your independence and your resilience is a real strength of yours. You've done a lot for yourself, by yourself. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. It's one of your strengths. It also sometimes makes you feel lonely. Sometimes these things have two different sides to them.</p>

<p>[19:13.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that — well, this pretty much happened after I had — I think I told you about the fight where I blew up at my friends and then we weren't friends anymore. (chuckles) So this had happened after that, and I was already feeling lonely. I had that relationship with that guy who was really bad to me, and that was happening at the same time. So all of this was happening at the same time. So sophomore and junior year really sucked.</p>

<p>That's also when I overloaded on my credits and picked up a second major. That's actually when I started becoming really involved in student government and was president of two clubs or something. So I just —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got really busy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I got a job. Yeah. I just did everything. I think that was helpful, even though sometimes it wasn't. (chuckles) But yeah, I don't know. I mean, in general I don't like really talking about it. I don't know. It's just — I think it's in the past for me. Thankfully. (pause) Yeah.</p>

<p>[20:27.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, if you ever feel like you have to go back and process that, either because it's been brought up again for you, like this patient kind of brought it up and triggered memories for you, or for any other reason, you are totally welcome to use our time that way. That's really important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is there any way — I mean, for me it's just really hard to say it, but it's not that I don't want you to — I mean, I actually wrote a letter to the guy's family, and when I went to file a police report, I wrote what I wanted to say and just turned it into them. I didn't want to say it again, but it's not about the information. So is there any way I could send you that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that way you have it but I don't have to say it. It's just I don't think I can say it without —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can always — I mean, if there's ever anything that you want me to know but is hard to say, you can always send it to me in an e-mail or write a letter and give it to me in session.</p>

<p>[21:30.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know it's really awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not for me. I mean, if it feels awkward for you, I understand that. But for me, it would be totally fine. Sometimes it's a step in the process of being able to talk about something that's too hard face-to-face. So, I mean, anything that gives you voice I think is a step in the right direction for you. That's a lot of what we've talked about, not with regard to this but as to other things. It's just ways for you to hear your own voice, to have your voice heard with your friends and your family. Sometimes that's speaking and sometimes it's writing. Sometimes it's English and sometimes it's Spanish. Any way that you get more heard is helpful.</p>

<p>[22:22.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay, I'll send it. (pause) Do you think that — I mean, so in the whole thinking about communication and talking to people and sort of this person that I thought I was, or that I am in my head but not in real life, I did use to be like that. It's really not until right now, or maybe a little bit before, that I started to think maybe there's this big difference in the way I communicate because I went through this big thing alone for a long time.</p>

<p>So for me to ask for help, it's like well, why would I need to? I haven't had to before and I've done all this other stuff. (pause) So do you think that could have impacted the way that I communicate or don't?</p>

<p>[23:21.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah, it certainly could be. I guess we'll never really know exactly what it was that started this shift to feel less secure about yourself. That's sort of what underlies —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or extremely awkward. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that certainly could be [one thing]. I can understand that [in a number of ways]. One, there's this huge piece of information about your experience that nobody knows. Not necessarily that people need to know that, but I wonder if that feels, not necessarily on a conscious level, but I wonder if that feels awkward for you.</p>

<p>There's actually lots of stuff that nobody knows because you keep a lot to yourself. Sometimes that makes it hard to relate to others because you see yourself in one way because you know all this stuff, and you're not really sure how other people see you because they don't know a whole host of things. So that's one way that I could understand that.</p>

<p>[24:19.8]</p>

<p>The other way I think is more of what you're saying, that you did withdraw in a lot of ways. In one way, you were very public, taking tons of classes and obviously seeing lots of people. You were participating in student government, probably working with people and seeing people and being somewhat present. But in another way, you were really withdrawn because it sounds like you really didn't have your close friends anymore. You had cut off from a lot of people. That's such different worlds.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's actually a really great way to put it. I even ran for president at school and I knew a lot of people. Even still if I go back, I still know a lot of people. But I didn't ever really feel like I knew a lot of people, you know what I mean? And then when I came to divinity school —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were on an acquaintance level with people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And when I came to divinity school it was so the opposite, like I really didn't know anyone and also I didn't know anyone. By the time I graduated, I didn't know a lot of people. I would usually have been that person that everyone knows. So, that was also —</p>

<p>[25:29.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In terms of relationships now, how would you describe it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I've been thinking a lot about that too. (chuckles) Some of my roommates have been out of town and I'm like "Wow, I have no friends." (chuckles) I mean, except for the people I live with, but it's also not their responsibility to keep me company. (chuckles) But I feel like I know people. I feel like I know a handful of people very well, but I don't know a lot of people, if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you comfortable with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, until recently, sure. But I think now I've started to realize that it would be nice to have someone to call up if I want to go for drinks and one other person can come. (chuckles) So I'm sort of hoping that when I start classes in the fall, I can —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll certainly have the opportunity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: — branch out and meet people, maybe do some extra-curriculars or something. I'm going to start volunteering soon at a place.</p>

<p>[26:27.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you know Helping Hands?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So hopefully I'll start volunteering there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What prompted you to do that or to think about starting that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I've sort of always wanted to, but I never had time because I was in grad school and college and did all this other stuff. I don't know. It's something that — there was a question actually on the application, and I really didn't know what I was going to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The application for Helping Hands?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So the question was "Why do you want to volunteer here?" I said something along the lines of "I've felt really disempowered, and I would like to help other people not feel that way."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's what you said? That's what would really be your therapy answer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was really surprised that's really how I felt. I mean, I was really surprised. (chuckles) I just wrote it out and I was like "Really? Oh wow."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So as you came to it, it really resonated for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. So, I don't know. I used to volunteer a lot in high school, and I don't really do that anymore.</p>

<p>[27:32.1]</p>

<p>I like people. Even though I feel like I'm really awkward and can't really talk to people very well, I still really like them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somehow you manage. I think you sometimes manage better than you think you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Maybe, yeah. I don't know. I actually had this conversation with my trainer. He was like 21 and the friendliest guy, so we sort of became friends and I was like "How do you know so many people?" He's only been there for three weeks and he's literally like best friends everyone who works there. Someone even baked him cookies.</p>

<p>He's just really good friends with everyone there. It's like "How are you such good friends with everyone? You've only been here for three weeks." He was like "I don't know. I just talk a lot." (chuckles) He's like "Just introduce yourself" and I'm like "Oh, okay" and I tried it. I was like "Oh, hi, I'm Leanne. I'm the new scribe." And someone was like "Oh, nice to meet you." So that was really nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a good start.</p>

<p>[28:22.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it was definitely surprising for me, just because it's not something I would have done if I hadn't been prompted to, I guess. But it was nice. I made a friend actually. She's really into Harry Potter and so am I. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she actually invited me to her prayer circle or something. I was like "Oh, cool."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't need to wait necessarily until you start classes in the fall, it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. Too bad it's an hour away. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you'll be there actually. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I guess that worked out well. I still feel like I'm extremely awkward, like "Oh my God, who would want to talk to me? I'm so awkward." I laugh about it, but it's really how I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not a comfortable feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Especially when I babysat for that wedding. I was like "This is the story of my life."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a very awkward situation. I can't imagine many people that would feel comfortable as a babysitter for a wedding with no children.</p>

<p>[29:30.3]</p>

<p>That's a really hard position to be in. In evaluating yourself and what your strengths are and what your growing spots are, we've also got to take into account what you can possibly expect of yourself. You know, some situations are just really awkward and sometimes just surviving them is the best you can do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's exactly how I felt. I was like "Well, it's been 20 minutes since I last checked my phone. Cool. This is good." But I also felt like "Oh, this is kind of like a metaphor for my life. This is how I feel." (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is it a metaphor for your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I just realized this wasn't my fault. I know that I wasn't scaring people away or something. (chuckles) It was just sort of an awkward situation. I was texting Julia and she said "Well, they put you in a really awkward situation" and I was like "Well, yeah, that's true." But it was just like, this is exactly how I feel. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[30:33.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That life feels like an awkward situation that you've been placed in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no, not necessarily that I've been placed in. Just like this is how I feel I interact with people. Like I sit at the awkward table by myself, and this is how I generally feel. (chuckles) Which is fine most of the time, but sometimes —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you feel when you discovered this other woman who had similar interests as you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt like it was really unusual. I think some of it was — like I think part of the nervousness I had starting this new job was because I had kind of a bad experience with the nurses at my old job, in particular one. I guess she didn't like me. She talked about one of the other scribes all the time, and how she loved him and was trying to get him a job.</p>

<p>[31:30.8]</p>

<p>She was best friends with him, and she wished he would work more hours. This one time I showed up and she was like "Oh, I thought Mike was on today" and I was like "Nope, just me. Is that okay?" (chuckles) It was just kind of really obvious that she didn't like me, and that's fine. Not everyone has to like me. That's fine. It just —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it does make for an awkward — it seems unprofessional. It's true, not everyone has to like you. But in a work setting, it seems unprofessional to allow your personal feeling to be so present, to be so noticeable to you. That seems over the line.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess I sort of took it to be — (pause) Yeah, maybe that's not fair either. I was sort of like "Oh, this must be what other people think of me." Because I am weird. At least in that context I was strange and like — I don't know.</p>

<p>[32:28.5]</p>

<p>Like some of the comments I made were things I couldn't help. Like, okay, so one of the doctors goes on this thing where he is the doctor for this trip of really rich people. They go on this plane and they pay to bring the doctor with him, where they travel all over the world. Like they rent out a plane and just go to different countries.</p>

<p>So he was showing us pictures he had taken on the trip, and he was looking at one from India and I asked him questions like "Oh, where did you go?" because that's what I studied in college. So that was really nice, and he seemed really interested.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't seem weird.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the nurse I think started looking at me kind of weird and I was like "Okay, I'll just be quiet." Maybe it was inappropriate questions, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were those the questions you asked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I asked him if he'd gone to Dumroan in India and like a shrine somewhere in Tamil Nadu or if he'd seen some of the pithas or something like that. I think it was the pithas I asked about.</p>

<p>[33:38.0]</p>

<p>It was just really weird after that. I picked up on it. I was just "Okay, I'm going to be quiet." I think partially it doesn't help that we don't get a seat with a chair, so that makes it really awkward because we're off on the corner. At the new place it's like a little cube where all the doctors and nurses sit, and we're literally outside of the cube. So I think that doesn't help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sets up a tough dynamic because it sends this vibe that you're not part of the group.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So, I don't know. I think those experiences at the urgent care made me feel like I'm this weird person that nobody can sort of relate to because I have such strange interests. Strange interests is I think really it.</p>

<p>[34:36.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For a while we sort of haven't been paying close attention to the assumptions that you're making. But one thing you just highlighted with this one nurse is that she let it show she felt uncomfortable or disliked you for some reason. So you made the assumption that they all must feel that way. You need to be really careful about that because it might be unfair to subscribe everybody's reaction to this one person. It gives her a lot of power to think for everybody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think the reason I did that — I do know that one of the other nurses really liked me and we got along because one of her sisters was a minister or something, and we talked a lot about divinity school and stuff. Layla (sp?), the nurse that didn't like me, was really the loudest and the most —</p>

<p>[35:32.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It feels like she's speaking for everybody, but she's not and she can't. It's important to kind of remind yourself of that because it's easy to let the loud voice be the overwhelming voice. It's also easy to let the voice that matches up with the critical voice in our head seem to take precedence because you often critique yourself. So when there's somebody that matches that, it's easy to slip into "It must be right, and it must be what other people are thinking."</p>

<p>Just take a moment to second-guess that voice. Let there be an opportunity. Maybe someone else thinks differently. Maybe the weird looks you got in response to that question wasn't a message that it was inappropriate, but a message that people were surprised. They may have had no idea that you had that kind of knowledge, or maybe they wouldn't know any follow-up questions to ask because they haven't studied the area and wouldn't know how to ask a follow-up question about those particular pictures of that particular place. Just leave room for another interpretation that might be a little bit friendlier.</p>

<p>[36:43.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, to be clear, I don't necessarily take that as a — I know I'm interested in weird things, but that's not like a negative thing for me to say. That's definitely not a negative thing for me. Okay, I know that studying Sanskrit is weird. (chuckles) People don't study Sanskrit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's less common, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's not a negative, but I can see how other people could see that as being weird in a negative way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not know how to relate to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So that's sort of the —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess the challenge is how do you maintain your interests and not necessarily feel like you have to hide it from people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's — okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Express what your interests are, and find a way to relate to people who may have different interests. Because I think that's where the negative piece comes in, when you assume that because your interests may be less typical or less common than the other people in the room, that you have to cut off from them and that you can't relate and that it's going to be awkward.</p>

<p>[37:40.8]</p>

<p>That stuff is negative. But if you can find a way — and there are ways — to demonstrate that what you're interested in doesn't have to be isolating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's definitely about me. I still really like listening to other people, and I'm interested in so many different things that learning about something new is always interesting. I think it's more about sharing my interests.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to show other people that what you have a lot of knowledge about is really cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I guess. So what I'm saying is it's not that I can't completely have a conversation with someone. (chuckles) I mean, it's hard — I think it's also awkward for people to talk about religion, and people have had negative experiences and assume that I haven't.</p>

<p>[38:29.1]</p>

<p>It's also a touchy subject. I forget that in the real world, that's something that's hard to talk about. I'm also interested in a lot of other stuff like Indian art and stuff that's not necessarily as controversial. But that's something to think about, I think. (pause) Yeah. I think I can do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you came in and said "I feel like I'm all over the place." Something you have mentioned before is wanting to have a little bit more guidance and a little bit more direction. So I'm wondering about the different topics that you're wrestling with. You know, body image has come up a lot and how that impacts your comfort with men. This new job and being introduced to new people. Where do you want your focus to be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know. I sort of have this feeling that everything from today is kind of related.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't disagree.</p>

<p>[39:30.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don't exactly know how to fit all the pieces together, but I like puzzles, I guess. I mean, I sort of have a sense —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In some ways it feels appropriate that we do touch upon all these things because I agree. I think the body image stuff and the relationship stuff and probably the sexual assault is tied to your body image. A lot of times for women, having an experience like that changes how they feel about their body, changes how they feel about men, and just being aware of how that might impact you. It's not something that necessarily has to be —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't really thought about it a lot. Like I said, my instinct has been "Alright, move on."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Put it behind you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I certainly don't want you to relive that one more time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean, I think that might be helpful. But yeah, I know I'm sort of all over the place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like that's a good indication of what life feels like for you, so that's appropriate.</p>

<p>[40:31.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's also closer to what goes on in my head. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, they're all parts of you and they're all probably connected. We just need to figure out how.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that would be helpful. I had another question, just because my — this is like logistics — my health insurance is about to run out from school, and I can't renew it because you just can't at the school unless you're doing a BA program or something.</p>

<p>So my new job has offered to pay for half of my new insurance, so I basically get to pick what I want. I wanted to make sure I picked one that you were covered with. So I was wondering, is that Blue Cross Blue Shield or — ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so I am a Blue Cross Blue Shield provider. There's one Blue Cross HMO plan that uses a different provider panel. I am not part of that HMO. They changed names, so just double-check.</p>

<p>[41:38.4]</p>

<p>If you're going to pick Blue Cross Blue Shield, just double-check that — and they will send you a provider panel list if you ask. If you're going to pick an HMO, just double-check that. I don't want you to pick a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan expecting me to be on it, and then have that particular plan.</p>

<p>The other thing is, I will bill any insurance. So if you pick — there's HMOs, PPOs, point-of-service plans. Usually PPOs and point-of-service plans allow you to see someone out of their particular network. They pay 80 percent of the fee or something, and instead of paying a co-pay, you pay the — I think they call it a co-insurance amount — so you're paying 20 percent of the fee. Sometimes that's actually a better deal because if your monthly plan is less, it works out in the end.</p>

<p>[42:33.8]</p>

<p>If Blue Cross is more expensive than the others, just pick a plan that allows you to see someone out of the network, and then I will bill them and bill you for the remainder. So it just requires some math on your part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I noticed there were 24 sessions covered under the young adult plan for Blue Cross Blue Shield, so maybe I'll just check the provider list for that. I think the copay is like 20 bucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that the Blue Cross through — not under the school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's another one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Usually — now that's interesting. I thought the student plans have a limit. Maybe it's the young adult plan that I usually see as the student plan. Where a lot of Blue Cross plans have something called — what is the term for it?</p>

<p>[43:32.2]</p>

<p>But they don't limit the number of sessions because of — parity. It has to be in parity to medical health where they would never tell you that you couldn't see your doctor more than a certain number of times. So I'm surprised there would be a strict session limit on another plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Insurance is always complicated. I'm happy to try to help you work through it. So if you want to bring in stuff to look through together, I'm happy to help you do that so you get something that is going to work for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. The other question I had was at health center, I see a nurse practitioner, a psychiatry nurse practitioner, so I'm on medication which I haven't been very good about taking recently and I feel it. But anyway, I wanted to hook up with another provider because I won't be able to see them anymore. I was wondering if you had any recommendations because I'm sort of lost. Like psychiatry here, there's like 8,000 of them.</p>

<p>[44:33.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Unfortunately, most of the psychiatrists I know who do private practice won't do just meds. One of the reasons psychiatrists go into private practice is they want to do therapy and meds together, and not be stuck being just a prescriber. I will ask around, but I think what you're probably going to end up doing is narrowing it down to a very specific area you want to be seen in, and I can —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Area of — ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you can narrow down in the area.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, like in region.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly. Like "I only want to look at things a mile from my house."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Narrow the list down like that for convenience, and I'll be happy to look at it to see if there's anyone I know of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But most of the people I know — like I know some people have left to go into private practice, and they all do their own therapy and I don't want you to switch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I don't either.</p>

<p>[45:32.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's figure out what plan you're going to be on and look and see who is on that plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. I think the nurse (inaudible) said that she could give me a three-month prescription.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you have some time. Okay, great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And take your meds.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (chuckles) I'm so bad about it. I feel bad about it. Like I literally feel bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because when you're inconsistent, you end up feeling worse from the effects of withdrawal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you have to adjust back to the meds again. I think we need to schedule for next time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

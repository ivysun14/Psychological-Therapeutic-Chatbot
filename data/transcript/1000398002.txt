<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, immediately thinking about 3 things that uhm, (sniff) I don't kno—, I don't see the obvious connection, but there must be, the way I think of them all together.  Uhm, because I, when you came out, I had just, was thinking about wondering if the girl, FNF, that I saw yesterday, had called, because I'd tried to get her today, and she wasn't in.  Uh, and I have to tell her that I'm not going to hire her.  MSCZ wouldn't do it. </p>

<p>And I don't know, as he said, "No, I won't do it," I began to feel, well, I really should be able to, and uhm, (sniff), but then when I left, since she hadn't already called, I told FMC she might.  And that FRL could tell her the job was already taken, but she might want to speak to me, and that was fine.  Uhm, and so I feel very mixed, on the one hand, it would be nice if it had already been taken care of, but uh, I don't know, still I feel as if then I'd be running away from it, if I don't speak to her directly.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>And then I was thinking about this jacket that I wore, because it's the thing that I bought that day when I felt I'd really splurged.  And I hadn't, had worn it this morning, and when I left to come here I really hadn't thought about it, until I was practically at the subway, and then I suddenly realized I had this on.  And that it had been something I talked about here.  And then I felt sort of embarrassed and uhm, I don't know, it was almost as if, if I had been at home when I realized, I think I would have changed it. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, somehow, uhm, the feeling I had, and then it was almost like a defiant feeling, well, I would let you see it, was that I didn't want you to see, see it, as if that would minimize how much I had splurged on myself.  Or uhm, well, I just don't know why, because I'd already told you about it, so I'm not sure how seeing it makes it different.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, it's almost as if, if you didn't see it, then uh, it would be as if I hadn't done it.  Even though I told you about it.  Or, uhm, I don't know, because for a while I'd considered taking it back — not that I'd talked about that to you — but, I don't i—, it's almost as if, uh, if you never saw it, maybe you'd assume I'd undone what I'd done, or so I, I, I just can't quite tell. </p>

<p>But uhm, (Pause) I don't know, I start thinking again of what I'd thought along with these other things.  Uhm, well I think there's in part an explanation for this, but I felt extremely tired today, and very uhm, aimless.  And uh, well I was doing the main grocery shopping, because I usually do that on Thursday, or Wednesday, one of those days.  And uh, so I had that I had to do.  But I al—, I found it almost (clears throat) I don't know, just very difficult to make up the shopping list, which really isn't difficult at all.  And make those few decisions. </p>

<p>And then, in the grocery store, uh, as opposed to some days when I get in there and, and really go through fast, and know exactly what I want. Today, I just felt like sort of wandering around and it didn't bother me to spend a long time in there.  Although there wasn't anything I was doing particularly, that made it nice to spend a long time in there.  Just, it was almost as if I couldn't, uhm, face something next.  And I don't know what that "next" would be, and I got home and uhm, the things I'd brought home with me had to be put away immediately, and it was, I don't know, just everything was an effort.  And then finally, I, I felt really tired, too, which I think might in part be uhm, because I haven't been sleeping that well.  Not terribly, but uhm, not that well. </p>

<p>And then, today I rode my bicycle to school and home, and I g—, I guess maybe, because often, if I've been out exercising on a day like today, when it's cool and nice, after that then I feel very sleepy.  So it might be just that that was all it really was.  But uhm, since I was fighting the feeling and trying to keep going, and trying to think of something useful to do, since there are plenty of things that I could do, and yet I didn't do anything, really.  I just, well I don't know, I felt as if I were making myself do things. </p>

<p>And then, uh, I thought of some, an incident that happened in school today that bothered me, because again, it's a case of I think, overreacting.  Uh, and taking out personal feelings on a child, which really disturbs me to do that.  And I don't, I me—, I seem to do it a lot, too. Or at least, often enough so I feel even more disturbed.  But uhm, this particular incident occurred with this boy, MJ, who I probably have referred to him before, I don't know if by name.  But uh, he just can't relate to the other children at all.  He doesn't even know their names yet.  And uhm, he refuses, I don't know, sort of the attempts others make to approach him.  But he's upset at not having friends, and he feels they pick on him, although they really don't. </p>

<p>And he's always — the only peo—, he can only talk to me or FLMZ.  And he does it all the time, in sort of a frantic way.  And at first, he didn't even stop to see if you were listening.  He'd just kind of keep going and it was exhausting, because you'd try to listen, be a good listener, and yet it, and yet he didn't need at that point, a good listener.  But he really, but he also really needed attention. </p>

<p>And uhm, now it's just very tiring to have him constantly come up, and he won't wait if you're talking to somebody else.  He just starts shouting out what he has to say.  And then if you ask him to wait, he will.  But you always have to ask him to wait, and he's always coming up, so it's just this constant thing.  And uh, so he wears me down, and I know, and he wears FLMZ down.  Uh, usually, I guess I hide it.  But today I just felt worn down, and I just felt after awhile, I wish he'd not come over anymore.  Because I'm just getting (Laughs) awfully tired. </p>

<p>And uhm, then an incident occurred, where there had been some misunderstanding.  But in the end, a child was being hurt.  MJ is not a child who will go out and purposely hurt anybody.  But uhm, the child was being hurt by something.  He was taking a tricycle away, which he had been riding, and the child, uhm — it was at clean-up time — and the child had, I think, maybe seen it near MJ, and had thought he could go clean it up, or else he tried to take it away, I'm not sure.  But anyway, MJ was establishing that it was his to put away.  And he was doing it in such a way that the child's foot got caught under it.  And then he was, that child was really being hurt. </p>

<p>So I went over, and I said, "MJ, wait, because MYF's foot's being, is caught and he's being hurt."  And MJ, all MJ could think is, it's my bicycle, it's my bicycle, and he started pulling it again.  And I said, "I know, MJ, but just wait so MYF can get his foot out."  And MJ couldn't stop, and so I had to hold him and hold the bicycle, uhm, because he just, he couldn't hear me, or he couldn't hear what I was saying, because he was so concerned with it being his bicycle.  And uhm, he was just yanking away, pulling the foot with him, and then scraping the bicycle over the boy at the same time too. </p>

<p>Uhm, and so then I felt kind of mad, because MJ hadn't obeyed me.  And, and the whole rest of the incident was just really my being madder and madder at MJ's disobedience.  And, and I lost the ability to really handle the situation, except by being the bigger adult, and stronger, who could physically make MJ do what I asked him to do.  And yet I think MJ is the kind that, if you insist verbally, he will do it, and you don't need to use the physical way, and he gets very upset at that.  And, it was almost as if I were using the physical means on purpose, because I knew it upset him.  Because I was so mad at him. </p>

<p>Because he, he then did several other things.  I asked him to sit down for a minute, and calm down, because he just, he was just in such a state.  And he refused to until finally, verbally I did get him to finally sit down.  But he did it in such a way, that it was oh, not listening when I tried to talk to him about what could he have done to handle the situation better.  And, so I asked him to stop, he was playing in the sand and I asked him to stop so he could listen to me.  And finally he did.  And then when we finished talking, he, I said now — because it had been clean-up time before — it's time to, to uhm, put these things away, too, which had already been cleaned up, and he'd taken them out again when he went over to sit down there.  And he wouldn't, he said, "No, I won't." </p>

<p>And I said, "Well MJ, if you can't, I have to.  But it has to be cleaned up, because we have to go downstairs, now."  And he said, "No, I won't."  So that really made me mad and I pulled him out of the sandbox.  And then I asked him to go stand by the door.  And he said no, he wouldn't.  So I took him over to the door.  And meanwhile, I'm getting madder and madder, and just out of control, I felt.  Because I was, I, I guess it was the feelings I was afraid maybe would get out of control.  But uhm, and then he stayed by the door until it was time to go down.</p>

<p>And he was sitting there, and then when everybody was lined up, I said, "Well, okay MJ, you can stand up now, and we can go down."  And he said, "No, I'm not going to stand up."  And so this just went on, so I had to pick him up.  And I don't think I had to actually do anything physical with him, but I felt as if I had to, because he was being disobedient, and I couldn't stand — at that point I was so mad at him — for him to be disobedient once.  And uhm, well I, I don't know which part of it's upsetting me the most.  That I don't think I handled it in an appropriate way for him, for the kind of boy he is.  Uhm, I think I had to handle something when he was hurting the other child.  And his complete inability to be aware of other children.  But uhm, that all got lost in our fighting each other.  And so that makes me feel badly. </p>

<p>And, and then I suppose the strong feelings I had made me feel, well I suppose, guilty.  (Sniff) Because maybe, maybe in my reaction to this, I'm feeling as if I really did something terrible to him.  I don't think I did something good to him, but uhm, because of the strong feelings I had, I'm wondering if I'm not feeling as if I'd actually, well, I don't know (Laughs) quite what I wanted to do to him.  That's wh—, was trying to think.  But uhm, (sniff) sort of destroy him, almost.  And, and then I guess I feel as if maybe I really did.</p>

<p>Because then, that makes me think of that girl again, FNF, that I have to say no to.  Uh, because it's almost as if I've worked myself up into a mood, too, of I'm not going to let her beg and, and push me around, so that, so that maybe I'm admitting more th—, or it's not exactly admitting it, but feeling that feeling that you pointed out yesterday, that I must be feeling when she was begging yesterday, of being angry.   (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, it's f—, it's funny with her.  Uhm, I suppose in part, I'm thinking about something you said yesterday, of my understanding what she's doing, because it's similar to what I've done here.  Uhm, like in her being unable to accept that she can't have what she wants, or that I wouldn't call her exactly when she wanted, or something like that.  Uhm, b, because as soon as I finished thinking, well, I'm angry enough so I can talk to her on the phone.  Maybe not showing my anger, but at least be firm.  Uhm, then I always start thinking, well, she strikes me as somebody who really needs uhm, needs something from other human beings.  And I don't know exactly what it is, because I don't really know how mixed up she is.  Or how true some of the things she said, are. </p>

<p>But in any case, she needs something from other human beings.  And then I'm saying no, I won't give that to her.  Becau—, well, I don't know, I don't feel that probably it's, we're in the position where we should, and that she should then be with FSO.  But still I feel sort of badly that then we aren't.  And then I think of what could I do that would be constructive, that uhm, without hiring her.  And, because I do feel somewhat, I don't know, that she really, I mean i, it isn't as if she was some person I just didn't like, and I couldn't care less what happened to.  Uhm, (sniff) well I don't know. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   What do you think she needs?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well I think, what I uhm, felt for the 2 times, uh, the telephone call, and then uh, meeting her, was that she feels, she must feel very badly about herself, or have a very bad image of herself, or uhm, maybe not feel secure.  I don't know, it all comes out to sort of the same thing.  And that uhm, (sigh) she needs to be in a place where she can be accepted and uhm, not be criticized.  And not have to have a lot of competition.  And where she can kind of — well this is where I don't know how much she needs, whether she really had a fiance who died, and then this has sort of thrown her off, or if she's made that up.  Somebody said they thought from the way she sounded, that she might have even made that up.  And uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I wonder why how I, you know, I have a strong feeling that you're really not letting yourself think of the most obvious thing.  Which is, the picture you describe, is someone who's asking for psychiatric help.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   I wonder why you don't say that, or think it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I do think it actually (Laughs), I just don't know how to say it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Well, why don't you say it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, because I guess then, because of other aspects of this, that I've been identifying with her in some form or other, uhm, I think I feel in saying that, I'm saying something about myself that actually has already been said, so I don't know why I hesitate.  But it's like saying I don't, I want to be here having from you what I think she needs from somebody. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Somebody?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well I suppose e, essentially I think of a man, some man, but uhm, but I, I don't know I, I even — maybe this is part of my not wanting to think more about what it s—, what she, what I c, clearly thought she needs, which is psychiatric help.  Because uhm — then what I think is, well that even I — and sort of feeling well, what it would come down to I suppose, is sorry for her, or uhm, I me—, I, and then assuming certain things about her, because I'm, I have identified with her in certain ways.  Uhm, I even feel I could maybe, just by being nice to her and so forth, if I'd hired her, helped her, or uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, you, that's right.  You mentioned that sort of feeling yesterday.  You know, you attempted to try to change her, help her.  What about that idea?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, the first thing I thought of was that, that's not a new feeling for me.  That I've often, and for years, had that feeling, uhm, when I thought I could see somebody else's problems more clearly.  And it wasn't until a long time that I began to realize, I'd be seeing other people's and not my own.  Uhm, but I don't know, it just seems like a similar thing.  And then I immediately thought of that feeling I had had toward Mrs. BBF, too, yesterday, when she was talking to me about the other teacher, or just about the situation.   And uhm, I felt I could clearly s, see some of the reasons she was having problems.  Uhm, that could be changed.  So I felt then, I could help her too, if I could say them tactfully enough, which I didn't, because I didn't know quite how to.  But, and it would have been quite presumptuous of me, uhm, at that particular time, anyway.  I don't know if ever I'll be able to, but certainly not then.</p>

<p>And uh, I don't know, it seemed like again, that's the same kind of feeling.  And I don't know —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You know, it occurs to me that you must have a similar ex—, you must expect, at least, you know, or want for yourself to be, similar with MJ, for example, in school.  Because again you describe a boy who's clearly in need of some help, pro—, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhum.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I mean, you as a teacher with many students, must have a lot of problems you know, devoting all that time just to him.  You don't say that you think he needs help.  But it's sort of, so obvious, the way you describe it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Hmm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   I think you must have thought of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, in fact just now, I was thinking of wanting to help FNF.  Then I thought, well here I'm more important to MJ, in that I'm MJ's teacher for the year.  And I do generally feel that way.  But today I just got mad, and uh, instead of there I could perhaps do something to help him, I didn't.  Or at least, I negated whatever I might have started by doing.  Uhm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   How'd you like to be a psychiatrist?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  How would I like to be?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   It kind of sounds like that's really the sort of idea you're p—, you know, behind this.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Interrupting) Yeah, well I used to play with that. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And by used to, I mean you know, way back when I was in high school when I thought I could help all these friends who would talk to me about things.  And I'd always feel, well I can really see their problems.  But uh, I don't know, (cough) well, when I used to think it re—, more recently about child psychiatry, but uhm, (sigh) well, then thinking of what's happened here, I, I just think I never could have the patience.  And that I want to — if I decide I want to help somebody — I want to do something and have immediate results.  And uhm, which all must get back to how I think, when I'm fighting you, I'm fighting you by not changing immediately.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, this seems to be kind of getting off uhm, I don't know, I mean it's thoughts I've had sort of in mind with uhm, (sigh) reactions, anyway, that could lead me into thinking about being a psychiatrist.  Or just what people in general, but I, I, I think also of 2 things.  Uh, one was — and this is my reaction when you brought up MJ today, as did I, had I been thinking of him as somebody who needed help — uhm, because I don't know, I went through a period where it seemed to me that practically everybody at LKC — and I think it might be true, anyway — but, that practically everybody at LKC needed some kind of help beyond which a teacher is equipped to give. </p>

<p>And, uhm, and then I began to think, well I'm really being rather extreme.  And maybe it's because I'm coming here, and so I'm seeing some things, and not all things, and just getting kind of carried away.  And, so I guess, uhm, this year in a way, I'm sort of trying to go the opposite way, of not jumping to that conclusion all the time.  Uhm, and MJ's mother — I don't know about MJ's father, because I've never met him — but his mother is very much like him.  So I, I don't know, I think, well, that might be just the way the family is, too. </p>

<p>Although Mrs. BBF and I were talking about MJ today, and apparently there is some difficulty, because of the 2 younger children, and how much attention MJ actually gets.  And that explains to me a little more, why he always talks about his brother and sister, as breaking his things, and ruining his things.  And he's always making things for them.  And uhm, he's very impatient with things he makes, if they're not exactly right.  So I've seen him destroy his own things.  But his stories always are from home, that his brother and sister ruin everything. </p>

<p>And uh, but I just have been resisting thinking of him as needing any help beyond what we in the classroom can do.  Uhm, and then I always get angry at him, I don't, I don't quite understand uh, I mean, this kind of a blow-up I had with him today, was more major, because I handled him physically.  But there've been other times where, I know he needs help, and I know he can't not do what he's doing.  But he's very disruptive in the room, when we're, especially at the beginning of the year, when we were trying to get the group together.  And, because he was, he was the one — I don't know if I mentioned him — that would suddenly walk right through the middle of the group, if we might be having a discussion, or something, and start talking, and be unaware that something else was going on.</p>

<p>And, so sometimes then I'd get extremely annoyed at him, and uh, he's being a lot better.  So I don't know, maybe I did handle it the right way.  But I'd always feel upset after I got angry, because I think, well, his behavior was right in line with his problems, and so I had no right to get angry. </p>

<p>And, well then, the other thing I was thinking of, is the one that was bothering me very much after this meeting, uhm, yesterday.  And, I mean, it has for a while, I guess, in terms of what Mrs. BBF might really be.  As nice as she is, in some respects, to work for, and as many good ideas as she has.  But that handshaking issue kind of got down to maybe what she feels are nice manners.  And then, just the way I've seen her handle children, anyway.  And there seems to be a certain lack of warmth, and uh, understanding.  And she very much approves of something like what I did with MJ today. </p>

<p>Because when I was telling her, uh, I was saying, I really feel I handled it poorly by being so physical with him.  And if he goes home upset, you may get a call from his mother, I won't, because I wouldn't be there by the time the call came back.  So I thought you should know what did go on, so you would be able to talk to the mother.  And uhm, and she just kept saying, "Oh no, I think you did just the right thing." </p>

<p>And, well anyway, this all has led me a—, oh, and then some—, something came up about guns in school, because apparently in one of the classes, a lot of the kids had been bringing in guns.  And there's a rule, policy, no guns.  And uhm, I don't know, I just got this feeling that some of the th,th, the, the atmosphere Mrs. BBF is creating, by some of the things she wants done, is a very cold and unfriendly atmosphere.  And uh, so it's creating the kind of feelings that end up causing people to war against each other.  And this barring guns is kind of a meaningless gesture, then.  Because the basic feelings are being generated when uh, well sometimes maybe they could even be played out with the guns, rather than, I mean, I don't like having a lot of guns in the room, either.  But I don't like this blanket no, our policy, no guns. </p>

<p>And, so anyway, I was just kind of thinking of making children end up being adults who think wars are the right methods of solving problems.  And uhm, (Pause) I don't know, I feel as if I've sort of gotten off the subject. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   You sound as though you feel under a lot of pressure, here, right now.  I mean, you have today.  Feeling guilty about FNF, and MJ, and the blazer.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well something else is mm, mm, mm, because when I stopped today, and said I feel as if I'm getting off the subject, I felt uhm, (sigh) mm, I'm not sure what about it, because I know I once talked to you about, when I was reading that book uhm, about play therapy.  So it isn't as if you had no idea I had these ideas.  But it bothers me, in some way, that you asked that about my thinking about being a psychiatrist, and I'm not sure why.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, what do you think about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Uh, I think my reaction at the time was, that w—, you'll think I'm again, presumptuous, to think such a thing.  But then, now I think, well maybe it means, that I'm thinking I could do it better than, you, or something like that.  Meaning, I suppose, changing me, I don't know.  (Sniff, Sigh)  Because then, then what I think next is, of whenever it was recently, your pointing out that I had made some progress, yesterday.  And, and particularly that day when I was thinking about not being responsible here, and you said well, in a certain way I had been, because of making a certain amount of progress.  And I didn't like to think of that.  And I was concentrating then on, because of the way I think of the word "responsibility".  But maybe now, I've gotten away from that, and am just thinking about progress, so that I'm resisting again, I don't know.  </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, as though the idea had really frightened you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because that's another aspect of thinking about being a psychiatrist that might have bothered me when you asked that.  Because, one thing it does suggest to me, is that I'd have to make a lot of progress, or have finished making progress, to really entertain the idea.  And then, if I don't want to make the progress, well th—, uhm — (Silence)</p>

<p>Uhm, I don't know quite why these 2 things come to my mind, except since they both involve a certain perversity, a,a, and it disturbs me.  But the first thing I thought of, was of uhm, a call I got last night.  And at first, the woman sounded quite well-spoken, and so I thought, well maybe this is going to be a good candidate, because, well, I haven't told you, I guess, that FDO ha—, did call back to say she would take the job.  So tha—, finally settled it.  But she called later in the evening, and uhm, this woman called before we knew. </p>

<p>So I was listening to her, and I was trying to get out as much as I could about her experience, and background, and so forth.  And uhm, then I began to realize, that she was evading all my questions.  And that as we talked, it got worse and worse.  And uhm, and finally I decided that she sounded like somebody I definitely would never want to hire.  But she seemed to need to talk.  And, at first, I still took her as somebody who was honestly calling about the job, but just was having problems keeping the direction of why she called.  And w—, and it wasn't until this last thing that I began to think, well, maybe she's just calling because she needs to talk, and uses ads as a way to call people. </p>

<p>But the last thing of it, she asked for my uhm, well w—, well she'd asked where we live long before I realized what was happening.  And I had told her, and so she was talking and talking.  And then she said, where did you say you lived, again.  And I said, "At PSN," in PWE.  And she said, uh, "Oh, I used to work up there.  I think I worked somewhere in there for a week." And said, "I shouldn't tell you this.  They probably still live here," and then proceeded to tell me. </p>

<p>And I didn't, meanwhile I'm thinking well, I could be nasty and just say something very abrupt and cut her off.  Or I could let her talk.  And I felt quite trapped, because I didn't want to stay on the phone.  But, and I kept trying to get back to questions that were ones that would keep her on, why she claimed she called.  And uh, and I was getting a bit more abrupt as the thing went on. </p>

<p>But anyway, and then she told a story about this family that uh, was something to do with anyway, a possible adopted child, and uhm, the parents treating her sadistically, or doing something to do her in a room that they'd lock.  And they'd have a chair with a hole, with no seat in it, actually.  And they'd throw the child around the room, and then sort of throw her into this chair.  And, actually at this point, I kept thinking, how would this woman know, the doors were locked and she wasn't in there.  But uhm, I was sort of interested to see what she was going to tell me.  I was kind of enjoying that part of it.  And then I think, maybe that's what's bothering me, too.  That when she began to tell this story, I was getting kind of curious.  And, because at least it was more interesting than what she'd been saying before. </p>

<p>Uhm, and then the other thing I thought of was, uhm, now I can't remember.  Oh, I know, it was something that uhm, MEINZ had been at our house Saturday, and MEINZ and FENI.  And at one point, it fit into the conversation more than it seems now, I don't know, I can't remember how it did.  But he, he mentioned something about a man that he has been treating.  Uh, I guess, in therapy, not analysis.  And the man came to him very excited one day, because he'd had a, the best sexual experience he'd ever had with his wife.  And then it turned out that their 3 year old daughter had been in bed with him, and the man hadn't made the connection.  But MEINZ felt that was the whole reason that the experience had been the best, to him, that there'd ever been. </p>

<p>And that really upset me at the time, when — I mean, just because of thinking of the daughter being there, and being aware of what was going on, to some extent.  Uhm, but now I don't think I, I mean initially I wasn't thinking of it, because of having been very upset when MEINZ told of that.  But uhm, I thought of it at the same time of thinking of the story of this woman.  And I don't quite see why I think of those things, now.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Mm, and I'm thinking of that woman again, rather than thinking of why I thought (Laughs) of either of those things.  I, I was just thinking of something that had surprised me, because she said it at the beginning of the conversation it didn't seem to me really apply, and then she tried to make it apply.  Uh, but then after that story, which at the time, I couldn't at first tell if she really were telling something that had happened, or not.  But after she got into it for a while, I began to feel she was just making it up. </p>

<p>But anyway, the thing she said at the beginning, and then it just, I don't know, makes me feel she really was disturbed, is uh, I think I asked her what experience she'd had with children, sh, she was very vague in answering.  And then just suddenly announced she didn't like sadists.  And then the conversation ended, because after that story I felt I had to be firmer with her than I had been, up to that point.  Uh, but she ended with a story o, of practically, sounded like she was presenting it as these parents being sadistic to this child.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because then, that makes me think of the way I treated MJ again, and, and it makes me feel I, well, I don't know if that's really the way to use the word "sadism", but uhm, that somehow there was an aspect of that, in what I did to him.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I mean that mainly because I knew uhm, very quickly after I began reacting this way, I knew that what I was doing was something that disturbed him more than other m—, ways of handling it.  And that then he would be reacting to what I was doing, rather than to the original situation that had set it all off.  And uhm, and I wanted to disturb him, because he was making me so angry.  But then I get back to, but he shouldn't have been making me so ang—, or I shouldn't have, it didn't seem to me that I should be feeling that anger, because he is a child that needs help.  And —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.

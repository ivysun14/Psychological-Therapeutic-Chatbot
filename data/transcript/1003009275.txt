<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty good.  I had a hearing yesterday, had the oral hearing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> EEO or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What was that about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Other important stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because they said they had, um, you know, they had, we had done the level that, they weren't doing, going to do anything?  I had, gave you a copy over there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, then they, um, he, uh, [NAME OTHER] sent a letter over there that, to, um, that you guys, that they were basing it on the '65, 1965, uh, when I first -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, they -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Noticed, had the problem, you know, when they put the special shoes on me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we started with that yesterday with the lady from [DEIDENTIFIED] and, um, you know, she didn't ask any questions but she didn't have it, she goes, so you just went to go see the, well, they had your stuff that you sent?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, she goes, so you went from 2005 until 2008 with seeing the doctors, said what?  And [NAME OTHER] says what are you, what are you talking about?  I have no records, and I'm like, he has, I mean, you know, all the records from all the doctors that I've seen from [DEIDENTIFIED] to [DEIDENTIFIED], the orthopedic specialist -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you have them with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, he has a copy of them, so he sent them up there because, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I, either they, well, he said they, um, that's happened before, that they say they don't have them early, did something with them, regardless, but this, this is the second, third copy he sent [INAUDIBLE] because I know he sent it twice [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When did I see, yeah, three, four times and since then.  Send it Registered Mail, don't matter.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They threw, that threw me off because, you know, we got, I, I had, we had talked before what she, they were going ask and then, um, she's like and, and I'm like, what?  [LAUGHING].  I said, I seen enough doctors, I can't remember all their names.  God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sounds like you did all right, then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, hopefully.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long do you, do they have to tell you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ninety days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But if it, I mean, the outcome is what it should be, you know, it'll be great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, should be.  That's, that's just as, astounding that they do that.  Well now, what are we doing, the Zoloft?  Just 100 mg?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it working with you, say?  Hm.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was thinking, let me ask you a question.  Is, is it bad to take, um, Zoloft with, uh, phentermine?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I was thinking I was going to see a diet doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, well, go on and try it, I mean, the trouble is, they're similar drugs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, they are?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They sort, they sort of add up on each other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I thought that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I thought the Zoloft was a downer, or, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Phentermine is like a upper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, yeah, but the way they work in your brain is different -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's like the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING], [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fen-Phen?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, no, I don't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I did take, I did take [INAUDIBLE] back, um, when Prozac first came out, and, um, because I wasn't, I wasn't, um, where Eli Lilly is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED], my friend lives there, we were over there and, um, it was supposed to be the new diet drug, and [LAUGHING], I was taking, uh, Prozac with phentermine, of course, that didn't work that way for me, but, that's what they were touting -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It as, it probably has a skinny people, they [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, oh God.  Well, those drugs scare me a little, but I never prescribe them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Phentermine?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and the Fen-Phen stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I took, I took the phenorm, Fen-Phen when it first came out, didn't do nothing for me.  But, um, the phentermine, I've taken, I've taken off and on since I was in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think you'll be all right with it, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, if you start getting, uh, muscle twitching and restless and sweating, you better stop one of them, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I, I always sweat, though.  My God, that's, I do that big time.  But that's from the Synthroid, so [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you want to lose some weight?  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'd like to lose some weight or just, I don't want to gain it.  But at least it's getting warmer now, I can get in the pool.  That's one thing good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's one thing good, because, you know, other, otherwise I'm dead, so tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I get off of work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your sleeping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's okay, uh, I get a, well, see, now, I got another problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My wrist.  I wake up at night -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're hurting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean killing me and I, I went to a [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] sent me to a neurologist and a cardiologist and they did all the, a carotid artery study and my heart study and a -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's, the neurologist did, um, oh, a MR arm, MRI of my spine, and everything came back okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, now I'm seeing this other doctor, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], he's a hand specialist?  And I been going to therapy because I mean, I wake up in so much pain, and they're, they're not, I get, I go, they go numb.  I don't know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a, that's a workman's comp.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, but I mean, it just, well, the neurologist said, um, there was nothing wrong with me, but then I'm like, okay, but he wanted to do a shot in my neck to deaden the sensation; I'm like, if there's nothing wrong with me, why do you want to do a shot?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, good question.  What'd he say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, he said it, because something is, something's there, but they, and I said, what is it?  And he's like, he can't give me an answer.  He wouldn't give me, he couldn't give me an answer.  And, so then, that's when I said, you know, I think it, I think it is carpal tunnel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, you see, they're going numb now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what'd he say about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I didn't, I had, I already, when he said about the shot, I was like, oh, and, and then he said, more pain medicine, and I'm like, I take enough pain medicine.  I don't need any more, you know?  So, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went to see this [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, nobody did the test where they put a needle -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he did it on this side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, he did it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He did this side, because this is my worst side and he said nothing was wrong with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it didn't show up on a test.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  And I, and I'm like, okay, and, but, I just, um, he was very adamant about, you know, I don't have this and I don't have that, and I was trying to say, then what do I have, and he's like, and he goes, I don't know what else to do for you except do the shot.  So that's when I just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, uh, stopped it right, you know, I, I said, oh, okay, thank you very much, and I left and that's when I went and found a doctor for my hands because something is wrong, you know, I mean, they go numb and at night I wear, um, the splints on, and it does help.  It does help, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, from wearing the splints?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The splints, but um, I'm supposed to have that real test, from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], [DATE], uh, to see if it is carpal tunnel or whatever it is, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, oh, okay.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then after that, then if, if it is, because I told them, I said, you know, I don't understand this.  If it is carpal tunnel, don't I have to have a, a certain amount of time before I get workman's comps on it, or something like that?  I don't know how it works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're pretty much going to need that test to be positive for the workman's comp.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, so then it starts from right then and there, when the doctor says its workman's comp and it's done, I mean, it's, it's carpal tunnel, but he has to say it's from the job, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, which is a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A no brainer, in my opinion.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, I mean, there's, and that's exactly what I told my therapist, I said, I don't do anything, you know, I'm not on the computer -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Except for -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you spend -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the point is, you spend years and years doing -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> On the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Repetitive -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been doing it for 25 years, you know, and that's what -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The whole thing is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, they paid for the initial thing, now we'll see if they pay for any more, [LAUGHING], on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, Blue Cross?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, workman's comp.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, they did?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They paid for the first visit and the write up.  And maybe the second visit, so we'll see what they do, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, last week I went, or, no, it was around the [DATE] I went to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and had to pay $150.00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I don't do that to you, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's a lot of money.  But I mean, if it gets what I need to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] a point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it should be done, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well, you might need another Zoloft prescription.  Heh.  You, you're getting through this now, now that you had that hearing and got to present your stuff -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Did you, did you write on there on the Ambien, because I know I ca, because last time I forgot to get a prescription, I don't know how many refills you made of it.  How many do you usually make of it, three?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but it, it could be anything.  [INAUDIBLE], the CR?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's the CR.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] better give you another one.  All righty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, come back in about a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Keep taking the meds, and hope that they don't take 90 days, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.  Maybe when she sees this stuff, the information from the other doctors, she'll -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing that will do it, to tell you the truth.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your week been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good, doing, the stuff worked real well that you give me.  To, or, uh, what you call it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ambien?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did I give you samples?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, uh, you just gave me a prescription.  Do you fill it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it a little white pill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Little white pill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They, uh, they only gave me like 14 of them, now, and you're 30, but my mom said something about insurance, you got to do that early and you go back and get more [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, those [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, it's your insurance doing that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There was, and I think it was only like $5.00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you, all right.  And do you use it every night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because my mom said the pharmacist told her no, to not to do that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Take it every night, but why would I get it and not take it every night?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just do what I tell you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if you're, if you worked in the yard all day and you're dead tired, you know, you don't need to take it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, so you've been working, or what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  Trying to figure out what summer class I'm going to take, because I got to register soon.  I've been working about 25 hours a week.  I might get a second job [INAUDIBLE] this summer, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you officially finish the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not yet, but soon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  What do you got to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm paying them today, so I got to pay them today and I'm going to talk to them and see what's going on with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That helps [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you, this Ambien 10 mg was the first Ambien that came out.  So they only did their studies for two weeks, I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It got approved for two weeks.  Then they were smart enough, and this was [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Years ago?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eight, 10 years ago.  They were smart enough the next time when they came out with CR-</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's the difference?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, CR releases half right away and half four hours later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And what's the point of that?  Isn't the point to just put -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Put -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You to sleep?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or some, well some -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or to keep you to sleep?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, theoretically.  It's for people who wake up during the night.  But they tested it for six months, so they got, then FDA approved that for six months, and the old one, which is just as good, only has two weeks, so the insurance company decides to play that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, and make their money off of you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And everybody knows it's the same [INAUDIBLE] drug.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'll do it that way, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The other than that, I've been coming home on time since I was here last.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Try not to piss my parents off as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, listen.  My son, I do, I don't know if I told you, he came back when he was in his 20s after he got divorced, and lived with us for about a year.  But I didn't have to tell him but once, don't be coming in late all the time because, you know, your mother wakes up and that's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you weren't here, that wouldn't happen.  You know [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  That's funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But he, did, yeah, no trouble with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, okay.  Hope you get done all this shit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, any other problems with your parents or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you just keep things calm?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Keep it calm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any girlfriends you go out with or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, there's nothing serious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's, [INAUDIBLE], right now you don't have a real predictable life anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you going to do about driving?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, after I pay this probation today, it's the next thing I'm paying off.  I'm, I only got to pay 220 bucks and I get my license back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then after that, figure out a car, so that hopefully will be in about two weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you do need a second job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.  It's all about the money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, it is important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I just saw a sign on a car, it said "Life is about ass, kicking it, kissing it, covering it, getting it."  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  That's funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For mom's sake, we'll go another two weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Please, keep things in synch.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

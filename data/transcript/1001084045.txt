<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so the way we're going to think of these is like panic attacks.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have lots of panic.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have in addition to this panic attack?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] panic attack.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A panic attack has to be out of nowhere.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The drive is a phobia.  We call that a phobia because it's about something specific.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is out of nowhere, right, you all the sudden get nervous and chest pain.  Do you get short of breath too?  Do you get sweaty palms?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel like you're going to die?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You just get this pain and anxiety and it lasts for a while?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It lasts for a while.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Has this ever happened before?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And like one time I tried eating like maybe thinking like the food would make it go, it doesn't matter, nothing makes it go away, like the Tums didn't make it go away, food didn't make it go away, like nothing made it go away.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Listen, it could be something minor medical, nothing big medical, it could be something minor medical that's kicked off by anxiety.  I want to check your blood pressure.  I'll do kind of the poor mans version.  Even so, you should let it be [INAUDIBLE] to the doctor and at least be thinking about this also.  How's your mood?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's all right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it low when that happens?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your anxiety level is high, right?  Have you noticed that she's not as well mood wise?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, as a matter of fact, she's doing good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She has.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I had a great time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You did.  Were you revved up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I just had a really good time. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You weren't manic?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your blood pressure is great, 109/87, it's low even, which is what we want.  A lot of us would kill for that blood pressure and your pulse is 87, which is just right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She stopped smoking.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The other thing is I can't drink coffee anymore.  For some reason, coffee will make me nauseous for like two and a half months now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know why.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know why either but it's really upsetting to me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so your anxiety is a bit higher.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think it was the ulcer. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's not, if it were serious we would see more, it would blossom into something bigger.  Coming and going like this, it doesn't strike me as anything that we have to worry about medically.  It probably has a little medical group and then the anxiety just makes it blossom so our goal here is to push down that anxiety, to make the panicking stuff not set it off.  How's your appetite?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're sleeping okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not completely.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's wrong with your sleep?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just like the past week or two.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's wrong with your sleep?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't sleep.  That's why I took the Klonopin.  I took the Klonopin over the weekend to see how it would be waking up in the morning.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Has your energy been higher than it has been?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My energy is fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's good even though you're not sleeping?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How many hours are you sleeping?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sleeping like 3.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're sleeping 3 hours a night and you're not tired?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Have you noticed that?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, I haven't seen [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you find you talk too much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does she talk too much?  Do thoughts race?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But not more than normal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No more than normal. </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Regular.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Racing though.  Is your self esteem high or low or normal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's normal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not arrogant?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have any suicidal thinking?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is your concentration okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you hearing anything that's not really there?  Any crazy ideas?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not paranoid in any way?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sure?  Is that your beeper?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Probably, sorry.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's all right.  I just want to make sure I'm not [INAUDIBLE].  Are you getting pleasure normally, enjoying things?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like what, what do you enjoy?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Going out.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The beach.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The beach.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The kids, she had a good summer with the kids.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Friends.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What did you do over the summer?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Went to the beach and went to [DEIDENTIFIED] for a week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the kids are thriving?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They're doing nicely and you're managing as a mother?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're doing okay.  So your family is well?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's been an excellent summer.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's great.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The kids are happy, she's happy, her husband was happy, everybody was happy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the better you do, the better you will do.  I've said that before, I wanted you to</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think now the problem is, you know what I really think the problem is, I think that my husband isn't working right now so I think that has a lot to do with not sleeping and</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He's not working?  So what does he do?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's home.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> He's laid off.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He's just home all the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I think that whole thing is just maybe, I'm worried about that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you worry about money?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm worried about money, I'm worried about him being home all the time, I'm worried about everything, I think that's</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're in a bit of a state?  An anxious state.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And what are the chances it will, what kind of work does he do?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's a heavy equipment operator.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So will he get a job?   Do things look okay for him to get a job?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, he says he can't find a job.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> He'll work.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He'll work.  So this will be temporary, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I hope so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you believe?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, he's a hustler, he'll work.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He will.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> This is only his second week.  [INAUDIBLE] he'll work.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well listen, life happens, life happens to everyone and we just hope that when life happens to us, our brains are okay enough to manage.  Life is [INAUDIBLE] with your troubles with your kids and, you know, whatever, life happens to you.  It looks like you manage it okay.  Is that fair to say, she manages it okay, and so you'll manage this, you'll manage this.  I think you need a little help right now with anxiety only, everything else is in a good place, right?  Let's just run through what you're taking.  You're on Trileptal 600 mg, you're on Geodon 160 mg, you're on Wellbutrin 450 mg, you're on Lithium 1350, you're on Topamax, how much Topamax do you take?  I have here between 50 and 100.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Between 50 and 100, I take 50 in the morning and I always don't take 100 in the afternoon.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So 50.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I definitely take 50.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so sometimes you take more.  Does it help your appetite?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I just started going back on it because I didn't take it for a long time and then I gained a lot of weight, so I just went on it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you think it helps.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, it definitely helps as long as you take it but I stopped taking it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does it help your moods at all or no?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know about my moods but it definitely helps my [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so we'll keep you on that.  I think, I'm between two things, one is we could just chase these anxious states with some Ativan and the beautiful thing about Ativan is when you put it under your tongue, it'll work in a minute, it'll work right away and contain the anxiety.  On the other hand, it sounds like you're really anxious a lot of the time, it's not just this, it's that you're in a bit of a chronic state of anxiety, right?  You're more anxious than you should be all the time, is that fair to say?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Most of the time, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] all the time.  Up to two or three weeks ago when [NAME OTHER] got laid off, you were anxious?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes, not all the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not all the time.  All right, so this is kind of acute because he got laid off, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is happening now.  Here's how it works, Klonopin is a 12 hour drug so to turn the volume down on anxiety round the clock, all I need to put you on is a morning dose of Klonopin and a nighttime and you're covered round the clock.  If your anxiety level drops down, let's say [NAME OTHER] gets to work and you're not anxious, the same dose of Klonopin is going to make you tired.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you, but you have to pay attention.  If it starts making you tired, it means you have to lower the dose or stop it but for now, it's not going to make you tired because you have enough anxiety to mop up, so I'd like to put you on a round the clock Klonopin.  You're taking a nighttime dose anyway, I just want to give you a morning dose also, but around the clock, let's cover the anxiety all the time and then what's going to happen is eventually you're going to get better and it's going to make you tired, you're just going to find that the Klonopin makes you tired.  You must, must, must reduce it at that point, does that make sense to you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you in favor of doing that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Turning the volume down on the anxiety.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's going to make this thing go away?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Everything else I don't want to touch.  Now do you need the Inderal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  The Inderal is great.  I didn't take that for a long time, I started taking it this week and it is like the best thing in the world.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I took it because I have to address envelopes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm doing work for this company and it's just great.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For the tremor or for the anxious?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, for the tremor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's also good for anxiety in that it turns off the physical part of anxiety, the fast heart rate, the sweaty palms, all of that stuff.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And also, I think when I stopped smoking, I'm shaking because I stopped smoking and it took, because I was shaking one day so bad and I took one and it was just, I stopped shaking.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So what's your dose, I have here 40.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because they have a long acting one I can give you if you really like the Inderal.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I really like it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I can give you, did you take one today?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not yet, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because with your blood pressure that low, I don't want you taking too much because it lowers blood pressure.  It's a good old blood pressure medicine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I took one yesterday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I can't push your blood pressure down too much from where you are now, so just use the, you have 40's, right?  Do you know your dose?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 40.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 40 and you take it just once in the morning or you take it three times a day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, just once in the morning.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Doesn't it wear off after 8 hours or so?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I take one like eleven o'clock and then I'm good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're good to go?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so let's keep you on that, that's fine.  Do you want me to write for the 80's and you break them or 40 is fine?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 40 is fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so let's run through this.  Now we haven't checked your Lithium level in a while.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What you should do, when you go to the regular doctor to get everything checked out, just remind him to draw a Lithium level, okay?  You should be checked for thyroid regularly, Lithium level, and things like anemia, all basic stuff that should be checked.  When's the last time your thyroid was checked, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like two years ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it was fine?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> So her thyroid, the Lithium level</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And then the basic, I mean a routine exam would be to check cholesterol, check anemia, you know, blood counts on the blood, all that stuff, that's the normal stuff.  The stuff I need and, you know, for most people thyroid is normal too, the doctor doesn't need me to tell him that, as a psychiatrist, I want to see thyroid and Lithium.  I can write it down for you just to remind but you don't have, you're not getting nauseous?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If your Lithium level goes too high, you start getting sick and bad tremor but the great, the great thing about how you've done is that you've not been psychotic again in all this time.  You stayed out of that place of psychosis which has changed your world and that makes all the difference.  Mood stuff we can tweak, psychotic is what winds, it brings you into the hospital, so you've really done nicely.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Everybody has talked about it [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]  Everybody says her mood is so much better now, [INAUDIBLE] the family, you're doing very well.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's great.  Well, yeah, I mean the year before she came in to me, she was hospitalized, you know, multiple times and even through the years it was never stable, there was never a long, I think eventually, not only have we got the right meds but you got so sick of being sick, you just got tired of it, you said to yourself, that's it, that's it, I'm just going to take these things and get better now because it ain't fun anymore.  All right, so do you need presciptions?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just for the Klonopin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, now, to be honest, I don't know the exact dose of Klonopin you should be on.  You have to tune it to your level of anxiety versus sedation.  The tougher one to fine tune is the morning dose because the morning dose, I mean obviously at night if you overdo it, you know, you'll just sleep more, it doesn't matter but on the morning dose you have to get it just right where you don't have sedation but you don't have anxiety, there's some perfect place right in the middle and I want to say that perfect place is going to be somewhere between 0.25 and 1 mg, so the pills we'll give you will be the 0.5 mg, okay, 0.5 and so your morning dose, let me write this down, your morning dose you can break in half so you can take anywhere from a half a pill to two pills, okay.  So Klonopin 0.25 to 1 mg in a.m. for anxiety, right, and I'll write here in parenthesis, if sedated, reduce dose.  Then the nighttime dose, how much are you taking now at night for sleep?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was taking three.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Three of the 0.5's or the 1's?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I have here 1 as needed but I don't know, so it's taking you three of them to knock you out, to put you to sleep.  I wonder if those are 0.5's or 1's.  So you're either taking 1.5 or 3 mg.  All right, well, I'll write here up to 3 mg at night but, of course, you could take less, you know, take whatever it is and you may find that with that morning dose you may not need as much as night.  I think a lot of your nighttime dose is just to calm things down.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you'll be calmer, this thing will go away and you won't be as panicky or as anxious, okay, so use the Klonopin and then we're just going to continue the 600 Trileptal, the 160 Geodon, the 450 Wellbutrin, the 1350 Lithium, and the Inderal and Topamax.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I hate swallowing all those pills, you know, I can't stand it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you take a whole handful and just</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm having problems swallowing pills.  I gag on each one of them but I don't want you to change it, don't change it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, do you like smaller pills?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't want to change it, just leave it alone, I just hate it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well then it's especially good that you do it anyway, even though you hate it.  All right and then on the lab tests, I'll just write here check thyroid and check Lithium level the next time you see your regular doctor, all right.  Do you need prescriptions?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I need a prescription for the Klonopin.  I went to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] for a physical last year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't like him.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] you like him.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, no, you should like the doc.  [INAUDIBLE] for forty years.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So what don't you like about him?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't like, I'd rather go to another doctor I like.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I'm going to let [NAME OTHER] give you that prescription, all right?  All right, actually let me, I need you to sign this, those two X's, I'll give you a pen.  You can keep the pen, Ambien, sell some Ambien.  Klonopin 0.5 mg, all right, that you take four twice a day, 240 tablets but you know that you take it the way we just talked about it.  I need your address and everything.  And the other prescriptions we just do by phone or fax  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or whatever they call it, okay.  All right, take care.  You look great.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She is, the kids are doing well, everybody is, a little set back [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine.  Things happen in everyone's life.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Exactly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Take care of yourself.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, see you.</p>

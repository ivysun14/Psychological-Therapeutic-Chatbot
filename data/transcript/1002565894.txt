<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay so we're up and running.  How are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, all right—ish.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right—ish.  So what, I don't know where the microphone is so we'll find out eventually we'll just leave it sitting there on the, um, so fill me in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I stopped the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, like a couple days ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay it was more then a couple wasn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah like almost a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, it was worse when I was on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  What was worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was like really depressed, didn't want to do anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wasn't really eating much, cause like nothing really tasted good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I didn't want to do anything.  And like I was really easily upset, like if someone said to me I'd just get very angry pretty quickly.  Um, so when I stopped that for like a day it felt fine, I think just because, because like I stopped that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause it made you feel worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause then like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when you stopped it was like a relief.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Um, but then like the past few days I've been feeling like off where I get really annoyed very quickly with people.  And get really impatient.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but then I'm also like depressed where I don't want to do things and don't want to eat much but it's not as bad as when I was on the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's still not great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and then the other thing that happened was you went up to100 of Lamictal maybe a couple of days ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe 3 or 4 days ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was like 3 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do you notice anything good or bad for that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah not really anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's as if you're on nothing.  No side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, how bad, you know is there a glimmer of improvement from being on that medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause I think I went up on that the same time I went—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Off the Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Off the Wellbutrin, so things like for a day or 2 I felt better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But then it went back to being like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was an illusion because it was really stopping the Wellbutrin.  So, so far the Lamictal's not doing anything.  And you're familiar with [NAME OTHER]'s care right, so in [NAME OTHER]'s case the Lamictal seems to prevent highs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But doesn't protect him against feeling depressed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's why we've been looking at adding, uh, a second medicine.  And you guys are following suit with the recent research which is that antidepressants don't work very well in bi polar depression.  The only problem is sometimes they do and you know in fact, uh, I do have people who are on Lamictal and an antidepressant or some similar configuration and they're doing well.  So we always try it because it logically makes sense.  But, um, it doesn't always work.  For you the Lamictal might work if you get up to 150 or 200 mg a day, cause that's typically where people land and at that level it might work.  But, uh, it might be what [NAME OTHER] has where you know you're not getting high anymore which wasn't a particular big problem for you, but you're still feeling down.  And then we might be adding a second medicine.  So the question and your mom calls me every couple of days and we have these little chats, which is fine, the question is when are you starting school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm moving half my stuff in on the [DATE] and the other half on the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I'm staying there starting the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when do classes start?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE], okay so we have essentially 2 more weeks to try and get you all better.  But again that's the goal, but if, if you're not all better we want you as better you know we'd really like you to be better enough that you feel comfortable starting school and you're not worried.  And you know the goal of being all better in, in the very near future.  So that's the real decision, we're marching up on the Lamictal you can't go faster then you're allowed to go although we went a few days early on going up to 100.  I, I wouldn't feel comfortable with going up again for a week.  I'd feel okay going up to 150, you, you increased it on Monday maybe?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah?  So, uh, next Monday we can go up to 150 and if it's not bothering you and, and it seems like it's certainly not doing any harm I think periodically go up to 200 the following Monday.  So then you're really on Lamictal.  So the question is should we add a second medicine.  Now not knowing whether you're going to need it or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what I mean?  And the pros would be we're trying to move it along.  The cons would be, the only con I can really think of is, we wouldn't know whether you were better, if you got better because you were on Lamictal plus X because you were on Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that's not a big problem because maybe over Christmas break if you really were very interested, we could try and slowly taper down or maybe even next summer if the other medicine's not causing any problems.  Or maybe during the school year.  We could slowly taper down the other one and check do we still really need this one or not.  So do you have a preference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I'd rather just start something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'd rather add and try and push things forward.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and then based on so far, which was we tried Zoloft we tried Wellbutrin, they both made you worse.  There are many other antidepressants.  But so far neither of you seem to tolerate or benefit from antidepressants.  So if we put those aside then, um, we're looking at adding a second mood stabilizer which is the direction that the research suggests.  And what we're doing with [NAME OTHER] is we added Lithium.  Because in his case, he did notice that he felt better on it before but he felt dulled and slowed down and he wanted to come off of it.  But that was at a higher dose that was at 1,200 mg a day.  Now he's only on 600 mg a day and that might be the secret, would be to try and just put you on a little bit.  Put you on 300 maybe for a week, see if you're a little bit better but you know no cigar, it's not bothering you maybe put you on 600.  That would be my idea with Lithium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The other option we talked about, uh, was this medicine Invega, which is different then Abilify which you've been on.  And what was the other one that you were on?  Were you on another one or it was just [NAME OTHER] that was on another one?  [NAME OTHER] was on Zyprexa.  Abilify made both of you rattley, Zyprexa made him very tired.  And so I'm guessing it might do the same for you and so I was thinking of putting you on one that is kind of in between.  But the, uh, that's the one that I say I, my concern about it is that it does elevate prolactin, that hormone that you secret when you're pregnant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so in a young woman it's common to cause that side effect and I was thinking maybe we'd—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Steer away from it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah maybe we would put that after, maybe we'd try Lithium first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, [NAME OTHER]'s now on 2 Lithium a day right?  Do you speak to him about this at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not sure.  I know he's on Lithium but I don't know how—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think we just increased to 2 um Lithium is a funny medicine.  It's, you had chemistry in high school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what Lithium is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just under sodium on the periodical table.  It's a little tiny like molecule and you just pee it out, there's no metabolism so Lithium and Lamictal is in a way a nice combination because they're just totally different.  They work differently, uh, in fact the usual thinking is that Lamictal is a little better for treating depression and Lithium is a little better at treating mania, but you guys are both wrong way highways anyway, so you know we're actually doing it the opposite.  It doesn't matter as long as you feel better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Both have the potential to do both, but in certain people they do one thing better then another.  So, um, but the potential downsides of Lithium include some people feel tired, or they're dulled, or they might experience weight gain.  Um, those would be the main ones, if they, all the side effects are dose related, if I put you on 1,800 mg a day you'd get a different doctor, you'd hate me, but if we put you on 300 or 600 it might fly under the radar.  It might be so little that you don't notice much and you feel okay.  So that's what I was thinking, just mirroring what we're doing with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It seems to have been the best thing that we have done so far.  Um, and you know you hear about, a lot about Lithium like some people have a strong bias against it because it sounds like something that people are on in the 50's and they were crazy and it's terrible.  Do you have any of that?  You don't have any preconceptions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You, you've not heard about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just think it's kind of cool because it's an element.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah so see for you it's an up side.  Um, uh, some people think of it in a negative way because they equate it with some of the older medicines because it is an older medicine that have been used for a long time.  And they think about very seriously ill people who are in the psychiatric hospital.  And again it's true it's an older medicine but used properly it's probably under you know, it's a medicine that has a very nice use for many people and the young psychiatrists now sometimes don't use it as much because they tend to use the newer more heavily marketed medicines, rather then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What has the best evidence of showing that it might help somebody.  And again it's, it's considered very side effective.  But in a dose related way.  So there's some medicines if you're going to get the side effect it doesn't matter, even on how little you'll get the side effect.  Lithium clearly the side effects go up as you go up in dose.  Uh, the one important thing to, uh, talk about with Lithium is that on the low dose that you're on it probably would never happen, but it, uh, a common side effect with Lithium is it makes you pee more.  It, it, your body thinks of it like sodium so it kind of pulls more fluid into your kidneys.  So it tends to make you pee more so you have to make sure you replace fluids which you would do normally.  But if you were you know at the beach and it was really hot and sweaty and you weren't replacing fluids your concern, you'd be peeing a lot and not replacing so your concentration of Lithium would go high and then you'd encounter the higher side effects.  You might get tremulous, you might get you know confused or sedated or things like that.  So the important thing is to remember if you're on Lithium that you, uh, you need to replace the fluids and salt.  That's why people drink Gatorade, you know they're competing because it replaces fluids and a little bit of sugar and, and electrolytes like salt.  So if you're in you know working out or what not you need to replace fluids and salt or if you got a GI virus and you're throwing up a lot, same thing.  You'd be shrinking your, your total body fluids and after the place [INAUDIBLE].  But on the dose that we're giving you I'm, I'm thinking that might never happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right?  So your, you're down with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right do you have any questions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.  Um, I actually I have a tendency to get like more light headed and almost pass out from the heat and stuff already so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That would be—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you don't know why that is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really I mean first I thought it might be like low blood pressure—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But like I don't know I just more like if I'm out in the sun I tend to, either almost faint or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you not drink, do you not normally—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't' think, I mean like I don't think I'm not drinking enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause some people do and some people don't.  I don't automatically, if I'm working I the yard I never feel like oh I'm sweating a lot I'm really thirsty I have to have a drink.  I never feel that way.  I do it only cause I know from experience that I get you know light headed if I stand up quickly or I get more muscle aches you know more lactic acid build up if I don't drink a lot of fluids.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah like any time I stand up usually it's like where you can't see for a little while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So to me it sounds like you are, either your blood pressure drops because of you know vasodilatation you know in the heat and or you're not replacing fluids.  So you have to be more attentive to that, if you go to the beach or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know you go back to school in September there's going to be some hot days and what not so just have to be aware of it.  I don't want you conking on the cement—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bang your head on the awning or something.  All right so what else is doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You look like you're not terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it's worse, I was bad yesterday because we went bowling because my dad stayed home from work and they wanted to do something.  My brother didn't really want to go anywhere—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we went bowling and like I was fine for like the very beginning, but then I just started getting really, really annoyed and everything seemed really loud and like annoying and then I started to get like depressed and like wanted to leave very badly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  So it's still on again, off again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Have you gone any places with the boyfriend or anything I mean have you done more things like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah we've had a bunch of like going away parties for people for college.  I mean he had one for himself that I helped with, but then like towards the middle of that I started to feel like really agitated and so I like, I'm just like upset and so I just like hid for like 45 minutes because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't want anyone to talk to me.  And like, after I got people to like get through it where like it just took me a while—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For it to like pass I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Where's he going to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how are you dealing with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right I mean we're supposed to see each go to the other school once a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just hoping I'm not like where I can't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right, but you're feeling comfortable with the idea of having a long distance relationship, it's a change.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah well I mean like it was similar the last—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah it was a little bit long distance, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah so I mean I think it will be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well how about if he comes to you first?  You know I mean I'm just thinking—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm still feeling like you're going to be better, but it may not be on [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so you know we might have to nurse you a little bit the first few weeks.  But I'm still hoping that very early in this semester you're going to feel better, better and then hopefully sail through, that's what we're shooting for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any other thoughts, questions, anything else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right so let me shut this off, uh—</p>

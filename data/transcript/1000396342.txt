<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence) Hmm, I'm thinking about a dream I had, uhm, I think Sunday night, and uhm, I recalled it after I got home yesterday and was puzzled.  I hadn't thought of it here (Clears throat), but now, when I'm thinking of it, I don't know, it's almost as if, when I recalled it again, I had thought well, something that I should think I'd want to talk about here.  So now, I'm sort of making myself think of it, without really wanting to. </p>

<p>And th—, I remember when I, it must have been I woke up from it, er, anyway, whenever I had immediate consciousness of it.  Uh, it was a very upsetting dream.  Now it just doesn't seem very important.  And uh, also I find it kind of hard to remember some of the details.  I, I think it was that I was dreaming uhm, that this time I was really going after the job at ZCO.  And uhm, the woman was indicating that probably I'd get it.  And then, I don't know, somehow, i—, sh—, it came out that she knew I came here, and that this might be the obstacle to my getting the job, or it was something where I hadn't said anything about coming here, and, and somehow, the person involved knew.  I, I'm just not sure whether now it was over getting that job, or not. </p>

<p>And the first thing I thought was of the girl that I told I was coming here, said something.  And then I knew that there was no connection.  So the only other thing I could think was that you told this person.  Or that you told somebody who told this person, I mean, that somehow it came from you.  And I think I felt very betrayed, then.  (Pause) I don't know, sort of a combination, in th—, in the feeling betrayed, of feeling both frightened and angry that I couldn't trust you, because I guess I was, the whole basis was I was trusting that you weren't saying anything.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And also, it seems to me, I, I, I'm not sure of this, but it — not only was I very upset when I woke up from having this dream, but that uhm, I think on Monday morning at some point, I don't know when, so may_ maybe I'm wrong on that, uhm, that I was thinking along the lines as if this dream had been reality, and uh, then I suddenly realized it had been a dream.  Maybe I dreamt it Saturday night, so then I would have thought that way Sunday, that uhm, (Sniff) —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why do you think you had the dream? </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I don't know, when I had it, I was wondering and i—, I, I only would think in terms of uh, thinking maybe there were feelings I, I didn't know I had about that job.  And uh, also thinking well, maybe there were feelings that I am not admitting to, after telling that girl about coming here.  But today, I think of it more, maybe it was a mixture of these things, but that it was during a time when I wasn't coming, because you weren't here.  (Pause) Or I suppose, it could be too, just in terms of my feelings about Christmas, that I didn't get what I wanted, or you didn't give me what I wanted.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, because whenever I uh, I don't know if when I recalled it after I left here, I was directly thinking of talking about FNAO BBK at the end, but there does seem to be a connection.  The two seem to come to my mind now. </p>

<p>ANALYST:    In what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I, it's almost as if the feeling that I got from the dream, is what made me feel (Sniff), I don't know what word to use, whether sympathetic, or understanding, or what, of what happened with FNAO BBK, and what her position must be, or have, must have been.  And I really don't know anything about her state of mind, or anything like that.  But (Sniff, 3-minute silence) —</p>

<p>I also w—, w—, keep changing in thinking about this dream, (Sniff) because this happened when I, before I started talking, uhm, and, I start thinking about uh, both yesterday and today.  Because today I went, I had FN come early, because she was coming today, so I could go to well, WKM had some sales on things I wanted to check.  And then, there were some other places I wanted to go.  And uhm, oh, and I went back to SMQ because there were some floors that I hadn't gone to, that I'd wanted when I had FSO. </p>

<p>But I keep thinking of well, one thing in particular, because FNI (Sniff) went earlier, I guess right before Christmas, to a shoe sale they were having.  And I know that last June when SMQ had their shoe sale, FNI bought some phenomenal number of shoes.  And she bought more this time.  And when I think of that, I, I didn't really look very hard at the shoe sale, because it didn't, they didn't have things out, and so you'd have to really o—, my feeling was, that I have to really need someb—, something and want something, in order to sit and ask for things.  And uh, I don't know, I just, lately — I used to love to have lots of shoes — but lately I've been using the same ones over and over.  And then I start thinking, well, FNI went in and bought so many before and she can't have worn them all out.  And then she's buying more, as if she knows some use for shoes, that I don't, or that I don't know.</p>

<p>A—, a—, I think the thing that was upsetting me, is that uhm, (Sniff) I don't know, that somehow, there might be some I would like.  There's one pair that I, I think I'm going to want to get, but I wasn't definitely decided, so I didn't want to try to get them today.  And uhm, that, I don't know, other than that, I have this feeling, here's this sale, FNI's bought a lot, I should be wanting some.  And then not really wanting them, or uhm, needing them I guess more, too, because I also feel very much I really have to need things now to get them.  Before when I was earning a salary, then I could always kind of use my money, and it didn't really matter. </p>

<p>And then I felt the same way at WKM, although I had some specific things I was looking for.  And they didn't have those things, because I was re—, I really had definite ideas.  And, but then I had this feeling, here are things on sale, I should want some, something that's on sale too.  Or maybe it's mixed up with that I had definite ideas, and that I didn't find them on sale.  (Sniff, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Mm, now I find I'm thinking about uhm, letting FNI borrow some, I don't know, those little stretch suits that — FSO has pretty much outgrown the largest size.  And most of the ones that she has in that size are ones FYC handed down to me.  And FNI was saying, I don't — she has this idea that MYDN's a lot bigger than I think he really is — but she's sort of anticipating his needing that size fairly soon.  She was asking me if I had any.  And I was just thinking about lending them to her. </p>

<p>But I don't know, it's almost again, a reluctance to lend them to her.  And I keep telling myself, well, won't matter.   I, I, almost as if I think I'll never see them again, or something awful will happen to them.  And so, what I keep thinking about them is, well they were handed down to me, and uhm, I don't know, that they're practically worn out anyway, so it won't matter if they wear out.  (Sniff, 4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I think I'm mainly thinking now about FSO's clothes and (Sniff), when I was thinking about those suits that I'm in a way, reluctant to lend to FNI, although there's really no reason.  And uhm, I try to tell myself, well it won't matter if they wear out because they're close to being worn out anyway.  Uhm, (Sniff) n—, it also makes me think of sort of a mixed feelings I have about getting FSO things. </p>

<p>Because on the one hand, sometimes I've wished that so much were not being handed down to her, so that I, I don't need to go out and get her things, and, I mean, there ar—, loopholes, but she does get a lot of things handed down.  And then I always start thinking, gee, I'd love to go out and buy her something.  There are so many cute clothes.  But yet, whenever I have gone out to buy her anything, the clothes are so expensive, I end up feeling I can't justify — at least the ones I like are, always seem to be the more expensive ones, too.  And that I can't justify spending that much.  So, I sort of fall back on what's been handed down to her again.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think th—, it sort of frustrates me to feel that way, and uhm, then I think I was thinking about FNI, and there was something — I think it was over a quilt which I've been trying to buy for FSO — or some type of, not exactly a blanket.  Something a little lighter, I mean warm, but not as actually heavy on her, uhm, that would sort of cover the area of her crib, so that she wouldn't so easily crawl out from under it.  And uh, I had seen a number that FNI had, w_ well, when FYH stayed with us, she had them with her.  And they seemed to be the type I'd like, because you can wash them and they didn't look expensive.  And FNI said they weren't, but she also told me where she'd gotten them.  When I went there, even then, prices were low_ lower than what I'd seen before, but they were still higher than I have yet been able to make up my mind to spend. </p>

<p>And so I think I'm feeling jealous because FNI's idea of what isn't expensive is different from mine, which makes it easier for her.  And also I was thinking about all the bureaus she has.  And not so much she has the bureaus, as that they're, they must be full of things.  (Sniff) And so th_ that she has all these things, and wondering what she could have in them, because she really has quite a number of bureaus.  And I'm thinking now for the kids, not, not for herself.  And uhm, I don't know, just wondering how can she fill so many bureaus.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What connection do you think uhm, your concern about these things for FSO and getting shoes has with the dream, and feeling I betrayed you? 
 
PATIENT: (Pause) Well I think it must have something to do with the feeling betrayed, then I'd feel I'd lost something, and that I'm trying to go out and buy things to make up for that.  (Pause) And maybe part of this feeling I was, frustrated by uhm, not, I don't know, feeling I couldn't justify the expense of a lot of things.  Because somehow they didn't seem what I really wanted.  Maybe it's really because they aren't going to take the place of what I'm trying to replace.  And, so they definitely aren't what I really want.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, but uhm, the additional thing is, that you connected the betrayal and the idea of remembering the dream, with thinking about uh, the BBK boys and Joan. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Well I think mm, that makes me think it's just again, sort of assuming what Joan must have been feeling, is a terrific sense of being left out.  And, and not having something too, because then it made me think of uh, how FSO sometimes, when she's been around MSCZ, mainly I guess when he's about to take a shower, has sort of looked at his penis. </p>

<p>And I don't know whether she's focusing on that beyond anything else, but she's noticing his whole body, and that's something that is, stands out.  And uhm, I didn't think it sh_ she made any reference to her own body when she was looking at it.  I said this once, that I think, more in terms of I don't think she realizes she doesn't have a penis yet.  And MSCZ said, "Oh, I think she does."  And he gets all (Sniff), I don't know, sure that she's staring at him with jealousy now, and everything.  And, but again, I don't know sort of the terms that's always put in, of the girl is in the negative position, of not having something.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, then I start thinking about (Sniff) a feeling I think I've had lately, well, anyway, I think I did last night, where on the one hand, I get to the point where — unlike sometimes when I don't even want to — that I want to do things in a way I know will please MSCZ.  But yet, then I want to be pressed and busy, with lots of things still to do, so that I'm, I'm not sort of available well, for one thing, to make love.  And for another, just to, I don't know, be with MSCZ.  And i_It's where I, as soon as he starts showing his appreciation, I sh_ shy away.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I feel as though I'm just going around in a circle, and I can't make these connections, really.  Because now I'm just thinking about  FNI again, and uhm, just from several times when we've been getting together, or she's called me, I know how varied her schedule is for nursing MYDN.  I remember it was for me with FSO.  And uhm, then I was thinking of that and I guess wondering, well, how she'll manage when she — because I think she went to only 1 class before Christmas vacation, and then she'll start again after New Years — and so I w—, I, generally it won't affect her, because one day she just has to be gone all day, so the baby has to have bottles.  And the other, she just goes in the evening.</p>

<p>But uhm, I don't know, I guess just sort of thinking you're, it's harder to plan things, anyway.  And then, I just began thinking about MJ and FYH and how — well, I don't know what word to use, except, I me—, it's not they're unaware of MYDN, they don't — nobody seems to be really interested in him.  Because I was thinking of this, even Christmas when they came over, that if it had been us, with just 1 child, FSO, I don't know, the whole feeling on our part, anyway, would have been very different, of when she was off sleeping in another room.  But when MYDN was off sleeping, it was as, I don't know, seemed almost as if nobody knew he was there at all, or thought about him, or was aware of him in any way.  And I know it isn't true, I'm sure, that FNI was aware of him.  But I, I think I was almost thinking that MJ and FYH hardly, e—, e—, they'll pass by, but not notice him, or see him or m—, m—, this may be a very good thing.  But somehow I think of it as showing something that isn't right.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Mm, I was also just thinking of yesterday when we were in SMQ.  At one point FNI was trying to pay for something, and FYH started taking off her shoes.  And I think she's gotten a lot better about that, but it used to be that she'd never keep her shoes on.  And uh, FNI said something to her about putting her shoes back on, and she didn't.  And then, since FNI was also trying to do something else, I thought well, I'll try to help. </p>

<p>And, yet I think there was more to it.  Because somehow, I wanted to be able to take FNI's place, as far as getting FYH to put her shoes on.  And, and yet I couldn't just sort of take the position that a mother can, of, of uhm, I'm going to put your shoe on, and, and when FNI finally did this, FYH let her.  But I tried by using arguments that would keep things pleasant, but that hopefully FYH would give in, and she didn't.  She was very clever at thinking up ways to circumvent what I was saying, which all was common sense.  And she knew it.  But yet, she could still get around it, and not put her shoe on. </p>

<p>And I don't know, I felt uh, somehow, that, well I don't know if it was that I failed, or am inferior to FNI.  Because in the end, FNI could just say FYH, I have to put your shoe on, because you have to have your shoes on.  And I didn't feel I was in the position where I could do that.  But yet I, I don't know, I feel as if there must have been a way that I could have gotten her to put her shoe on, without FNI having to do it.  A—, a—, I, I d—, this really bothered me, and I don't, I don't know why, unless it's to do with my feelings of jealousy of FNI.  And — (Sigh, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, you know, one way to see what you've been saying and feeling lately, is that uh, the understanding you felt of Joan killing her husband, and that bringing back the dream that I had betrayed you, and your various associations that a girl fundamentally has something missing, suggests again that this is what you felt was the basic situation about you.  If you'd been a boy, it would have been different, but you're not, felt something was fundamentally missing.  So one solution you hit on, was the idea of having yourself a baby, but a baby boy, in particular.  So you end up feeling very mystified that FNI can be so casual about MYDN, and nobody missed him when he was sleeping.  If you had a son, you would think of him every minute.  You'd love to change places with her and be in her shoes, so to speak.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  You feel betrayed by me, because I've neither arranged for you to have a penis, nor a boy.  Nor have my words made it possible for you to duplicate FYA's fate.  So I've failed you in every way.  And in the same way I think you feel MSCZ's failed you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, it makes me think of I, I don't know how much I've (Sniff) admitted that I feel MSCZ's failed me.  Er, I, I seem to usually approach it from another angle, but I was just thinking of the fact that recently, I think it was — it's happened a lot, but I think even this morning I was doing it — uh, I was just thinking about again, I was probably thinking about some of these things that FNI can borrow.  And that I was just thinking just in terms of my having a lot of clothes, especially when FSO was younger, that she never really wore out.  So that, if we had another girl, it would be nice, just because there are some nice things. </p>

<p>But then, my idea would be, I, I don't know, I keep thinking of it now, we'll have a girl, probably to protect myself from the way I felt before.  But uhm, also along with that, was this idea that I'd have a girl, this time, who resembled me, and not MSCZ.  Because FSO right now, and, I m—, it was always hard to see any resemblance to me, or my side of the family.  But, now there's just none.  And uh, I, I don't know, I think it really bothers me that she doesn't look like me at all, or that there's no physical tie, in that sense. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

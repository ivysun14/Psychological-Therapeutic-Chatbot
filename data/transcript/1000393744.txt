<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) I keep thinking I don't (clears throat) know where to start, because there are just so many things on my mind.  And I've—, then I get the feeling that I'm just trying to get everything organized that's on my mind and controlled.  Because one of the things that's most on my mind is, uhm, that I am pregnant.  But I was also thinking of, well, 2 things.  When I called, and was waiting for the, uhm, secretary to tell me the result of the test, I know I—, it seems that I was preparing myself to here that I wasn't.  Because when she said the result was positive, it didn't register with me, at first.  Then I thought, "What does positive mean?"  And then after that I, I don't know, I didn't feel any different.  And I—, It's almost as if I'm not letting myself.  And, and I mean by feel any different, even feel really pleased or—.  Then I thou—, I don't know, I still think I'm still mixed up about how I feel about being pregnant.  Because last night (exhales) MSCZ and I had one of our usual lately arguments.  Over the fact that I'm not, well, in a way, submissive.  Submissive to his desires when he wants to have intercourse or that kind of thing and— (deep breath).  Last night I just, I don't know, I had the feeling that if I weren't pregnant I wouldn't be feeling quite the way I was.  (pause)</p>

<p>It was funny, too, because it was a situation where I hadn't—.  We had sort of started a fight and then I went to bed and went to sleep and MSCZ didn't come to bed.  And then when I woke up quite a bit later, it was obvious neither of could sleep thinking about it.  And so we had—, we started talking about it then.  And he did come to bed then.  He was lying in bed talking to me, so he was right next to me.  And he was just so angry at me, and I could understand in a way why he was angry, but I couldn't—.  I don't know, I suppose that was why I got angry at being pregnant or something and wanted to blame it on that.  Because I just kept feeling that something that he was asking of me I couldn't do.  And it was something to do with being submissive and—. And in that way loving him.  I don't know, but anyway, and I began to feel he was further and further away from me, as if I reached out t_, I couldn't touch him and—.  Or else I was just feeling more and more alone and therefore farther away from anything around me.</p>

<p>And then I began to get the feeling that that dream that I've mentioned sometimes that I used to have a lot when I was little, around 3 or 4, when there used to be the color red a lot and all.  And that was the feeling that I had, that it was almost as if I were awake in that dream. And, and MSCZ was just miles away then.  It was almost as if I could hardly hear his voice for a while.  And it was just an odd sensation.  And I'd never—, I'd began then—, and I don't know whether this really true, but I began to associate that dream then with feeling alone, which I'd never done before.  I'd just known it gave me a feeling I didn't like and that was confusing to me and—.  (silence)</p>

<p>Uh, (clears throat) I was just thinking again of what MSCZ was saying last night, and it's (exhales), it's almost as if I didn't understand him then and so I can't recall now what he said.  (pause)</p>

<p>Except it has something to do with feeling that he's asking me to give in to his will.  (pause)</p>

<p> It also just came to my mind that, at some point, I think maybe before—, when I f_ first woke up I'd been having a dream that seemed to me I'd been hav—, I'd have that dream before or similar dream.  And now I can't remember any part of it, except at one point I was walking down either corridors or alleys or, I don't know, avenues with trees were on either side, but it—.  It seemed like I was trying to escape.  And at one point, the part I remember was that, uhm, I heard the voices of this—, the elderly couple that have almost become like parents in that they demand attention from us the way they do.  And for a while I felt responsible to them the way I might to parents, until it just made me angry.  And they, and they were behind me and I was trying to escape them then in the dream.  And I think finally I got to some kind of a dead end, and I had to turn around.  But then I was inside, because it was some kind of a door I couldn't go through or something and—.  And when I'd turned back they'd disappeared.  (pause)</p>

<p> Also last night, when MSCZ and I were talking, and it was, I don't know, not exactly a fight, but it wasn't casual conversation at all either, uhm.  I kept remembering the last time this happened and how you pointed out to me that what I'd done essentially was, I had initiated love-making when I was ready for it.  And yet I had the feeling last night—, and I didn't want to do that again.  I didn't want to make it something where again I was getting control and all.  Because I, because I know often I'm doing it, but if I'm aware of doing I really don't want that relationship with MSCZ, too, and—.  I don't know if I ended up doing it or not, because at some poi—, I don't know, at some point when it was obvious we'd talked ourselves out, and z____ z____ just so far away from each other, that I was just thinking that we both touched each other tentatively, and then being afraid of a rebuff or something, stopped doing it.  And MSCZ had done it as much with me as I had with him.  And I thought one of us has to risk being rebuffed.  And MSCZ's very afraid of that, because I guess I often do rebuff him.  And so I did.  (pause)</p>

<p> And, I don't know, then it bothered me because I didn't know whether I had just done the same thing again, that I'd done before.  I didn't actively make love or anything, but I just, well, I don't know, just touched him and didn't take my hand away for awhile, until he started to respond and—.  And then later we did make love, and I—, it didn't—, I don't know, it was an odd feeling of feeling very much he was possessing me or (exhales), I don't know, it was feeling I didn't really put into words, but somehow I was nothing except through him or—.  But, but he said something that expressed what I was feeling, and I don't—, but it doesn't sound as if it's it entirely when I say it.  But at one point he just said, "It makes me feel so happy to think you're all mine."   A feeling this possession of me and—.  It was almost like I was just kind of resigned to it, but I didn't really want it.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, then I was just again, wondering or being confused about how much thinking, since I s_ started thinking it over the vacation that I might be pregnant has had anything to do with this mood that really has continued since that time. Of. I don't know, being more aggressive about wanting control and not giving in to MSCZ's desire to make love and all that kind of thing.  Just, I don't know, not returning a feeling to him that I have fe—, been able to return to him more frequently at other times and—.  I mean I just, I just feel as if I've been pushing him away saying, "I don't need you."  (pause)</p>

<p>And I, eh, something occurred to me that, maybe in a way I've already said it, too, about your pointing out that I avoided this side that you were stressing.  I di—, I almost didn't even hear it the first time you talked about how I'd approached you on changing the time, and that in effect I was demanding that you change the time.  And what I thought after I left was almost that if I face that I'm demanding it, I don't know, I also have to face that I'll probably be refused.  I think I, that I was saying that to some extent anyway.  (pause)</p>

<p> Or just anyway, just thinking about how people act, I don't think you would go from asking to demanding unless you didn't get things when you asked or—.  I don't know, on the one hand, when I think of demanding I feel very guilty and that that's terrible of me and so selfish and—.  It's—, I mean it's just horrible.  I don't want to see myself that way.  And then on the other hand it seems like I don't want to see it that way because then it means with facing I'm demanding I have to assume I'll be refused.  (silence)</p>

<p>I began to think about a boy in school today.  Of—, It was one of the boys, I'd, uhm, whose mother I spoke to yesterday, the one who's been swearing a lot and just has always had very bad behavior.  And, uhm, his father stopped in today, because apparently his mother can't tell his father what I say w—, and have him believe it or so—, I don't know, there's something there so that she wanted me to tell the father, too, and—.  The father didn't really want to hear anything.  And he mainly wanted to concentrate on the language that his son's been using and contradicted the mother by saying that he hadn't heard it at home.  And then started blaming the older boy in the family for all this, which I, I don't know, I can't certainly as far as the behavior of the boy I have, the older brother's not to blame.</p>

<p>And uh, I don't know, and then I was thinking that after the father left I spoke to the boy about why I talked to his parents, because I think he's just going to get beaten when he goes home, because of the language he's been using and—.  So I wanted him somewhat prepared, because I couldn't seem to get to the father and all on, well, I don't know, it's my approach, so it may not be his anyway about what I say when they use those words and— (exhales).  And then I (exhales), and I also said that we talked again as he's known I have before, about his behavior.  And he said, "Well, I can't do it when there are 21 boys in the class.  And he must have heard this from somewhere, because I don't think he'd think that all on his own."  And, and I just said, "Well, you have to learn to,"  and, I don't know, I was just thinking now, here was the father and the son trying to avoid where the responsibility was.</p>

<p>And somehow I get the feeling that, mm, anyway last night that's what I was doing.  In that I didn't want to face the responsibility I have for MSCZ.  That I'm not free to just be horrible and expect him to put up with it.  And I don't know, maybe feeling, too, that somehow, I'm sort of dodging around something here.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>And one thing I keep feeling I don't want to think about that I am pregnant, or that I've been told I am.  And I, because I find I'll start thinking things, "Well, what if I have a miscarriage or something goes wrong" or—.  And it—, I—, and I'm still worried about something that I was told not to worry about, when I asked the gynecologist, that something I'd read when all that information was coming out about the pills, on the danger of, I guess having, instead of having the double chromosomes or whatever it is that's double, having triple, when you just go off the pill.  So you have some kind of a malformed thing that wouldn't—, I mean then you would have a miscarriage and— (clears throat).  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I just (clears throat) feel resistant to thinking, or saying anything.  And I don't know whether it's against you or against thoughts that I might think if I let myself.  (pause)</p>

<p>It almost seems like sometimes, though, I'm trying to avoid—, I mean today—, I'm trying to avoid further responsibility, in thinking.  Because sometimes when I'm quiet I start thinking if I'm quiet long enough maybe you'll say something.  It's almost like I'm trying to force you say something so that the responsibility will go to you not on me.  (pause)</p>

<p>And then I just—, it occurred to me (clears throat) that I don't know, maybe I would find out what you're thinking by what you said, by what you might ask me, if you talked.  And then it—, I don't know, it just seems that what I'm really wanting to know is your reaction to the fact that I am pregnant.  (silence)</p>

<p> And I suppose what I'm wondering is does it please you or displease you.  And then I thought, "Well, I know what MSCZ's reaction is, because he's pleased." And that made me think of something that last night kept, I don't know, it seemed important to know—.  I wanted MSCZ to answer this question of how—, what are his feelings toward me as the potential mother of his children, or if I am pregnant as—, in that way the potential mother of his child and—.  I don't know, having the feeling that what I didn't want—, except maybe I did want it, I don't know, is for him to be pleased with me because he's grateful or, I don't know, I'd done a good—, I'd done the right thing or something and—.  Which seems to be lacking any feeling of creating together, and—.  I don't know, last night all I could think is, all MSCZ will feel is just the first thing, not the creating together, but just pleased with me because I'd done the right thing, or been able to do it or something.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But what's so striking is that that's what lacking in what you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  The creating together?</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  It's very clear from all that you say that you hardly tell me anything about your reaction.  You want to know what I think.  You think about what MSCZ thinks, but what you leave out is what you think.  You recall a dream in which you felt you were at some dead end.  You clearly speak of fears; you speak of miscarriage, but you don't really say much about any of these things.  And I'm very struck with how, last night, you say that you, some way or other, contributed to MSCZ not going to bed with you and being very angry.  And you felt it was some issue of your submitting to him.  But again the whole thing sounds very much as though somehow you got the baby, and it's what you want and now you think of being alone, and it's sort of the way you act here.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  But last night when I was feeling so frustrated and, you know, angry, maybe again I was just picking being pregnant as being angry at something or—.  I don't know, I just wanted to pound on my stomach and kill whatever was there, because it was making me react this way.  And I like it better when I don't feel alone and that I don't need MSCZ.  But somehow now it's something to fight off, and, and it becomes a negative thing.  (pause)</p>

<p> And I get the same feeling that whenever anything has ever made me happy, that I always seem to get of starting to feel happy, and then cutting it off and—.  I know I've spoken of that before.  And I don't know, I don't know, agai—, I don—, it seems like I've had different ideas about it, as if my concept of myself means I can't be happy so I can't let myself feel happy, or I'm afraid of it or I don't know what it is.  But I do feel as if I'm just deading—, deadening my feelings.  I'm not, I'm not saying anything about my feelings really because I don't—, I just don't want to feel them.  (silence)</p>

<p>While I'm thinking about it, too, it, it seems as if some of the feeling is, if I start thinking that I've got what I want by being pregnant and don't need anyone, which certainly is the way I've been reacting to MSCZ, since I thought I was, then I just know, I don't know, it's sort of an opposite feeling of knowing I'm making myself abnormal in such a way that I can't be happy.  And th—, it's just that situation that I'm afraid then I'll be a bad mother.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, or guaranteed that you will be what your mother seemed to you to be.  Grim, determined, hard.</p>

<p> PATIENT:  That's another thing that makes me think of last night.  I can't remember now exactly the situation, but I reacted at one point like my mother, and MSCZ didn't say, "Here you are acting like your mother,"  but he pointed out how I was acting and I, I made the comparison and—.  Here I can feel so strongly that I don't want to be like my mother, and yet I keep on acting and reacting just like her.  So it makes me wonder, maybe I really want to.  (silence)</p>

<p>I suppose it's wanting and not wanting to be like my mother is— (exhales), is sort of like this, well, maybe it's part of the same thing, of feeling that I had so much as I was growing up, or as I got older was beginning to think what my life would be, that I didn't want it to be like my parents'.  I didn't want to be a committee woman like my mother, and all these things, yet my habits and ways of thinking and so forth were all just like the ways my parents had, or the pattern of living were essentially the same.  So I might substitute something else for my mother's committee work and think I was living a different life, but really not.  (pause)</p>

<p>And (clears throat) it just seems like somehow I'm always rebelling against my parents, what they stood for on the surface.  Because then I thought I was establishing myself on my own.  Because I knew underneath I was so terribly dependent on them, and still asking for something they hadn't ever given enough of.  Which is why I'm always still reacting to them, or like my mother.  But my father, too, sometimes.  And again I just ending up not knowing, what am I?  What do I really want?  Or isn't there anything there, except this negative|positive feeling about my parents.  (pause)</p>

<p>I think that's it that I keep—.  I know often I've thought, "Well, eventually I'll—, shining through this mess will come what I really want," as if it's always there, clearly there.  But it can't be there if I've never let it start, and it doesn't seem that I have.  And I—, I mean in term—, what I really want in terms of completely free of my parents.  Maybe I don't know—, I don't know if you can be.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

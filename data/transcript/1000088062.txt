<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Coming at you, the counseling center's answer to the Bubonic plague. Hey, speaking of Bubonic plague, those last two sessions were real bummers, weren't they? I don't know, I guess maybe I haven't been reading my E.E. Cummings or Dylan Thomas or something. I'm not sure. Enough of this chit chat. Client 0426002, reel number 111, 12th interview. Client 0426-002, reel number 111, 12th interview. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I am sure you could find that (inaudible at 0:40). Like what they do to cattails. You know cattails? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You mean (inaudible at 0:50) with the scissors all (inaudible at 0:52) the cattails? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. No. You really don't know what a cattail is? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (In audible 0:56) cattail is. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Let's see, it's a fuzzy, long thing. It's called something else too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. They're like weeds outside. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. They grow in ditches. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible at 1:10) You've never been in a house that's had cattails sprayed and - you must be from the city. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I may have been and not noticed. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, I've decided it's pretty confusing when you start to think over are you happy or are you not happy. What do you want to do? You know, it just kind of depends on the day. And then it's like I don't think you can be happy every day all day long. Or even content. Some days you are just, you know, nothing is going to go right. And you'd rather be someplace else. [1:59]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean...

</p><p>PATIENT: And every time I, you know, I talk - I say to myself, "I really don't want to get a job." And then like the next day something will happen. And I'll say, "I wish I had a part-time job." You know, and it's just - it really is - I mean had much more fun I think before I started to think about myself or (inaudible at 2:27). You know, because I just kind of floundered along. And it really is a problem when you have - when you're making decisions and you don't know. You really don't know what you want or what's going to make you happy, or if anything is. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. So thinking is some sort of Pandora's box for you, just bringing, I guess, sort of confusion and like mind changes all the time. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And like nothing seems very solid. No course of action seems like the right one because two minutes later you change your mind. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know in all the time we've been in school, I thought, "Well, when he's out of school, then we'll have the money that I can do what I want to do." But it just seems like whenever, you know, I'm always kind of living for the future. And seven years have gone by and he's still in school. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You could be waiting for the future forever. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then sometimes you've got to live, but how - I don't know how to do it without money. If I don't want to go - I mean I could not go and volunteer to do something, you know, that I wouldn't get paid for. I want to strictly bringing in enough money that we had what we needed. [4:03] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you can't afford to do what you want to do? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I guess you're also like saying that I might never be able to afford to do what you want to do. You could be waiting forever. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, and if, you know, like if I do do whatever it is I want to do. But I'm not really sure, but I want - in Springfield (sp?) I thought, "Gee, if I would be able to go out and play raquetball, and go to the beach all day that would be a lot of fun during the summer." Kind of store all that up for the winter when you couldn't get outside. But I don't - you know, and that gets pretty old too. And so what is I want to do, I don't know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sort of restless, but not knowing where to move. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And the less you do, the worse you are. I mean I am so tired. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kind of lonely (ph) and lethargic from doing nothing. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And doing nothing. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Just laying around, reading - well, this week I've been nursing my cold. It might hang on for two or three more weeks, so. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you kind of experience yourself running down, and down, and down, like inactivity or uninterested. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just can't get going without anything. Nothing really thrills me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Nothing you really want to do. But you know you don't like it how it is. [5:57]

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe, you know, if I do something maybe I'd find out I'd [don't want to do it] (ph). Maybe if I would ever do something, I might find out that I'd like to do whatever I'm doing, you know. Or maybe I'd be more satisfied with staying home. Well, I have always been satisfied with staying home, it's just there are so many pressures now. You know, like with women's lib. My neighbors kind of look at me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The oppressed woman? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I didn't ever feel that way. I always thought I was underpaid. But I thought I was doing what I wanted to do. But I'm afraid that I won't - I will not get a job because my neighbors think I ought to get a job and get out. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You are afraid you won't get a job? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of had a reaction to your neighbors? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Like - well like I'm trying to do my own thing now, and I don't want to take advice from anybody, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And it just goes from one day to the next. It depends on how much pressure I get put on me from both sides. Jim wants me to stay home and she me to go. It depends on who does the most talking. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But what it sounds like is like the most pressure is sort of like Jim wants you to stay home. You want to go out and get a job. And if your neighbor wanted you to go out and get a job, you want stay home. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, you know, it's nice to assert yourself, but it's like cutting off your nose to spite your face. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it's like none of it has much to do with you (inaudible at 7:49) as far as the fact that (inaudible at 7:52) told what to do. But in terms of what you really want to do. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. It's not resentment, it's just, you know, from, you know, like I finally have been saying what I should have been saying all along, you know. [8:08]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And I want to keep that independence. I mean if I decide to go to work, it will be my decision. And it won't be because Jessica Fennson (sp?) said, "Well, you should get a job. You know, those kids all day will drive you nuts." You have no - again it's (inaudible at 8:28), you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you're wanting - if you get a job you want it to be for you. But it sounds like - or my guess is that something about Jessica Fennson saying you ought to get a job that's (inaudible at 8:48) Jessica, but you can't plug you into that. Like - it sounds like what happens is you get focused on (inaudible at 8:59) battle of wills with Jessica, or some kind of thing with Jessica rather than your own feelings. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Does that make sense? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like I won't do it because she said so. And it's not because I don't like her, it's because I want to do it because I want to do it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But a point of fact, what I'm getting at is something like - the point of fact you may want to do it, but you don't know. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I don't. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And if I don't get one, how will I ever know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You really have to be on the job to know whether you're going to like it or not, To sit and sort of stew about it isn't going to get you anywhere. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And I feel like, you know, after looking back over the year we've been here, I've have really haven't done anything, even at home. I just, you know, maybe I'll have a sudden burst of energy. But other than the day-to-day routine, I haven't really done anything. [10:18] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 10:20) the day-to-day routine, but you have to have something to show for having (inaudible at 10:24). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. But I think it's - it really is kind of a vicious circle. Because if I went to work and got the money to fix up the house or do whatever I wanted to do, I wouldn't have the time or the energy to do it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're damned if you do and damned if you don't? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I think if I could get over my guilty feelings about leaving the girls, or if Jim would make himself a little more available. But he always makes you feel like, you know, that is after all your job. And I'm imposing on him to watch his children. Whether he means it or not, I don't know. You know, it's funny. This cold is really been (inaudible at 12:23). But since I've had this cold, we've haven't been able to have intercourse because I can't breath. And now he's turning off again. You know, and then it comes back to me again. Well, that was all an act, his being nice to me while I was well. And it just irritates him when I get sick. And I don't even - I can't afford get sick very often. [12:53]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 12:56), I'm not sure, but it sounds like you're getting sick now - it seems like it's really showing you what he was doing before wasn't sincere. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. And it - I just - I don't know, unless he's just a very simple person. I mean because I feel that way sometimes too. Like one day I'm on and one day I'm off. But it really does encourage me that if I'm not well enough to have intercourse, then he doesn't even want to have anything to do with me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's all your good for is just taking care of kids. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And if you're not going to put out, there is no other feeling there. (Inaudible at 13:56) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 13:58) feel like hate or disgust. [14:03] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you're pretty vocal (inaudible at 14:06). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think I am. You know, and then he'll think it over and come back home and for maybe two hours he'll be a decent person again. I really would like to run away I think. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd really like to leave him? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Leave him and the kids. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 14:52). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Some day it's just a really big bother to be nice. I mean you don't really feel like...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like (inaudible at 15:17) boiling inside (inaudible at 15:26) inside perhaps to smile (inaudible at 15:38). And none of you would ever (inaudible at 15:41) at home. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's just like when I'm sick I feel like I need some sensitivity and a little extra attention. Like instead of insisting that I go to the park with Jim and the girls, he can take them himself and I can get a little rest. [16:06] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. He got his way (inaudible at 16:08) you're sick. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Now I'm supposed to do all of these things, you know. But he couldn't - like I mean it's like no bother for me to take the girls with me wherever I go. But if I ask him to do that simple little thing, it's just too much - it's just too much for him. He's just completely incapable of handling it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying something like, "When I need some kind of support. I need to be cared for. If he can't or won't handle it." 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. But then he says, you know, like, "Well, you do such a good job." And it's just - you know, taking care of the girls. It's just all insincere. I mean because all the rest of the time he's running me down about why can't I ask you more (inaudible at 17:07). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So (ph) you need to tell that's why you're the great mother and the marvelously competent person that you want him to do something. And you see right through it. You see right through that act. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I think - like Sunday he wanted me to go and just sit in the car while he and the kids went to play on the playground. I said, (inaudible at 17:35) in that all. It was hot in the car, and I was really sick, and I'm supposed to sit there for, you know, his moral support or something. And yet he wants me to take the kids to the park, and go to the beach, and everything. But he won't ever take them. I mean he took them, but it was just for 30 minutes. You know, and even there I was out (ph) of the car before it's time to go home. And yet he puts on this big thing about what a great father he is and how much - and then he feels - he says he feels so badly that he doesn't have more time to spend more time with the kids, so why I don't spend more time with the kids, you know. So I have to pay his duty or something. [18:29] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 18:31) is you saying that, it sounds like you keep his taking care of the children and your taking care of the children (inaudible at 18:41) as being unfair and placing unfair demands on you. Things that he won't do he expects you to do. It also sounds like you deserve (inaudible at 18:55). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am. Because - I mean he said, you know, "I don't spend enough time with the girls." Well okay, spend more time with them. But now he says, "I want you to take my place and spend more time with the girls." I mean I don't see how I can spend any more time with them. I live with them from 7:30 to 7:30. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're up to your ears...

</p><p>PATIENT: In kids. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 19:30) and then to (inaudible at 19:34) getting off scott free, put your head (ph) under water. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Wake him up in the middle of the night. Spend a little time with them. And I - you know, like Danielle (sp?) is starting to just - she is the second (inaudible at 19:53) to putting all of her fingers in her mouth and kind sitting around. I know this because Jim and I argue, it's not because neither one of us are spending time with her. Because when she's in the house I read to her, I talk to her, you know, we do things together. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [20:12] 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just the bickering. It's not the lack of the special attention. Also, I kind of blame him for the way she is anyway. He wasn't around too much when she was growing - you know, for a couple of years. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She was really damaged by the arguing? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. She was damaged by him. I mean he wouldn't let her walk because he was afraid she'd fall down and hurt herself. She took a couple of steps and fell down. You know, even if I was across the room, "Why didn't you catch her?" And that's the way she's been brought up. We never let her cry because he has to get up in the morning. Consequently, I was up day and night with her all the time. But, I mean, she really is so sharp. She can see all these things (inaudible at 21:21) most kids can. And they both know who to attack, you know, which parent to attack depending on how the argument's going. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it isn't just you (inaudible at 21:52). [21:53]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, depending - I guess - yeah, like I'm the only one Danielle will attack. But that's because she knows that's the way the game is played. I don't do any attacking. So she knows that I'm the one to (inaudible at 22:11). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She knows that (inaudible at 22:25). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. She's (inaudible at 22:27). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Does that make you feel like a punching bag. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I do say it's the same thing, all the more, with Jim. You know, I can remember my friends saying, "Oh, you're so lucky. He's around so much. He takes an interest." And I was thinking, "I wish could do it, (inaudible at 22:56) having him around telling me what not to do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 22:04). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. He's not. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 23:10) very much (inaudible at 23:12). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, there - but he never seems to know when it's time to take over. You know, when I've really had enough. And if he doesn't help, then I'm going to start screaming. He waits until I start screaming and then comes in and says, "Why can't you handle this? Keep your emotions under control." Then he goes through his regular sermon. But I mean he would never think of coming in after school or before supper and taking care of the girls. And he'll lay around before he goes to work or back to school until I - you know, until it's time to give the girls a bath, and then he has to go right away. [24:03] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're (inaudible at 24:10). What is it (inaudible at 24:14) sensitivity to my needs. He's not helpful to me. He doesn't sense when I'm at the end of my rope. But it sounds like you're also saying that he's like not only that, but also he likes to exacerbates it - like he welches (ph) out on you just when I need him. He like makes the whole thing worse for you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He doesn't help. And furthermore, he just (inaudible at 24:38). 

</p><p>PATIENT: There are times when, you know, like at 4:00 and 5:00 that you really need some - anyone. And it doesn't necessarily have to ask him to take the kids. You've had them all day, and you're trying to cook supper, and you're standing there. But he's in watching TV. And it's just - well, he's tired, you know. Well who isn't? It's more tiring, because being around little ones all day, than to do manual labor. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's tired, but you're exhausted. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's just sitting there watching television just oblivious while you're in there trying to fix the dinner and not step on the children. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, (inaudible at 25:42) come out and turn the pans around so they can't grab them, or turn down my fire. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He'll come in and really help a great deal. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 25:54) in. It's little things like that, you know, build up your self-confidence. [26:02]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you must feel very much alone. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am. That's why I got (ph) interested in why I'm staying with him. I mean I do it all myself. There is no time when he's there that I couldn't have somebody else doing just the same job and probably better at it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You guys are changing (inaudible at 26:35). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I could get a good job and get this thing (inaudible at 26:40). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's in your life pretty much as a non-entity, certainly not someone who cares for you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I usually am wondering if he really cares for the girls. You know, does he care for anybody except himself? Because if he did, it seems to me that he would want to take over a little. You know, at 4:00, because he knows I'm going to lose my temper any minute and blow. You know, and to save them from that if he really cared. Maybe it builds his ego when he can sit there all self-possessed and watch me blow up. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's absorbed in it. [28:01]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. He can say, "Well I don't do that." And even when he's sitting there on the couch watching TV, it's "Why don't you - I hear something outside. Go see what it is," while the kids are crying, because he doesn't have two legs. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It seems like the (inaudible at 28:33). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I do. I get off on that. [Same thing though] (ph), I would just like to plain get rid of him. Sometimes I really think I could handle it better without. At least I wouldn't have to move into anybody's (inaudible at 28:59). It might be nice to go away by myself for a while to see how he can handle that, and leave him with the girls. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That sounds less like you (ph) thinking more like we're (inaudible at 29:51). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Well, I kind of want to sit around a lodge, I think so. I know I'd never want to come back to the apartment after he's been there. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How do you mean? [30:07] 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean he would maybe watch the girls, but that's all he would do. They would eat out and never clean the house and...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd come back to it after (inaudible at 30:20) a pit sty. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I went downtown one Saturday and came back to an absolute pigsty, and it was clean before I left. I mean it's - that's what I mean. I can hire a babysitter or a dog to watch the kids better than he does. So what is he good for? So I don't want things popping into my mind. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're not swamped with alternatives. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I can't think of one. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: For you or good for (inaudible at 31:08)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Anything, except, you know, then someone to talk to about your own children, you know, who is (inaudible at 31:18). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You sure it's the children (inaudible at 31:23) the children? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I really don't have anything good to say about him today at all. You're just trying to make me like his mother. And he told me to invite the neighbors who are leaving over to dinner. And today when I went to the grocery store I said, "(inaudible at 32:38). Do you have to go to the grocery store?" I mean, you know, and his mother is such a penny pincher I'm sure that he would like me to manage the money a little better so that I wouldn't have to spend any money to entertain anyone. Can you think of anything good? I mean I hate to have the...[33:19]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You've run out of that...

</p><p>PATIENT: I haven't even started on many good points, because I can't - you know, like if I come home and he's nice to me. Now tomorrow I'll think of all these things that he's good for. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Your evaluation of him sounds like it fluctuates between good and bad just according to how he's been to you that one day. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well this has been a week. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That he's been to you this way? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And before he that he was nice. And I thought he was an okay guy. [33:59] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. And tomorrow...

</p><p>PATIENT: But and until - he was nice to me - well, he wasn't even nice - I mean in that way then he didn't take - he never has helped me with the kids or the house. And he just talks to me like I was an adult. That was how he would start. But it still wasn't like he took the children or read them stories. When I - when he has to read them stories it's, "Why don't you read them a story?" When I'm out getting supper, or doing the dishes, or doing something, whatever I'm doing is not nearly as important as reading a story to his children that he doesn't have time to read because he is so busy. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That son of a ****. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Is that the only nice you can say about (inaudible at 35:00)? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's what it sounds like you're trying to say. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, he is. You know, really I'm the one - I'm so gullible. I mean anything he tells me I believe it. He tells me next day when he does this stuff, you know, says the exact opposite. But you know the week I was with my parents, I really didn't think about him. Well, I did about Thursday I thought, "Gee I'm not even missing him." [36:15]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And (inaudible at 36:24) continue (inaudible at 36:26). 

</p><p>PATIENT: I was even a little disgusted with it because he called and he tried to make me feel miserable because I wasn't coming back early. I just thought that was kind of a low thing for him to do. Well, I never have the nerve to leave him. [38:17]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It takes no courage to leave him? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well that's (inaudible at 38:25) nothing else to go to. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To leave him and to really be alone. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible at 40:19) see any alternative except to stay with him and bear (inaudible at 40:26). [40:27]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 40:29)

</p><p>PATIENT: You know. But the girls would be the ones giving me the problems, because they're always whining for their daddy. If I do something to them, "I want my Daddy." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 40:50) look forward to (inaudible at 40:55) alone (inaudible at 40:58). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. (Inaudible at 41:03) I mean like if I was to divorce Jim and get married, that would be something else - getting married again. But when you don't have any means of support and you have two children, and no house, and no clothes, and no food. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So just in terms of like just the minimal survival (inaudible at 41:33) physical possession (ph). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just couldn't. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But, you know, I can see like I have these dreams of being - of having enough money when Jim finally got through school. But still - I mean even with money there isn't going to be a companionship or any of the things you think when you think about marriage. With money or without, it's going to be just the same. Only maybe I'll be less out of his life and [mine sort of plays] (ph). [42:45]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Because his work is still going to be uppermost in his mind no matter what it is he's doing. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So when he graduates, like materially things will be more pleasant. But inside you'll feel just as empty. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's going to be just the same unless he does some changing. You know I never do anything unless I'm really coerced into it and backed into a corner. And I do what I have to do. I'm thinking now about getting a job. You know, if somebody would come up and say, "I have this job for you. Why don't you go interview for it?" I would go. But I don't know if I want to go out and look for one. And yet I feel like that's the only way I'm every going to have any kind of outside interest or life of my own. [44:44] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's (inaudible at 44:49). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well - well I know myself too well. You know like I take the first thing that comes along. I'm not very choosy. And I would hate the thought of getting something that I didn't like and then not having the gumption to quit and just being miserable. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But if somebody said to you, "I have this job for you." Right? You'd be in effect taking the first thing that came along. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So what's the difference between that and pounding pavement and taking the first thing that comes along? I am not clear because they sound identical. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, (inaudible at 45:41) - you know I'd say, "Well gees, if somebody wants me maybe I could get a job someplace else." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So when they hire you for a job that you're out pounding pavement for, it's because somebody wants you. [45:59] 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible at 46:00) is out pounding (inaudible at 46:01). I don't know. I've got too many dreams, I think, that I'll never - that are never going to happen unless I do something about them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you go on the way you're going, it will all just crumble to death. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean like I'll wake up and be 50 or 60 and then have never done one thing that I want to do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's the same way it is now when you (inaudible at 47:04). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is that you'll be 50 or 60. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And not too much time left to do it. It's just - I'm just too afraid to do anything but sick back and, I don't know, wait I guess. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Wait for the inevitable (inaudible at 47:45). 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't ever take the initiative it seems like, in anything. You know, like I'd rather stay home than plan a party and have - I'd rather stay home alone than have people over. I mean if somebody invites us, I'm just raring to go. [48:41

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But if you're responsible in some way

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't want any part of it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I think like - it's always in the back of my head that it's not going to turn out. And I think I really go overboard on the things that I plan. Like you can have just as good a time on pretzels and beer, but here I am, you know, repainting the house and making hors d'oeuvres for three days before. And it's really a bunch of work if you don't have any - you know, like you think they look - I mean I must (inaudible at 49:36) that they're not going to have a good time next week because of how my house looks (inaudible at 49:41) got to feed them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It must really seem as if you're on trial. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible at 49:54), you know, if it's overflowing with (inaudible at 49:58). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They couldn't possibly want to be with you. [50:03]

</p><p>PATIENT: You know I don't feel like I'm that interesting - that people are beating a path to my door. It's like I think I would be much happier if I would have married a construction worker or somebody else. You know, I can really - I think I can really shine. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. The reason you feel so cruddy has to do with not being better - not being better than him or...

</p><p>PATIENT: Not the measuring up to him or our friends. You know, they've all like accomplished something. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You need to live in a world of (inaudible at 51:09). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible at 51:15) stand next to a fat lady. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because if you get anywhere near your equal, you are outshined. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I don't have any equals here. They are all better than I am. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. (Inaudible at 51:43) that. If you get anywhere near someone who isn't grotesque, you're outshined. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I never thought of it that way, but I guess that's right. Did I say grotesque? [52:07]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No. Does it seem like a (inaudible at 52:35)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. You know, maybe I'm a glutton for punishment. Because there is one girl in our apartment building that's no better than I am. But I don't like to even be around her. You know she's worse than I am. I mean she's - I can't even describe her. She's a just a real mess. You know, but all of the people that - all of our friends their wives are accomplished outside the homes. And it seems to me that they are better homemakers and mothers too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't do anything? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not even what you're doing full-time. 

</p><p>PATIENT: So maybe if I had a part-time job I would have an excuse for not doing either of them very well. I don't know. I sometimes think that I'd do better if I had more to do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: At times (inaudible at 54:01) very heavily (inaudible at 54:02). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And a lot - you know, if you don't really - if you're not under any pressure, or at least to me, some people don't feel that way. But if I'm not under pressure, I don't do anything. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Maybe you just sort of go to (inaudible at 54:18). But if you were working from 9:00 to 2:00, then you'd feel like an immense pressure to come home and...

</p><p>PATIENT: Not - well, not immense pressure, but it's - I mean I would have the time, you know, say in three hours to do what used to take me all week. And I could do it and probably do a better job of all of these things. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, like I haven't done anything this week, and I have people coming for dinner tomorrow. And now I'm going to have to spend the whole day preparing for one little evening, you know. You know, if you had different things that you had to get done and you knew you wouldn't be home, they'd be done. But I like to put off. Because really I do think it's better with two children - or three children now, than I did with one. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess you think that (inaudible at 55:55). I need some limits. I need some kind of structure. [56:01]

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I can't do it myself. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I can't give myself that structure. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I have no self-control. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 56:20). Everything I do I go overboard with. And also, I think if I had an outside interest it wouldn't make that much difference what your house looked like. I mean like the house is just too important to me. You know, I don't want anybody to come in when it's not spic and span. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But you're not doing anything else. It's like all of you is invested in this house. You have no excuse. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I have to do something. And that goes back to what will people say, you know, if they come into this house and they see it's a mess. And they say, you know, "She doesn't do anything else. At least she could keep the house up." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She's a total slob. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 57:23), you know, like what we originally thought. Is this what I'm supposed to be getting out of therapy, figuring that I really am a slob? I mean I'm not going to go home today very happy thinking of myself and seeing a real loser. [58:11]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's really what you think of yourself today? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. 

</p><p>PATIENT: There is just things like I had so many (inaudible at 58:36). You know, like if there's pop in the refrigerator, like I just have to really control myself. Like I say I have one a day, and where do I drink it? I mean it's such a big problem. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like you have no self-discipline or imposed limits, like you've given the slightest provocation - the slightest temptation you run amok. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just - yeah. It reminds me of Bill Levy. It probably doesn't remind you of that. But I mean like he said he never had enough money to buy hot dogs at Coney Island, and now he goes, takes his children, and buys - you know, he just eats himself sick. And, you know, maybe I never have any temptations and I don't know how to control myself. You know, I (inaudible at 60:02) - I know why I stay up late at night is because it's the only time I'm alone. Even though I know I'm going to be tired. And then I never want to get out of bed. I mean, and you think, well maybe you're not going to bed at night because I don't want to face another day. And the longer you stay up, the longer you prolong. And that could very well be it too. [60:34] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They both make sense. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean there is never- yeah, there's nothing going on the next day. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so more of the same. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Garbage. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 60:46). We should be done (inaudible at 60:56). I won't be here Thursday, I just realized that (inaudible at 61:22). 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 61:24). Okay. (Inaudible at 61:58).

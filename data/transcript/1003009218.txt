<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, a new girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what sort of work are you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do home improvements.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Referred by [NAME OTHER].  Um, and you're on probation right now.  For what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, felony possession of a firearm and cocaine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long have you been out of jail?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Eleven months almost, 11 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how long were you in prison for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, close to 2 years.  Twenty some months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Have you ever seen a psychiatrist before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], but I don't know if that's a psychiatrist.  It's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  He's a therapist.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Therapist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long have you been seeing [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, for a couple months.  Two months, maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, and he said, uh he said things are a bit better since you stopped drinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they got a little bit better but it's, it's kind of getting shaky again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you drinking right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I drank on New Year's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had like, 3 beers and uh, a sifter of cognac.  That's the first time though, in like, 2 1/2 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well what's your understanding of why he referred you to me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, basically what I tell him, he thinks that uh, there might be something with some hyper, ADD, like uh, I got a lot of things.  Like I was in jail and I got out, uh, my wife was cheating on me so I divorced her, but I then I have more legal issues and I've got the stress of going back to prison for a long period of time.  I'm fighting it in the court system right now.  Then, you know, just everything with my wife is always starting drama with me and then I have a girlfriend and it, it's like, it's kind of like everything's, I'm all bottled up and I take it out on her and she gets pissed off at me, so then we're not on good terms.  And then it's just like, I get real snappy with people, get a attitude and I get mean sometimes and she always says that I, like, could be doing one thing and I just stop what I'm doing.  I could be doing the dishes, I'll just leave the dishwasher open, go do something else and return to that.  She says like, I'm in the car I'll be smoking a cigarette, on the phone, playing with the radio, swerving in lanes and sometimes she looks at me and she's like, "What the hell's going on with you?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is your wife or your girlfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is my girlfriend, right now, present time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, are you on any medications right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, lisinopril for high blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's just like, you know, I got all this stress and it's like I'm ready to explode sometimes.  Some days I'm just ready to give up and it's like, I get stir crazy sometimes.  It's like I don't know what to do with myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now, as a child uh, were you treated for -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hyperactivity?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I wasn't really hy, this has just all came in the last recent couple years, maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much schooling have you had?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got my H, HSED.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where'd you go to school at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went to uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] and then I went to [DEIDENTIFIED] and then I dropped out of [DEIDENTIFIED] and I got my HSED in [DEIDENTIFIED] when I was uh, I went to boot camp up there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I got it through boot camp.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you were in the service?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No boot camp for prison.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Alternative -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Alternative to doing all your jail time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You do some jail time, boot camp -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Complete the program and go home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, as a kid uh, um, were you able to sit and focus in school and get your work done, what were you like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I, I'd say half way.  Like, uh, I get distracted easily.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I believe.  Like I could be talking about something and just completely start talking about something else and not even -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But let, let's go back to, you're like, when you were in grade school.  I mean, were you able to sit and complete a task or did you, were you all over the place, had to go from one thing to another thing?  Were you able to wait your turn in line?  Uh, were you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, for the most part I'd say do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Okay.  Uh and why didn't you finish school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That is just like, I got a, when I got into high school just, I really didn't care for.  It's like; I couldn't really sit around all day in school.  I just would leave with my friends.  We'd go to school every day, like we were going to go to school, and then we would just kind of venture off and do some other stuff all day long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And did you, how about drugs in school like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I smoked a lot of weed in high school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Did you get into cocaine later, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I started, just started experimenting with cocaine in the last couple years.  It was, first couple times I didn't like it and then I think, just, I've been out February of last year, I got off [DATE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I exper, I haven't done cocaine probably since I was like [AGE] or [AGE] but then when I was out I kind of, all the stress got to me and I started doing it and I went through like a maybe, a 2 week stretch of using cocaine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And what's the uh legal problem that you have right now that you're -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a pending case.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> About what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, possession of a firearm as a felon and the cocaine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, but you, this is since hap, since going to prison, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the prison was, was that just cocaine related?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No that was marijuana related, but it was all still pending case and I got out.  I got out.  I was in the federal custody -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From the uh, federal, the feds got me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you have a new charge?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got, yeah, I got 2 new pending charges.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you got caught with cocaine and you happened to have a gun?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.  Okay.  Um, and you're working right now?  How, how long have you been working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, a couple months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's that going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's, that's going pretty decent.  That's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  You're able to get up, go to work -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And all that?  And you've never seen a psychiatrist before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Never been in a psych hospital or?  Okay.  Uh, even in prison they didn't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, well now, I mean, do you have trouble, can you, um, complete a task?  Start something and complete it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's always like I bounce around.  I'll get everything done, but I'll have like 3 or 4 things going on at one time.  Like, when I clean the house, I'll have a laundry pile over here, I'm starting a load, I'm doing the dishes.  I might just stop, start sweeping the floor, go back and wash the counter.  I'll get everything done, it's just I don't, I just don't sit there and so all the dishes and you know, somewhere in between [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get distracted very easily?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Like, give me an example of how that happens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, okay this is like, okay this might be off the subject, but it's like, my mind, okay, we'll use my girlfriend for instance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like she might be on the phone with her girlfriend and be talking about, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me just get.  Hang on one second.  I have a call to take.  Hi this is [PHYSICIAN NAME].  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah sure.  Yeah.  You know what?  Can I just tell you um, there's a [NAME OTHER], uh yeah, you got her.  Can you, we can take her.  I'm, I'm starting, no [NAME OTHER] is.  You know, it'd be great if you could do that, I'm really busy.  Okay.  Okay, thanks.  All right.  Sorry.  Um, so you were saying about your girlfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, um, it's like she could say that she's going out to the store or something and I was, I'll get to like, okay for instance she went to her cousin's yesterday and did her hair and you know I, I get to thinking like, I called her she didn't answer her phone so I'm thinking like she's with another man and then I'm thinking she's having sex with this other man and in reality she just didn't have her phone by her and it's like, I take something so small and twist it and make it so far fetched and the thing is, is like, I'm over here thinking about it and then I get to talking and it's just, I start to saying all types of crazy stuff to her like, "Who you fucking, who you been with, why aren't you answering your phone?"  and she's looking at me like, "What the hell, I just, my phone was in the other room.  I was doing her hair."  You know, I'll just blow it out of proportion and then that messes me and her up because then I can't always say sorry because then I'm always saying sorry.  It's like, you know, if she don't, she didn't answer her phone right away and you know, like, you know, I talk to other people like, my sister said, "Well you know women sometime need their time away to go, go whatever."  I'm like, "Well, why the hell didn't she pick up her phone?  You know, what the hell is she doing?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  How about with your, with your wife?  What broke the 2 of you up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I, r,r, really, what'd you say?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What happened with your wife?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, when I was in jail just for that 20 some months -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She uh, was screwing around and she got pregnant by another man.  She didn't think I was coming home so then she tried to deny it all and everything and then when I come home she finally admits it.  I was there that night and I haven't been home since then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I had owned the house.  I gave it back to the bank -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And basically she's on her own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have kids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we have 3 kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old are your kids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE], [AGE] and [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Is she working right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how is she supporting herself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, she has a girlfriend that lives with her -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That gives her money and my son gets a social security check.  I believe that's what she lives off of, basically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I will not give her no money.  I will, I buy things for my kids or if they need money I'll give it to them, but I will not give them to her because I don't know where it's going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, sure.  Um, do you lose things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Periodically.  I lose my keys a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My phone.  I used to lose my phone.  More when I used to drink -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'd always lose my phone.  Every damn day I'd lose it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Let's talk about your family.  Um, do you have brothers and sisters?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I have a brother and 2 older sisters.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where are you in your family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm the youngest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So the youngest of 4.  And, any of them have a history of seeing a psychiatrist?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Alcohol problems in the family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, my sister, my father and my brother drink.  My mother and my other sister don't drink.  I mean, maybe occasionally like, a beer -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or a mixed drink.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They have problems?  Have you ever been treated for alcoholism?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Yeah in AO, we did AODA in uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In prison?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, in boot camp.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I used to have a real problem with, bad with alcohol, but seeing how I started losing everyone, like my girlfriend.  We broke up and it was because of alcohol.  I was distant from my family.  It's like everyday, it's, it's like I could drink and drink and drink and not feel it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then it's going to hit me 2:00 in the morning.  Then I'll just be all drunk and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I had a couple bad episodes drinking and uh, there's been times when I like, didn't really even know what the hell I was doing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Basically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  [NAME OTHER] says uh, anxieties and depression, obviously he recommends you stop drinking uh, is hyperactivity, difficult sitting still, lack of focus and concentration, long chronic history of impulsivity.  Um, have you, have you ever taken like, speed in the past?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Cocaine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never really, like I said, the cocaine thing was just for like a 2 week period and it was just because I was under so much pressure with the feds -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, I got my ex-wife always calling me and sh, you know, talking shit.  Then it's like, you know, it's just like certain things in the day just would trigger, trigger me off and I'll get, I get very, very emotional with my girlfriend.  I always think she's up to someone and I know she's not, but for some reason my brain is always telling me and I can't just shut there, shut my mouth and bite my tongue.  Eventually, I might not say it today, I might not say it tomorrow, but the next day it's just going to whoosh, all come out on her and she's going to scream and be like, "Where the hell?"  She always say I'm talking out the side of my neck because I just, you know, something that she might, and it's none of my business actually, you know, she might be talking with an old boyfriend or old friend on the phone and I might not say nothing until, like I said, a day or later on that night.  I might not say nothing to you right then and there, but it's, it's like everything has just been getting to me.  I think it's a lot of stress with the feds, and, you know, nervous about going back to prison, and then I got the divorce thing going, you know, with the court.  Then I've got my girlfriend and it's like, you know sometimes she just wants to be left alone and I always think something's wrong with her.  "Why aren't you talking to me?  Why don't you give me a kiss?"  "Well someone doesn't have to give someone everyday a kiss to let them know they're there."  Well then I'll be in bed, "why aren't you snuggling with me?"  You know, I'm always riding her and I think the reason I'm riding her is because all this other shit that's going on with me and then I, I tend to take it out on her when she's not even the one.  She's there for me and you know, I, I, this is what me and [NAME OTHER] have been working on because I'm going to end up losing her again by putting, piling more and more bullshit on her plate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  How about have you had a past history of uh, racing thoughts, uh, staying up many nights in a row?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah like, I, I, yeah.  I, I function off of like, 3 hours sleep and I'll be good for a whole another day.  I had a problem -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not re, okay and we're not talking about related to drugs or alcohol, we're -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There, I'm just saying like this, this past months or whatever I could go to sleep at 2:00 in the morning and be up at 6:00 ready to go again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know I can function off of real little sleep and it's like I feel tired, but then I catch another wind and the tiredness goes away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your, how have you been sleeping lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's, like last night I tossed and turned a lot or I'll just lay in bed and just think, you know, just look up in the sky and just you know.  It's just like everything, it's like my brain's a motor and it's like in overdrive and I can't, I just can't look straight ahead and think about something.  It's always something's bothering me or irking me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, when you were in prison or boot camp were you able to sleep well then and not get -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not be racing like this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mind would be racing on coming home, you know.  There's more to it.  I just can't say everything, but there's more to the jail thing than me coming home and it's like, you know, I thinking about I got to come home, I got to come home, I got to get back to my f, my wife and kids.  But then when I get home, I don't have a wife.  I have my kids, but we're not a family no more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but when you, how did you do in prison?  Were you able to get along with people?  Did you get in trouble?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I, I just stood with a certain crowd of people and I really didn't talk to nobody else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really don't, like uh, talk to many other people, just people I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know I'm kind, you could say I'm shy.  You know sometimes I'll goof around with like the waiter or something at the restaurant, but that's as far as it goes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you didn't have trouble following the rules and, in prison and all that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, they tell us not to do things and we do them anyways.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I mean like, if you tell me to stand right there, I, I could stand there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very depressed.  I want to damn near cry everyday.  There's days where I just go take a shower so I can cry in the shower because I can't talk to nobody.  I feel like sometimes I can't talk to people.  They say they're there for me, but I can't talk to them and if, I always feel like everyone's out to get me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your energy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I have energy, but then there's day when I feel real tired and kind of drained and I just lay down for a minute and then I'll be good to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Once a day.  Like today I didn't eat yet since I've been up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why do you only eat once a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really don't feel the urge -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you lost weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I've lost weight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I'm not sure.  I used to be kind of more bloated.  Everyone says they can see in my face that I stopped drinking -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because my face would be always swelled up like, I don't know, maybe 10, 15, 20 pounds maybe.  I know it's a lot more in my legs too.  My legs were a lot chunkier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well when you do stop drinking you might um, you know, you're not all those dead calories and that type of thing.  Um, but if you're eating once a day.  Um, do you have crying spells?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Crying?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I cry sometimes in the car when I'm just driving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like it's certain things will just get to me.  And I always, like I said, I feel like no one's there for me.  You know, like, I'm a very affectionate man, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Be touched once in a while or talked to, "Hey how you doing baby," whatever, whatever, and it's like when I lay in bed and she's got her back turned, turned towards me or I, I, told her like, like "You're being distance from me" and she said she hasn't that it's just, it's me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I, you know, like every morning I give her a kiss, tell her goodbye, you know.  You know text message me when you get to work to let me know you're safe, you know when it's snowing and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have suicidal thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, it's crossed my mind and it's more of like, could I do it?  Can I not do it?  Do I really want to do it?  Or can I get over this?  But the whole problem with me drinking is I was drinking pretty much to try to hurt myself, to put myself, because with all the stress and the court system -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And me knowing that there's a high potential of going back to jail, and it's, you know, I, it's like I lost, I lost my family -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, my girlfriend, she says she's there, but I'm always riding her.  I'm eventually going to lose her and you know my family's there, but I can't tell them everything.  You know, how am I going to go, you know, and say, "Oh I'm having problems with my girlfriend" or this or that.  You know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to talk to people sometimes because I think that what I'm going to tell them is going to scare them or make them worry about me more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about um, okay.  Um, do you have racing thoughts?  You know like, you can't turn off our mind.  It just keeps going and going and going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I lay down at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It takes me a long time to unwind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have you have a history of like, spending sprees, life of the party -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wait, what -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like a animal.  When I had the money I'll go to [DEIDENTIFIED], get VIP, buy a bottle, you know.  Uh, periodically I'll just go shopping and spend $400 or $500 buying shoes and pants and shit like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah, if I have money in my pocket I, I, that's like my uh, my pre-occupation or you know, to pre-occupy myself -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I said, I sit at home a lot and the only time I like to leave is with my girlfriend when we go do something.  Like she came, she, we went to [DEIDENTIFIED] before here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She took back some Christmas stuff and then um, I dropped her off over here on [DEIDENTIFIED] so she could get her nails done while I'm here and I just, there's a tavern across the street, I just said go to the tavern if I'm late.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sorry, a tavern?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's tavern across the street from the nail salon -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I told her just to go in there and have something to eat or get a drink or something if I'm not back in time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see, okay.  Um, do you get paranoid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I used to have this paranoid thing when I used to sell dope that uh, someone was going to come in my house while I'm sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like if I, I just hear a little, I'm up looking around the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Were you doing pot at that time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  The only thing I did then was drink.  I didn't, I drank like, 4 days of the week, but not like how I did when I came home this time.  This time was everyday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get grandiose?  Like you have special powers or abilities?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not going to say special powers like I'm X Man, but I think I'm tough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you feel people can read your mind or control your thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Depends how you want to take that.  I think uh, sometimes, I think my girlfriend's playing a game with me and just try, you know, some of the things she say -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like she's playing with your mind, but do you think people or your girlfriend, can actually read your thoughts or understand them?  Hear your thoughts?  [INAUDIBLE] your brain, so to speak.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, does the TV or radio ever talk about you?  Do you get that feeling that, that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No but I do get this uh, buzz sometimes in my head.  When I lay down it's just like a hummmmmm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  But you don't hear voices?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I'll say, "What did you say?"  She'd be like, "Nothing."  I thought maybe she said something but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what do you think would help you the most?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What do I think?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, like if there were -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know what would help me.  I mean,  I would just like to stop my brain stop racing all the time where I could just me more, you know, like, because I know people get sick of me just always fucking nagging and getting all over her case about stupid things.  Like I said, she like, she could go to the gas station and say, "Okay, I'm going to get a something to drink."  My brain and it's not like I really want to do it, but is she meeting someone at the gas station, what the hell is got to go to the gas station?  You know what I mean?  And it's just, it's stupid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do have a problem too, lately -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I think it's due to sex, of a, penile dysfunction.  My thing don't want to get hard all the way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if that ties in anywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not, and you're not on any medications?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, just the blood pressure, the lisinopril.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lisinopril.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I would think that would help it because that's supposed to open up the blood vessels and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it doesn't work that way.  Uh, let's see, lisinopril.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told, I told [NAME OTHER] about it and he was, you know, he kind of put his input on it.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just wish I could be more focused and not let everything get to me and just, you know, concentrate on 1 thing, and then, because my last worry is, is my girlfriend but I always put that somewhere in the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, in terms of what would help you now, I guess I'm trying to think.  Um, it, it's really hard to say.  I mean, [NAME OTHER] was questioning attention deficit disorder and I wonder if you have more, sort of an affective disorder or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A disorder of a more mood, an affector.  Something called cyclothymia or bipolar type 2.  It's really kind of hard to say -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what, you, you say, say that and that's kind of odd because I can start a fight with her or start talking shit about something that I heard she say, but then like, as soon as I walk out the room,  I'd be pissed off, I walk out the room, I go down stairs and all of a sudden I come back in the room, you know, I'm sorry, kissing on her, she's like, "Get off me, get off me.  Quit trying to touch me."  I be like, "Why?"  "Because you pissed me off," "Okay, I'm sorry.  Just give me a kiss."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's things like that.  I seen, I seen that too like, like it's a switch that just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Makes me kind of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if it's uh, ah, regret I said something crazy to her or just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.  And when you were, okay well, and now that you're not drinking that helps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's helped a lot.  And if I was still drinking she would have left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And there's a question of an enlarged liver?  Who did you see?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] um, at uh, um, uh [DEIDENTIFIED] on [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he, what did he, he just did an exam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he took blood one day and he tells me, he calls me the next day and he was like uh, "We got your results.  I think you should come in and talk to me."  So I said, "When would you like," he was like, "Today or tomorrow."  I said, "Okay, I'll be there tomorrow."  So I come there the next day.  He tells me that, uh my liver is enlarged and it could be damaged from heavily drinking.  So he wanted me to go down for a uh, ultrasound.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I went and took the ultrasound.  He's showing me on the paper there's like 3 sections with the ions, izones or something -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Enzymes, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He was concerned about -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because all the numbers were like doubled or tripled than what they should be -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he was concerned more about the last one.  That's he said when that's high your liver could be damaged.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bilirubin?  Did he mention?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That might have been the last one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did he mention hepatitis?  Did he do a hepatitis screen?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He, they, he, they took more blood -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Blood for a hepatitis screen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you ever do IV drugs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  The only drugs, the drug of choice that I don't do no more was pot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So did you get the ultrasound?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I got the ultrasound.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So the lady tells me 3 to 4 days someone will contact me.  Well like, 2 weeks go by and no one contacted me and I kind of just blew it off thinking they'll call me.  I called them and then I get, you know, I talk to like, 3 or 4 different receptionists and the lady kind of pissed me off because she says, "Well, if no one contacted you it's no big deal."  Well, why would he call me back in to take more blood -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well you need to have a follow up appointment with him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm going uh, this coming week, actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The best is why don't you just wait until you see him and certainly alcohol could cause that, but you know, you could also have acute hepatitis, too, and that could cause problems, but stopping drinking is the best thing you could do for your liver.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.  But yeah, I pretty much stopped.  This New Year's, like I said, I had um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I guess what I'd like to do is, it's really hard for me to say, I mean we could do nothing, but it sounds like uh, you could use some treatment and unfortunately in psychiatry it's not like I could do a blood test and say you need this medicine or you have this diagnosis.  You have a variety of different things.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah it's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have issues of depression, you have issues -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The depression I know is there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I could be in the car and just start hearing a song and something will click in my head about something that happened in the past or happening now and I'll start welling up, getting a tear, but I try to fight it.  I don't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But no one's ever treated you with an antidepressant, Prozac, Zoloft -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Paxil, anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's, it's like, it's happened just within the last like, 2 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Well, maybe what I think I might want to try to do first is treat with an antidepressant and if that doesn't work, consider sort of a more mood stabilizer, um, or atypical neuroleptic and if that doesn't work might, I might consider the issue of attention deficit disorder, consider a stimulant, but I'm not sure I want to go to that immediately at this point.  And um, the medicine I'm thinking of is called Wellbutrin or buproprion is the generic.  And it doesn't work immediately.  It might take a little while, but even if you have some hyperactivity or attention deficit it may possibly help with that too.  And you got to give it a couple weeks to, before you say it's not working out.  If you take it and you really don't like it or hate it uh, you can always stop, but my thought would be to give it a try and meet in a couple weeks and kind of reassess how things are going.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And uh, like I said, if you really don't like it you can always stop it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just something to make my mind stop racing and stop thinking all that crazy stuff, or is that just in my mind?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No there, [LAUGHING], you, you have a lot of things, I mean I also debate about giving you this new medicine called Invega -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I think if, if, if I had a pill that would kind of calm me down, make me happy, but not, like just block certain parts; like the girlfriend part, block that out so that I'm not so that I can be happy with her because when I'm, I treat her good, but it's my mouth and one of my thoughts get to going all crazy.  Like okay, she didn't call me for 2 hours yesterday.  I think she's out there fucking around, doing this, this and that.  My sister says, "You know, why you think like that?  Girls need time alone with their girlfriends sometimes."  Why the hell didn't she pick up the phone?  You know, and I can go on and on and on, it's like, you give me a topic about something like that and I could take it around the corner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe what I want to do, maybe I'll start the Invega first.  Um, since that seems to be your thing and that might help with the racing thoughts and let's try that.  Oh, I know what I been wanting to ask you I think.  Now, when you did take the cocaine, what would it do for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what?  I would be so fucked up and drunk -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it basically would take my drunkness away so I could drive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you would always do it when you were drinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it would be like, I'm getting into it with my girl or, you know I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would it help you focus?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Would it help me focus?  Uh yeah, a little bit.  Better on the road, yeah.  I'd say it helped me focus some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  It helped you focus.  Because you do have a lot of sort of symptoms that fit a whole bunch of criteria so it's kind of hard for me to know which way to start uh, at this point.  Uh, sometimes stimulants can be very good things.  Um, but, so you've never taken speed or anything or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I think someone gave me some speed one time and I, I uh, I think I freaked out -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of, on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Here.  Why don't we start [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah that thing with the girlfriend and all that about uh, you know, just because she's not cuddling with me in the bed makes me think that she's fucking somebody else.  You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Things like that are, you know, "who are you talking to, who texted you, you've been on your phone all day."  It's almost like I, I say things like that or I'll say something like, "well you don't pay me no attention.  You know, you sit here with me and don't say nothing and I feel that you're giving me the cold shoulder, but as soon as your phone rings whoever's on that line, you're all chipper with them, but you tell me you're not having a good day."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "So how can you tell me that you're not having a good day?  When someone else calls you, you're fine."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it, like I said, I feel that people are out to get me or against me.  You know, I got, I got a lot of stress with, with the courts and all that and you know that, that's been on my mind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is your um, [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's my number.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And who's [NAME OTHER]?  Is that your girlfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, [NAME OTHER] is my -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ex-wife?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, my federal probation agent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  [NAME OTHER].  What's her last name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, [NAME OTHER].  Okay that's, I see.  What if we met -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no no.  I said what if we meet again um, I'm looking at my schedule here.  How about a week from Monday, Monday the [DATE] at 12:30 could you meet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you're not working at that time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, if I work I just leave or work later or before then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Let's meet Monday [DATE] at 12:30 right here in my office.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But [NAME OTHER] said he, he didn't want to give me no medication, he says, because I have a good personality, he don't want nothing to ruin my personality.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, and I want you to try taking, here's 2 weeks of samples, so that's 1, 2, so you'll have enough.  You just take 1 in the morning when you get up and that's all you have to do.  Don't take another one, don't take it in the evening.  You take it first thing in the morning and if you have a problem with it, you can stop it and you certainly can give me a call.  My number's on here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But otherwise -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can I get another one of these?  Just to give to my PO or whoever should ask me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Otherwise, keep on taking it and let's meet um, on [DATE] and we'll review how things are going and make a decision whether to continue with this.  This is a low dose.  It's just 3 mg.  Actually it's, the starting dose is 6, but I want to see how you do and how you like it, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So just take 1?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just 1 in the morning, like I said, it's just 1 tablet in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  And what is this exactly going to do for me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I'm hoping [LAUGHING], it will help with, organize your thoughts, make you a little less paranoid, suspicious and organize you a little bit better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] suspicious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I should be a God damn detective with all the thinking I do [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so let's meet uh then and give it a try.  If it doesn't work I have lots of other things we can try -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But sometimes you have to try one thing and then another.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll see you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You have a happy new year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You too.  Okay, one sec.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: and said that they're just clarifying what they're looking for and they're going to call it either like an Assessment assistant, something like that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Maybe Assessment assistant. So they're clarifying like what the job is and what the functions are and then they're going to call me next week to kind of compare what they're kind of looking for with what my goals are and expectations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I thought from what you had shared at group that they just really hadn't come up with the money that would make it feasible for you to do it? So are they looking now to kind of maybe do it on a contract basis where it's a lump sum to get them organized or something?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: My, well, I, so I, I basically told him that it wasn't enough money - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - and he wrote me an e-mail just saying you know I thoroughly, I have it in front of me, "I thoroughly enjoyed our visit and hope that we can find a way to work together if the stars line up, financial needs can be met, and the damned (ph) on the first" or something you know, it's. [chuckles]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: So, I don't, it looks to me realistically that it's not going to be enough but you know maybe they'll come up with an offer that would be appealing enough for everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And are they, they're offering you the 30 hours a week so that you can get benefits?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: That's what Josh said when I originally talked to him  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - and I talked to my favorite teacher at school who, I believe, may be in Al-Anon or not. [Chuckles] I mean just from her languaging (sp?)  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - I think she could be, and she's been at the school for 20-25 years, just retired actually. I talked to her on the phone about it, she's been very willing to be a mentor to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh good.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, and she basically said her experience is that, what happens is that students love it, it's a wonderful community, you know she's loved it, but what will happen a lot of times she sees is that, it starts out that the school serves them and it, somewhere flips and they start serving the school and that they grow resentful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And so she's seen that happen over and over again, so she really cautioned me about, about working for them. [0:02:02.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: So that was a good, I'm glad I talked to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they start resenting it because they're not, they're underpaid and overworked.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yup.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, got it.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yup, underpaid, overworked. Yes. So, but she offered to pass my resume around to her contacts in the biotech [chuckles] and I got  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh wow.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - [inaudible at 2:21.9] and gave her my resume so that was nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And she said, you know, ideally, in ideal situations, and also just in terms of making a living at cutting hair, she talked to me and said an ideal situation is to do it on the side and, you know, build up your practice and it's a nice, you know, it's a nice side income.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: So, you know, so it's a bit of a reality check and I mean there are people that do it obviously, you know, as their main profession, but  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - again, it's not all roses. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: You know, and a lot of the people I talk to are in debt, you know, or whatever, you know, so, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's a stepping stone  - </p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - in some direction for you, you just don't know what it's stepping you to yet.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Right, and so then next Wednesday before I meet with Glen...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: My old boss, is going to be meeting, I'm going to meet with my old boss at the University.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how long ago did you work for him or her?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I worked for him, I just printed out my resume, I think in like 2000, so maybe six, seven years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, it doesn't feel like it was that long ago, but I guess it was. Some ways it does, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Six or seven years ago, I worked for him and he said that if he got money in he'd be interested in hiring me and that was my experience always with him, you know, his grants coming in and out and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And I, he gave me a ton of independence, so in some ways he was a good boss because he was just completely hands-off and I just, I don't know if I can do a regular 40 hour a week type of job, but he may be willing to do some 30 hours and, it's just, I guess what comes up for me - [0:04:06.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - is that, well, I'm kind of resentful that I have to work [laughs]. I just don't want to work. I want to follow, I don't know, I still have a fantasy about like there's these dreams that I'm going to follow and I'm going to be pursuing this passion and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let me, let me ask you why, some questions, try to put some words to why you're resentful about working because most humans work, I mean.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you know why you're resentful?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I don't know. I don't know if it comes because I worked so hard in high school in college, like that I didn't have any "fun." I was always like my weekends were about stressing about work, or with schoolwork.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be a good guess, and if it, if that is, you know, kind of why the family's mad, you know the inner family's mad about it, then you might want to explain to them that you're never going to come at work that same way again. That experience will never be like that again.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, and I just, I don't know how to do it any other way and I'm scared, I mean I'm in recovery so I'm learning, but I'm really scared that I would go back to that, and  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think that the fears probably bigger because you're thinking of going back to the same industry.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And so, what is, what was your undergraduate degree?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Biology.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your grad degree?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: In Biological psychology.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And do you have any other kind of, how would you list your talents? You know, kind of God-given talents?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: God-given talents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well, right, you know that you're articulate.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, you know I'm articulate, yeah, like I'm a good writer. I'm good at sort of networking, so in some way I'm really good at people skills but more on a one-on-one type of people skill I see myself. [0:06:11.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And are you good with children, adolescents, adults, elderly? Any in particular or just set no, no particular segment?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: No particular segment. It's sort of, I'm not, yeah. I just, in some ways I don't have that much work experience. Like I've always loved school, well I always thought I loved school anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what did you love about school?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I just liked learning; there was something very passionate about it for me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: It was very, maybe it was like I had control? It was an area of my life I had control? Like if I study hard enough, I do well on the test? So I always had a sense of control, even in beauty school I have a real sense of control? And I've never had that, and work never felt that to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what, what does work feel like? If it doesn't feel like a sense of control?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: It has always felt like prison to me. It has always felt like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well God girl, no wonder you don't want to do it and you're resentful. Well let me just tell you that, you know, just kind of, and I'm talking to the inner family as well as you, is that my belief is that God has given us certain talents that we get to utilize [at 7:23.6] and that we can find work that we would pay them to let us do. I've, ever since my recovery, I have had only work basically, you know every now and then I had a, you know, when I, because I went back to school and, you know, worked on my degrees and one of the times I just needed some extra money, I'd run out of money to, to be at school and had to work, go back to work again. And normally I worked for the school district because the LV city schools really paid fairly well, even as a teaching assistant but, yeah, I was at a different university living in a different area and that school district didn't so I had to look for some other job. And I was looking through the paper and I found library clerk and I thought, "I can probably do that," you know, they wanted, I don't know, whatever it was, 10-15 hours a week and it wasn't, it was above minimum wage, it was a fairly okay part-time pay, but it was just reconciling these really old bank accounts. I think it was some school library. And I had a desk in this accounting office and I didn't really know much about accounting, but just by being there the short amount of time that I was there doing their, you know, old organizing, I learned about organizational flow and I thought, later I thought "Oh, that's why God gave me that job, because I was going to be self-employed and I needed to know about organizational flow and, you know, all that kind of stuff." And so, even that one, and it wasn't unpleasant and it wasn't a prison, but it wasn't as, you know, it wasn't one of those ones that I'd pay them to let me to do? But most of the time I've really had work that I'd pay them to let me do. That's so uplifting and so enriching and I'm going to encourage you to believe that that can happen for you too. I don't think it has to be unique to me. [0:09:11.5]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah and I just have a really hard time believing that and I sort of thought it about it cosmetology and I like styling, but I get resentful about that too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what's the resentful part about the styling?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: It's like when I'm giving a hair cut I feel people. [Chuckles] Okay, I'm going to say it because I know it sounds a little embarrassing (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [laughs]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: But it feels like people are draining my energy. Like they're sucking me dry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you may, that may be an experience that has some validity to it. You know, it's stran... I think that when we work with people in any kind of a healing art, and beauty is certainly a healing art, what I do is kind of a healing art, is that it is up to us to know how to have our boundaries up?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't just mean verbally, but I mean kind of a energy field wise. I think it's very important that we know how to do that so that we aren't taking on anybody else's stuff. We aren't letting our great creative energy be given away.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And I hear, I mean, and they teach us that in school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: You know, they give us various techniques to do it, from you know rituals of clearing energy to imagining on your arms these energy barriers  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - you know hands are touching and it, gets (ph) some techniques and, I guess I'm still in the beginning of my career so it just takes a while to learn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: You know, to give myself that, that time to learn it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good. Yeah, so have you practiced any of them? Does it seem to help at all?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: It seems to help, but as I guess with anything new, it's still really draining so it's like I can only do so much. You know, like I can't see myself in a spa setting right now with lots of clients.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: That that would just be way too much. That it just, yeah, but I need to get my, and I guess the appeal for getting the job in the I.T. is that it gives me, I feel like I'll have the room to breath and grow with styling slowly. [0:11:18.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Like I won't feel this pressure to get up to speed and running.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that's a good idea. I think oftentimes that that is how we start off in any profession is we try to kind of get our ducks in a row financially in other areas so that we can, therapists do it, they build their practice but oftentimes they have to do other stuff while their build, I've done one guy that, gal that was a, what do you call those the secretary-type person at a lawyer's office?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Oh a secretary?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Secretary. She was, you know, put herself through graduate school being a secretary and then was able to work part-time while she built her practice so that's not unusual.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. That's not usual, it's just, what comes up for me is just the having the energy, I guess to do both, but I guess I can try to get...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well my guess is right now it doesn't feel like you have it, but my guess is when you're in the middle of it, that I think it will be a transformation for you. If I had to guess, that's what I would say. Because I never felt like I had the energy to be in early recovery, raise two kids, go back to school, get a job.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do my own, I was separated so I was like, okay I have a yard, I don't have a gardener. I have housework, I don't have a maid you know? And I had small kids so they weren't really in, you know, nobody, it was me that pushed the lawnmower so to speak.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, I just.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I can't even imagine how I did it, other than God.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, I guess that's it, it's coming back to my higher power as it is a lot of pollution (ph) there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: It's really trusting God on this. And I guess as far as the job stuff goes with the beauty school or the university, I mean I just have to keep trusting God. I'll keep one step in front of the other and see who offers me what. You know, what my options are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And nothing's permanent. </p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And nothing's permanent. And it's just been a lot of fears of making mistakes, but yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And again the thing that really helped me a lot is, God is bigger than any mistake I make. [0:13:19.9]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If my heart's in the right place and your heart's in the right place the best I can tell, you have been very, very clear about your heart being in the right place. This is about your growth, your spiritual growth, your finding, your passion in life, your niche in life.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, and I'm just so jealous of other people, which I know is a sign. I'm so jealous because I see other people like you and like my husband, as much as I, you know whatever, but like following their dreams, following, trying to find that thing that you said that I'd pay to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And I have trouble believing that I'm actually ever going to have that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I do think that that's what safe is about. You know if we really knew the future and we knew how it was all going to come together, we'd never need faith. But life is, and the truth is if our soul really knew what was going on, we would not be happy campers. [laughs] So, I think the excitement of life is the not knowing. That it's, so it's always creative, it's always an adventure and, and nothing's permanent. And if you can kind of invite the kids to be on board with looking at finding work that is uplifting and enjoyable and enriching and not everybody walks through that and believes that and goes in that direction, but I want to encourage you to do that. </p>

<p>My, my first husband, had been sober a long time and he, you know, he just hung in this job and hung in this job and hung in this job and, you know, he'd been there 20 some odd years and probably, I'm going to say when this happened to him it was somewhere in '86, '85 or some, '86, '87 maybe, and he had been with this company since, I'm going to say '65 and probably ten of those years he had been sober, but not 20 of them. And he was a manager and they called him in one day and they said we're going to have to do some layoffs and because he was a manager he thought, "Okay well who do I have to lay off?" and they said "we're laying you off." And he, you know, it was a small company and he knew the owner and the CFO and, you know, he'd been there a long time and he said, "Why are you laying me off? And they, he said they kind of looked down and shuffled papers and then one of them looked up and said, "We know you hate it here." [0:15:48.6]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Oh wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he said I, like it was a, a boulder came off his shoulder and he said, "You're right" and they gave him this incredible, what do they call it, severance package and da, da, da, da, da. And all he did was wanted, he had not taken a vacation in all those years. Not a, not one vacation [laughs] in all those years and so he decided just to take off, take time off, work on his tan, and quit smoking. And when the industry kind of found out he had been laid off, he started getting calls, you know, are you available? We got something we want you to look at, da, da, da. And because he wanted to lay at the beach and work on his tan, he kept putting people off. "Well, I'm looking at a lot of things" and "well, you know, we probably can increase that package for you." And long story short, by him just wanting some time off, he got not only offered a vice-presidency of this one company, he got a company car, he got, you know like the perks kept going up and up until he finally said, "Well, that's a good package." And I, when he told me this story I laughed and said, "God did for you what you could not do for yourself." [chuckles] Is that it got him out of a place that he would have endured, endured, endured. Gave him some time off and then offered him this really incredible job. He's the president of a company now, as opposed to the vice-president. And, and I just, he would have endured forever. So I, I know that you don't want to endure. I know that you're telling God, telling the universe that you're ready. That you would like to bring your particular talents and skills into a form that brings you income and, and add to your community and add to the world through letting it bring you an income. And if you can hang onto that through faith, my guess is that it's going to show up. [0:17:34.8]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And what I. So in looking back on my job at the university...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: You know it was pre-recovery.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: It felt, it felt in a lot of ways I was enduring the job. Like, I did enough other things on the outside to make the job tolerable. But it wasn't, and I tried to be passionate about it, but it just wasn't like my passion?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And that was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But again that, that's the past and you don't have to repeat it.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Don't have to repeat it  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - but yet I can go back there to have the income to support myself  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - while I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you really might find that God kind of guides and directs you in a way that you didn't even know was, was available to you.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: So that that job, if, you know I don't even know if there's going to be a job, but if there would be a job there, God could be directing that I'd go back there and I'd be doing something different and I'd end up really loving it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You bet.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: So kind of trust in God on this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. And you don't have to think you did anything wrong if you go back and it's not the right fit, you can just say, "Oh, I thought it was going to be the right fit, it's not the right fit, I'm assume, assuming that God would like me somewhere else." I remember I walked off a job one time with, for the school district. I just became really unsafe, it was 12, I think they were 10-12 year-old boys and they were totally out of control and I was the teaching aide and they were, you know, handicapped kids but all, mostly emotional disturbance and the teacher like quit (ph) shaving and was having a break down and one of the boys said, "Close the door, we're raping the aide." And so I knew it was kind of time for me to go, you know [chuckles] and so I walked in and it's some, you know I've got a family at home, I've got a house payment and I thought you know, I don't need to be here and I walked in and I told the principal, I said, "I'm sorry to report this, but here's the situation and I think he needs help, I think he needs a leave of absence and I need to go." And so it's like February or something. It's not the time of year to look for a school position. [0:19:59.2]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I called downtown and let them know I was available and they had a brand new federally funded project for three to five year-olds that were all wards of the court coming from abused homes that we were going to do play therapy with them.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Oh wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I interviewed with this incredible group of people. Not like your stuck in the mud, endure your teaching job people. These were the creative, cutting-edge people and as they, I was one of the first people they, they interviewed at, like after they got the two head teachers and they brought me on board and then I interviewed with them the next person that came in and then that person interviewed with us the panel to get the, you know we built this team. They sent us away for a week for bonding.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They gave us two different psychologists for ongoing support. They gave us classes. I mean it was like a dream job.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. All because I walked off the job at exactly the right time. I was not willing to endure. I wanted to be there for those boys, but, while that teacher was having a breakdown, but when it became unsafe it was time to go and I honored that. So I don't think I made a mistake, I think the timing was right. So if you go back and take the job and you discover in two months, six months, three days, two years, whatever you notice that it's not right for you anymore, then that'll be the right time God's got something else in mind for you. [0:21:22.4]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: [groans] I just, ahhh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this is, this is really about strengthening your faith muscle.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I'm strengthening everything [inaudible at 0:21:34.3] feelings (ph). Yeah because just the thought you know when I think about a job because I still my layers of old beliefs on it, it just feels like enduring, you know just the thought of a job just like enduring. [laugh]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, I can tell you that that's how I felt about marriage when I came out of my first marriage. I thought I would never, ever, ever do that again and then met you know a love of my life and compatible in every way, shape or form and when he asked me to marry him and I said yes in a weak moment and then I went into a six week depression and I had to tell him. And he was good at cartoons and, he drew and sketched and wrote poetry, I mean he is really talented in lots of way. He drew this cartoon that was like me staring, laying on the bed staring at the ceiling about what am I going to do about this, I love him, I don't want to get married. [laughs] And it was just the cute, you know like he didn't take it personally. And I really had to just work on that and work on that and work on that because I needed to know that I was not going to repeat that marriage.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I did not. We did not. We didn't have, we had separate homes, we had, we really created a marriage that works for us or works for me more specifically. So you get to make this up. You get to kind of decide, he's, your boss is going to, your resume is being passed around but you're going to get to interview them. What's their energy like? Are they excited about what they're doing? Does it sound like it might be fun for you? Do your talents match it? You know, those are all okay questions to ask. [0:23:12.2]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, and another thing is it going be okay, I guess it's going to be okay to tell Bradley, my old boss at the university, that I'm in a massage school or maybe I'll probably tell him I'm working on my HHP because that sounds a little more respectable than massage. [laughs]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I know. I know.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I can just tell him I'm getting a Holistic Health Practitioner license.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that's why you want something part time, but you're hoping that it's something that you can really enjoy and really bring your talents and a contribution to. And if you look at it that way, that I want to go somewhere where I'm going to be bringing something that's in, that I feel like I can, I'm really contributing to something that's fun and enjoyable and the people are nice and, I can tell you that God can arrange it. This is not a hard thing for God.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Right. And I would just feel so much more relief if I had some money coming in, if I was self-supporting and also become working on the [inaudible at 0:24:09.3].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me, let me tell you again if you had money back-up, my guess is you wouldn't have to strengthen your faith muscle.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: You're right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then God is the source. You know the bank account, the inheritance, that's not the source, that's just a channel it comes through. God's the source. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. God is the source, yeah. Ohhhhh, I mean it, it makes so much sense intellectually and then getting that soully (ph) (sp?) [laughs]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, but that again, when we strengthen our faith muscle, we act on faith, we act on faith, we act on faith whether or not we feel fear, we act on the faith, we keep reaffirming our faith, and pretty soon we build trust. Because we have been a historical path that we can look back on and how well we're taken care of. You know, you've heard me, I mean you've been around me long enough to know, do I tell story after story?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because my faith God confirmed into a trust. And do I still like, you know the newest thing for me is my rental investments?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I've noticed that I'm having to build from safe, not, because I don't have trust in that area. It's a new area. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to hire the right property manager, pick the right anything you know and so I'm working much more in safe than my trust. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Yeah. And it's just, oh yeah, it makes so much sense and it's, I recognize it is as what I, what I need in my life and what I didn't learn as a child from my family that was all about control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: So, and it's just, it's just foreign. You know? [laughs] It's basically, I mean it's getting less foreign, but  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - still at some level a foreign concept even as (ph)  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - less and less in fact.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So don't try to make it about needing more release. Make it about, thank you God for an opportunity to grow in faith, thank you God for this opportunity to grow in faith. Just make that your mantra.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Thank you God. Okay. And I guess that's where it is. I just got to have that faith that God's going to show me, you know, with the support of recovery a way to do work where it's not hell - [0:26:21.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - because that's my association with work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Correct and it doesn't have to, I mean you know my work isn't that way, you know a lot of gals in the group that is not how their work is. You know all work has its ups and downs and struggles, but in general it has mostly joy to it for me.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah I can't even imagine that. Yeah, I mean I hear Joan too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, Joan, and I think, I think Kara really, you know she has lots of stress but she really loves knowing that she's helping those adolescent kids.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She really knows that's her purpose right now. And, I'm trying to think who else. Even Chrissie when she was, had, before she had that injury where she doesn't, can't work as much. You'd hear her light up when she'd talk about those kids.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. And Ana too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ana, yep.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: [inaudible at 0:27:07.3] stories of other things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep. Absolutely with her.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: [inaudible] She does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep, with her writing, absolutely.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, and I just can't believe that that's possible for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is possible for you. Your, it's, it's that, in AA they talk about that ego in reverse, which it, when it punishes us? Well, you know you're sicker than the rest so it can't happen for you. </p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: That's really what [inaudible at 0:27:29.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: God loves them but not you and that's just ego, that's just ego. We're not that special. It really is available for all of us. [chuckles] </p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Just haven't experienced it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well, my feeling is that even though we kind of separated work from the Glen or the marriage thing, is that I'm going to guess you brought that same enduring energy to the marriage.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: [laughs] Oh, God, (ph) look at that you took the worst part of your marriage to make it work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and I want you to know you don't have to do a marriage that way either.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Oh yeah. I have some trouble in that area, but safe enough [but I have to listen to my burner] (ph) [chuckles] right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, but it will. And the, at the more you work through this enduring issue around work and really have more and more faith muscles strengthened and more trust muscles strengthened, it will help you to move through when you're ready to date or venture out in that arena too.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Okay. Wonderful. Ahhh. Yeah and I don't and by the way, how long is our session (ph)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've sided (ph) you for an hour if you want it.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Oh good, that works for me I just wasn't sure if it was 30 [or if it's] (ph) an hour. Yeah and then I guess this with the massage school thing, I'm just going to have to trust God whether it feels right when I talk to him about exact, because they're clarifying what they want, because it was [way before] (ph) when he had a million ideas. It would probably be much clearer when I talk to them again, and find (ph) exactly what they're looking for. [0:29:05.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: [See if it's] (ph) a good fit or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you can even say, I don't know if I'm open to a, an ongoing situation, but I can't take that one chunk and do that one chunk for you for $1,500 or that other chunk for $3,000. But, you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: So I can negotiate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You can always negotiate.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Get away from my work [inaudible at 0:29:30.6] like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, it's like, I, I still have some, I guess it's I don't know if it's ego or arrogance?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Just about, about certain jobs. Just like maybe it's around massage too. I can still like, I was talking to someone from Starting Over on the beach who I'm not really friends with, like it was a couple of us walking and she was talking about getting a hair cut and how good the lady was and she said something like, "Yeah, I bet you she's like going on to be a top stylist or something because he was just so good. I mean I can't imagine him staying as a hair cutter only."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aww. Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: But it fed into my own arrogance around it as well. I thought, wow, like some part of me agrees with her, like. That that's not a good enough, you know, that's not that you would stay at that. You would do something more. Yeah, think thingums (ph) (sp?).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, you know, and for some people that are real good, they might go on to something else and some people who are real good have a full practice and enjoy it. [chuckles] You know?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a client that's been a massage therapist for a while and she does, she works at a spa and has on and off different ones, but she's gone on to get some kind of a degree that, and she's in her 60s now and she loves helping seniors, she loves giving massages to senior citizens and a lot of people don't. They don't want to touch the old people. And she loves it and she loves the ones that have arthritis and stuff and so she went on to get some kind of a, where she can teach like water aerobics at the senior center, you know? And it's just brought even more joy to her.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because she knows she has a special calling to work with senior citizens and people that are either injured or whatever, she's just so, her practice has kind of evolved in a certain way from finding out that about herself and then she did pick up some other classes. But it's not, I don't think you have to be arrogant about it. I mean I have another friend that's been a massage therapist for a long time and she's a single mom and she just has a full practice and loves it. [0:31:39.9] I don't think she's going to go anywhere with it in general.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, and there's some part of me that thinks like I'm better than, like that arrogance like I'm better than being a massage therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me rephrase the statement for you. That I may have some talents and skills that are going to be used in bigger or better ways than massage work? And that might be true.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Well that would be okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it doesn't mean that one group's better than the other group. It just means, you know, I know how to type but I'm pretty sure God's not going to use that as a skill. </p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm sure that, I have this one gal I may have told you this story about her before but she got thrown out of the house at like 13 from drug use and they just didn't know what to do so they just kind of locked her out and she kind of ran the streets, didn't, literally no edu, really bright, but really no education. She finally got sober and clean about 18, ended up getting pregnant her first year, had a baby and then was on welfare and was in a car accident. And around the time she was in a car accident, she wanted to deal with her recovery from an eating disorder. She had a little money to come to my groups and pay me and stuff and what she decided to do as she got more and more into recovery, and she hung onto that money, she budgeted pretty good, is she wanted to look at having a real career. And she had no education at all. She said if I had an education, I'd want to be a veterinarian. </p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Wow. [0:33:27.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And she said I can't imagine trying to, not even getting out of the 8th grade, do that. And she said the other thing that I thought I'd like to do is maybe cut hair. You know be a beautician, but she said I'm not sure I'm that good with people. She said, so I think what I'd like to do is be a dog groomer.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Ahh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so she found a woman who was a dog groomer. Paid the woman to train her, didn't go to school for it, paid the woman to train her. Went and got a job, started working, got a, earned enough, was good enough at it to kind of support her and her son. Got off of welfare and by then she had a few years of abstinence and quite a few years of sobriety and her mom who had kind of been around this area, southern New York area, decided to move back to New Jersey or something where her sister had married and had a family back there to be around that family for a while. And this gal just kind of found out that she wanted to move back there and said, "Do you think that that's a good idea?" And I said I think that's a fine idea. She went back there into this little town, they didn't have a dog grooming service within 60 miles.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She opened it up. She's like a pillar of the community because she's a business owner in town.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everybody knows her. The Chamber of Commerce knows her. They're proud that they've got a dog grooming company in this little town.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It, who'd have thought? Who'd have thought?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And that's beautiful and I think, I think the thing for me is I grew up kind of being told that I was a superstar sort of thing? That I was so smart and, oh she's going to go to medical school and blah, blah, blah and so it's really hard for me and it wasn't about the money. It wasn't like, oh she's going to earn so much money, but it was that I was so smart, like I was going to do these incredible things with my intellect. Or something. I don't know where I got, all that came, but whatever, it's that like nothing is good enough for me now. [0:35:33.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Well  - </p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Like being a dog groomer wouldn't be good enough for me. You know, I'm too good for that. It blocks me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It blocks you definitely. Well, I'd certainly get the pen and paper out and try to say, "what's the block?" And, because for me I had a lot of less than, less than, better than stuff going on and, particularly in early recovery, and it sounds like it kind of falls in that category. And I really had to get it. You know my handicapped granddaughter, because my kids are, my daughter's like in the genius category and my son's in the gifted category and I was in the gifted category, so we're really hooked on that intellect thing too?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then, here my daughter who's this genius person has a mentally retarded daughter. And what I've noticed is that this angel in the family is teaching all of us things that we never could have learned any other way. And so there isn't really, you know, from the Gandhi standpoint? When, and you remember the movie?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, bri, a long time ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of depicted that he, he said that he and his wife lived on this commune thing and everybody knew Ga...and he's this hotshot guy, you know? You know, father of India. And he took his turn cleaning the toilets and his wife was very mad, like can't our position get us out of cleaning the toilets? And he said, "We're just one among this group. We clean the toilets. We rotate through."</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, and that's where, that's the whole resenting having to work for me, all this stuff, even having, it took me a long time to be able to even go to Al-Anon even though, you talked about it  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - for about a year. It's been just a journey to become one among the group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like you have a version of entitlement abuse. And I got some of that too. You're smarter, you're prettier, you're more talented. Why are you doing X, Y, or Z with your life? Why aren't you utilizing your potential? Why aren't you, you know, we expect great things of you and I was so burnt out on that by 8th grade that I was really, really rebellious. I asked my mother and kind of begged her to get me out of that gifted group and never put me back in it again. [0:37:57.2]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was, it so rubbed me the wrong way.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And, I mean, I just, I mean I lived for it, I mean, that's how I got any sense of worth. So, yeah, all that entitlement abuse, that's a good word</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And then what's so odd about it, it was just so strange, is I'm really uncomfortable with this inheritance money, which is, in the scheme of things is not that huge, but like believing that I can keep that, that Glen wouldn't get it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: It'd be okay for me to have that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Really uncomfortable, so it's really bizarre.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is, it is, we do end up with I can't think, I think kind of an intuitive feeling that there isn't this hierarchy that the world tries to make up that Gandhi was more right than wrong and yet it's really flattering... hang on, my UPS guy is here. And yet on the other hand, it is really flattering to be told those things about ourselves, particularly when we're a kid and we don't have a sense of mature character development yet. And so the kids are going to be, you know, on the one hand liking it and on the other hand hating it, which is kind of what I did by 8th grade. On the one hand, like it and on the other hand, hate it because there's more to me than that and I don't have to live up to my potential if I don't want to - leave me alone kind of thing and so I want you to kind of think in terms of what's some spiritual truths about this so that you can start to talk to your inner family. They really need you to be clearly and specifically helping them understand. [0:39:39.4]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, but it, it isolates me. It really isolates me that, like even in massage school I get this, well I got a science background so I'm better than these 19 year-olds coming out of high school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. And instead of making it better, make it different. You are different, you know? Your 34 or 5, I can't remember how old you are.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, 5, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 35. You're married, getting a divorce, have an advanced degree. You are different than them. Not better, but different.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Different, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At 35 they'll have their history too.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And I guess my inner kids hang onto the better, like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - that's going to keep me safe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And what it does is it keeps you separate and it keeps you fear-based instead of faith-based.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And for some reason, my Judaism has ties to that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how may have the Judaism might be tied in?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Because I grew up in a town without any Jews, so I'm like the only Jew, so there's always that sense of being separate?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ahh, okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I'm different, I'm sep...like it wasn't just different, it was like it turned into some sort of fear, arrogance thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't, I have a little sense of what some of your spiritual beliefs are but let me tell you one of the ones that I adopted to kind of challenge this less than, better than thing and when you brought about the Judaism it made me think of it. And that is that because I played that game so strongly and so devastatingly hurtful to me and to others, but particularly me, I decided to believe in reincarnation. And I didn't really know for sure if I believed in it, but I decided to believe in it and so I thought, would the world be a better place if we all believed in reincarnation - meaning that I've been black and I've been white; I've been tall, I've been short; I've been wealthy, I've been poor; I've been brilliant, I've been handicapped; you know, get over it. What are you doing this lifetime? [0:41:39.8]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, that's beautiful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And just embrace what I am doing this lifetime, as opposed to assuming that one position is better than the other because I've been them all or I'll be them all and so will you and so will everybody else. And that really did help make a shift for me.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Wow. Yeah, I love that. I really love that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, good cause it  - </p>

<p>RESPONDENT: It takes me out of that judgment place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really took me right out of it. You know, it helped me to focus on me. I happened to be a female in this lifetime, I have to be born in 1944 which means I was a kid of the '60s, a baby, a war baby but a kid of the '60s, so that gives me specific things. Yours would be a little bit different. And it is as it should be. So that's why the 19 year-olds are going to have their history by the time they're 38, so you're just different than them, but one's not better than the other one. Like 38 is a great age to be in my opinion. You know? I don't know if I, it's just, I like being 62, I'm almost going to be 63 as well, but their different, you know? They're just different and each, each phase of my life has its value and its purpose. But one isn't better than the other, so that would be like me saying, oh I wish I were 38 again, oh I wish I were 38 again, wish we're, what about these awful wrinkles? It's like, no. These wrinkles are a reflection of my life and I have a history. I don't want to erase my history. I don't want to pretend I'm another age and erase all my 30s or my 40s, I don't want to be a different age. I don't want to have different experiences. This is just my life this time. You know? [0:43:35.0]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Well that helps a lot. That helps a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good, good. But I want you to maybe get the pen and paper out and get some of these things in black and white so that you can start to communicate to the kids. And I have some spiritual books that, I can give you some titles, see if they are interesting to you at all.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, that would be great. I'd love that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Do you want them now or...?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. One of my favorite ones, it's a real old publication, it might be hard to kind of get but you probably could get it. The author's name is Jane Roberts and if you google her name online you might be able to figure out some stuff or pick up some books, but here's the one, it's called The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events and so it's kind of like a quantum physics book but it just really touched my heart. It talks about death and life and people and why earthquakes happen and, and so it was important to me to really get a foundation for how the world works and that one made the most sense to me. In fact anything by her I liked, but that one in particular, The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And Jane Roberts?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Jane Roberts.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And of course I like Gary Zukav's Seat of the Soul. And then I like Michael Newton's books: A Journey of Soul and Destiny of Soul. And that was, those have been out in the last few years so those are on amazon.com, as well as probably Gary Zukav's. Also, too, the one I read by Gary Zukav in 1979 that was on quantum physics, which was The Dancing Wu Li Masters. And I remember thinking, "Who can I talk to about this? This is great." And it was just too far out for most people, but check them out. I wouldn't buy them all, I'd try to go to a bookstore and see if you can't read them and see if they match at all, because they may or they may not. [0:45:44.4]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, most of them have concepts that you've probably heard me talk about over and over in groups and sessions, so.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Okay. Ahh, well it's just really good to talk about some of this (ph), what's been coming up for me around work and my beliefs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do, we just have, a few minutes left. Do you want to talk at all about the meeting with Glen coming up?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I guess, yeah. I'm not really sure. Yes, I'm meeting with him next Wednesday. I have the financial records.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is he bringing his financial records or...?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I don't know and I don't know if I say, "Hey, go ahead and get your financial records." [chuckles] But I think not, I think I'll bring what I have and basically, you know, he can then go and look up his records if he comes to (ph) get them, but basically I want to ask for fully what I put in, and if he wants something different, then let him make the proposal?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And when you say what you put in, you mean, what you want to get out is your inheritance? You want it back?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. I want my inheritance back and I have a number that he put in that, it looks like from the account. We'll get the records, although I don't have his original records...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: That he can take out what he put in, so I basically, and then, I don't if it's helpful. It's sort of helpful for me to talk numbers.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, so basically I put in $250,000.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: And he put in $30,000. [0:47:21.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: So, we each take out what we have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do you, well how much do you have? To take out from?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: There will be $65,000 left. So, it was 868 thousand left and I would just suggest we split that. So that's what I think, looking at the records. That's what, to me, looks like would be fair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's, that's where you start. Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: (crosstalk) [inaudible at 0:47:45.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's where you start then.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. And you know I have no idea how he's going to react.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what does your lawyer say? Does she say that's a good approach and let's go for it?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. My lawyer thinks that I'll be able to get that if I (crosstalk) now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: If we went through lawyers, that the law's in my favor - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - and that I could get that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so that's probably what you want to say. Say, take it for what it's worth, but the lawyer that I'm working with does feel that if we went to court that that would probably be what, what the end result would be.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Right. So that's what she said. Now, of course, she also told me that the judges don't always rule by the, [chuckles] by the law, so, it isn't a guarantee  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - that that would happen and that if he hires one of these high-powered litigator types, it could cost us a ton of money and they could try to argue that I commingled it and blah, blah, blah, so, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, just be prepared that if he has a strong emotional reaction, it's okay to say, it might be a good idea if I give you some space to kind of sit with it for a while and then maybe when it's not such an emotional conversation, we come back and talk again. And then get your stuff together and get up and leave.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. I think, so that's it. So be prepared to leave  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, with, with  - </p>

<p>RESPONDENT: if it gets emotional and I will have somebody with me</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: and I'm a little nervous that, I don't know. He may try to keep, an older man, he's retired and I'm a little nervous he might try to interfere a little bit and I know that that will tick Glen off big time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, where are you guys meeting?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: At Panera Bread.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you ask the friend, the older man, to sit close by but not be in the direct conversation? Would that make you feel safe? </p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Ahhh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that he's there, he's in the room. If you need him, you can lean over and say, whatever you need him for, can you come here? But otherwise, he's just there for backup support and that you sit down with Glen. One-on-one. [0:49:53.4]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: That's an idea. That's an idea, so that way...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then that would kind of stop him from butting in without getting an invitation and you'd still have him there for kind of a moral support.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Okay. That's a good idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So just say, I've thought it through a little bit and I think what I'd like to have happen is you sit table and chair kind of close to us but not really be directly involved in this situation unless I ask you to kind of come over and join us. But that you're there for the debriefing session, the preparation going in, the debriefing session, something like that.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. That's a great idea. I love that because I just was a concern that he was going to kind of step in as a father-figure and that that would just bo..., oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: My experience with Glen is that would just set him off  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - big time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In fact, I'd get there early enough I wouldn't even, wouldn't even necessarily introduce him to Glen. Glen doesn't even need to know he's there in the room unless you want him to be. If you decide to say I did bring a friend with me sitting over there, let me have him join us. That's if you choose to do it at that point, then you'd introduce him.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, and I did tell Glen I was going to bring somebody, but it might be good, I like your idea of not having him sit directly with us  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: - that we can try to talk. But knowing he's there will keep me in...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, and then is he a good person to try kind of debrief with?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, he's a good person, yeah, because he's been through several divorces and he's in recovery and you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what time is it on Wednesday?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: We're meeting at five and I have my job interview at 2, so it's [inaudible at 0:51:32.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh my God.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: With my old boss, so at least it's a comfortable, sort of comfortable interview in the sense that I'm really just interviewing him about what's been going on, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, with this Glen thing, I would just kind of say, I'm putting these numbers out, we probably, I'm not asking you to give me a final decision right now. I'm telling you what I think is fair and what I'd like, so it doesn't have to last real long?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And hopefully you'll get to debrief and then come and join group. If Glen wants to really talk it through right then, you have permission to say, "I probably need some time to think about what your saying. So, give me your feedback and then I think I'll just take some time to think about it and pray about it and then we can meet again or talk again." You don't have to answer if he wants, you don't have to be involved in the long, drawn-out thing.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I mean, I guess the other question that's coming up for me is, do I need, do I need to even meet with him? I mean can't in some way I just e-mail him these numbers and say, hey this is what I've done, this is what I want?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I certainly think you can do that.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I'm wondering if like this idea of meeting in person is causing me, would cost me more discomfort.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'd e-mail him and say, I've worked on my numbers, I know we probably need to get this handled or get this approached, dealt with. I'm wondering if you would like me to just go ahead and mail you the numbers and give you a paragraph explaining kind of my position and then kind of that gives you time to think about it and sort it through and then you can either e-mail me back or you can e-mail me back setting up a meeting and that would be okay too. But that might just be all I'm going to do is kind of put the numbers out there and give you time to think about, so why not do it through an e-mail? So, that's what I'd do. But I'd send the e-mail kind of inquiring, can we do it that way first?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, I mean because that's a good idea. I like that. It just occurred to me like why am I meeting with him, you know? When we don't need to, I don't need to go - (crosstalk) [0:53:33.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At this point, I don't think you need to.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I don't need to be through the trauma of his reaction, my reaction, and blah, blah, blah. (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. And you're welcome too, if he e-mails you back after the numbers, you can just forward it to me and I read it first so that if he's insulting you, you don't have to read it and I can give you the gist of it. [laughs] Because once I've been hurt, then it's harder on me. So.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Okay. That's an idea too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it's an option for you.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah. Thank you. That was really helpful actually. So, what I'm going to do is I'll send him an e-mail and tell him that I've looked up the numbers just to see what I think would be fair and ask him if he wants me to e-mail that to him, or if he wants to meet in person and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Wonderful. Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Now let me grab my schedule and see if we can line something up for next week since I'm ill-prepared for tomorrow. Let me take a look here. What about, let me see here, like a 4 o'clock on Tuesday? Oh yeah, you're not in group on Wednesday night. You're in group on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: I'm in group on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Is a good one or not a good one?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Actually not so good just because I go to a meeting after group, so I won't have time for dinner more easily.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: But we could do that in a pinch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Actually right now I have a 1 o'clock available in person that we could probably play around on her computer like you helped me before. [0:55:15.6]</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Better, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to do that one? 1 o'clock on Friday?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, next Friday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Yeah, that's probably going to be better anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay good.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Do it in person, it just needs less time I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. All right. Good deal then we're down. Now do you want to put your next one on the books?</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: No. I think I'm good for now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. All right.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: But that was really helpful, the stuff about the job and Glen. I liked that idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Perfect. All right well keep me posted and after you get your new beliefs kind of articulated for the inner family, if you want to run them by me, great. Run them by the group, whatever.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: All right. Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. All right. Well big hug to you and I'll talk to you soon.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Okay thanks so much Josephine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye.</p>

<p>RESPONDENT: Bye-bye. [0:56:02.3]</p>

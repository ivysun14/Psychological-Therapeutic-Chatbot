<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now baby this is the masked fury interview nine. The masked fury with interview nine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm thinking about starting running for exercise. I'm out of breath running down the hall. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the end of that idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It certainly is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's up wrong with the box of Kleenex? [0:01:12.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been smoking I'll get it tomorrow. That's what took me so long. I had to go and buy cigarettes. I had an extreme moment of panic when I didn't have any. How could I come here and not smoke, I would probably go nuts. I had a nasty dream about my old boyfriend. I found it interesting. Where he was a monster chasing me, me and all my very best friends, through lavatories. [0:02:17.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean to you? Anything? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. See I had this dream when I first went to sleep and I woke up immediately after it. It kind of scared me. It made me feel bad. When I woke up this morning I didn't remember any definite thing. But I woke up and my first thought was how bad I felt about things. So I probably won't have any more dreams lately. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it sounds like one thing is that you're left with you're feeling bad about that. Having known that or something. [0:03:03.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I knew that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it just like made it worse. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We were all hiding from him and he caught us and I felt embarrassed that he caught. He was so ugly that he was changing into a monster. I was also very frightened. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Both embarrassed but also just plain scared could be pretty terrible; something scary. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like he was really going to give it to you or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe all my friends too. Because there were people from all over the country. Some people I grew up with. I'd really like to know why I feel so bad about it. I don't know why. Because when I was here on Tuesday, he had just come to my school and I was having a bad, although I had gotten hostile towards him. I told two people about him. And they both said, "Well it was wonderful that you told him off." "You should have done that three years ago." But I didn't feel like that. In fact I wanted to, not necessarily call him up, apologize to him somewhat. I'm not sure why. I don't want to feel that way because I don't think I should but I still feel it and I want it to stop. [0:05:02.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It doesn't make any sense that you should feel bad about him. Like you haven't done anything that you should feel bad or whatever you've done is cancelled out by what he's done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. See I think that I have done things that were wrong. But in my head I'd say well they were cancelled out. I guess I don't feel that way. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you weigh it out on paper, make an equation out of it, you'd come out ahead. But you're aware of what he's hurting; what you've done to him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just it's not right as far as right or wrong; or good or bad. I just feel like I shouldn't feel those things. Whenever I see him, I feel those things. And actually I think I want to be hostile toward him; or completely insulting. I really do. [0:06:18.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you'd like to feel all one way about him and namely angry. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that's alright. I don't know. But if that's what's inside; I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it doesn't in some way that feels like a very bad way to be with him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it was just a headache. I don't know. What do...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's to get here? </p>

<p>CLIENT: My feeling bad. Feeling like everything was my fault with him. [0:07:06.2] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean maybe there's no justification for that. It's just left over from somewhere. An old...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well probably that's the way I feel about a lot of things but I felt like that with him. I can't remember. I've been getting justifiably angry without apologizing to him ever. He always made it seem like it was my fault whatever it was. But that's why I </p>

<p>can't explain the reaction. Plus it probably bothers me even thought it was in the past why I stayed on so long. [0:08:41.5] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though it's over and done with now, it sounds like you look back and it seems to me like you should have gotten out a hell of a long before you did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I knew it at the time too. [0:09:04.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You know it's true. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Maybe I was afraid to. Maybe I thought that there wasn't anything else. Not like I'll never love anybody else. Not like that. Like nobody else would want me. Stuff like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. He was your last best hope. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's probably why I did that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get the image almost like you said you're feeling it or something like you would say goodbye to him and drop off the Earth. [0:10:06.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I'm sure that's the way I felt. I don't know. I wouldn't have known what to do or something. In a strange way I think he would cover a lot of security or something. In a very strange way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why a strange way? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well because he made me insecure. I mean I felt insecure too. Yeah having somebody there is insecurity. I think about all these things when I'm here. Now I'm driving myself really nuts because I'm doubting everything that I say. I really am. [0:11:26.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if I say to you I think that maybe I think that I'm a bad person or I feel that I am. I think how do you know that's true. Do you understand? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. It's like for every statement you make in here there's like a little voice inside saying, "Yeah maybe but not really; maybe not really." [0:12:03.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't even know. The more I think about it the more confused I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Nothing seems just unequivocally true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's correct. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It also sounds like it makes you feel sort of tied up in knots. Like a dog chasing his tail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I think there probably is some truth but I just don't know which or what it is. I keep waiting for some revelation to strike me but nothing has. You know I thought oh well that's really the way it is. That doesn't happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That it doesn't happen? Not good. Like I'm waiting for it to happen to me but it's not. [0:13:11.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're sitting here expecting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think well maybe the more I think about it, the more I try to work things out I'll become clearer. But it hasn't happened. The work gets worse. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there something specific that you had in mind? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No not really. Almost anything that I say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like sort of like floundering in quicksand or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's really ridiculous. It's not even like the many facets to a personality because one person can be different ways in different times. But it's not even that. I don't think it's that. Well maybe that's how I'm looking at it. I'm saying well you're this way this time and this way another time. Are you following me? [0:14:03.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well wait a minute. Wait a minute. No I guess I lost you. It sounds like you're saying, "Well maybe I looking at it; maybe it is like different facets." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I did change. See I don't think. I'm trying to think what kind of angle. Like I could be thinking about any of my old boyfriends. Like if they were all really wonderful why I did certain things. I think well he might know it's because you were very insecure. And then I think well maybe you were just using him too. I'm not sure what's right. Mostly it's related to what I think of myself. I think maybe I basically think that I'm not good or something like that. And then I think no you don't really think that way. I'm lost. I've lost you and I've lost myself. [0:15:58.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess the one point where I don't think I'm lost is like I guess you must be feeling sort of all floundering and frustrated. [0:16:13.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I am. In a way though I don't mind it. Because I think well maybe you're going to reach some conclusion because you're here like this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm feeling like this I'm not going to stay like this. I'm going to reach some conclusion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's the impetus to do something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then again...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it's time. Maybe I'll just feel like this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Floundering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Because maybe there's no truth to reach. I think that sometimes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that mean? What's truth?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The truth is that maybe there is no one or two specific reasons why I was doing these things. Maybe it is just different facets of a personality. [0:17:17.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand exactly. Are you saying something like maybe there is no one or two central reasons but a whole bunch of reasons? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Now that's depressing. I could never figure out a whole bunch of these things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see. One or two then it's easy but ten or 20. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like it feels like there are ten or 20 to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. No I don't know what I feel. Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. I was thinking it would go away too. Now this week I'm away from that. Plus I don't even know what I'm talking about. [0:18:22.6] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of disembodied. It helps. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It is helpful. Different things that I do or different ways that I react, I think maybe it could be something. They don't seem to be as strong unless one of the other parties or the other party is mean. That's the truth. Yeah. I'm more confused about my reactions with men. Although some of the same reactions are true in other areas. [0:19:32.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you may have those reactions in every area but it's like the place where they seem to you to be super strong or distorted or just very vivid are with men. Like that's where you really see the unfortunate side of you; the confused side. [0:20:02.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what this has to do with anything. I have a stepfather. I'm not sure of what my reactions were but when I was real small I used to live with my mother, and my grandmother and grandfather and they were very close; probably closer than most grandparents. Then my mother married my father. I think right after that we moved away then we moved back. Then we moved in with my mother's parents again, all of us. But my favorite person practically in the world was my grandfather. And I know that a lot of the times I just disliked my stepfather and I'm not sure for what reason. If it was because to me my grandfather was my father or just because he didn't want him around. I don't know. [0:21:40.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just because he didn't want him around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't even know if that has anything to do with it. But they were both men in my early life and I know, or at least I think, my grandfather was real important to me. [0:22:04.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A real important positive. It sounds like your stepfather was real important too but kind of negative.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Real ambivalent. I can't even talk about it. I like him ok but I don't want to talk to him very much. I just don't know what to say to him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it like ambivalent? You said like like him or is it more like he's not so bad that you don't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes he does nice things. I suppose he's not so bad. And he's never been bad to me ever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you can't find a good reason for not particularly liking him or having anything to say to him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:23:00.8)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Not to my knowledge. I can vaguely remember things when I was very small. Like him giving me, maybe at the time, maybe I said this before, a lot of attention. And then I have my brother who's three and a half years younger than me. And I was aware through most of my life that my father, I don't know if he really did favor me or not or if he was always just trying to be nicer to me or something. But anyway my brother Danny got the short end of the stick and I resented him for that too. My father... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you resented him for paying more attention to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I felt my brother was getting cheated or something. Plus he wasn't very affectionate at all. Maybe that's the truth. I don't know. I mean physically affectionate. Now I'm real super typical typically affectionate maybe because of that. [0:24:51.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like physically he was very cold. It sounds like you're saying maybe there's sort of like a whole well in you a whole well of needing physical affection because of him. [0:25:09.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like that. That's where in my mind I put the reason for it but I'm not sure it's true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know whether you buy the image or not but like being starved by him and now you having to gorge your system.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Kind of. Yeah. He was always nice. But I don't think he every hugged anybody. And I don't remember my mother either. I'm sure she did it more but not much more. But I think I placed the blame on him for her being that way. I know I did. And I don't want to but I think I did. Because the other people in her family are all much more physical than she is. [0:26:04.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what he did to you and what he did to your mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Plus I don't know what I was aware of when I was that small but I'm sure they never had a verbal argument in front of us. They still don't. But now I'm aware when they're angry. Maybe I was then too. But anyway I never saw it and I'm not sure that's good either. Maybe that's why am like I am about getting angry. I can see myself doing some of the things that my mother did and I really don't like it. [0:27:13.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like not fighting? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can see her if somebody says something that hurts her in some way having the same look on her face that I'm sure that I do. I mean I'm not sure that I do but that's the way that I feel that I look.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I'm hearing is that you take hurt the way she does and you don't like the way she takes hurt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I'm worried because sometimes it makes me cry and I've seen him do it and I don't like that. [0:28:07.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like going weak like that instead of fighting back. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess I do feel that she's weak really. Yeah I can't understand why she married my father. [0:29:12.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure that they she dated other people in her life. I know that but I cannot feel that she's allowed herself to be close to that man. Because everything I ever heard about her before she got married to him was like she was a different person; like a person that I never knew. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she was a person that you would've liked to have known. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She's still alright. But she's weaker. Like if I'm around she won't even call up anybody. She won't make a phone call like to a store or she won't return things. I mean like that. [0:30:19.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like she lavishes all the attention on you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No she makes me do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I'm sorry. I see. I see. Like helpless. Like if you're around like she's then helpless. You've got to do all the chores and the tales and all that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like she buys me something and I don't. No I never thought she was helpless. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the world is too much for her? [0:31:03.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I can't explain it. Like she went out and got a job because she decided she didn't want his money she wanted to her own. They aren't poor so she didn't have to do that. That was several years ago and she's kept it ever since. I don't think that's weak. It was like must not share my 100 percent. It's not going to do with anything. But anyway I don't think she's helpless. My father used to be gone a lot. I used to love it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who used to love it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I did. My mother probably didn't like it as much as I do but I always had a good time with just her and my brother. And I did resent it when he came home. [0:32:04.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like he was an intruder?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Still do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He has no business being there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah I do feel that. I don't know what that has to do with other men and me. But I feel that it might have something and I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the fact of it is I guess just wanting to kick him out, or wish he would fall down a flight of stairs, or just anything to not be around. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I probably wouldn't care if he died except I might feel bad because my mother would care. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's nice to have her to yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think a long time ago, like I told you, I thought I was either illegitimate or she got married a long time after I was conceived. Oh yeah I'm sure I did. Oh maybe I didn't. [0:33:22.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think you did. But anyway...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway oh when we moved to (inaudible at 0:33:35.4). My friends can't believe that I don't know anything about my real father. I don't remember wondering about it a great deal when I was small. I know that when I was in grade school I once asked her why she divorced my father and she told me something that was silly, but I told everyone in school because I thought he would hang around with other women. But I don't remember ever wondering again until lately. Now I feel like it's so late for me to ask her. [0:34:13.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you'd really like to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd like to but I'm afraid too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I think I was illegitimate. I don't think she wants to talk about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you were illegitimate like what that would be awful? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I wouldn't mind now, but she would. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're afraid of hurting her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But on the other hand you'd really like to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I wouldn't ask her that but I'd really like to know. I don't know. I don't know if she was married or not. If she was married it was a long time ago. It was a late marriage kind of thing but I don't think she was. But I don't know what to say to her. [0:35:05.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like the place that sticks you there is like you don't want to make her uncomfortable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how do you find the right euphemisms or how do you ask for the right circumstantial facts from which you can deduce what you want to know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How many men? I don't even know what it is I want to know. I don't know if I care about my real father really. I don't....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I thought one of the things you wanted to know is whether you were illegitimate? [0:35:57.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that's really the thing. But I'm not sure why I want to know that. But I really think that I was and I think when I was younger I felt the effects of that, and I don't know how I did. I think not from my mother's parents except maybe they were too nice to me. Add the way I feel about my father who was too nice me because of that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Does that make sense? Like I was crippled and they were over compensating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like it's almost as if you were ugly and they were acting as if you weren't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They were killing you with kindness. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I really am. I think that's the way that I've always felt. But I don't know if when I was small I felt that the world was ..... I really don't know. Except from my father. I knew that. That the other people I don't know. I know that I was deformed and was made much over. But I don't know if at the time I felt that way. [0:38:00.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like they always kind of lavished attention and praise on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That made you think hey what's wrong with me or maybe not you tell me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it must have. At least I know the reason somewhere along the line. When I was five years old my mother told me. It was when I started to eat like a piggy and got fat. Something must have happened. I don't know what. But I'm sure that was some reaction to something. It never would have been a reaction to my brother being born and the natural jealousy but it was already a year and a half after he was born. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little late for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because that's what she was planning on and I didn't think that was correct. [0:39:01.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what else happened when you were five?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I went to school. I don't remember school being traumatic at all. I'm trying to think of something. I can't think of anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I guess why I was asking wasn't that anything had to happen. It seems like the point was when you were five you started to eat like you were a pig. That's the point. [0:40:03.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Don't people turn to food like people turn to alcohol? Isn't that kind of the same thing? For like lack of love or something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It can be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That would make sense to me if my brother were just born. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then that makes us think it sounds like jealousy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he was older.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's why it doesn't make sense to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I kept it up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Constantly gorging.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. I can remember it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it wasn't so long ago or... [0:41:04.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I mean I can remember being in kindergarten and spending all of my money at the candy store everyday and secretly eating. I can remember being a sneak eater for as long as I can remember; sneaking food. You're stuffing yourself with food. I still do it. It's horrible. It's really awful. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean thinking about yourself still doing it makes you feel bad? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Even when I'm doing it. Now when I'm doing it my mind is a complete blank. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're like possessed or something when you're doing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. I don't do it as much now but I still do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying that it's really a kind of craving that I really have to keep in check. [0:42:03.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. For sure. For sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like being an alcoholic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is the same kind of thing I think. Aren't you supposed to feel good or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Really out of control. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I'd like to know what started it and I don't know. (inaudible at 0:42:41.2) my addiction. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe now it's like a habit. I don't know. I mean a partial habit I'm sure. [0:43:06.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Now I guess you must really feel like unmotivated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most of the time. Some of the times I know that there's motivation. I think I do stuff that will cause this. But that's not what I meant by really what I'm talking about. In fact I caught myself doing that this morning. But I caught myself in time so I didn't do it but I was going to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were sort of on the brink of doing it and you all of a sudden woke up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's something else. That occupies so much of my mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What eating or not eating? Eating. [0:44:03.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like all the things I'm not going to eat. That's it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Usually it's like how big I am. Let's see. I really haven't been on a diet in a long time. When I was pregnant, right after that I lost a lot of weight because I weighed 185. Now I keep my weight within five pounds but it can go up to more than five pounds within a week which isn't right either. (Inaudible at 0:44:59.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well. [0:45:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well about the other day when I was (inaudible at 0:45:05.5) That has probably occupied more of my mind than my boyfriend. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your father? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. I mean I really fantasized about that too. In fact when I lost about 45 pounds, and the way I did it I'm sure it was like I fantasized my way all the way to that body; like I was somebody else. That's the only way that I did it. Well I guess that's alright since it worked. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feel like that giant urge to eat is awfully awfully irresistible; that's the only way you can do it? [0:46:00.3] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes. I'd sure like to find the switch to turn it off too. There's no switch. I don't think there's a switch but I sure would like to find it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wake up one morning and be thin. I mean real sized thin. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It would be neither a compulsive (inaudible at 0:46:46.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not be a fat person who's temporarily thin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There are actually thin people and fat people. I'm just a fat person. All my life I'm going to be a fat person. I'm sure of it. [0:47:00.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's torture. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes it is. I really have to lose ten or fifteen pounds and I just can't do it. For two years I've had to lose ten or fifteen pounds and I just haven't been able to do it. I'm afraid to do it I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. I'm not sure what the reason is. I think I'm (inaudible at 0:47:47.8) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pardon me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said I think I'm unattractive. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It means why should I sit and think about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I don't remember? [0:48:01.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't remember? I remember talking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember talking about it too but I don't remember you being afraid to lose... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. I thought I did. I'll talk about it later. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All self.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll talk about it later. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I had the feeling like you did want to talk about </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel it will bore you. I'm boring myself talking about weight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems to me that's all that I think about. I know I've talk to death about how I am in a crowd of people. That's always on my mind. I mean it's just horrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I guess that makes sense what you were saying earlier. That's the one thing that's more on your mind than your boyfriend. It sounds like that is really just what you've been saying. That is you're major preoccupation. [0:49:16.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your first thought is I don't know what it is. It's what am I going to eat or what all I'm going to eat or what do I look like. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's all of those. Almost every morning I wake up I'm not going to eat to get thin and everyday I eat. It's on my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a constant battle that you lose over and over again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And a on thin person's mind whether or not the thin person's overweight; it doesn't matter. That's not on their mind all the time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not...</p>

<p>CLIENT: On their mind all the time. And when I was binging it all that weight it wasn't on my mind. I don't know what I feel. I didn't even think about it. I really do think at least the way that I think. But I had to pretend I was somebody else. I had to pretend that I was my grandfather doing something. Because I couldn't eat I guess. [0:50:32.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where are you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still thinking about being fat. Actually I think if I wanted to do anything that I could feel that it's important to me. I pretend that I should... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that like you are incapable of being... [0:52:10.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It must be. I'm not aware of it at the time. I have to fantasize during sex. The problem is not to fantasize. I don't know if I fantasize that I'm somebody else. I don't fantasize lewd things. I know that I'm thinking I'm somebody else. I don't know who I think I am. I just do all those things. [0:53:03.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean by that. I don't know... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I really can do all these things but I guess I think that I can't. Does that make sense? I don't know that I couldn't very well do it. Just about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:53:41.0) I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's hard for me to get my teeth into that. The only thing that I'm sure of is something like it must be like not being there. [0:54:18.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean like sex or eating or the diet; like it's not happening to you. You're not there for that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know where I am. You mean the success in that'd </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean anything important. But I guess like the last thing you said was making love and I guess that's what I had uppermost in mind; like not being there. [0:55:00.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. No I don't think that's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound like that doesn't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not quite right. I don't know what to say is right. It's like if I just let myself do something. I need something I can do. I don't know what that is. [0:56:14.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you're the only person you rely on then what can get done? Actually you have to rely on somebody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or it's even me but I'm different than I really am. That's my fear more than being somebody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Good. Like a different you. Well I guess in some way might as well be somebody else. [0:57:01.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I don't feel I'm like that whatever way that person has to be at the time; efficient or whatever. That's even true in work. If I have to do something, not so much with teaching, but with other kind of work doing something that has to get done. It's like I'm a stereotype efficient person. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's how it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you don't have your own feelings that you're the efficient person. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More like a role or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's what it is; a role. My old boyfriend used to complain whenever I'd read a book that I liked. We talked about this before over two weeks. That's not really important but it's related I suppose. [0:58:08.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's related in the sense of like you not being you but whoever you've been with last, that's who you are. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Sort of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like, I don't know whether I'm just taking off on a flight of fancy but, it sounds like you feel you don't have any core; any solid center or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. Yeah that's true. Sometimes I think oh yes you do and that's like the controversy I was talking about at the beginning I think in a way. Some ways I just think I'm so malleable I'll almost do anything. And sometimes I don't. [0:59:19.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah maybe it's like the controversy like in the beginning. It's like oh it's true and none of it's true. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're going to stop. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have to come next Friday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Next Friday? [1:00:02.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know. I guess it is but we usually see each other just on Thursday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes I know but we're saying this is a bad month for Thursday's so that's all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh no with the Thursday's, this last Thursday and the other Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it doesn't matter anyway. Do you not want to come next Thursday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh yeah. I just didn't want to come on Friday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're going away?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My fantasy of what it's like going away on Memorial Day and July 4th and it's always like millions of people and all that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure you're right. I've never done that. We're going camping which will probably be horrible. [1:01:00.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You and 10,000 other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Unless it's cold; then we'll be the only ones. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll wager a lesser life than he does. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Thank you. Have a nice weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good bye. [1:01:46.2]</p>

<center><p><b>Transcript</b></p></center>

<p>Ivey 1: Robin, thanks so much for being here today. I really admire what you've gone through. You say I'm the eleventh person you've seen. I think that's really impressive. As I was telling a little beforehand, I kind of like to set a little context. I am interested in the idea that the individual develops, grows up in a family, in a cultural context, and so it's really kind of you and how you tie in with what's around you, but then that's kind of my thing, and there are a couple of things as we begin here. One of these is context. Here I am a man, you're a woman. There are issues of gender here, and I was wondering if anything occurs to you just as we start around issues of gender, if it does, uh . . .</p>

<p>Robin 1: Gender, no. Well, sometimes I think, it depends. Some of the issues that I come in contact with gender can play an importance, but now, no.</p>

<p>Ivey 2: Okay, so, if it's an issue, let's think about it. The other thing here is for me sometimes it's useful just to write down a few key words or notes. Will that bother you?</p>

<p>Robin 2: Nope. Not at all.</p>

<p>Ivey 3: If it does just speak up and I can just put them down.</p>

<p>Robin 3: No, that's fine.</p>

<p>Ivey 4: And I also feel that you've done more of these tapes than I have of course, but I think there's a general thing I feel if anything that you don't want on the tapes, I mean as far as I'm concerned, I feel you own this material, and I think it's very important, very, very important. Do you have any questions or comments as you start?</p>

<p>Robin 4: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>Ivey 5: I'd like to know, sort of a background, what would you like to have happen today?</p>

<p>Robin 5: Well, knowing a little bit of what, I guess it would be nice to know that, and I know it for a fact, but try and see it more as a visual type thing, because of who I come from, that makes me who I am, and that there are some things I can or cannot change because of the influence of different things. That's important, I think for me to . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 6: So how the past affects the present is one of the things.</p>

<p>Robin 6: Right, right.</p>

<p>Ivey 7: And you'd kind of like to explore that a little bit today?</p>

<p>Robin 7: Yes.</p>

<p>Ivey 8: Is there any specific objective or goals you might have?</p>

<p>Robin 8: No. I don't think so. Just open . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 9: Okay. Sounds good. What I'd like to do as we start is, we have just been, I said individual, family, culture, and you were saying as we chatted just briefly about two or three minutes before we started that your mother is from Mississippi, your dad from Tennessee, you've been recently getting very much into genealogy and learning about your family history, an issue of South and North, and I was wondering if you could share a little bit more about that.</p>

<p>Robin 9:  Well, it's, I've never, ever considered myself like a Southerner. I've always considered myself a Northerner because I was born and raised in Illinois, and it's like most of my family commuted from the South up here. Some have commuted back. Some still remain in the North, distant relatives of my mom and father, and there is a tie there but not a tie that I would want to go back so to speak, but . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 10: So the South is important, you have the tie and so forth. You also said that you and your mother had been going around to grave sites looking into family history eight generations back. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Robin 10: Yeah, on my dad's side we had checked eight generations.</p>

<p>Ivey 11: Oh, your dad's side back eight generations. How far back on your mother's side?</p>

<p>Robin 11: I think my mom has it back to like four or five. Not counting my generation but like my fourth or fifth great grandfather.</p>

<p>Ivey 12: So, one of the things that I think is really important in terms of developing our own story, our own narrative, is family stories, and I was wondering if there is a particular family story from either side that stands out for you.</p>

<p>Robin 12: Well, one of the, I guess it was a tradition that got established when we were young children. I complained about it as an older child, but every Easter was always like "the family reunion" and we would travel to Tennessee always for Easter Sunday. We'd all go to church, and we had the big Easter hunt, and I had well, I have a younger brother that's 16, and he's like the 43rd grandchild, so you know there were a lot of grandchildren. By that time there must have been almost 30 great grandchildren, and it would just be a great big family time at my grandfather's house. So those were always good memories. Even as a young child when there weren't so many, and then older when we were able go back more as an adult and there were even younger children.</p>

<p>Ivey 13: Wow, that's a really important time for you. One thing that I find that is really helpful as we start exploring these issues is focusing on positive resources, and it sounds like that situation with your family there in Tennessee is a real positive one, and what I'd like you to do is get a little more specific. Can you 
recall a specific time when you were there at a certain age. I am looking for a particularly positive memory strength.</p>

<p>Robin 13: Well, I wouldn't say that this, it's a memory that I will always keep. My grandmother died when I was 4, but the last time I went down there she had Parkinson's disease, and well she gave birth to sixteen kids. To me that's a miracle in itself, but one of the last times we went down she had, it was her birthday we were going for, and having that many grandchildren, you didn't, as a grandchild, you didn't get . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 14: Didn't get a lot of attention.</p>

<p>Robin 14: Right, right, right. Like my son gets a lot of attention from my parents now. There wasn't that a lot, but we got her little ankle weights for her to go like this, and I was so proud because it was my gift to my grandmother, and it was something, that's the only memory except for the funeral that I am able to retain about my grandmother was her birthday and how she just loved those weights because she was going to work. I mean it's something very, very silly, but it was something that's the only memory I have of her alive.</p>

<p>Ivey 15: That's a wonderful story of you giving to your grandmother and that your grandmother was very special to you, too. What I'd like to do, and sometimes results are a little surprising, if you could get a, go back to when you were 4, and close your eyes if you feel like it, I would like to get a visual memory of you as a child, Robin, giving that to your grandmother, and her getting it. Can you see that in your mind? What are you seeing?</p>

<p>Robin 15: Well, it was dark. It was night time, and the house was still lit by kerosene lamps, and she always sat in the one chair that looked out into the picture window, and I would sit, I was sitting right next to her on the floor, and I guess the thing that I remember, it was just us. There weren't a lot of other . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 16: Finally, you got alone with her.</p>

<p>Robin 16: I had some time just the two of us.</p>

<p>Ivey 17: Okay, what are you hearing in that scene?</p>

<p>Robin 17: I think it was raining.</p>

<p>Ivey 18: It was raining?</p>

<p>Robin 18: Mhm. Because I remember it was dark. It was dark in the house. There was music. She always listened to old time gospel music.</p>

<p>Ivey 19: Oh really.</p>

<p>Robin 19: Quartets too. I probably liked them then and I somewhat appreciate them now, but it's not necessarily my cup of tea music. Southern gospel quartets.</p>

<p>Ivey 20:  Southern gospel quartets, dark, rain, you're with your grandmother. What is she saying? Or is it more being with her?</p>

<p>Robin 20: Well, I do remember her saying thank you and that she would use them and that she needed them, and she always used to say, Jackie raised such good girls. That was my dad's name.</p>

<p>Ivey 21: Jack or Jackie?</p>

<p>Robin 21: Well, legally it's Jackie. He doesn't like to be called that, you know. But he was the like third to the last born, so my grandma was running out of names.</p>

<p>Ivey 22:  Jackie raised good kids. As you are seeing that, you know, we have the rain, one of those rare times with all of those wonderful grandchildren that you were alone with her and had the joy of giving her this gift and you see her there. What are you feeling? Can you kind of get into your feelings and can you . . .</p>

<p>Robin 22: Um, there was security. There was a lot of love. I don't know how to express, in other words, I was special to her even though she had tons. I made an impact at that particular time.</p>

<p>Ivey 23: You made an impact.</p>

<p>Robin 23: Yeah.</p>

<p>Ivey 24: As we say that thing of, just allow yourself to say security, love, special. I made an impact. How does that feel inside your body?</p>

<p>Robin 24: It makes me feel good.</p>

<p>Ivey 25: You feel good. Can you locate that good feeling in your body, physically?</p>

<p>Robin 25: Well, sometimes I get that tingling sensation.</p>

<p>Ivey 26:  That tingling sensation. And where is that? I saw your hands move.</p>

<p>Robin 26: Um, well you know, it's sort of like it comes from the heart.</p>

<p>Ivey 27: Comes from the heart.</p>

<p>Robin 27: Can well up into the face.</p>

<p>Ivey 28: Well up into the face.</p>

<p>Robin 28: And like teary eyed. It causes me to crack a smile, you know, when I think back.</p>

<p>Ivey 29: Comes from the heart, goes up and you get a little teary eyed and yet it comes from the heart and you can smile. All kinds of warm, fuzzy emotions come with that. That's really a wonderful, wonderful base. Could you just allow yourself just for a moment to experience that in your own way either with your eyes open or closed. Just experience that.</p>

<p>Robin 29: It's one of those things that you don't ever like to dwell on those things. I shouldn't say you don't dwell on those things, but you don't think back to those things a lot.</p>

<p>Ivey 30: No.</p>

<p>Robin 30: Because the busyness of life just keeps rolling on and on. Those are, it's a, I don't want to say a dumb memory, but it's a memory that's only important to me, nobody else. And it may sound stupid, it may sound strange, but it's just that connection.</p>

<p>Ivey 31: That connection. I'm sorry, it doesn't sound dumb to me. I feel, I can almost feel myself just a little teary eyed thinking about that connection, and the thing, I think we need to draw on those wonderful connections we have, because we do get into a lot of moments where it isn't quite so wonderful, and . . .</p>

<p>Robin 31: To me it was like the world stopped still.</p>

<p>Ivey 32: The world stopped still.</p>

<p>Robin 32: And it's sort of like I guess, it's sort of like, I guess if I had to look at my life in picture frames, that was a picture that will never be erased and will always stay vivid.</p>

<p>Ivey 33: Always, the eyes, the heart and so forth, that's always there. And there were some words that were said that I think I like is that, I can make an impact. Can you say that for me?</p>

<p>Robin 33: I can make an impact.</p>

<p>Ivey 34: Can you say it again?</p>

<p>Robin 34: I can make an impact.</p>

<p>Ivey 35: Pretty neat. That's a wonderful gift from your family. I love the story. Now why would I go through all of this? Why would you imagine I would ask you to go through all of this?</p>

<p>Robin 35: Because whatever that picture made it had to have had some positive influence that you know, maybe I made an impact there maybe I can do the same thing for somebody else. I can be that grandma, I can be that mother to somebody else, and give that same, that same comfort, that same type of feeling.</p>

<p>Ivey 36: I wouldn't call that a dumb memory, would you?</p>

<p>Robin 36: No, I guess not, but I guess the thing is the whole story around it, the memory is not dumb, but just the thing that made the importance, but yeah.</p>

<p>Ivey 37: And yet it's moments like that I think that can be so special and in moments of strife and conflict, Robin can make an impact. Robin can make a difference.</p>

<p>Robin 37: Sure.</p>

<p>Ivey 38: And you can draw on your grandmother. I also liked Jackie raised good kids. They are wonderful stories.</p>

<p>Robin 38: Oh yeah. My grandma always said that.</p>

<p>Ivey 39: And I get that positive feeling. If we had more time I would look for more family stories and more strengths, and what we would find is that there is a memory in the heart. There is probably an image of strength in your arms for example. Just offhand, does something cross your mind from your family?</p>

<p>Robin 39: Probably my grandfather.</p>

<p>Ivey 40: Your grandfather.</p>

<p>Robin 40:  He always worked with his hands in the garden. And I used to work with him a lot.</p>

<p>Ivey 41: And we could develop that in the same way and Milton Erickson had a saying once that my voice shall go with you. Well, I think the voice that goes with you are these wonderful strong voices from the past, and I think that these strong voices can so much help us to deal with difficulties as we move along. So we've looked just a little bit at your family there and the South, and the cultural frame. You mentioned that your dad, early on you mentioned, because before we started your dad had an Irish background and your mother you said had some Cherokee and some Scottish, and I was wondering in terms of cultural ethnic issues, what crosses your mind when you think about this particular part, Irish/American and Scotch/American.</p>

<p>Robin 41: It doesn't bother me at all. I don't even, I guess as a kid we used to watch all the time Schoolhouse Rock, and it did a thing about that America is the melting pot. I find it interesting, but at this particular time, I mean, who knows, down the road I never say never anymore, but I don't feel an importance to that. Because I look at myself I'm an American. Regardless of who came over when. My family has lived here long enough to know, you know, like if I was born in another country, then I would feel the loyalty to that rather than to here. But I don't find a difference.</p>

<p>Ivey 42: One thing I hear is that you see yourself as a melting pot and I am an American, and you really talked a bit about going back, and you talked about going back four or five generations with your mother, and eight generations with your dad, and this whole connection with the South, and so you have developed a lot of pride in just being an American in a sense. And I was wondering, let's hang in with that there and sort of say because we can identify as an average American. We also can identify as a melting pot American. By the way they aren't either or. You can have your cake and eat it too. But I'm kind of looking for either in the Irish/American, the Cherokee/American, and Scottish/American, or I am an 
American, a positive type of thing that hits, that strengthens you as an individual from your cultural frame.</p>

<p>Robin 42: I guess not so much the family but going back to like the Revolutionary period and you know that I spent a lot of time in high school, it seemed like U.S. History, studying that particular time frame, and the people that wrote the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and what brilliant men they really 
were. One thing I have always admired, and I know times change, and different things are going, but they were all, it all had to stem from religious persecution. And the freedoms that we have here, I guess we owe them a lot. I owe them a lot for the things that they made. Because I may not be the person that I am today had it not been for the things that they did.</p>

<p>Ivey 43: And you are really, it's your family but your family in the context of the U.S. American. So what they did sort of makes it possible for you to be where you are. What types of feelings well up in you when you look back to history and where you are?</p>

<p>Robin 43: Um, I guess the freedom issue, and I guess because I see so much going onin the world and well, my father is a Baptist minister. That has a lot to do with it.</p>

<p>Ivey 44: I know that well.</p>

<p>Robin 44: He is, you know, so I have a real strong spiritual tie that I know of lots of countries where that's not possible, you know, they are not able to read the Bible whether they want to or whether they don't want to. I mean, it's just not available to them where when they came over, that's why they came over because they weren't able to practice the religion that they wanted to practice. They were intelligent enough and they covered all the bases. Freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion, you go on and on. I mean, they just covered it all.</p>

<p>Ivey 45: So this stuff has really become very important part of who you are and it sounds like kind of related to I can make an impact as well. So, I'm a Baptist too, so I kind of know some of the things you are talking about, and here's one of the things the Baptists are good about is being an individual.</p>

<p>Robin 45: Oh yeah. They believe in the autonomy of the local church.</p>

<p>Ivey 46: They believe in the autonomy of the local church and the autonomy of the individual. But I'd like to follow up a little bit on the spiritual side which you said is important, and I'd like to ask you for a spiritual image. You have a family image. Can I ask you for a spiritual image that you might draw on from your spiritual tradition which is important.</p>

<p>Robin 46: Well, I believe that I have a personal relationship with Christ. I believe that he guides me when I ask him to. I have a security of knowing where I am going if I were to die. And there is a song, "Where Is The Hope," well I have hope. My hope is in Jesus Christ, and I don't have to worry about, sometimes I shouldn't have to worry about tomorrow because I need to worry about today, but I sometimes, the 
human part of me takes over, and I worry about tomorrow. But I don't have to worry about that. I know that in scripture, I am assured. I have assurance, you know.</p>

<p>Ivey 47: Blessed assurance.</p>

<p>Robin 47: Jesus is mine. Yes.</p>

<p>Ivey 48: So, do you have a specific image. We did one around your connection with the church with spirituality, where you get some of that blessed assurance.</p>

<p>Robin 48: Um . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 49: Or, something else.</p>

<p>Robin 49: Well, this is the example that I see, where the scripture says take up your cross, and the words there are going to be struggles along the way. Well, the one thing that I will always remember, my father was a bi-vocational man, and the first church he pastored was 75 miles away, and we would leave on Friday nights and come home on Sunday nights, and we would live in a parsonage, and we would live out of a suitcase, and we did that for eleven years. And the sacrifice that my dad made because he felt the calling to do what God wanted him to do, that made an impact. You know.</p>

<p>Ivey 50: That made an impact. Okay. Do you have a visual image of those times, a positive one?</p>

<p>Robin 50: They were hilarious. I guess some of my favorite times were loading and unloading the car.</p>

<p>Ivey 51: Well, that's a good story.</p>

<p>Robin 51: Well, it's funny because a lot of ministers have libraries where they keep their books and their Bibles and their commentaries. Well, my father always had a cardboard box because it would have to be carried in and carried out, and he would always pack it and sometimes he might forget a book or this and that. Well, we were 75 miles away. He wasn't going to go back and get it, you know. We would always have to take groceries there. Things like that, and it would be like when we got there we would go and unpack and we thought oh, we forgot that, or we forgot this, but his cardboard box was how he carried a lot of his books that he would prepare sermons and stuff with. It was the cardboard box.</p>

<p>Ivey 52: Well, let's just for the fun of it go with the cardboard box and get an image of that box at the time and go through the same things - seeing, hearing, and feeling.</p>

<p>Robin 52: It was always the last thing to go into the truck. Especially on Sunday nights, and I guess it was always the winter night. The box was well worn. It was wintertime, and he went to put it in the trunk, and it fell apart just as he was putting it in. You know, there he is. He was in his trench coat, and he had on his 
boots, and he had his hat on and things like that because it was a very small community, very rural, and we had to get out of there because there was a snow storm coming, but there we were picking up papers. It was probably like 8:00, 9:00, 10:00 at night on a Sunday night picking up stuff to get it in the box to put it 
back in. He got a box the next week. But . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 53: And yet you are smiling and that's a special memory which a lot of people would remember differently.</p>

<p>Robin 53: They remember different things, but if I had to pick something spiritual, that was my father at that particular time in his life.</p>

<p>Ivey 54: And as you are seeing that, what kind of feeling comes to you, can you get yourself maybe close your eyes or open, can you get any feeling with that in your body?</p>

<p>Robin 54: I don't know. I guess it's not so much, I wouldn't compare it to the same type where you know you swell up, it's more of a chuckle, more of a laugh. I mean it's important, but yet it was something my dad always did. You always knew he was going to do it. Always dependable on that. It was like rock solid.</p>

<p>Ivey 55: Rock solid.</p>

<p>Robin 55: But, there were times my dad could lose his temper, yes, but he didn't, when it came to that stuff he never lost his temper. There was humor there. It was sort of like he was at the point, oh well, what else can go wrong, but you know, we picked up the pieces. Oh well, what else can go wrong.</p>

<p>Ivey 56: Yeah. Now, I saw you make that movement. Oh well.</p>

<p>Robin 56: It would like come from the shoulders like a release.</p>

<p>Ivey 57: A release. Oh well, what else can go wrong.</p>

<p>Robin 57: But then it's sort of like picking up the pieces and you have to laugh a little. You got to have a little humor.</p>

<p>Ivey 58:  We have some wonderful, powerful stories don't we? I can make an impact. From the heart. A rock solid dad that can make you chuckle. Oh well, what else can go wrong. What a wonderful foundation.</p>

<p>Robin 58: Yeah.</p>

<p>Ivey 59: So how do these stories play themselves out now for you?</p>

<p>Robin 59: Um, well my dad is still probably my rock. My dad and my mom. I don't want to say I don't have a good relationship with my dad, but after I had my son, I have a wonderful relationship with my mother. For some reason mothers and daughters can have that friction there a little bit, especially during adolescence, and my mom and I were, but, now that I have my son, my mom and I, she's like my best friend, but my relationship with my dad hasn't changed any where my mother's has. But my dad's always been there to defend me and do whatever I need and, you know.</p>

<p>Ivey 60: So there is a really wonderful type of support you have.</p>

<p>Robin 60: I have real good support there, real good.</p>

<p>Ivey 61: So, we began by saying you were interested in how the past affects the present, and I just was wondering what stands out for you so far?
 
Robin 61: Well, it's one of those things, I have, there was a distance between my grandparents on my dad's side. But my dad put such a value on family and the importance of family that I felt just as close to my grandfather that lived in the South as I did to my grandfather that lived like two miles away. And plus it was probably a better relationship, so there is a tie there. In other words, I think I have the ability with a family member whether they lived next door or if I only talked to them once a week or once a year, I can still know that there's that tie.</p>

<p>Ivey 62: So you have the connection, that tie. And if things don't go perfectly . . .</p>

<p>Robin 62: Right, it's like, oh well.</p>

<p>Ivey 63: That's the way it goes.</p>

<p>Robin 63: Sometimes I need that more often than not.</p>

<p>Ivey 64:  So those are wonderful solid strengths. So, you've done, how does this, and your story, what is your story drawing on this family? Who are you, Robin, and how does all of this fit with who you are and where you are going?</p>

<p>Robin 64:  Well, um, that's hard to say. I guess that's a thing, I mean there's a little bit, and there are quite a few negative things that come from my mom's side of the family. Like I mean the skeletons in the closet, and sometimes I feel that conflict of some of the things like if I react the wrong way or am I acting the way say my grandfather did on my mom's side who had the horrible temper. Am I getting that from him? Am I acting just like he did, and why am I not pulling more from the way my father is or the way my grandmother was.</p>

<p>Ivey 65: When I saw you reach there, I saw your jaw kind of pull from that rock. Your jaw just for the moment kind of set in. It's not always easy to pull from the rock. Would you care to share a time when it hasn't gone as well as you might like, you kind of forgotten to draw on the connections in the rock either now or in the past?</p>

<p>Robin 65: Well, a prime example would be that I spent one whole session talking about my mother-in-law, but that would probably be a place where it did not go well. Three months after I was married, I'm in marriage counseling not knowing what to do because I can't get along with my mother and my husband is not going to tell her she has to fall in, and I acted probably a lot like how my grandfather would have reacted.</p>

<p>Ivey 66: I see.</p>

<p>Robin 66: Instead of trying to kill her with kindness, I was like you are going to do it my way or else. I'm married to your son now, that type of thing. There is still a little tension between the two of us, but it's much better than it was.</p>

<p>Ivey 67: What made it better, and what goes on when things are going better?</p>

<p>Robin 67: I give up.</p>

<p>Ivey 68: You give up.</p>

<p>Robin 68: In other words, I don't have to have my way all the time.</p>

<p>Ivey 69: You don't have to, there are different ways to say that I give up is one thing. I don't have to have my way all the time is another one. One is kind of like there it is, and another one is . . .</p>

<p>Robin 69: It sort of like, one time, I don't know if you are familiar with Dr. Dobson, in raising children it says choose your battles. You know, what's important and what isn't. If it's not really important, why make it an issue. You know. For example, my mother-in-law would, when I was going back to school. I was married at the time and I had to study a lot, and she would take, she would go with Ed out shopping, and they'd spend the day together or whatever. Well, instead of, there were times she should have asked me, but she was trying to be thoughtful. I could have said this that and everything, but basically what it came down to is what is it hurting. He's having fun. He is able to leave. I am able to study. Just because I'm not with him doesn't mean, you know . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 70: So there . . .</p>

<p>Robin 70: There was more of a power struggle.</p>

<p>Ivey 71: Rather than going to a power struggle, you found it worked better just saying . . .</p>

<p>Robin 71: What's important and what's not.</p>

<p>Ivey 72: What's important and what's not. More like letting the box fall out there in the snow with your dad.</p>

<p>Robin 72: Right.</p>

<p>Ivey 73:  So how are you able to do that pretty much now, or how is that going for you? You sound like you've got the philosophy pretty well.</p>

<p>Robin 73: I've got the philosophy down. It usually comes down to the moment. Hindsight is 20/20, but I can half way through start to see and then I'll say, oh well, that's it. I've had it. We're not going to fight anymore, or I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said what I did. I just need some time to cool off. You know, 
depending on whatever the subject might be or whoever it is. Nine times out of ten if it's somebody besides my husband, I will apologize and say you know, just let me think about it for a while.</p>

<p>Ivey 74: So you really have found a really good way to deal with these type of situations with your mother-in-law or other difficulties, and I can see how they relate back to your desire for connections with like you said your grandmother and letting it go. And you can catch yourself you say in midstream.</p>

<p>Robin 74: If I could catch it beforehand it would be easier.</p>

<p>Ivey 75: If you catch it beforehand. Let's take a look at that. If I could catch it beforehand it would be easier. What are you saying about that particular phrase. What are you saying about yourself there, Robin?</p>

<p>Robin 75: Well, probably that I'm human. You know, I can make the mistakes like anybody else can, and I have met some people that are very slow to speak, and they think everything through before they say it, and there's good to that but then, you know.</p>

<p>Ivey 76: So the price of perfection might be losing perfection, is that right?</p>

<p>Robin 76: Yeah, that's right. I guess as long as I am honest and you know, that's how I feel. As long as I'm honest and you know, catch myself and correct the situation. Now if I left the situation I would be wrong. But . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 77: You sound pretty good about yourself in handling some of these stressful situations. That's neat. So do you have any other concerns. I get the feeling that you are really cruising along using some of the stuff from your family history and cultural background pretty effectively.</p>

<p>Robin 77: Well, you know, you talked a little bit about community. I sort of feel, and I'm living in a community now that I've been in for four years. I don't feel a tie there. I don't feel, even to the church I feel a little bit distant. Not so much like an outsider, but somewhat like an outsider, and it has a tendency to not cause friction, but every once in a while get an air about well maybe I shouldn't have said that or 
maybe I shouldn't have done that. I'm not part of that. And part of it, the community as a whole where I live is definitely what they call closed. There are people that have lived there fifteen, twenty years and are still considered outsiders, you know. So, I wonder sometimes how much influence being in that community 
the last four years has made in my life, if it was good or bad. Is it opening me up or is it . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 78: So, you kind of like the connections with the family, with your own kids, etc., the community doesn't feel as comfortable.</p>

<p>Robin 78: Well, we moved from the community that I grew up in and where my husband grew up most of his life, and because we wanted maybe a like a smaller town, a little bit better schools, and we did that. You know, we made the adjustment, and we started our family, but maybe it's my parents that are pulling me back, or maybe it's the familiarity of the community where I grew up at, but I just don't feel that tie to the community.</p>

<p>Ivey 79: And coming down to not an awful lot of time left, but I guess I'd still like to hear a story, brief story at least about the community you left where you really felt good and being in the community and the connections and so forth.</p>

<p>Robin 79: Well, it's one of those I guess I couldn't think of a specific story, but like I could go into town and see an old school teacher, they would recognize me, know who I was, you know, ask, there was that familiarity that you just can't get again.</p>

<p>Ivey 80: So basically, every time you go downtown you see somebody. I can kind of identify with that because my town has grown, and now I go down and a lot of times I don't see anybody I know, so there is a difference, so that was one of the things that represented there that you just knew a lot of people.</p>

<p>Robin 80: We knew a lot of people. Familiar with streets, locations, businesses, things like that. That makes a big difference. I mean I've been gone four years. You would think it would lessen a little bit, but it doesn't.</p>

<p>Ivey 81:  Always get more, huh? But the schools are better where you are.</p>

<p>Robin 81: Yes.</p>

<p>Ivey 82: Are you thinking you are going to hang in where your are?</p>

<p>Robin 82: Probably more than likely. Unless the job situation changes for my husband, but I don't see that happening.</p>

<p>Ivey 83: So given some of your many, many strengths, what occurs to you that you might be able to do that you have this ability to let things go, stop in mid-sentence, wisely you don't try to plan it all. You've got wonderful connections to family.</p>

<p>Robin 83: I do. I see a big change happening once my son reaches preschool age or like kindergarten school age, and then there will be more when I can get involved in a PTO or I can get involved in community things and not so much that I'd get on the ins and know everybody because that's not necessary, but I can make an impact there.</p>

<p>Ivey 84: So one of the issues is when you get enough time to do this and right now your children are how old again?</p>

<p>Robin 84: I have a boy that's two.</p>

<p>Ivey 85: Two. Well, that keeps you busy.</p>

<p>Robin 85: Yes, he keeps me busy, so . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 86: What's his name?</p>

<p>Robin 86: Cameron.</p>

<p>Ivey 87: Cameron. So Cameron keeps you going.</p>

<p>Robin 87: Yes.</p>

<p>Ivey 88: And so you've basically entered the town and then you were pregnant for a year and then you have the baby, so you've kind of gone through four years of some disequilibrium.</p>

<p>Robin 88: Sure.</p>

<p>Ivey 89: Now, I kind of heard in what you are saying and your plans ahead, but I wonder if you'd just review where you've been in this session. If there is any particular word that you have used that might be useful for you. I've got it written down here, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. By the way these notes you can have when I'm done with them.</p>

<p>Robin 89: Of one of the words I said probably would be my rock.</p>

<p>Ivey 90: Your rock. Rock solid. So you can be his rock. The one I heard, I think that's a good one too. I can be like a rock. I also heard I can make an impact.</p>

<p>Robin 90: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Ivey 91: What about that?</p>

<p>Robin 91: Um, sometimes I don't like, to me that's almost being boastful. It can be a good quality, but it can sometimes be used as a bad quality.</p>

<p>Ivey 92: Did you hear this child giving this to grandmother with the rain?</p>

<p>Robin 92: It was done with pureness of heart.</p>

<p>Ivey 93: Pureness of heart.</p>

<p>Robin 93: Not wanting anything in return. And that's where, that to me, if I want to make an impact, I can't make an impact because I want this to be accomplished or that to be accomplished. I have to do it because I really believe that that's what I should be doing.</p>

<p>Ivey 94: And you can be doing.</p>

<p>Robin 94: Mhm.</p>

<p>Ivey 95: So taking that particular philosophy, what does that say about you and this community which is a little tougher for you as you get into it?</p>

<p>Robin 95: If I go in with an open mind, if I go in not wanting to change something but contribute something, I can make a difference.</p>

<p>Ivey 96: I know I found myself sometimes in somewhat perilous situations. If I think less of what I am getting and more what I am giving, somehow I end up feeling a little more comfortable, and that's what I kind of heard from you early on. I kind of hear you telling yourself.</p>

<p>Robin 96: Yes. It's important.</p>

<p>Ivey 97:  So, now we are indeed running out of time, and I was wondering, Robin, if you could give me a little feedback about our talk together and what sense you make of it.</p>

<p>Robin 97: I guess primarily that I do need to look at some of those pictures and that would be something good. I could take different people in my family, what strength did they give me, what weakness did they give me. And sort of know what my limits are, what my abilities are, and draw from those rather than, or learn from my weaknesses.</p>

<p>Ivey 98: I just totally love the idea of the papers all over the place and getting a chuckle out of that. I love the smile. That's wow, what a source, and what a resource for making an impact, but impacts don't come along . . .</p>

<p>Robin 98: Well, sometimes I wonder when my son spills the milk on the floor for the 
third time, you know, okay.</p>

<p>Ivey 99: I'm making no impact here. I better let it go. There is a challenge there all the time. So the idea that hanging in, making an impact, drawing on those strengths, and being aware that I guess maybe even taking joy in some of your imperfections.</p>

<p>Robin 99: Yeah. In other words, don't beat myself up because of the way I am.</p>

<p>Ivey 100: My Baptist images are very different from yours, and I say hey I like that idea of the chuckle. My church . . .</p>

<p>Robin 100: A little more rigid. Well, you know . . .</p>

<p>Ivey 101: That's neat. So I want to say thank you so much. Anything you'd like to say in conclusion.</p>

<p>Robin 101: No, but I really enjoyed, there have been different approaches here, there and everywhere, but I do, and no one has, I've never seen it done, but there is an impact to be made by who you are from where you came, you know.</p>

<p>Ivey 102: We grow on the shoulders of giants, and those giants are often right there in our own family.</p>

<p>Robin 102: And sometimes we put certain family members up on such a high pedestal and they were just as human as we were.</p>

<p>Ivey 103: Thanks so much.</p>

<p>Robin 103: Thank you.</p>


<center><p><b>Treatment Plan for Robin</b></p></center>

<p>In future sessions, Ivey would continue to help Robin develop a solid base of her strengths. He would help her define her positive assets and what she is doing right in her life. Together with Robin, he would further explore her problems for the body level, story level, reflective level, and from the self-development level. One of the areas he might focus on is her lack of connections with the church in her community and what that means to her.</p>

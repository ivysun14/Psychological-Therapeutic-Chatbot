<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll look through that and write up the bill, maybe over the weekend. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Two upcoming billing changes: one is it looks like my billing service is going to be doing this thing where you can kind of create your own log-in and look at your appointments and balance and just pay online.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be awesome. That would be great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Awesome for me. (both laugh) No paperwork bills. The other thing is I'm getting off of Blue Cross at the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you told me that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually that's strange. It's strange that your current plan . . . often plans that have a deductible don't apply it when the provider is in network, but I guess that's not true for your plan. Anyways, that really won't mean much difference for you. I guess Blue Cross may send you checks and I may bill you instead of sending them to me after January 1st. Otherwise it should be the same as it is now. [00:01:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Dr. Vaughn's not on Blue Cross, and so the way it works is that she bills me directly and I pay her and then I file the claim. I send in a claim with a receipt saying I've already paid her and they refund me, so I'm happy to do that or . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It may be just as easy for me to bill them. I can just do all that electronically anyway, so it's probably certainly easier for you and probably not fun for you to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. I have an interview at the coffee shop this afternoon, which is good. Finally, it's not the first place I would choose to work but it's the first place that's called me back, so I feel good about that, hoping to suck it up. But if I get that job, they apparently offer health benefits and apparently under state law I can't do independent if I can get insured through my work, which might mean that all of this is moot. (sighs) (laughs) Trying not to [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:21) trouble on that way but if I imagine . . . oh, well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good luck. [00:02:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. So it was a good thing to happen yesterday. It was not a good weekend otherwise. Yesterday was kind of better. I worked really hard, which was good. I got a lot done. I don't know. James and I have been fighting, which is not surprising at all. We don't know how to stop talking about the subject without it being a good deal. Like when we're having an argument and it becomes clear to both of us that what we're actually arguing about is not what happened in this television show and why the writers chose to do it the way they did. Something's going on between the two of us and we just need to let it go, put it down and move away. That can't happen without it being really a big deal, really emotionally fraught. (laughs) [00:03:40] It turned into a situation where I was like, "No. Really. We need to stop talking about this." I was like crying, crying a lot. In part because it had just been a hard day and a hard week and James was really, really upset and I was just like, "I just don't want to talk about it anymore." He was like, "Me either. Why are we talking about this?" But, yeah, yeah. It's like our normal mode of conversation is pretty intense and we do great. That's what we do. And then when it becomes too much for one of us it just blows up in our faces and we're just like we don't really know what happened. Yeah. [00:04:37]</p>

<p>You know when you get married and they give you lots of advice about how to stay married? And one of the things that everybody tells you is, "Don't go to bed angry. Finish the argument before you go to bed." That's terrible advice. That's such bad advice. (laughs) Because usually we don't. We stay up until like four in the morning and then just be completely exhausted and I just have this kind of sinking fear and it's horrible and I'm so scared I can't even really focus on what we're fighting about. It just takes us forever to get to the place where we understand each other and can figure it out. So this time, I guess Thursday or Friday night, we just went to bed angry. (laughs) I don't think we cared. (laughs) [00:05:44] We haven't really talked about that fight yet, but we talked some about it—what's going on. I think we're kind of back to a place where we're like both rested and level enough that we can go back and say, "This is what I think happened. What do you think happened?" What happened is we were watching—do you watch Sherlock? That's a series you really should watch. Oh, my goodness. I mean if you like Sherlock Holmes. If you don't, it's still going to be okay. It's out on Netflix, season two. I had seen it and James hadn't. And so we were watching the last episode which is where Holmes fakes his own death in order to destroy Moriarty, his arch nemesis. [00:06:39] The way that the current writers write Moriarty is he is this very intelligent psychopath who basically is just bored to tears with his own life and is kind of fucking with Sherlock in order to have something to do. And so at the end of the episode he like forces Sherlock into a position where Sherlock has to kill himself or his friends will be killed; but it's like Moriarty could call it off if he wants to and Sherlock recognizes that and is like, "I'm going to make you," and Moriarty is like, "Well, good luck with that," and kills himself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Moriarty kills himself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Moriarty kills himself. So then Sherlock is in the position of having to kill himself or his friends will all die. The way they wrote it there's like some sort of logical fallacy, like a [monocle flaw] (ph) that doesn't quite add up, which I hadn't even noticed because I don't tend to notice those things and James really notices those things. James was like, "That's not right." So he was focusing on this logical inconsistency and I was saying that the way that scene works emotionally is really good. I think the characters . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [You just believe what's in around the logic.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I didn't really even see the logic part. I wasn't really thinking along those terms. I was thinking along the motivational parts and I was like, "No, but that makes sense for each of them to do that." If it hadn't been a scene about suicide, (laughs) if I hadn't been so scared that James is not going to think that my emotions are valid and if James hadn't been really struggling with the fact that I'm doing crazy shit that doesn't make any sense to him and he has to be okay with it, it would have been fine. But as it was, it was really not fun. (laughs) Really not. Yeah. (laughs) (pause) Yeah. Yeah. [00:09:03] The next day he got—I just think he's so tired and I'm so tired. Not right now but I have been so tired. The next day he got really frustrated, really angry with me. It was one of the days I didn't take the Aterol because I had been taking it for three weeks and I needed to take a day off. Saturday when I just don't have anything to do is about as good as you can get; but it was just an awful day for me. He was very concerned and took care of me and so forth and I was just so overwhelmed by all of the things that I had to do. I could pick out pieces of them and, say, list one small chunk at a time, but even the little small chunks were just completely overwhelming for me. [00:10:02] And so at the end of the day someone called Mr. [inaudible]—I really like crepes a lot—but they had been saying they're hiring and so I was going to talk to them and he said, "I'm going to go over to the Square. Do you want to come and look there?" And I said, "No. I don't. I don't want to do it right now." And he was upset with me. As best as he could tell me or I could figure out, he was just upset that I couldn't break down this giant mass of things that were overwhelming me into things that I could do. He was like, "This is what you do when you're overwhelmed. You take things and you make a list and then you start on the list and you do one thing after another." And I was saying, "But even the list is too much. It's too much for me." (pause) So I said, "I think it's perfectly reasonable for you to be angry with me or upset that I can't do this, but my not being able to do this is a symptom and I feel like there's not all that much I can do about that at this moment." (laughs) So, it's been an interesting weekend. [00:11:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By "interesting" I take you to mean "at times, awful."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We cooked a lot of really good food, which is nice. We made crepes for breakfast yesterday. Yeah. Yeah. And yesterday was a lot better, but I was a lot higher functioning yesterday, so at the end of the day going to bed I just collapsed and was like, "James, this is too much for me. I can't do this. I can't." Going to sleep like every time I try to go to sleep, one image after another of all the things that I did wrong or didn't do or that I'm doing wrong or that are wrong with me kind of flipped through my head and I can't stop thinking about them. [00:12:55] James said, "You really strong-armed yourself through a lot of stuff today. Maybe you should do less yesterday." But I felt like he was really happy about the fact, or he felt really good about the fact, that I was getting stuff done yesterday. (sighs) I don't know. I don't know. (pause) I try to live up to his expectations, which doesn't mean that he is trying to get me to do that, but that's what happens. [00:13:43] I feel like if I hadn't done so I'd worry or feel as though I don't think this is actually the case, but I feel as though if I hadn't really pushed myself yesterday James would not have been as nice to me as he was yesterday. (sighs) (pause) [00:14:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that's one of the main things that you do to cope with how you're feeling—is sort of take in and act on what you imagine the expectations are of the people around you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It works sometimes. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It works really well until it doesn't work anymore. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Works to do what? [00:15:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel better about myself. I feel like I belong. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're working pretty hard, I think, even here, now in addition to when you're home to stay afloat?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (pause) [Right now feels the same as this morning. And I needed it.] (ph) It's good, but—yeah. I talked to Dr. Vaughn (ph) yesterday. I'm going to try Remeron. She was like, "Don't try it tomorrow." (laughs) So I'm not going to try and start until Tuesday. [00:16:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Remeron? It's an antidepressant—not an SSRI. It works similarly, apparently most notable for sedation and waking in terms of the side effects, so she was like, "Don't start . . ." I was not going to start it until I don't have to get out of bed early the next morning. (laughs) Yeah. Yeah. I told her I feel like we're stalled. I kind of want to know what we're doing next. So she said, ["Well wait seven that we haven't tried but might be worth trying." More on the order of course active and what starts working faster.] (ph) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not super active, I think. I feel like I told myself, at least, when I started all of this that I'm going to try everything. I want to try everything. If this is the way that I have to live, then I don't want to be able to say, "Well, I just didn't explore these options." [00:18:20] So I'll probably talk with her about trying this stuff. (sighs) I think it's hard for James to really understand that this is where I live now. He's used to me being really high functioning. He's used to me really frankly just being able to keep up, and it's hard for him that I can't all the time. It sucks for me that I can't. (laughs) It sucks but I don't. (pause) (sigh) Yeah, I can't keep up. (pause) [00:19:53] I'm absolutely confident that we'll get to the point where I'm really, really glad to be living with James. Absolutely confident of that, but a lot of the time over the last week I haven't really been glad that he's here and I can't tell anybody that—other than you, obviously. And I haven't been as good at disguising that (chuckles) and I ordinarily am at things like that. I think it hurts James, but I also know he would rather me be honest than not, which is hard. (pause) [00:21:21] It's weird to me just how much my mental processes focus around him when he's here. Like I've been talking about James for the last week straight. (pause) So I told you he can stay in his program though, right? [00:22:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that means he will continue to get his stipend, too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's good, or a salary. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think they call it a stipend still, which is good in that he doesn't have to look for another job. Less good in that it's really not very much money. (laughs) Cost of living in Ohio, I assume, is going to be lower than here, but as soon as I get a job we should be okay. But then the pressure is on for me to do so. It's sort of like if I were not part of this relationship it would be hilarious to watch him go insane over this very, very important element of our being stable that he doesn't have any control over. (laughs) [00:23:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean your having a job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like it's driving him crazy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's trying so hard not to try to take control over it and kind of failing. (laughing) A lot of the things that I do in terms of liking to control my environment, liking to understand things and wanting to act in the face of emotions that I find difficult, he's like the superhero at those things. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:24:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then I'm right back in the place of being obsessed and anxious about not having a job, so . . . (pause) I told him when we first started talking about his moving that I wanted us to be in couples therapy, that that would be a good idea. It hadn't actually occurred to me, but Amanda suggested it and I said, "Oh, that's a brilliant idea. You're absolutely right. We really should do that." [00:25:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure, I can think of a few.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We might wait until we have jobs. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I'm going to find a job, then I'll find a therapist for us and James will find an apartment. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got you. [00:25:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) That's only in part, only like 10 percent a sneaky way for me to try to kill the canary. (laughs) That felt so bad coming out of my mouth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I'm happy to give you names for the two of you or for him individually or both. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, I'm working really hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I suspect what's going on in here between you and I has been in a way—it's a compliment—but what goes on between you and James in that I imagine in here you're more playing the part of James, where at home he's playing the part of James? [00:27:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's about right, actually. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where I think in the same way where, or I guess to be a little more precise about it, at home he's playing your version of James in your version of the story to me and here you're playing your version of James.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today or in general?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In here somewhat over the last week, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That's different than I thought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you have a kind of, I mean you were very focused as you've been in here for the last week sort of talking and thinking about him and I think you're sort of more scared than before about how bad your feelings kind of breaking through. The fear you describe and the kind of vigilance you describe him having around how you're feeling seems similar to what you're showing in here. Like I'm sort of sitting over here I think kind of at least kind of in the impression that I have a very clear sense of some of the things you're not feeling and working hard not to feel. I imagine that's a bit how you feel when you're with him when you're at home; like you're pretty clear of some of the things that you're very worried about or sort of trying hard not to feel because you're worried about disappointing him or upsetting him or dragging him down. [00:29:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That makes sense. (chuckles) So what do I do about it? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you're playing your part pretty accurately.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. Yeah. To me it feels like, in addition or another side, is I feel like all of my other relationships sort of get reshuffled when I'm with James. It's like I'm not sure where we are in some ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like how we've been reshuffled? [00:30:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Why would I be doing that? There's not an obvious reason to my why I would be doing that, and there usually, once you say, "I think this is going on," it usually does make sense and I can see where it's coming from.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because (pause) I think because you're working very hard to protect him mostly, as you see it, from you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I want to protect him here, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot of what I think you're doing, but go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get really angry with him, really upset. I worry that you will think that he's something other than who he is. I worry that I won't guard him well if that makes sense, in that you are not going to get to meet him unless you want to and he wants to—whatever. It's more important to me that you not get a misreading of him, that you not think badly of him than that you not think badly of almost anybody else. (laughs) [00:33:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you concerned that I'll think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he's controlling. That he is not sensitive to me. That he's not trying hard enough to take care of me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think these are all things, again, part of how I imagine the scenario in here is working is that you're playing the part of James and I'm playing the part of you; so I think you're giving me a bunch of thoughts you don't want to have about him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (laughs) Yes. Absolutely. Yeah. But the controlling thing is something that I get anxious about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you mostly don't want to think critically of him. [These kinds of thoughts are probably ] (background noise at 00:34:13), but I think more broadly you're really worried about being critical or disappointed with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not very much fun. Yeah. Yeah. There's a difference between being upset with him in the moment and being upset with him in the long term. It's much easier for me to be angry with him about something that he's done than to feel like this is a character trait. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Like he is controlling. "You said that thing to try to get me to do something in this moment" is not so bad but "you are a controlling person" is uncomfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's uncomfortable and it's not consonant with the way that I've ever thought of him—controlling specifically. The early first couple of years of your relationship, my remembrance of it was me constantly trying to cast him into the role of Bryan and him constantly being like, "No, Tanya. You make your own decisions. No, Tanya. I'm not going to be jealous of you. No, Tanya. I'm not going to do that." And so that's like a bogie for me; terrified that I've been in controlling relationships before and they scare me. That's kind of shifting away from what we were actually talking about. [00:36:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That is complicated because on the one hand, some of what I think casts him as Bryan, he's a terribly controlling figure for you. Having him in town exerts such control over what you can and can't feel; and as you say, you've been sort of talking about him for the last week—I mean that's because he's in town—but some if it is he looms so large in a way that I don't think you're choosing for him to do. I mean he's going to loom large because you're husband. I don't mean like that. But it's all so immediate. I think it feels like he's right here all the time and I think that exerts a lot of control. I don't think that's him being a controlling person. [00:37:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We talked a few days ago about the degree to which I try to live up to what I imagine his expectations to be. I'm like, "How did that happen? Neither of us meant for this to be such a big structure in our relationship, but it is and we should work on that." (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's this thing called an unconscious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Oh, God. (laughs) Yeah. Yeah. He met me and we walked back home together after therapy Friday and I was upset and kind of just wanted to walk and think and he was just scared because I was sad and he kept talking to me. I got really angry at him but I didn't say anything. [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:10) After therapy, I don't want to talk to anybody for a while. (pause) [00:39:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It looked like you were looking there for a reaction from me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yes. [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:31) Hoping you would approve. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's the shift, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yep. Yep. I mean I like to think that I choose good people to ask for approval from. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm flattered. I know that's not quite that. I don't know them well enough yet, but there are very good and probably very important self-protective reasons things developed this way for you, like this didn't come out of nowhere, so it's probably a survival strategy for you growing up in some ways that I'm not clear on, don't really need to be clear on at the moment. Just in general, that's the way these things work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll think about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now.</p>

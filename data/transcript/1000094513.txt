<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. How are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have pretty bad allergies so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Springtime.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yup. And I was supposed to think about an example.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Couldn't think of one, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. I really haven't sat down and done it, and even if I did I don't know if I would have been able to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how are you today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, other than itchy nose. I'm all right. You were saying you were going to be gone next week, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Next week, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think I'm going to be gone for the next two weeks after that so it's going to be a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Going to miss a few weeks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you going on holiday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, from the 6th which is that Friday, for two weeks, so it is going to be almost a month until we see each other again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, we can try to do, if our schedules coincide, some sessions, two sessions in a week. We can talk about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have any thoughts about or feelings about leaving for that period of time? 0:02:07.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm not one of those crazy ones that is going to commit suicide when their therapist is away. No, I never understood that, but I guess that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I mean it's just... Sort of breaking the flow can be - you know, it can...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, especially if it's going to be for that long, but I think it will be okay. I guess I've been a lot more relaxed as far as my outlook in my relationships with people. I've been a lot more laid back, or at least trying to, you know. When I find myself getting upset I just kind of take a deep breath, kind of try to speak slower, which seems to calm me down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're observing yourself a bit, sounds like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I've always been pretty self-observant. So you know, as far as that's concerned I'm doing better, at least with Billy. It is not - it doesn't feel as intense as it was before. I get less angry less frequently, but that isn't to say that everything is A-perfect but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But we're getting better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And with... I haven't seen my mom so I don't... I haven't called or anything like that. 0:04:05.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How has it been, talking about your mom here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's given me I guess more - clearer outlook as to not only what our problems are, but what I need to do to rectify that. So it's like in the back of my mind that I'm planning on having maybe a girls' night out kind of stuff with her and I and we'll just talk it out. I feel we'll do it in a public place so that there won't be any screaming match, but I think it will be okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you anticipating getting angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and she and I are both - we can be very vocal when we're angry, we've had our rounds, so I think it would be safer if we did it in public; keep our voices down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So... I don't know. I guess for the last week I've just been feeling like I'm really not sure what I want to talk about any more, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. I'm getting that sense from you tonight. What do you suppose it's about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't feel that real urgency about anything. It just seems like it's the same thing all the time over and over again and I think I'm getting like sick of hearing it at this point. I feel almost like a little kid, whining about something, and it's like relentless whining, non-stop, and that's the way I feel, listening to myself talk. 0:06:33.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's going to make it hard to talk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It just sounds so boring and it just seems like problems aren't really problems, they seem trivial, whereas before it was something that was really on my mind and I needed to talk about it and get it out and resolve it, and I just don't have that, I don't know, the desire any more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's almost like, I don't know, just boredom almost. You know, it seems boring. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's boring about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The repetition of the same thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And why is that for it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, anything. Like anything if you do it all the time it can be boring. I guess it is the same thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel some boredom going over it. What else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't have the enthusiasm, you know. I don't have the enthusiasm to talk about it. 0:08:03.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm wondering if you feel maybe some thoughts about what I'm thinking or what I'm feeling or concerns about that, you know. I mean when someone says to me that they feel that what they're talking about is boring it makes me think, well, maybe you're wondering if I'm boring and maybe that's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not really that concerned about that. I don't know. It sounds boring to me, you know. It's something that I've lived with all my life, something I've always thought about in my head. Just now like it is anything new that's coming out. So at least in my head it was just going over it in my head, it wasn't vocalized, so you don't really actually hear the sounds of those words. But when you talk about it you can only say it so many different ways and just so many times and, I don't know, it's just boring.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you feeling that you shouldn't talk about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't mean that. I'm not trying to avoid talking about it, but I just don't know where to go from there. I just don't know how to make it flow, you know? It just seems so choppy and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Choppy; what seems choppy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Our talking about it, the way we've been talking. 0:10:00.9 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today especially or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, we just started.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Last time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Last time, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, can you try to think what it was that felt choppy or what felt like it wasn't flowing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just the feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was the feeling you had?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just not comfortable any more, you know. I'm not... I mean not that I'm uncomfortable talking about it, I'm just not comfortable the way it is going. I guess I have in my head of what therapy was or is supposed to be and it is not fitting in with the way I remember it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, you mean before, with someone else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I don't know whether it is that, because I know a lot of the times... Like if I read a book and then I watch a movie on the same subject and I know that they're never the same, I'm not happy, I'm not, you know. I look for... If I read a book first, as I'm watching the movie I keep thinking this isn't how it's supposed to be, you know, because I keep remembering the scenes from the book and vice versa.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the first one...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the way it feels, though. It just feels like - it just doesn't feel right, you know. 0:12:14.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what felt right about the first one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess the fact that it was new, you know, everything was new, and so talking about things was brand new and I just - I don't know, what's that saying? Something about rehashing, you know? That's the way it feels, more so than therapy, like trying to resolve it. It just feels like it is just rehashing of the old feelings or the feeling is never resolved. It doesn't feel like I'm sitting here trying to figure out... Because I feel like I already know what my problems are. See, before was more like a discovering of the problems, whereas now it just feels like it is an old feeling. You know. I know what my problems are and I feel like by sitting here talking about it it's more like feeling sorry for myself rather than trying to figure out what it is I need to do not to feel that way any more, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, you've articulated this before and it's sort of an idea of wanting to come up with a solution. 0:14:05.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, it is like I think everything in terms of mathematics almost. You know, in math is an equation which is this problem, and you know, with every problem is an equation to solve it and that there is an answer for everything, and that's the way I guess I want my life to be. And if there is a question or a problem, I want to look at it, I want to resolve it. I want an answer so that if it's a problem I don't want it to happen again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, to stay with the mathematical equation analogy there is also - when you do a proof there are a lot of steps in between, and sometimes you do a step and it doesn't work so you try another one. And my sense is that you want to go from the problem to the proof, right? You know, and what about all those little steps in between, you know, where one sort of like wins one's way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. I guess what I'm looking for then isn't so much... I guess I'm looking for the final answer, you know, without the... Like you asked me the other day, I think it was one of the first couple of sessions, you know, when I was talking about a problem with Paul and you said - and I wanted to make a decision, and "Why do you have to make a decision right now?" And that's been my outlook, you know, and a lot of people have said the same thing, "Why do you have to have an answer? Why do you need to have an answer now?" I guess it's the impatience. And I don't know why there is that impatience but... 0:16:07.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, there is impatience, and I think as you yourself said there's some discomfort and it is not going to be much help to sort of gloss over that; it's part of where you are in relation to what you're working on, it feels uncomfortable. And part of that requires that you stay a little bit with that discomfort, because you need to get a sort of better sense of what it is about. So maybe something happened where you touched on some stuff last time, you know, in relation to your mother and it doesn't feel so easy, so good to sit with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think that's worth a look at. I mean we've actually gone through this before, you know, in relation to your talking about your mother. I can't help but think a couple of sessions ago, when you said - you came in after talking about it and you said, "This isn't working out," you know? And you said that it felt like it didn't have a flow. And at that time what you were talking about was sort of not filling me in on the details.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This time you've given me more of the details, but it is also not very comfortable because it feels like you're saying it again and again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why is that? You know, why... Consciously I don't feel uncomfortable talking about it. I just get frustrated at myself, because I feel like I've been having this problem for the last 20 years, you know. 0:17:59.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I think that frustration is sort of like a big brick wall, you know; it's going to be hard for you to climb over and see what's on the other side. In other words, it's going to be difficult if you don't take a look at what that frustration is about. I mean I don't think it's going to go away. Do you understand? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I understand. But how do we look at it? I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, one thing is to just accept the fact that you're feeling frustrated right now and just explore it a little bit. What does it feel like? Try to go in a little bit deeper into the experience of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The feeling is like when I started to talk about how I don't feel comfortable it is almost like it is right here inside and it is just pumping away of agitation. It is the same feeling where when I'm in a situation that is annoying me and I can't do anything about it I have exact same feeling that - and it's a physical feeling, it's not just an emotional feeling, it is something I physically feel when my body... It feels like I'm standing still but I'm running like 100 miles an hour. It's not the adrenalin and it's very hard to describe, you know. Because it's not really my heart that's beating fast, you know, but when I'm like really frustrated and I feel like I have absolutely no control, for me not to feel that way that's exactly what I feel like, that...0:20:40.5 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's see, I lost you a little bit. For you to feel you have no control and what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, when I'm frustrated and I don't have any control over the outcome of how I feel or outcome of what I can do about it it is this physical thing I go through, you know, it is really weird, and it is really uncomfortable, you know. It's not something I'm thinking about, it's just something I feel. I get very edgy. It's almost like when I'm having a nicotine fit, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you're feeling it right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What are the emotions that you're feeling right now attached to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Agitation, wanting to yell, wanting to yell at the person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just loss of patience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're feeling sort of anger, some irritation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're feeling it at me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you express that anger?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean as in explaining it or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, say it. What is...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Expressing it? No, I can't, because it doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel like it should be directed at you, you know, because I know it's not... Well, I guess what I wanted to say was if I was to say it at the time of that frustration it is like the thing that will come out of my mouth is you're not helping me, I'm not getting anything out of this, or I don't feel like this is going anywhere, because we're just talking about things without taking that next step, you know. And that's what it makes me feel when I came in and I said I don't have that same energy any more, that energy to - wanting to probe and talk about my past, because it just sounds sane, you know, because I figure, you know, you talk about it, you resolve it, and you go on to something else. But I do feel better now that I said that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, yeah. Yes, but there's a feeling of being stuck and not moving.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not going forward.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And that's - yeah, and I don't know whether that's... I feel that with you, because I may feel that way in other part of my life, you know, but that's the way I feel. I feel like I'm not really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stuck.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...moving, you know. I feel like this is my eighth session, and for the last four sessions it is been about the subject of my mother and nothing has become of it other than just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you have in mind would become of it? What was your picture? What do you want to see? 0:24:30.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: An answer, I guess. I don't know what answer. It's like looking for like a guardian angel type of thing. It's almost like not making the decision myself so that someone else will make the decision for me kind of thing. It's like I am so uncomfortable. When I'm in a situation and someone asks me to make a decision it is just I don't know what to do, you know, and I ultimately end up making decisions based on what I think it should be or what I think they want it to be or what I think... You know, it never...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I have a question: You came in saying you were going to meet with your mother and you were going to talk it out and it was not (ph) going to be a public place because you didn't want to scream at each other. Was that one of those things where you felt you had to make a decision and go forward, you've got to do...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no. That in itself wasn't a decision, because that is something I thought about doing for a long time. The decision was to go ahead and do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, okay. So is there something about that decision that doesn't feel right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I guess that's not a good example of it. 0:26:15.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, I mean you were talking about not moving forward, and it seems to me that you're suddenly taking a step now. But what is in - perhaps in meeting with your mother and talking with her but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, well, I haven't done it yet so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, but I mean what is not clear to me is how you really feel about that, and yes, in some sense I feel there are a lot of feelings around that that we kind of explored. I don't know why I feel that way but I just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I want a confirmation, you know. It is like if I was to say, well, this is what I like to do, I guess I would want feedback from you as to what you think the outcome of that might be, you know, of both pros and cons, as a person who is aware of the situation but not emotionally involved often can look at the situation a little bit better, you know. Well, most of the times I think as an objective observer your decision isn't, how do you say it, influenced, you know. So if it follows to say, "Well, what I would like to do is to meet with mom and talk it over," and I guess I would like to hear maybe, well, "What do you think - what is going to happen. Are you going to get into a fight? If you do, how are you going to handle that or what kind of fight or what kind of - or what do you think her response is going to be?" You know, that kind of stuff with questions like that that I may not have thought about asking myself. You know, that am I just jumping into doing something impulsively because I'm not looking at it objectively. That's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, well, it seems like you have a lot of different feelings about whether or not to go and meet with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's something that I know I will do in due time. I'm not sure when that will be. I'm not sure - you know, I'm not 100 percent confident of myself. I don't know how I'm going to begin this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think more useful than me giving you advice, because that's not really I think that helpful for you, more useful would be for you to talk about some of the ideas you have about meeting with her and how you imagine it, and we can explore that in that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, gosh, you know how a lot of the times everything is impromptu. Is that the word? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just you make it up as you go along?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Improvise it. 0:29:47.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel like that is the way it is going to go, you know? I think I'll go in with - not negatively, because that right away puts the person on the defensive. I'd like to maybe take her out for dinner and maybe some drinks and say, you know, "I think there's some things that need to be resolved in order for me to get a complete understanding of who I am and why I am the way I am and I think a lot of that is influenced by the way you are as a person and as a mother and the relationship, because of the relationship, you know." See, I think that's the way I would like to take it rather than coming off and saying, you know, "Because of you I'm all fucked up." That wouldn't really work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you have a sense that that might pop up, that might rear its head a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think if she becomes, right away, defensive, because she has a tendency to be like that, you know, I think if she's willing to listen to me, both the good and the bad, I don't think that that will be a problem. I don't think I would react like that. But knowing her, there's going to be a lot of "buts." She's going to say "but this" and "but that" and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So as you say it to me, what are you feeling as you talk about it, as you're beginning to explore it? Are you in touch with what you're experiencing right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're in your head, thinking about it? 0:32:14.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not really feeling anything. I don't know. I don't know what I'm supposed to feel. I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's no supposed to or anything, just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not like before, where I had definitely had definite feelings, you know. I just don't feel anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it that you would like to have in between the two of you? What would you like from her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I want her to become like the mother that I visualize, which is someone who wants to know what is going on in your life. Calls you up just to find out, that kind of stuff rather than calling up to... I mean we really don't have a conversation. It's just like she calls up to mention something about somebody or an occasion and then every once in a while I'll get a chance to tell her what I'm doing, but for the most part it's always about her, you know. And I guess I want her to be a little more involved in my life; not necessarily having to be there physically, but just knowing what's going on, you know. 0:34:15.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you want her to know you more and share more of what you're doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, unselfishly, you know, not... It's like she only wants to hear about certain things about certain people. She has a limit as to... She sets limitations as to what we can and cannot talk about, you know. We are not allowed to talk about our body parts; the fact that if I'm feeling low and say, you know, I gained some weight, I've got to start exercising, I can't even mention, you know, about stuff like that, which she calls it, quote, unquote, boring. I mean I don't know what kind of conversation she has with her people but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean "her people"?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Her friends, yeah. But to say that "It's boring and I don't want to talk about it," it just - who are you to tell me that what I want to talk about is boring, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sounds like she has some limitations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, she's certainly got limitations. I mean but it's okay to talk about her body, you know? I mean that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's okay for her but not for you. 0:36:12.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I mean if she starts it, you know, then it's all right for us to have this conversation, but if anyone else starts it it is like "No, I don't want to talk about that." So stuff like that where nothing feels unconditional... conditional - yeah, that's right - rules and regulations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, Judy, what about the possibility of her not being able to meet all those wishes of yours?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know she's not going to meet any of them. I mean, you know, that's the... I don't even think it's a matter of... I don't think it's that... Her viewpoint is going to be "Tough shit," you know, "This is the way I am," you know, which I think would hurt me more than if I hadn't even talked to her about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it seems on some level you've heard that before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, you know, "tough shit," yeah. I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in a way you anticipate that she may respond this way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in a way you already know what's going to happen in the meeting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I could always be wrong. And it has been a long time since I've had a heart-to-heart talk with her and so what I'm feeling may be, you know, not true, and that she may not be like that now, which I don't think is the case but... 0:38:18.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so when she says "tough shit" to you what does that make you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Furious, you know, because it's not even like a discussion any more. It's like she's saying, "That's it, I don't want to talk about it."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And where does that leave you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, nowhere. Again, I have absolutely no control. I mean I feel like I have no control, because I've just been told, you know, that what I have to say don't matter, whether I say it or not. It's not going to mean anything to her, that nothing's going to be done about it, so why even bother wasting my breath?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe that's part of why you would hate to go over this again and again, because it's painful, when you think she's really not going to move.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I know that it's not going to be all that productive. You know, there is going to be I think resentment from her end for probably feeling that - her feeling "I can't believe that she feels this way about me." And so it would be like this hurt feeling with some resentment for me feeling that way about her. You know, and then there's going to be...0:40:50.9 </p>

<p>I mean I was not a bad kid growing up compared to.. If I were to compare to a lot of people at that age, you know, I mean I never got involved with the wrong crowd that got me into trouble with the law. You know, yes, I'd done some stuff that they considered wild so they never let me forget that. To this day, when I see them, they love to bring up all the wild stuff that I used to do, the way I used to dress, kind of people I hung out with, and really - and then they thought I did drugs. I mean I smoked pot a couple of times. But trying to convince them of that, they have absolutely no idea of what I went through. It's like I have this "they." When I say "they," I mean usually my family. 0:42:09.8 </p>

<p>You know, I did dress really slutty, you know. I don't know what she expected of us. She moved us into a neighborhood that was predominantly project blacks and low-income housing Puerto Ricans where there was a lot of drugs, a lot of kids hanging out on the street. They were not educated. So we moved there and then she tells us not to hang out with any of them, ignore them. Do you know what that does to these people when you ignore them? You live in the neighborhood, you try to make friends with people.. Especially if you live in a bad neighborhood you don't want to be the enemy of your own neighborhood.</p>

<p>So she - on one hand she moves us to that neighborhood because she wants us to see how half - the rest of the world lives, you know, because we were considered upper middle class and she wanted us to know that not everybody lived like that. Not everybody lived in brownstone houses with a housekeeper and went to private school. Fine.</p>

<p>So once I began making friends with them, and then once they recognized my family, they made sure that they kept their eyes open for my family, you know. So now my mother is grateful that I become friends with these people, so now there's another... She's got two double standards now, you know. We moved there, then don't be friends, now it is okay to be friends, so now I'm friends. Well, they used to hang out and smoke pot, so I did that every once in a while, you know. But I mean I was not a dumb child. You know, if I knew I didn't like something, I didn't do it. I mean yes, there was peer pressure to some extent, and I think that's how I got involved with cigarettes, but that's the extent of my addiction, you know? 0:44:41.9 </p>

<p>You know, I tried drinking. I knew I didn't like it because I'd have the worse case of hangovers so I knew the limitation to that. I tried pot, you know. </p>

<p>So because of a few instances where I came home drunk, came home late, hung out with these, quote, wild people, you know, 15 years later they still like to think of me that way, and it just gets me really mad when I go over there and that's what they want to talk about, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do they bring it up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Usually somebody would - I mean I still have sisters that are younger so they still live at home. They're at the age or was the age that I was when I was going through this. And so she would start off by complaining about one of their behaviors, and then she would say, "Well, I guess compared to you, you know, it's not so bad," and she... 0:46:05.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have a reputation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I was the rebel, and then I was considered the black sheep of the family. And when I said that to her... We were talking about - I forget what we were talking about, and everybody agreed about the way I used to be. And I said, "Well, I was the black sheep of the family," and she denies it, you know. Why? I'm admitting it. Why is she denying it? She'd say, "No, you are not the black sheep of the family." I said, "Who the fuck was the black sheep of the family then," you know? I mean I rebelled. I set the ways for the rest of the kids, I mean, but if she looks at us none of us got into trouble, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So her saying, "No, you weren't the black sheep..."</p>

<p>PATIENT: That makes me mad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes you very mad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because she's denying it, you know, and that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And why is it important for her to acknowledge it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that's the way she treated me the whole time I was growing up. So now that we're adults she's going to say, "No, we never treated you that way"? You know, that's the exact same thing that she has done a lot of times with a lot of people, which is an outright lie, you know, and that's what I mean when I said that she used to lie to my father, because when he used to come home after work she would tell him some things and we would all be in trouble, for what we don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, she... What about another possibility in that she's trying to establish another kind of relationship with you now? 0:48:01.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, by denying the way she treated me in the past doesn't make it right. And if that's her intention, that's great, but I have no way of knowing if that's what she's trying to do, you know. And if that is what she's trying to do then why is she bringing up the part of my life that is very sore? I mean I'm just... She can bring it up without making it as a comparison to every goddamn thing that goes wrong in that family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so she does bring it up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She just says you weren't the black sheep. She brings it up, but she says...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. So that makes me more mad than for her to say that I was a black sheep. Because I don't necessarily see being a black sheep of the family as a bad thing, you know, because I mean you could be from a very poor end family and if you were the black sheep then you were at least alive, you know, so I don't necessarily think that it means that you were a bad person. But she obviously thinks that that's the way that I think it. I mean they just... </p>

<p>And then, you know, now my sisters have boyfriends that come over, and so when we get into conversations they just love to do that, you know. And I can do that more comfortably with my sisters than I can with my mother, you know. I can joke with my sisters and say, "Yeah." But it's like even when I do that I feel like I'm lying, because I really don't think I was all that bad, you know. </p>

<p>And the way they talk, there's a big exaggeration and exaggeration is another thing that I don't like. I don't like when people tell stories and to make the story sound better they spice it up with their own version of what happened, you know, and that's why usually my stories are very boring, because I don't like doing that. I don't know really how to do it and I've seen people do it and it just - I feel very uncomfortable, even when they spice it up in a positive way, because I know that's not the truth. 0:50:44.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think you're talking about wanting to establish for yourself what your history was and wanting it to be truthful and wanting others to recognize what it was, the good and the bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm sorry we won't be able to meet for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're going... You said next Monday, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll be gone...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Next Monday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll be gone the end of this week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'll be back on the 7th.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only other time that we can do this week will be tomorrow or Friday and then not until another month so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, tomorrow I'm not here and Friday is, unfortunately, a little difficult too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, so let me just get my calendar. 0:52:01.3 </p>

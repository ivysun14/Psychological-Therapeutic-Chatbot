<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is session (unintelligible) yeah, after all. This is December 14, Client TO, session 16. Okay, and you're up to your last (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You paid way back in the middle of January was it? (chuckling) that money for four sessions lasted a long time. Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep (0:00:59.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what we were going to do, you had some project in mind about visualizing an alternate idea of success or lifestyle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you for (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I've - as much as I said it would be very easy, I guess it isn't as easy as I thought it would be. I didn't really (unintelligible). But I guess, you know, the really - it's difficult for me to come up with an alternate really is why I could go on about like, would just be sort of elaborations or variations upon, you know, one single thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about that? A very good place to start.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I suppose it involves in a certain way it would involve Sandy in the movie "Carnal Knowledge." You see that? You're not getting around enough, Penny [ph] (0:02:09.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You take your work too seriously (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: So the problem is (unintelligible). But why the fellow in there, Art Garfunkel, plays the part and he's sort of the conventional of the two partners. You probably know something. And he becomes a doctor, professional man and marries the sweetheart whom Jack Nicholson previously seduced unbeknownst to Art Garfunkel who trusted him. And so I suppose it would just sort of involve something along those lines. That's at least an alternate from a rah-rah [ph] point of view of technical success.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, tell me where success is there (0:02:56.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a second, let me revise that. Tell me more - fill out what you're telling me. I'm not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, right, you didn't see the movie so it doesn't have anything to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, well, you're saying Art Garfunkel's style was an alternate style to what you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well in certain ways, yeah. He had the benefit of a sort of, with being a doctor, you know, sort of a professional life, quasi-scientific, you know, life. And so that's better than the kind of thing that I'm in which really involves, you know, selling yourself rather than having to do distinct professional life that you lead, you know. So that's - that was sort of a pleasing alternate. Although the movie of course demonstrates that his life was bankrupt also. So nobody gets away with anything. But that's more pleasing to me than (0:03:58.2)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Gets away with being - not having a happy life. Both of them have miserable times, both the heroes. And Art Garfunkel finally does become a hippie. But that at least is sort of a pleasing alternate to me. Although chiefly the fancies that I had and have involve accumulations of immense sums of money. And in order to do that of course one has to be very effective in the world. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a continuing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't exactly go off and be a hippie.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. There are some I suppose that do it in pseudo-style. Rich hippies, they call it, that must be the ultimate in hollow men because they affect hippie styles and yet secretly are Silas Marner, you know, hoarding great sums of money in California and Chicago and stuff. And but that's neither here nor there (0:05:02.8).</p>

<p>Yeah, so it comes back to the continual hang-up that I have, the difficulty that I have with the idea of the personal authority and the dealing effectively with the world, you know. And then this is coming back on a little of what I touched on ad nauseum by now, you know, dealing with these people. And then it turns back on myself that, you know, I don't do that particular thing very well. And probably in some ways my temperament would have been better suited to be something that's generally thought more (unintelligible), a teacher or some, you know, as I say professional style, lifestyle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound somewhat sad in coming out of it a little bit now, sad and serious. What is that about [ph] (0:06:02.6)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sad and serious. Well I guess I'm just sad at having to recite all of this nonsense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then don't obsess [ph]. I mean it sounds like you're reciting a rather boring compendium.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well maybe we'll just kind of have some [ph]. But I guess one of the things that I'm sad about is that I had another horrifying date with my friend Jane last night and I had a horrifying weekend. And so I'm a little low as a result of all that. Went on an incredible drinking binge starting Thursday night and didn't return to the office until about 3:00 Monday afternoon. During much of that period I was gassed out of my mind (chuckling) (0:07:00.1).</p>

<p>And then so Monday night I thought I'd set things right and have a dinner party and go to take Jane to dinner. And she went - she freaked out on me at the cocktail lounge at the bar which is supposed to be kind of a nifty place. And it isn't, but it's supposed to be.</p>

<p>So she just - she was just incredibly, you know, I'm fouled up, but she is incredibly worse. I don't understand it. She accepts a date with me. I called her at five, I said let's go get dinner. I'd been over her house Friday night, late. And so she accepted the date. And then she comes to the cocktail hour and then proceeds to give me all the manner of little negative shots. And we end up in a long conversation with two drunks at the end of the bar. And one of the guys is almost incoherent and wants to first buy us a drink and then get in a fight with me. And she's going on, she's saying, I just felt it was really being negative. So then I just shut down on her and we went to dinner and I just became very bored and told her I was very tired and I said I was going to take her home. And she didn't eat anything, she just continued to drink, and I had something to eat (0:08:15.0).</p>

<p>And so we went on talking about things and she was talking about herself and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it was positively horrible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was really - it was really one of the great horror shows. It was - in a certain way it was liberating for me though because in a peculiar sense, because previously I always drank and put up such a good face on and just tried to keep things going, you know? And then last night I just said oh, fuck it. This is ridiculous. If she's going to act this way I'm just going to be as rude as can be and eat dinner and then take her home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you enjoy the...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it was very demoralizing, really. You know, in a certain way I had to do it but it just was like a relief, you know, that kind of feeling that I'm not going to put up with this facade any longer. And it really is a facade.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's really great (0:08:58.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well that's the first time I've done anything of that kind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did it feel like to do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well if felt like, as I say it felt like a relief. I felt in a certain way that it was positive in a sense that it takes a certain amount of security I suppose just to see a bankrupt situation and rather than pretend any longer just say well, you know, clearly it's gone and I'm just going to go. In another way I enjoyed being - turning the tables on her and being a little cruel to her. You know, she's typically so obviously goofy because the moment I would give her a little shit she loves it. And then she came on very strong and wanted to make amends. You know, and she gets very aggressive, you know, what's wrong, what's wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like she's getting something out of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like she's getting something that meets her needs out of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's that kind of a situation that it's just not my scene. She used to go out with a guy who she, every time we go out she invariably tells me about this fellow and then I react in an invariably insane way. Well he used to belt her around a lot. And I always was very negative about it. And he was a horrible drunk. And, you know, he gave her a black eye and beat the shit out of her (0:10:16.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so she said - and then she started telling me about, you know, John, you don't understand it when two people really love one another, that doesn't really make that much difference. You just don't understand that. And then my response of course in a certain way, especially when you're being polite is limited to saying very conventional things, you know, if you're going to have an normal private [ph] conversation, which you can't do because she gets so, you know, elusive. You know, if you drop it can't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She gets elusive but you get pretty (unintelligible) too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe I do. But she after all - or somehow the conversation seemed to initiate from her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you (unintelligible) last night (0:10:55.5)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I treat it as a highly - as a mockery. I just mocked her. And that's - I sort of enjoyed that, again the feeling that I don't have to, you know, play the role that she's envisioned for this thing. But see the trouble with that is that it's not really that satisfying because I now feel like, you know, totally unworthy even to think about it because I really think she's screwed up. In even a more, you know, overt way than I am. A lot more overt way than I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. It sounds like one good thing happened (unintelligible) and that was your getting free of that role in footing the bullshit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With her at least.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I just - I think that's great and I would really like it if you could enjoy that a little bit. Your immediate response is, yeah, but everything else is (unintelligible). And that's a way of - that's a neurotic thing that I - almost everybody does during some amount of time. I did an encounter group last Sunday night where we had two guys who did that. (unintelligible) oh, this is terrible. Things aren't happening, and I can't even remember what their words were. But nothing's happening here and it's just a big show and everybody's just using words and nothing's happening. They went through this whole spiel (0:12:20.7).</p>

<p>And I felt kind of bad about the group because I wasn't interested in leading but I was - had a commitment to lead. (unintelligible) that night, so there I was leading. I felt kind of shitty and so it was kind of easy for me to fall into acceptance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you're really right (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I felt that a little bit, I really did. And they kept pulling this shit over and over and over again. I finally got my head on straight and realized that, you know, things weren't as bad as they were saying they were and said, hey, (unintelligible) that bad. Now I enjoyed moment A and moment 32 over here and other people started doing the same thing. Everybody opened up their mouth and said the way they felt and it turned out that those were the only two guys who felt that way in the whole room. And before that everybody - that had been the tone of the whole group. Those two were the only guys that were opening their mouths (0:13:10.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everyone else was afraid to say they...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it turned out to be a totally different situation when you got down to being specific instead of (unintelligible) yeah, it was bad as they were saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it was just, you know, a real learning experience for me in terms of enjoying, okay, yeah maybe some of those things are true about some of the moments. But what else is true here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I see what you mean and there - yeah, I did experience that sense of - chiefly it was just a sense of relief at not having to go through. And also teamed with - partly motivated by anger and hurt for that (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I did find that it was a relief to do that. And it also, it was funny how easily she accepted the role when - whereas she had been sort of an emotional, you know, emotional aggressor - not emotional, had sort of the emotional jump on me. In other words I'd be responding to, you know, her little signals of yes, no, you know, chiefly no, trying to cover it and acting probably very uptight when I do it. So she did - so I'd be responding to her own - her (unintelligible) (0:14:27.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It completely reversed the role...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Puppet...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Yeah. And so it was nice to do that. And I can see how she would get involved with a guy that would beat up on her because maybe that's some kind of a - maybe she, you know, in fact I suppose she had to have, after going out with the guy because she virtually admitted it. That one of her problems was that they both realized that they sort of loved each other, maybe it was some sort of sexual thing, but they didn't really like each other. And she said that on a couple of occasions, not just the last time but previously (0:15:04.6).</p>

<p>And so then part of this deal is that they don't like each other in a certain way and yet, you know, he banged her around a lot. Well, she probably liked it, yaddah, yaddah, yaddah, that kind of thing happened to her where she was - the role playing thing. And, you know, kind of sad in a way.</p>

<p>So, yeah, so I enjoyed that aspect of it, of being dominant. I think one of the problems with that was - with her was that I think what I really wanted from her was a sexual partner in a lot of ways. And I find that I just can't get through enough to achieve that (unintelligible) you know, basis it's all right. She's the kind of girl that I could get drunk on a Friday night, which I did last Friday night, and show up at her apartment. And then we'd drink some more, grapple around, smoke some dope and fall asleep is what it amounts to [ph], and then up the next day. Which I did Saturday, except I went home and started all over again with Bloody Marys at eight. And carried on until later on in tithe afternoon anyway (0:16:17.6).</p>

<p>So I guess if I'm sounding a little down that would probably the reason why I feel a little emotionally down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you feeling down about that brought that on? What were you feeling down about that you got drunk on Thursday night, Friday night?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Thursday night just sort of spontaneously happened. There's not much else to do. You know, as I said once before I like to drink alone. I like drinking alone a lot more than I like drinking with people because I can turn on the record player and I go (unintelligible) soliloquies to my window. And I'm virtually talking to myself. I don't know if I speak aloud. But all kinds of things going on in my head, rehashing old scenes and all that (0:17:10.0).</p>

<p>And I find I get some kind of gratification from that. It makes me feel like maybe in a certain way I really get back in touch with myself like that. You know, I don't know if getting back in touch with myself is what I mean exactly. But I don't know, I just feel like I come alive and let a lot of things sort of slide freer. You know, if I could - for example if I'm stiff when I'm thinking about something I could cry about it. Where, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel a real sense of, you know, the kinds of things that are normally bottled up and my feeling of rage can come out. Or they have recently where I just, you know, the hot emotional and hot tears aspect of things. Because I'm a very frustrated guy. And so, I mean that doesn't happen, I'm not sitting around shrieking at the guys all the time. But I mean this is the kind of things coming out [ph]. It's a relief (0:18:05.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about allowing yourself, your mind to do it without the liquor?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, you see that's - again the liquor is (unintelligible) for the crutch. I can't - don't seem to (unintelligible) otherwise. I do it when I'm stoned on pot too. But then again I have to be alone also (unintelligible). But so I suppose that's the reason for it. Because, it's - you know it's an old story. There's nothing new in it. One of the things I find more and more I think about these things myself is that my reactions to things are a lot more male than I had ever anticipated, a lot more commonplace. You know, once again because of childish (unintelligible) especially Byzantine (unintelligible) pretty straightforward (0:18:58.6).</p>

<p>I find that I'm dreaming a lot more now. I find that the kind of dreams I have pretty obvious connotations dealing with work and (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you ever want to bring any dream here that's something you can do too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That would be interesting eh? I don't know. Yeah, we'll do that if I can find something that seems to be particularly strong to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I don't want to do that (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: So - but anyway that was a good development, I suppose (unintelligible). I think that, you know, one of the things that I'd have to do - will do is to lower my sights maybe a little bit in terms of the kind of person I want to take out. Because Jane was very attractive even though she's screwy as hell as I said, she is very pretty. And there are a couple of other girls that are - lead a, what looks to be kind of a lonely life, they're pretty plain that I could sort of maybe rehabilitate myself with. And maybe she'll have a nice time in the process. But for one reason or another I've procrastinated on taking out these people (unintelligible) (0:20:34.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it hurt to think about doing that now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does it hurt to think about doing it? Taking them out you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's just sort of depressing. And, you know, the way it's - in a certain way it's like giving up. I mean everybody likes to go out with normally the best looking, most attractive to others too, person you could think of. And these would just be sort of plain Jane types. Not all (unintelligible) just - but I'm afraid the one is probably so interesting that she might be a little bit beyond my intent because she's a little bit of the - I don't know, it's not - you'd have to invent a new word. She's not a hippie, she's like a post hippie. She went through it all and saved some of the remnants of style that (unintelligible). She's a (unintelligible). But (0:21:28.4)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What if somebody doesn't want to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Willing to try. It's hard to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She sounds like a good woman to explore alternative lifestyles with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Right. There's got to be something better than getting drunk on Friday night. Just got to find it, especially in (unintelligible) because we're well, getting off of work and (unintelligible). So - yeah (0:21:55.9)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I'm seriously suggesting that don't you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just, you know, again it's a very childish thing, I'm just so afraid of going out with her and then feeling that this particular girl, and then feeling like she's made a decision, you know, I don't cut it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I know what you're going to say. It's obvious. I mean, it's just something that I have to, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That wasn't what I was going to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would be - I was curious, it sounds like you've got it very clearly set up in your mind of what would be a success and what would be a failure. Well, I definitely can almost guess what it is. I mean if she...</p>

<p>PATIENT: See it's hard for you too isn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. If she sees you as a very suave man about town...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's becoming less and less likely as time goes by (0:23:02.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well is that still what success means to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that still what success means to you? Is that what you want with a girl? Is that what you want her to see you as (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: With her I'd have to modify the kind of image that I'm projecting because that wouldn't turn her on. Well I'm just - what I really want to do is either find in myself or find in somebody else something that strikes a positive response. I really feel like sometimes...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like a great idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. That's what I really need to do, you know. But what I'm saying is that I'm afraid that I get very spooked, you know, because I get very nervous about it. It doesn't take very much to, you know, make me think that I blew it. Or (unintelligible) because I think I'm a great one for getting myself involved in situations where I do in fact (unintelligible). Because I don't know what I'm really all about and the conversation gets awkward. And it's a little difficult I think for sometimes for the other people to figure out where I'm coming from, you know. And then it's difficult for me to (unintelligible) (0:24:16.5).</p>

<p>So but essentially I suppose...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Essentially I suppose it's just one of those things where you have to take a shot at it. But as I say I like to pick my shots pretty carefully. I haven't been picking my shots recently except this hopelessly screwed up Italian dego broad. It's (unintelligible). But I don't - I think one of the positive things about all - at least about some of our conversations is I really feel like, you know, having talked about things and thought about ostensibly (unintelligible) that I think I am getting a little bit clearer idea of where I'm at. I don't think I can express it to you because some of it's very painful. And - but I think I might get to the point where I could accept the fact where for example maybe I'm not a real aggressive Chuck Percy [ph] type overachiever and not writhe with, you know, guilt of having perceived that and understanding it and saying well, what you're trying to tell me time and time again. This is a, yeah, okay, (unintelligible) overreact to the situation but, you know, that's me. And that may not be the most attractive part of my pitch to people but that's part of (unintelligible). So, you know, it might be that there's all those conversations when I can achieve something like that. At least I can fantasize that this is - and it'd be a very pleasing thing for me, you know (unintelligible) (0:26:12.0).</p>

<p>So that comes in it'd be terrific.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, to me and to a lot of women that I know, the most attractive guy is the guy who knows who he is and likes himself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. That's always the case. And I'm sure that's one of the reasons why I sent off negative vibrations. Because I (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And to me that seems like a different thing than what you before thought you had to (unintelligible). I mean the kind of (unintelligible) (0:26:54.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true. In many ways it's obvious to me for example, and I may have mentioned this to you before that socially in most situations I tend to for example (unintelligible) my brother (unintelligible) who has been successful at least superficially - well very successful, this is why it's interesting. Excellent, fantastic at it. And so my mannerisms many times (unintelligible) his, you know, in the most (unintelligible) people are kind of (unintelligible). But, you know, (unintelligible) like on the telephone, (unintelligible). He copied most of his from Jack Kennedy or so he thought. So (unintelligible) correlation to Jack Kennedy (chuckling). At least that's the effect.</p>

<p>But so, you know, those things would be the sacramental signs I suppose of the rise of the true Ted O'neil in a way. When I no longer (unintelligible) my brother's mannerisms (unintelligible) (0:27:55.2)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) Jack Kennedy (unintelligible) Jack Kennedy sounds a hell of a lot worse than...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) Jack Kennedy sounds incredibly boring in comparison to a real Ted O'neil.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's a sleazy (unintelligible). So and of course that's one of the things that Jane was always - reiterated and reiterated was that I was a phony. I think maybe she was chiefly disappointed that I was such a bad craftsman at it. She wouldn't have minded somebody that had a little technical expertise, make themself into a certain kind of person. But I just didn't, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it reminds me of (unintelligible) down and sharing lines with (unintelligible). And perhaps we can also be good at our lines (unintelligible) and comparing also, you know, if you get to recognize them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Third sentence out or a first sentence out or whatever.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what the pitch is going to be from there on in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And a lot of your (unintelligible) wasn't working (0:29:04.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I run with that type. It's funny thought I used to be - I used to have a lot more - maybe it's just because it's getting worse. I used to have a lot more success on that level than I do now. I was just thinking back, and it wasn't always that things were so dim on that (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course that was when the girls were younger too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, one. Two, it was a lot fresher on you then too as a - I mean you were more - you were more into it right? Now you kind of think well, I'll give a view of (unintelligible) ho hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sure is a whole new world awaiting there somewhere. But I think I'm just going through a particularly evil phase. I certainly hope so (0:29:58.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) talk about having come to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Through our conversations so that was (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I've come to see that as kind of a - I'm not there yet, you know, but I've come to see that as a plausible, you know, resolution where I don't think perhaps it seemed quite so plausible to me before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've just done a great job in my book of doing what I asked you to do last week about forming an alternate...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lifestyle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well under your skillful guidance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well yeah, but not really. Okay, okay I'll take that away then. But also I mean you've done it in a very genuine way. You started out in a very - going through the DOT [ph] definition of job title that our government has saying here's File Number 24, here's Number 24 (unintelligible) and then you went into a much more moving thing about what you might be. But there might be something that (unintelligible) (0:31:15.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well, good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would you like to do with the rest of your time? Anything particular in mind tonight?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'd like to address something. You can always tell there's an evil...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I was wondering if you would like to explore now a little bit more specific (unintelligible) an alternate style. Well let's - we could also call it setting some goals of what you would like to do very specifically (0:31:59.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm very bad at keeping those.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't care about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So just set them up. Hmmm. Well I don't know exactly how to respond to that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have any gut way to respond?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because - well the trouble with my gut level responses is, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I hear your gut level response please?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Again it comes down to just sort of elaborating with maybe a slightly leftist tinge, the kinds of thing I'm doing now. I really find it very difficult in any event to, beyond the level of the sheerest fantasy, to think about for example doing something different than what I'm doing now, you know, the work I do. And I have it really fixed in my head (0:33:11.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I didn't say you had to come up with a different job.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The only one that I can do and that I - just to speak of it for a moment because it gives me closure is to - for a different job what was interesting was being involved in television directing. It's really childish (unintelligible) do what they do. And I was watching (unintelligible) on a couple of occasions and I always am struck by what fun that would be when you have talented people. You'd probably get a little charge out of that too because in seeing what's going on when they're talking and just throwing the cameras on them on the revealing times. And interesting times, you really can create a dynamic, sitting there on one screen and like shifting around and showing different ways (0:34:01.4).</p>

<p>I've always thought being that kind of a person before, hell, I don't know really what they pay television directors. Afford a great lifestyle, like a movie director or something. You could get the best of all possible worlds. You could just have people paying immense amounts of money to do a creative thing and he gets an ego kick from it besides just the money, you know, you could really get to the bottom of something like that. Where, you know, being in the real estate business is not - you're just trying to cut deals.</p>

<p>And maybe the problem with the real estate business is I haven't cut a deal yet. And I'd respond to it, you know, as an emotionally satisfying thing if I had. To date all it represents is difficulty. But, so you know that's one thing that I could - that I would really like to do. And you would be associated with a different style of person then too that might reinforce, you know, certain tendency that I have now that are not brought from before because of my association with people (unintelligible) (0:35:07.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, getting more involved in (unintelligible) literary type of things, music and (unintelligible) that kind of stuff. Which I do in a very helter skelter way at this point. But that conception of myself pleases me. If I were to bring it, you know, to pass, being sort of in the kind of setting, you know, kind of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In that kind of setting, you know, the intelligentsia, certainly the newspaper guys and the TV guys, you know, everybody's pretty smart and doing something that they really enjoy. Newspaper would be interesting except not - to a certain kind it would be interesting (0:35:57.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What certain kind (unintelligible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Doing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See one of the main things - I don't want to hear just a job description, I want to hear how one of these would fit your emerging personality, okay? And you did that somewhat but do it (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think investigative reporting would be interesting, and political reporting. It would please my image of myself because I think I have a pretty good critical faculty, having honed it pretty well. And just getting into the inner workings of things and communicating it to other people would give me a kick. I really can't - I mean television directing is that kind of too. I sometimes get a feeling I would really like to excite other people with - if I could. And if I could gain a conception of how a certain thing is, could handle a reporter, or how a scene itself of television, and to communicate that and to see people respond to it would be a big, big chart. Because then I could think I'm really doing something worthwhile and getting something across to these people. And so that's what would be pleasing to me about those two kinds of jobs (0:37:21.7).</p>

<p>And I think the other things I was speaking of in terms of being with a kind of person, a kind of lifestyle isn't really that important. It'd just be sort of like a fringe benefit in the sense that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm getting lost. What are you trying to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm trying to foreswear the business about as I say being (unintelligible) as being gratifying because that seems a little too superficial to me. But what, again what would really be a kick out of it would be to do - and I get that feeling sometimes when I see (0:38:00.6)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To set up - to create some little vignette, whether it be in critical newspaper articles or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And to communicate it is the thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And to be able to see peoples' response (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And to feel that I, because of the way that I wrote it and the way that I reported it have been able to, you know, do that. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really knowing that your cause and producing something and seeing the effect of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and having a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And having some kind of completion of that communication...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're communicating to the world somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And having the world respond to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, having them be moved in the way that I am, you know, by the thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's exciting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be a large kick. And I've thought that on occasions when you see such and imminently good cause as, I saw a film on the last few days of Martin Luther King. Did you see it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-mmm (0:38:55.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: On Channel 11 (chuckling). You're suffering from tunnel vision (chuckling). No, I'm kidding.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's true, I'm suffering from tunnel vision.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I saw this...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm suffering from seeing Sesame Street twice a day with my one-year-old.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Knocking them down from tables.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe we better talk about your alternate lifestyle rather than mine (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Believe me I'm working on it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But anyway I saw this film on Martin Luther King and it was really, really well done. It would have been - and it was very moving. It really was because it filmed his last speech, the emotional climax of it was, I've been to the mountain. And if you haven't seen that speech, it's pretty good. If you ever do it's just dynamite. It's the most, you know, no one is - could see it and not get an enormous lump in their throat and think this man was just marvelous. It's a propaganda piece in a lot of ways. But it was - anyway I was thinking about what a charge that must have been for the guys that worked on it to get all that footage and then editing it, you know, and filming it and writing the narration. And it just struck me as an immensely worthwhile activity, you know (0:40:01.6).</p>

<p>Especially because in a certain way, you know, they showed it on Channel 11, it was a propaganda piece, you know. Because then again you're fashioning the thing to make a point and you're really editorializing a lot and so on and so forth. But you're trying to make a point and you're making (unintelligible). And they really succeeded I thought in that (unintelligible) to do that.</p>

<p>So those, I mean those - that's one or two or however many kind of alternate lifestyles. There are other satisfying things that I could do with my life as a real estate guy. You could, you know, I've said that one of the chief reasons I feel or one of the chief reasons I'm in the business if I ever get (unintelligible) is to - the opportunity for independence it affords. And, you know, independence to do what? Well, independence in a certain way to maybe get out of the game in a certain way, you know. Although I would like to - I would still like to stay in it (0:41:07.1).</p>

<p>But I guess - I don't know if that's really valid for me because maybe I'm just, you know, conjuring up a schoolboy's image of the housewife, the (unintelligible) house on the hill with the wife and the dog and the wife and, you know. Just it's too, I don't know, it just - it doesn't strike me right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It'd doesn't feel...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it doesn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alive to you? It seems like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't feel alive to me. Maybe because of the other did. But it seems to me that it's too patent and too in a way removed from reality. I mean, you start to think things like well I have interesting friends. Well what do you mean you have interesting friends? Most of your friends are probably the other real estate developers. And I mean, you know, those guys don't sound interesting. And, you know, you - and - but some people can do it. Some people can (0:42:04.3)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Some people can do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd love to do it. I'd love to - as I say...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would you love to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would love to be successful in this business just because it's something that I, you know, sort of committed to at this point. And then set myself apart from it and not live an entirely stereotyped life. The people who can do that are...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What am I saying?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Shoot, I (unintelligible) stopped at a point where I can't say it. Well I hear a hell of a lot of things there. I've heard an old bull grinding out that isn't very alive right now. You know, you didn't quite believe it and then you say, well I'm going to do it because I'm committed to it. Well it sounds like a past commitment that's coming through (0:43:03.7).</p>

<p>What I would like you to do is to see you make it new, make it real, make it yours. Is it really, you know, make it a real goal. Or realize that it's a dying goal and kill it. Or realize, take a good look at what's there, what is that goal you're, you know, is it one that's just kind of in the present because it wasn't - you set it up in the past and haven't bothered to end it? I think that the - it's more tied in than that. But, you know - and if you want that as a goal make it be attractive to you. Because it sure doesn't sound very attractive to you right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it isn't very attractive to me right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No wonder you have a hard time getting up for work in the morning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) I don't know if it's - if this is just a passing mood...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) (0:43:54.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I have because I touched on the other thing first which has all the attraction of being, you know, the grass is greener kind of thing (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or whether it really is sort of a past, you know, I really - I've felt at certain times that I'm really very (unintelligible) at what I'm doing and little enthusiasm for it but for some reason (unintelligible) month or so. You just kind of get ground up, you know, you're doing the thing all the time (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd like to hear you put some enthusiasm - look, I feel like I'm treading very close right now to making up your mind for you, making the decision for you. And I don't want to do that. What I want to do right now is offer you the option to make that a more exciting goal for you. If you want - you're in it right now, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm (0:44:55.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Can you make it exciting for yourself? Can you make it something (unintelligible) where you can produce something (unintelligible) create something and have an effect and that and really get some good enjoyment?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no, I think the - right now, they say for some reason that the business is not - the real estate business is (unintelligible) at this instant. What I'm saying is that, you know, maybe in a week I could - or two weeks or some other time it could all of a sudden come back alive to me. But right now it just isn't there. But I don't think that you, you know, you can't give up that easily.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not asking you to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no I know you're not. I understand that. And I - but I trust - what I'm trying to do is explain, you know, why I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Will continue to hold, you know, like in a holding pattern (unintelligible) with that particular thing. And recently - not just so recently either but I mean right now the other thing (unintelligible). And again I'm afraid to death because of, you know, a streak of the grass is greener and a certain amount of this childish daydream (0:46:16.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Aspects of what to think (unintelligible) apparently you should, you know, because they sit around, coffee spilled all over the desk and, you know, (unintelligible). So that (unintelligible) I might be able to rapture, or go on raptures about (unintelligible) real estate (unintelligible). Which they do in a way. I mean I don't understand why I'm not making a ton of money now. But so, you know, like I said it's just not a (unintelligible) (0:46:57.2).</p>

<p>I - in some way, you know, I don't think that I'm that maybe entirely self motivated to those things. I think my - I'm sure that my (unintelligible) life would be a lot different if I had a, you know, a partner or was in love with someone. Or had some other, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something (unintelligible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: yeah, something - maybe that kind of thing would be a lot stronger motivation for me in a certain way, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be in the real estate business and (unintelligible)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or to do something else. You know, again because a lot of the things I think about life and the most satisfying things of it are, come down to this business about I think they do (unintelligible) business about seeing other people respond, you know, seeing in some ways, especially the things I just talked about. But my ideas about politics are involved in that too (0:47:53.1).</p>

<p>And one of the things I - that spooks me most about myself is exactly in that area, you know, of how people respond to me. And I get very easily spooked and say, no more talking about that. Maybe taking on, you know, just not that strong where - what to someone else would be an interlude with no particular meaning would cause me enormous, you know, problems and all kinds of neurotic turning back in upon yourself and really going back through it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sounds a little bit like me. I can relate to that in terms of leaving (unintelligible) this year. That just about did me in, the thought of being out of school a year without working on a Ph.D. That just frosted [ph] me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, you know, as regards that feeling, maybe that kind of - I think that kind of a thing was just in a certain way unimaginable to me now, would be, you know, such a - would be a great kick now. You know, something else would (unintelligible) each other, and you really get something going (0:49:05.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then (unintelligible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that sounds great. But I'd like to throw a thorn in there too. And that is you're saying if I had this fantastic relationship where everything was going so great and we had our communication so clear and our lives so matched and we were so in love, you know, a lot of people are married and not in that happy situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's a lot of growing to do once you get into a relationship, as you want to marry or any other girl that you (unintelligible). There's a hell of a lot of work to making it that great too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I can understand. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's the plan then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In terms (unintelligible) what my ulterior motive for bringing that up was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well don't tell me about it because you'll blow the gig. Well, I don't know. That - for some reason as I say the real estate aspect of things just isn't real to me. But possible (unintelligible) that way (0:50:17.8).</p>

<p>You know, I - apart from all those things I think the most - and this, to touch on something that I touched on before, the real difficulty for me, you know, is - and the progress that's conceivably being made is that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're in therapy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Progress, you said progress.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was being made by me in terms of coming to deal with myself. You know, it will come, I suppose again it's as you said, when I just decide not to try and carry roles that are not at all suited for me. You know, like vis-�-vis last night with Mary or vis-�-vis today, we had a big luncheon today with some of our best clients. And a lot of the boys that worked on the account were (unintelligible). And I was just, you know, totally bored by the thing. And really made no pretense to being very much else but bored. And I thought to myself, you know, this isn't the proper way to act, and try to be jolly. But the conversation we were having at lunch was boring and there were people, it was a very low sort of mentality, you know. And they just don't make interesting conversation at all (0:52:00.5).</p>

<p>And it was - they talked about - they're really incredible. They talked about golf for a long time. I'm not a golfer. And the girlie shows up in Kenosha where they have all kinds of bizarre contests. They have (unintelligible) people with no clothes on at all and these really weird country fair stunts. And so they went on and on about this and especially this business about girls on vacation at lunch, you know, yukking it up. And it was just really a dull shot. I mean it was just really dull people. And there were little psychic pulls going on back and forth too because of my peculiar position there. I mean, you know, everyone knows without it just being said that I'm what they call a - what do they - swinger. That's a - they use that term, swinger. You know they got that out of Panorama Magazine, you know, just (0:52:55.3)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible) someone who can (unintelligible) more than one sexual affair. Usually people who...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah well they mean that and also just a near North Rush Street, you know, jumping, jiving stud. And they made repeated references to that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That made you feel bad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: yeah, it really did. But it made me just bored with them because they were dealing with - this whole thing was so overdone it was like well, we pegged him, he's the swinger, he's the golfer, he's the, you know. Sort of touched on those things and it was very mechanical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They didn't have to talk to you because they knew all about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, they knew what they wanted to know and they had their little sort of repartee that was appropriate for that kind of a person. Kind of go through the - and I just thought this is really an enormous bore. Maybe that's why I'm so (unintelligible) with this thing. But (unintelligible) people were uninteresting and turned me off (0:53:56.7).</p>

<p>And where - at the same time I thought well, you know, I'll try and get into this a little bit more and pick up on it and carry it through. Finally I just, I don't know, screw it. I just sort of, you know, ate my lunch in silence and smiled and let it go at that. And then again it was sort of analogous to the situation that happened with Jane last night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Certainly a drop away. But, you know, at least I always feel a little bit guilty in that I ought to be more aggressive and try and figure out a clever way to steer the conversation back to this particular deal. And ask them the right questions and just sort of manipulate this entire, you know, whoever I'm talking to, not the entire affair, that's something for a megalomaniac [ph]. But whoever I'm talking to and just be kind of very purposeful and get this thing done. So you have some sort of guilt feelings involved in that - not going on, you know, in you (0:54:53.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel guilty that you didn't use it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it's also an - and it was also an honest relief because they really were just very dull.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well (unintelligible) congratulations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) You blew a deal but you made a life. Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess we're done aren't we?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

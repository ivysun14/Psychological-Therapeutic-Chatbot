<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 2 </p>

<p>CLIENT: Start again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the way I see this is you can use this time to kind of sort out things. To talk about whatever you deem most helpful to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'll try to sort out. See when the thing is when I took the test it seemed easier because it was sort of a structured thing. I was able to organize my problems and my personality whereas like this is really not as easy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard because like problems and questions aren't laid out. [0:01:04.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well let's see. One of the problems is the same as it was last week. The thing is I suppose what I've been trying to do this week is trying to decide how I feel about myself. For half a day I'll feel fine and then the next few hours I don't feel so good. I think I could get over this problem I was telling you about last week if I could feel better about myself and feel worthwhile as a person. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's what's so hard is to keep feeling worthwhile.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You see the reason I can't do it is because I don't have anything to go by. I don't have any past experience. [0:02:13.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you mean by that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's see how do I feel? What do I mean by that? The fact that no man has ever liked me makes me doubt what I am and yet I've always heard that no one can like you if you don't like yourself. And yet I feel that if someone did like me it would be easier to have a positive attitude. [0:03:03.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like people have told you the way for other people to like you is for you to like you. But you're saying that's hard because I just can't start liking myself; nobody else ever has. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. I can't help thinking there must be some reason why my friendships with men never go beyond friendship. But I have no idea what it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There must be something but it's very unclear what that might be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I've gotten to the point where this weekend I just slept all weekend. I suppose that's the only way I can get away from it is to sleep. [0:04:06.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just feels like so much you just want to escape from it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's what it is. I suppose. I've always heard that people sleep to escape. You see the thing is in the initial stages of a relationship, like the last one I was telling you about, I keep going over and over what I said and what I did. And if I can convince myself that I didn't do anything wrong, then I feel that I'm ok. But I can't accept myself knowing if it is my fault then I can't accept that. I can't reconcile myself to the fact that I made these mistakes even though I can't do anything about them. [0:05:03.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't forgive yourself for it and it keeps bothering you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. Even though other people have observed this person is also insecure which I think is probably true. I think maybe I've idealized him too much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you think he's more perfect than he is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you're saying you go over and over in your mind what you did and if you're not satisfied with it you sort of say, "Why aren't you?" </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know when I say that I couldn't be that bad a personality because I have friends. If there was something terribly wrong I wouldn't have friendships. Well then I think maybe if I projected a positive attitude, which means confidence, I would have more presence and the qualities that I might have might be noticed more by a man or men friends. Or perhaps I shouldn't care. Maybe a nonchalant attitude would help. [0:06:43.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm trying to figure out what attitude you should project. Do I want to look self confident? Do I want to look like I don't care?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think maybe that sometimes they're the same thing. I don't know where I got a negative attitude in the first place. [0:07:11.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can't trace it. Can't imagine where that came from. </p>

<p>CLIENT: In these sessions, what do I do discover something through talking or what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hopefully you could. Why? It sounds like you're unsure just what to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean I have reasoned out everything so long and so much and yet I don't feel better. [0:08:07.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're reasoning somehow the way you reason doesn't seem to go anywhere. You think about it and think about it and you're sick of mulling it over. And yet it doesn't change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like one thing that happens, when you're talking, is that you spend a lot of time trying to convince yourself of certain things rather than trying to see how you even feel about them underneath. </p>

<p>CLIENT: How I feel about what? [0:08:58.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How you really feel about like spending a lot of time trying to convince yourself well I am ok. Am I or am I not? Rather than kind of looking at how it really (inaudible at 0:09:22.3) you are. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean what do I really think of myself? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. That's what I mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I never thought about it. I know how I want to think about myself and I know how I think I feel about myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you think you feel about yourself? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now that's a real hard question. I think that I have a lot of self hate. I'm certainly not treating myself very nicely. Ruining my life. I'm just ruining. Just wasting time being miserable. [0:10:31.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're treating yourself very badly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually what I'm trying to do is deal with somebody else's problems rather than my own. In other words I think that if I ask myself why isn't this man or than man attracted to me, I think I'm trying to deal with him. [0:11:01.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Rather than...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Rather than myself because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would dealing with yourself be like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think dealing with myself would be being the best person that I can be and developing assets I might have or trying to change my own faults. Living my own life. You know and not worrying about what someone else thinks. I think that's what I should do. I have to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you do do is be very effected by how other people feel about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some people. I'm affected by what some people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some certain people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: All people to a certain extent. Yet like a friend of mine told me the other night, "The trouble with you is that you try to be accepted by everyone, whether they have anything in common with you or not." I suppose that's true. It isn't that bad. [0:12:25.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's just very hard to separate yourself from how other people feel about you. You're very sensitive to that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I suppose. I don't know if that's so abnormal. I'm not sure that everyone isn't that way to a certain extent. [0:13:03.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you with yourself deceived that that's abnormal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I would say that my reaction, to the world, to the events that I told you last week abnormal. I think I overreacted. But other women they don't have any trouble attracting men. They must be projecting some kind of positive attitudes about themselves. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that must be the way you do it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No I do it. I don't know what the secret is. It's almost as if everybody is living a normal life and I'm just looking not knowing the secret. [0:14:00.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That sounds like very much like an outsider; on the edge. Can you stick with that? What's that like? </p>

<p>CLIENT: What is what like?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That feeling of being on the edge and looking in while everybody else knows the secret. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it just seems so normal. Everybody dates. Everybody gets married. Everybody has a companion. It just doesn't seem to be any problem for most people. That doesn't seem to be a problem for most people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And for you it seems like such a huge problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I thought maybe girls that started dating in their teens have a certain amount of experience. They feel accepted so maybe they feel more confident about themselves and therefore attract more people. [0:15:15.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe part of it is like you lack that background or experience to give you confidence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which sometimes I think is bad because I know a lot of women are upset if they're not dating anybody. So they have come to depend on that; on having a man to feel whole or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in that way you're freer than they are. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. I think so except I'm not sure of that. I think I can accept not having a date Saturday night where some other girls I know can't. [0:16:01.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's easier for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like the feeling of everybody else has a companion; it's so easy for them yet so difficult for me. Like that really hurts to be so different I guess you might say. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now for example this man that I told you about last week, if he comes in the cafeteria and he's talking to some other woman it just seems to be like he's on the make all the time. Now I don't know. A couple of people have told me that this doesn't seem to be true but maybe I don't know if I'm seeing things from a distorted point of view or not. But see that makes me feel that this other woman is more attractive and that's really ego damaging. Whether it's true or not. [0:17:28.8] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's damaging.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jealousy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it makes you feel very unattractive almost like angry or going back into a corner. I'm not quite sure what it does. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know either. I don't know that might be more complicated than I think. I feel jealous and I say well. Then I try to interact why does he prefer her to me? Then I say, "Well I wish I knew this woman." I would like to see what she has. What does she talk about?" Then I start belittling myself. I don't know. I just go through all sorts of thoughts. [0:18:26.5] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what kind of what happens is you get very jealous and you're jealousy leads you to really feel very badly about yourself. Like you don't measure up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Even though in some cases if I were being objective I would say I do. I would say I do measure up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On the surface you see but somehow down deep...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then when I can't think of anything else, then I think well she's more womanly. Something of the woman in here reaches the maleness in him. [0:19:12.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's something about me you're saying to yourself is not quite feminine really. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not mature enough. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not grown up much. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's I think right these days that this jealousy and I'm sure it's a fantasy. This is what makes me feel terribly neurotic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it makes you feel very neurotic because you know that it's a fantasy and yet...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It might be a fantasy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might be. You're not sure. But yet you can't get it away. You can't get it out of your head. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why it should be so important. Of course now I think that all of that is a symptom of what's been going on before. I don't think that's principally the problem. [0:20:13.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow it reflects...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It reflects what's been going on all my life. The way I've always felt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I suppose I don't accept myself. I suppose I don't. Maybe I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you have some kind of feeling that you don't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. I don't know if I like myself or not. I enjoy being alone. I enjoy my own company sometimes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You like to be with yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that if I were another person I think I would like me. I don't know. [0:21:06.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're the kind of person that you'd like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. It's hard to see yourself as others do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in another way you come out alright when you look at yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But maybe that's not true either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe that's not the whole story. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I might put people down sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then you're critical then and they might not like that. [0:22:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't worry too much about my friends because I imagine they wouldn't bother me if I were really distasteful. If they didn't like me. I've never thought of it in that way. I usually think of myself as a failure in relationship to men; not men as friends. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've never thought of it in what way? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I've only thought of myself in a negative way in relationship to men, not as people in general or men as friends. That's not a problem. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's only men as lovers. [0:23:00.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Then that's where nothing happens. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's where you're really (inaudible at 0:23:09.8). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh occasionally I'll worry about what a girlfriend thinks or some of my friends but it doesn't go too deeply. It doesn't become a tremendous problem. I'll think oh did I bore Justine yesterday or maybe I talked about this too much but it never becomes a major problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you worry a little bit. It just seems a really painful kind of thing is about the men. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't how to approach it. Whether I should dig for things in my personality that may not be right or ask a man what's wrong, which I feel foolish doing. I don't even think there's anyone I can ask. Or if I should learn to accept reality which is that I can't attract and live with that. [0:24:49.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to know which way to go whether...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to learn how to cope with it in some way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because where you are now is that it upsets you all the time. It's like being betwixt in between them. You can't really accept that they'll be that way and yet you don't know how to change it. [0:25:22.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Change what? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Change the way that men are attracted to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know what else I could do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you're saying its real discouraging trying and trying and always failing with men. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't even say that I try except being myself. [0:26:02.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except being myself? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well just being there. Being around like everybody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not like you put an effort?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I just told you of a couple of instances where I thought where someone was interested and I perhaps tried too hard then at that time. Or perhaps it doesn't matter. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it does matter. That's what part of it makes it so difficult. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Perhaps it shouldn't though because that's not all of life. [0:27:00.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe I should be able to look at that as just part of life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I'm sure if I can get over this last infatuation and if I can not get emotionally involved, I'm sure it will go easier. It might seem worse at the time because of the way I feel now and I just wish this would end. I just wish that I could forget about this person. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just wish you could put it out of your mind and get free of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now if I could get free of that and did not become emotionally involved, perhaps I could live with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you could have a kind of peace in you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Peace of mind as well. If I can't have anything else, then I'd like to have peace of mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't even have that now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But you know people say that I should get out more. But I've seen women who are successful who do no more than I do. Somebody will tell me, "Oh John called up and asked me out." Just people that we all know. Well I went over that before. It just seems so much easier for other people. [0:28:31.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. Do you sometimes resent how much easier it is for other people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like how can they have it so easy? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I suppose they look better in some way. I suppose they have problems. [0:29:07.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they don't seem as large as yours. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So I don't know how else to dig out my, to reveal to you. That's as much as I can think of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what coming through to me is that, I guess partly because you feel so discouraged about all this, but you're putting a lot of emphasis on how can I change and how should I feel. Kind of leaving out in some sense, how you do feel. Like passing over that a lot. [0:30:21.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: About what? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About a lot of things. About yourself I guess. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I'm passing over the way I do feel because I don't want to feel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you'd really not like to think about that. Not want to feel that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Should I think about how I feel about men? How they relate to me? How do I really feel about it? [0:31:00.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well when you say should my reaction is I feel I don't want to tell you anymore shoulds because I somehow feel like you've had enough of those the way you're talking. But I think that if you pass over the way you do feel, it's hard to really change until you really have a better understanding of how you do feel even though it may be unpleasant. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I wonder how I should go about that. Just go by instinct?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um. Well try it. I don't know what that means to you. [0:31:59.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I must feel badly about men's reactions to me or lack of reaction or I wouldn't </p>

<p>feel that I should feel that way. I must feel badly about it or should I say I think that's the way I feel about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Badly about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel disappointed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Disappointed that they aren't interested. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. I've always assumed I felt...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Always assumed what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I felt that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you don't know how you feel? Are you saying like assumed, I don't know quite what that means? [0:33:00.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I assumed that I feel badly about it because I feel bad. It's hard. Or maybe I think that I should be disappointed because society says that a woman should attract men. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You expect yourself to be disappointed or you should be. But you haven't really discovered or explored how you even do feel about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what? [0:34:00.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I feel ambivalent because the deformity that I have shows much more when I'm not dressed. And sometimes I'm afraid that if I became involved the person would discover how I really look and sometimes in that sense I think I feel... </p>

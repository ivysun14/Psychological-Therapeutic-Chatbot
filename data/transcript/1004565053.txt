<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where should we start today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So truthfully, there's something I've been wanting. I was like oh my God I can't wait for my session to talk about this was the dad coming to graduation thing came up again. So I had the conversation or fight with my mom, but then my brother calls me, my older brother, and he's like hey you should invite your dad, I feel weird going without telling him. And so I don't know there's more pressure. At first I was really frustrated. We got - I went through this and I went through all this trouble to not have to invite him and do all these things. But I don't know. I guess I started to feel sad before my brother had called me, not because he wasn't going to be there but I mean, I don't know. I mean I feel like it more a sadness because it was more sadness for something that couldn't really happen. Like I wish I could have a dad that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wanted to have that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And so I was sad about that but I don't know if I confused it with wanting him to come or something but, so I don't - they really want me to invite him and now I'm starting to feel really guilty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who's they?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My mom and my older brother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your mom still does too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yes, my mom - which I think is really great - was sort of well she still thinks that I should invite him but either way she's been clear that it's my decision. Which I find, even just if that came out of it then thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that's a big deal for her to be able to let you have your own valid opinion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yes. So it felt really nice to at least have that. And my older brother is definitely said that he thinks that it's my decision as well. So they both are sort of making it my call, which makes it A, very different, but at the same time it's still...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to disappoint them. [00:02:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yes. And so part of me feels like the better, to be the better person would be to invite my dad. But I'm just so tired of being the better person. You know, I feel like that's the route I've always taken and the better person forgives someone who treats her like crap, like a college relationship or something. So that's always sort of been a justification. But at the same time I think that even just because of the associated, my mom and my brother really want him to come, I would feel more guilty in not inviting him than more awkward having him be here. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you envision the day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean it was very different before this all came up. So I don't know. I was really sad. I told my brother. He was like well I already talked about this with my mom, with mom, and I don't - I sort of explained how I felt a little bit. But I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how the day's going to go. I guess it's just going to be a wait and see anyway. I mean there's all kinds of other stressors happening already. My friend, who is in Chicago, I invited to come to graduation and I was like hey you should come. But I thought that she would come and go back home on Friday or something but she's staying until Sunday. And so I'm like oh I want to spend time with my mom but I also want to spend time with my friend. So I'm already being split in a million ways. [00:04:02]</p>

<p>And there's all kinds of complications if my dad comes. If he actually comes to my house, he'll figure out that I live with boys, which is like oh my God, big issue for him. So it's just all this stuff happening at the same time and I don't know what to do. I've sort of been putting it off until I'm done with finals but that'll be today so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's time to make a decision.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, plus graduation's next week or two weeks from now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you extend the invitation what do you think dad would say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I have no idea honestly at this point. I tried to call him actually. He has 19 different phone numbers and I never know which one is right. And I called eight of them and he didn't pick up. But even just that was really terrifying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you planning on saying when you called?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey I'm graduating. I mean usually I don't really say much to my dad unless I'm really angry. So he usually would be oh do you want me to come? And then it would be something like well if you want to come, you know, because I don't know. But that's why [I'm afraid of him] (ph), to invite him to somewhere that he's not wanted - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a really hard choice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes and I know. Maybe the better person wouldn't invite him. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think rather than this being about being the better person, I think this is a chance for you to figure out what your person wants. It doesn't have to be about being better or worse. It's about figuring out what do you want and do you - and is that what you're going to act based upon? Are you going to do what you want to do or are you doing what somebody else wants you to do? [00:06:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can definitely see though, I remember it before at one point, I don't remember when, we were talking about how severing my relationship with my dad would have effects on other members of the family and that it would be â€” I had to figure out how to make that less problematic. I think, and I thought about that in terms of my brother feeling awkward and I don't really know what to do in that way either. So, I don't know. I tried to - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think that severing a relationship with your father will have effects on other parts, other members of your family. But you can't control their reaction to that. And I think that the piece that makes it manageable is when you find a way to be okay with how other people respond to it. And that might mean that, I mean in this case, your mom and your brother would be disappointed because it's their wish that you invite him and if you don't they'll be disappointed. You can't change that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So then would it be a matter of weighing what - because I do want to disappoint them less than I want my dad not to come, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So then that might be how you figure it out because knowing what you want to do doesn't mean that you always do that. Sometimes you do choose based on somebody else's feelings. I think when it becomes problematic is when we're too rigid in one direction or the other. If you can only do things that you want to do, well that's when we start to say that's kind of leaning towards or being selfish depending on how far to the extreme you are. If you are always doing what the other person wants to do and sacrificing your own wishes, well that's not healthy either. It's too far the other direction. So figuring out which decision is going to fall in which direction might be about well, I'll be uncomfortable if he's there, but I'll be more uncomfortable if they're disappointed in me. So maybe that is your choice or maybe that does help you make a choice in figuring out in which is less bad. [00:08:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I guess I was just worried that that - I don't want to be a pushover either, you know what I mean? I do want to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you ever make a choice that sits with other people being disappointed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ever? Yes. Probably. I mean I'm sure. I guess if someone's not disappointed in me a little bit, or at least in one situation I'm not doing something right. Actually yes, graduate school. My brother thinks it's a waste of time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it was important enough for you to do it anyway?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. Absolutely. And he was upset. So, yes I think in certain cases I'm definitely - it's interesting. I think in certain situations like I would never dream of - I would never consider not going to graduate school because my brother didn't approve or my dad, both my brothers and my dad did not approve. That was just well that sucks. But in other areas, it's the opposite.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. So what makes the balance, in this situation, what makes the mom and brother being disappointed that you don't invite him, what makes that stronger than the discomfort you would if he were here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I think that they would see it as being mean. Like my older brother was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't want to be seen as mean. [00:10:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I - I'm not mean. I think it would be, at least my mom would see it and I think this is more a cultural thing, I don't know but my mom would see it as instead of reacting gracefully to being slighted, it would be almost like doing the bad thing to someone else. You know what I mean, like instead of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she sees it, she would see not inviting him almost as retaliation type of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You hurt me so I'm going to hurt you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well to him, yes, and she doesn't want me to be like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it feel like to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't - I think I - I don't know. It's probably a little bit of both. I think that I am angry at him and I don't want him to be here. But I mean I'm not doing it intentionally in that way, you know what I mean, like I don't think that I'm intending it to be mean but I know that asking or not inviting him will be seen that way. That's definitely a mean thing to do, at least in the context of my family. So it's almost like a well so what, I guess, but not motivated by some desire to be, I don't know. Yes, I don't know. [00:12:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds more like it an avoidance of feeling angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Definitely....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not so much trying to hurt him but trying to avoid triggering that anger that you are anticipating would come up if you were here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the cost of being mean to him, yes. So I do feel, I guess I feel a little bit selfish. I definitely feel selfish by not wanting to invite him because I mean as much as I talk negatively about my dad I know that he really wants to have a relationship with me. And so it makes me sort of feel like I'm the bad guy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you don't want one with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Usually it's the other way around and I'm good with that sort of identification but the other way around is not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it's hard to be the one excluding or prohibiting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. Yes. I don't know that my mom would approve either. But I mean I definitely mentioned to her well if I ever get married I don't know that I want him there. I would much rather have my uncle walk me down the aisle. So, I don't know. I just don't want this to be a pattern. Maybe I'm putting too much emphasis...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want me folding to having to invite him to major life events be a pattern. But I also don't want to make a bigger deal out of something - I mean it's just a graduation so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much does graduation mean to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's important. It's - yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's not just a graduation. It's something important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, yes. In the context of greater life events I guess it's easy to well okay I'm graduating from a degree program but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it mark it as - I mean because this would be the first time that you didn't invite him to something. So I'm wondering if it feels too important to set that precedent rather - and are you worried about setting a precedent where you to use your words fold? But in the other - looking at it the other way, is it important to use this as a, to mark it as an experience or an event where you set the precedent that he doesn't come to these life events like graduation, marriage? [00:14:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I don't know. I guess I'll just have to think about it but I don't really have that much sympathy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have a lot - you don't have a lot of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I mean I think that I - I think that I'm just sort of going to invite him because they want me to but I think that I've made it clear that this is not something that I want...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something that you're not choosing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I definitely made that clear. So maybe that's a good enough step for now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what, as you say that, what feelings come up as you say I think I'm going to invite him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm really dreading that phone conversation. I haven't spoke to him since September. I'm really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a really long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I'm really not excited about calling him. Especially because something about me calling him, it just makes it feel like I don't know, I feel like I'm lying. I don't know. Maybe he won't even come after all. He's really unpredictable so that's part of the other problem is I'm inviting that unpredictability. So I have no idea. It's totally out of my control. I have no idea what he's doing. Yes, I don't know. Maybe it doesn't feel great but I don't know. I feel so conflicted now that I don't know, maybe err on the side of not making it permanent. So I've just been making it clear that that's kind of where I'm at. [00:16:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, as you noted having both your mom and your brother be able to say well this is what we want but we respect that and understand it's not what you want, that's a big change from these kinds of conversations and comments in the past. I wonder what made that reaction possible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I don't know. I think that at least with my mom and my mom said something to my brother because they talk or whatever, I made an effort because I don't know if I told you about this. After therapy one day I was like well I'm going to tell her how I feel. And my problem is that when I tell her how I feel about my dad it hurts her feelings and so I feel bad telling her but I don't know. It doesn't feel bad to me to say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're separate people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I don't know that - like my mom had such a great relationship with her dad that she always feels...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well she wishes that you did too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so whenever...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's upsetting to her that you don't have that relationship with your dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So when I express emotions like I don't think my dad is my family or he didn't really raise me, it's really hurtful to her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, it's not what she envisioned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I tried and maybe - I definitely - I told her a lot of how I felt and I think that that may have helped her understand where I'm coming from, which is new.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a new skill and it changed how she responded.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. For my brother I asked him for his advice actually. I said what would you do and he actually was like well considering all the problems that you've had with dad - which I felt... [00:18:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He acknowledged that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, which was big.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. A lot. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sit with it a little bit and see. It's clearly really important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was really meaningful for me to have that sort of acknowledgement. I'm also not sleeping this week so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that means a little bit closer to the surface but that's okay. Doesn't make it not real.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you're sleep deprived and all your energy's going elsewhere you're a little bit less defended.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's true. Yes, I don't know. And it's been weird because I remember I was telling you how phone conversations with my mom were sometimes awkward. And now my mom and I talk at least for the past few weeks we've been talking for, I don't know, like an hour or two on the phone. And this is really stupid and I feel like a baby but I started to make her sing to me or tell me a poem that she used to tell me when I was little before we hang up, which is so corny. [00:20:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's very sweet. What is it that made you want that again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think it started because I got sick or I hit my foot or something, I don't - I felt sick and I was like mom I feel sick, almost like I'm sort of half-kidding...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but it would also be nice to be able to have [inaudible at 00:20:48] again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, like come in and rub my back or whatever. And I mean sort of every time after that I was like well you want to sing to me again? And every time she does I get really choked up. I don't know why. It's really [inaudible at 00:21:05].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it mean to you, the song or the poem?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think it's - I don't know. It's sort of like a memory of the past but also it's almost like I can feel, it's almost like I can feel - I don't know. Like I feel very connected to her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you remember what it felt like to be a little girl and have her sing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. Even just I had my wisdom teeth out - I think this is when it all started as an adult. I had my wisdom teeth out and they were kind of complicated and so they knocked me out with an IV or whatever. And so when I was coming to I was, have you ever seen that video of that kid, what is it? Daniel Goes to the Dentist or whatever? That's basically what I was like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The little boy in the backseat. Adorable. [00:22:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. Is this real life? And so that's pretty much what I was doing in the car on the ride home. But I remember it and at one point I was making noises and my mom was like what are you doing and I was like oh I'm singing. And then I was like hey mom tell me that poem. She was like what? I can't believe you remember that. So she told me the poem and I was like tell it to me again. And so just - but I remember that being I don't know very comforting or - usually so [inaudible] that I pick it up when I'm really high or something but I don't know. But ever since then - and my mom really likes poetry so she's always been, she's always memorized poetry and always recited it to us in Spanish as I don't know because she thinks it's beautiful. I mean it is but, yes, I don't know. I feel like it's wrong but I feel comforted by her singing to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would that be wrong?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I feel like that's a three-year-old thing to want. But I get really seriously choked up. I can only ask her to do it at the end of the phone conversation. I'm like all right, talk to you later, bye. So, yes, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting the sort of connotations that you put on it and while yes, I think the idea of a parent singing to a child or reciting poetry to a child is very often associated with childhood but the purpose behind that, the why parents do that, is to soothe. I think whether it's soothing from your being hurt or helping a child soothe themselves to sleep, the purpose is to soothe someone that you love. And that's what you're asking for. You're asking for some sort of soothing, which is not a childish wish at all; that's a human wish to be soothed. And that particularly interaction is soothing for you because you connected to that time when she could do that, when she could make boo boos better and she could make, she could help you sort of end the day and relax into blissful sleep. [00:24:47]</p>

<p>And so it's that connection and this is how you get that feeling. And I don't think there's anything wrong with you wanting someone who you love and you're close to, your mom - she'll always be your mom no matter how grown up you are - and the fact that she can do that for you. And being able to hold onto this special ritual and connect to something that's very meaningful to her and the recitation of the poetry, that's something - you clearly have a very distinct memory of your mom being loving poetry and wanting to share the love of the language with you - being able to hear Spanish in a beautiful way when you don't hear, that's not the language that you're hearing most often any more. I think there's so many things that help you connect to a different time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She also used to recite poetry with my dad frequently. They would find - there's a lot of two-part poems, it's like a thing in Spanish poetry, and they would do this back and forth, either just at Christmas or something like that. So I remember that as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like a beautiful connection to me. To let yourself have that without feeling, without needing to feel guilty for it. But clearly she's happy to have this ritual with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, well, yes. I don't know why it's so awkward. Wish I didn't cry every time I heard her do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe there's nothing wrong with the tears. Maybe it's - maybe you can cry and have that be okay. It touches you deeply. [00:26:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I don't know. It's interesting that I feel like four years ago this would been ridiculous; I would've been like what? You're doing what? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And now you're a little bit more open to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes I don't know. And I have been doing it before I go to sleep too, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very fitting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm pretty sure my clock is wrong so I'm just going to check the actual time because I noticed when you sat down it said 12:30 which can affect your [inaudible at 00:27:29]. So I want to make sure of our time and mine. It's actually 1:16 so we have 5 minutes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So, oh I guess briefly to update you on the house situation, I don't exactly remember where we left off but Phil and I are actually really good friends now again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is not where we left off. How did that happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he, I don't know if I told you but he basically told us I'm moving out in three week. Good thanks bye. [00:28:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, yes. So I knew that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At that point you were pretty relieved that it was only a short time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then - so we found a replacement who was someone I went to college with but then a few weeks later he was like my - I can't move in with my girlfriend any more. I would love to request that you guys consider keeping me for another year. And so we had a house meeting and it was super awkward, I mean it was really awkward. We all five of us sat down together and we asked Phil questions and then he left and we discussed whether or not we wanted to live with him for another year. And it was difficult because we concluded that we did not want to live with him for another year and that we wanted to continue with the plan to invite the new roommate.</p>

<p>And actually I thought it was really wonderful that I asked him a question, when we were talking to Phil, I asked him I said when you told us that you were moving out before I felt like you were moving out more than you were moving in with Josie, his girlfriend. And I was just wondering how that has changed and whatever. But I was - I thought back on it later and I was like I can't believe I actually asked that question and didn't feel super awkward about it. And so I was really excited that I could do that. I was definitely - it felt really big for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a very honest question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and I didn't mean it in an offensive way. I really wanted to know sort of it was over questioned (ph). And so any way, after that I don't know what happened but he just started being really nice and then we - I started being really nice back to him. And then we throw a surprise party for his birthday and we're still, we're good friends now again, which is strange. [00:30:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm so glad for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it's - I'm really surprised actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were able to let go of a lot of your anger, which is something that you've always been a little bit afraid of, not feeling yet in control over when you were angry and when you weren't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. It was interesting that after - I mean I don't know if it's him or everything or whatever but I was surprised that after I said all those things to him that we were still able to be friends. And he said a lot of hurtful things to me too and both ways we hurt each other very much. And so, I don't know, it was very, it was just very surprising. Definitely not in the pattern - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Interesting information to file away that things don't always happen the way that you expect. Leaving open the possibility that things can develop differently. Gives you so many more options about what might happen over the course of the relationship. You didn't have to write him off. Turned out that actually you could be really angry with him, have him feel pretty angry at you too, and that you were able to let that go and move on to a different phase of your relationship. It didn't get cut off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I actually feel like I'm more able to communicate with him. I feel like if something came up I would feel comfortable saying hey, let's talk about this, which is also new.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, because in some way it worked. It didn't work right away; it didn't work on the first try. But if you're able now you're able to relate to one another and like each other again, it worked eventually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well a lot has happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it's been - I think finals week and all this difficulty scheduling. But yes. I keep remembering oh I have to tell her that, I have to tell her that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's been a while, I think it's been a lot longer, almost a month.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well, okay. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So our time - at least three weeks since we scheduled our last session. That's a pretty hectic time of year, so much coming up so. So why don't we wrap up there today. We're scheduled for Tuesday the 29th in the afternoon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I have, I brought my checkbook today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so you owe for two.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so I've been feeling very bad about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I knew I would see you again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [00:32:57]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>THERAPIST: Client 0222-115, interview number 8, February 11, 1971. 

</p><p>Touch and go every time. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, always looks like my school gets a head start on the other one.

</p><p>THERAPIST: I think we're on the, I don't know if it's called those (inaudible at 0:27) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh wow. 

</p><p>Still just waiting. I figured that today or tomorrow at which for sure Jessica should have gotten the letter, which means it'll likely be another four days at the soonest before I hear from her and possibly never. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You mean that possibility has sort of occurred to you from time to time. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I expect it will either settle itself over it or well it'll settle itself over it very easily. Come out one way or the other. I've almost, my vocabulary fails me, but I'm almost ready to accept either way as long as it doesn't take, you know, another umpteen weeks to find which way it's going to go. (2:11)

</p><p>THERAPIST: That's like right now the main air tender for things that's upsetting is the uncertainty. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'd just like to get it over with right now and so I can at least get that much behind me and go on. I suppose if we were to break up I wouldn't be too happy about it, but in charge.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like, this, is really, there's something about a hard fact, which, like, that would be very painful, but it's something okay then know what you have to deal with.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like do something about it. You can't do anything then you're (inaudible at 2:52) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I really enjoy my job though. Every day is getting just a little bit better. People there are really nice. I'm still a little uptight about my hair. I'd like to get a hair cut. It's going to be three weeks before I can afford it. So, I hope (inaudible at 3:14) until then. 

</p><p>It's kind of strange, yesterday evening I came home and didn't have anything to do. And I was awful hungry and the cook had gotten sick at lunch and gone home so we didn't have any lunch or any dinner and that kind of bummed me out. But I figured I still had the entire evening to just sit around and rap and this means that we could do whatever I wanted. And I found out that everybody disappeared but me. Damn near everybody and I kind of expected that to bum me out, but I just sat around and listened to music without rapping and kind of enjoyed the evening anyway. I don't know whether it's a calm in the midst of the storm or what. The last couple of days have been considerably easier. Not enjoyable at all, but at least not very painful. I have gotten six hours sleep last couple of nights. I felt in the last five days I think I totaled it up to 17 hours or something like that. (4:41)

</p><p>THERAPIST: I know. That's really, I know people who can get up in the night if they can't sleep and they go down and work or they read. Sometimes I'll get up and move the sometimes it's just there's nothing on late at night to get to sleep. Lay down hard. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I hope this weather holds. If for just one week we had decent weather so that I could get my motorcycle helmet, get it cleaned up and go riding. I have a feeling that that would be enough to interest me that I just wouldn't give a shit what happens as long as I could go out and ride my motorcycle. Dismal weather keeping me pinned up at home hasn't helped much, but neither has being broke. I'm sure I'd be out around other (inaudible at 5:55) (5:55)

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's like a sets, but each has its own niche. Kind of, it sounds like a questioning to keep you in a rut. 

</p><p>Well, at first it's not though. It's not just a rut. It's not just a matter of being bored or something. It's a matter having no way of getting out of something that's pretty painful. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's it. It's, I wouldn't mind a rut as long as it, you know, the rut is where I was headed anyway. 

</p><p>I've been considering calling Jessica sometime this weekend. Since I'll know she's had the letter by then. But that's another case of I don't know whether that's the route that I started out on or that I should do that or not. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Did you mean call if it was something in waiting to see if, see how she would respond to take initiative in responding to the letter. (8:02)

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>THERAPIST: If you call she's going to react to you and you will get an answer, but it will be a reaction to you're asking. Is that what you're...

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, the letter, as usual, isn't exactly what I wanted to say, but it, what I had to say was pretty punctual. I was pissed off because she didn't write and I think it was pretty clear in the letter. And if I should call I'm not sure, but what I'd probably mix up several other things into it and I'd just like to get a response to what I started out with in mind. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I see. Like that letter has one very clear thing in it that you have very clear feelings about and that's what you want to hear. Not get into anything else right now. Okay, I see that. What strikes me is I hear you say that is that's all very clear and yet the waiting it doesn't have any limits to it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, it undoubtedly has a limit, but...

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh sure.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean, like, I know it's not going to be more than four days. If I don't get a letter from her within the next six days why then I'll just call her and take my own end, which would be pretty obvious at that point. But no, I know that one in six days this will have cured itself. Cured, I'm not sure that's the right term. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like, I've got an interview right now. Taking a breather for a little bit? (10:10)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I suppose. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You want to give us a little bit and then maybe what you'd call fun, but it made you laugh. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, at least maybe I can recuperate. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was thinking of it myself kind of as like the night I was here last Tuesday when I got so upset. It was kind of like running into the bBob wall and I kind of stepped back a second to decide how to approach it a different way without just running into it again. 

</p><p>I still can't seem to manage to get to bed at 10:00, although I'm tired. Christ, I sleep during my lunch break at work, but that's only a ten minute nap, maybe 15. It seems that irregardless of how tired I am my habits are just such that I have things that I fool around with even though they're meaningless and I'd just as well skip them. I do them out of such an ingrained habit. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: That sounds typical. Like, do you want to go to bed at 10:00? Is that like a goal you have or is it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I'd like to. It's just that if I go to bed I'll hear somebody moving around upstairs or I'll go downstairs and I'll think, Christ, it's only 10:00. And although I'm tired I'll sit down and try and type a letter before I go to bed or something like that. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: So, it's sort of like as soon as you know what time it is, it turns out that nobody can go to, nobody goes to bed that early or something like, does it? (12:02)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. It's kind of like after dinner I'm just used to doing a certain amount of stuff. Not certain things, but I just do a certain times worth of just screwing off and until I feel like I've done that kind of until I've run out of things to do. I'm still looking around for what to mess around with next. But I think it'll cure itself. Next week I'll be able to start on an evener keel. I plan on resting up over the weekend. And by then I should have been able to shift over a little better to the new hours. 

</p><p>Breather, yeah, that's pretty good. (12:52)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Are you cold? (15:45) 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 15:51) She seems not concentrated in this office only. It's from the building next door. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I wonder why they didn't, you're not at the end of this wing. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I know. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Somehow or another they must have managed to slop it in a vent somewhere. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yes, very odd things happen with the ventilating part. There's an incinerator down in the basement and sometimes you just think you're smelling something burning in the ventilation. It sounds crazy.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's on fire. Give you a sense of...

</p><p>THERAPIST: Literally. I think I might know. It makes me very angry as a matter of fact. 

</p><p>PATIENT: In a few months if this job looks stationary enough I've considered moving knee deep into the rural areas although it's all labor, red-neck working class. I think, if I could manage to find an area where I'd work with just people and families I think I could enjoy that. The weird, weird social system that seems to not work or not exist here in Central Park I've just never gotten used to. The only way you ever get to know somebody around here is if you're forced to be around them. And I'm just not used to that. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: So, it sounds like there's need for what you'd call a social contact. (17:55)

</p><p>PATIENT: No, that's what strikes me that this, is kind of an asocial area, which is good for some people because that way people leave them alone, but I can be left alone easily enough by going into my own house or something like that then I'd like have people I know as friends or neighbors or something like that.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, a flaget (ph). You'd like to live in a place where you might go to the grocery store and get into a conversation with someone. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, just middle class, chivalry America inspires me to a point. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. 

</p><p>I often feel there is one here because I observed some ladies in the car talking to each other as their neighbors, but there's something that I remember that I never see. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, those people that live out near the shore that have been around the Central Park area for 30 years, yeah, they probably know each other, but most of the people around here are very transient because of the school and those that are here for three or four years know the ones that they've lived with or were very much in contact with in classes and other than that you kind of just drift on through.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know why. For the last few, no, maybe a week and a half now I've had a growing sense of fear from Matt. I mean, me fearing him. And I was speaking with Jack Larkin about it and he said that he had the same feeling as did many people in the house. And Matt is actually quite dangerous. I guess Matt is in one way or another made it obvious or known to people that or he even mentioned to me at one time that he was considering quite seriously killing someone. The kid that he was with out in the Mountains. We were camping and... (20:23)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Something chilling about...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and he just, he's quite psychopathic or whatever. He doesn't, he seems to be at a point where at one point or another he's going to flip out and either he'll kill someone or himself, but life just doesn't really mean anything real to him anymore. So, he's not concerned about it at all anyway. And sometimes he can make a point to communicate, but there for a couple of days in a row I talked with him and although I stood there or he ran his head I'd been able to understand and they were extremely cryptic conversations that weren't able to get much out of. 

</p><p>But normally Matt has a point of being just as obnoxious as possible. Eating dinner he'll eat a piece of meat and throw the bone on the table or on the floor. And you tell him, you ask him nice said "Why in the hell would you do that?" He says "It's none of your damned business." Later he picked them up, but of course in the meantime we've got bones laying around on the table or there's grease around or something like that. 

</p><p>He used to talk of doing things like that. He knew a girl that he, I don't know whether it was an admiration or just a curiosity, but this girl would enjoy doing weird things just to watch it creep people out and he talked of it quite a few times. It seemed to have made quite an impression on him. And I almost wonder if that isn't his point. Only now he has no point in worrying about shocking them to any degree that he wants or he's completely free to do as he wants and watch for reaction. (22:24)

</p><p>THERAPIST: That sounds, like, you're almost saying "Oh, he's throwing bones on the table or wouldn't maybe different to Matt pulling out a gun and letting someone have it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know if he's to that point yet, but I'm sure that if he got angry he'd be quite capable of violence. I never thought it before. In fact I noticed that that never before I'd ever considered the fact that Matt's probably 6'2" and weighs 190 pounds. But it's extremely obvious and makes quite an impression on me now. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Just put it into the only thing I can think of is chilling, Yet somehow, you know, you've thought About Matt (inaudible at 23:47) and the summary at least what gets conveyed to me is you tell me about this, is like I feel this kind of chill inside like. (23:58)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's kind of like there's no way you could possibly reason with that. If a Black man were to walk up to me and call me a Whitey and pull a gun on me. I mean that'd scare the hell out of me, of course, but I mean, it'd make some kind of relative sense. But Matt there's no way to grasp what might cause it, how I should behave to avoid it or anything like that. I have no idea of where I'm treading when I'm around him. Maybe just being there to do it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's not just something necessarily unpredictable since he's operating on some set of let's call assumptions. It's all different. Like you know a little bit about what makes him feel now. Maybe not with that particular one though, but enough to know there's some pretty mad Blacks around. I meant angry, not crazy. It's a like it's an understandable event or an event he could get a hold of that Matt might you want to ask why. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And they have another friend from Boise coming up. I don't know if I mentioned that to you. Some guy that had a mental collapse, a nervous collapse. He got awful fucking depressed a year and a half ago. Culminated in kind of a half assed attempt at suicide that turned out to be kind of fun in the end, but...(25:57)

</p><p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry this, is you or him?

</p><p>PATIENT: Me. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I was living with him in a time and we were both in pretty much the same shape. We'd sit around and at each other all day. Wouldn't even talk just sat there and looked miserable. And I got very, very fed up with him as I don't doubt he probably did me, but also got fed up with him because he was running around with a character that I just could not stand. And since then he has broken, he doesn't have any ties with this guy anymore. He finally told the guy to go get fucked. 

</p><p>He's kind of like he was two or three years ago when I first met him and he and I were quite good friends then. Only he's still so screwed up about women. He doesn't know where he's going. He's got a kid by some other guy's wife. He doesn't know it for sure, but he's evidently getting suspicious now because he's starting to threaten her and the kid both. And although Chris is still a wreck he doesn't seem to be destructive to himself anymore. He's at least active and has a little understanding of what's going on although I can't agree maybe with what he's doing at least anathema to it. And he is doing something instead of just sitting there feeling sorry for himself, which he used to do. So did I, but he wrote me the other night or other day and asked me to if I could possibly get him a job he was in desperate need of it. So, I wrote him back and told him that although my political clout is probably pretty well wasted right now from getting me a job and from getting Josh a job. He can come up and stay with me and look around if he like. We could do what we want to. I don't know what his reply is. I'll plan on calling him Wednesday, Thursday. I'm supposed to call him on Saturday. See what he thinks of the whole thing. (28:06)

</p><p>When I first moved up here had plans with maybe four other people possibly coming up with me. And if things progress then the hopes and dreams have degenerated and evolved to a more sensible realm of away from the fantasies of being, coming up here and everything turning out so wonderful. I kind of gave up hope and Josh coming up here was just kind of a fluke. He came up here and we're going to get ripped up and have some fun Christmas. He ended up two weeks later we got straighten enough for him to start work. So, I didn't really think too much about it, but when I started realizing that Chris was very likely to come up and I know that Josh is intending for a friend of his Jerry Daniels to come up and I've made mention to another friend of mine Bob McDonough to come up. It suddenly dawned on me that in a completely unimagined way what we had hoped for before was kind of coming off. 

</p><p>When I lived in Boise all the people that I lived with it was nearly a farm. I sometimes refer to it as that. I crashed in on some people. I went in their apartment. Another guy crashed with us and the four of us, two of them were actually living there, the other guy and I were just crashing there. We all became permanent residents and there was to be found anywhere from four to ten people living there. So, we began to call ourselves The Group. That was true, a lot of the kids didn't, they had more of, it was more of a family atmosphere there than in probably was in their homes. And we really had a great time. Everybody seemed to have their shit together real well. (30:06)

</p><p>Shortly after I left, the whole thing kind of fell apart. I guess it had just been together long enough that the, whatever factors that caused it finally came to the top. We were hoping that those people would reorganize back up here and maybe we could find out what it was that caused this to, or caused them to fall apart there and get it straightened out up here. 

</p><p>Caine gave up on it and now the people that are coming up are just a random sampling not from just that select group, but from people at all different stages of life, you know. Like Chris and I were together when it was still fun because I was a minor to go out and get into a bar when I was underage and get drunk. That's when he and I were together. Josh is here because he and I have been together since, at that time two, and also Josh and I started doing dope together. Bob is a guy that I met in The Group. He's always been one of them that we were planning on coming up and he's also the guy that was one of the few guys that was in my wedding. Jerry Daniels is a friend of Josh's that I don't know where he even came from, but just completely different people. Some of them I didn't even know when we first had the ideas of people coming up. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Ryan, pardon me. I have the impression sometimes of you kind of dropping a bomb and then moving on. Did you just say in your wedding? 

</p><p>PATIENT: A bomb. Yeah. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean it's starting to make sense there are facts that I don't know and it leaves me having the courage to ask. (31:53)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, wow. I hadn't even thought about that. Yeah, it was, oh God. The kind of thing I don't mind talking about it. It's just so hard to explain because I hate the terminology. I'll say it as I usually do. It's a hippie wedding, but I just hate that term so bad that I can't see straight. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: And it was Jessica?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay, I understand.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, that was last February 7th and then (inaudible at 32:22)

</p><p>THERAPIST: I'll bet.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's kind of strange too. I don't really know what to think of Jessica and I think we should break up. It would be a relief because before I started going with Jessica, before the girl broke up with me that I had been going with for five years before Jessica. That's about a year and a half ago when I was living with Chris. But she and I have been carrying on a sex life that was really I doubt it. I'm sure she did. But since then I've been just as chaste as I hate to admit and it's just miserable. I hate it. I have the feeling if Jessica and I were to break up I'd at least be relieved of that, but also I'd also be without a relationship that I could possibly lean back on. I'm not sure which one I would want more, but up to this point of course has been the relationship.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Sounds like something just broke suddenly very weird. (34:01)

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just drop a bomb and move on. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well, in the past I'm unlikely to react. (Overlapping)

</p><p>PATIENT: It did strike me a little bit at the time that I wonder if she's into that because I remember where I come from, but that's happened a couple of times that I've said something like that and then it came to light that I hadn't already told you about it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's funny too because I don't see myself as having a great need to know all these facts about people. You know, usually I don't care if they don't want to, you know, I don't care about people's histories and that kind of stuff. If there's more, again it's a sense of you talk about these things very, you know, sort of an easy, familiar fashion and I realize well geez I don't know about it and it tells, like, that just kind of stuck out for me like wedding, who? And of course it's not very much of a bomb. It makes perfect sense. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That, I've noticed that myself over the last year and a half, two years that not that you'd call it more familiar. The way I got to where I am now I seem to have taken more note of than any people I know. I mean, I can look back at an instance that happened a year and a half ago and I can see kind of what came from it. And I do that continually. For I don't notice that many other people do that quite the way I do. Someone, Jack Larkin, well I don't think you know him. At any rate he made a comment once that usually when I talk about something I do it talking about me in reference to what I'm talking about. I systematize it, set it out according to what I, my past history is in reference to what's happened to me or in reference to what I want it to mean. So, that it kind of shines back at me and I can look at it and see what it means. (36:12)

</p><p>THERAPIST: You use yourself as a reference. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm continually putting things away, systematizing them and stacking them back. I never quite thought of it that way before, but it just struck true to me. Matt did that once. Said something about me that just really came home and then like I'd been almost kind of aware of it myself and when he said it, it was like he had known me just a little bit better than I had on that subject or at that time. I'm not exactly sure what it was that he said. 

</p><p>It was the night that one of his all problems at the time seemed to stem from. We're all stoned on acid and he said something about you seem to say things so that people, I can't remember quite what it was what he said and I'm not sure quite what it, well quite in which way he meant it. I mean, I knew which way he meant, but I'm not quite sure what it was that he said. Let me put it that way. Something to the effect that people would either excuse me for what I was doing or what I am or that they would feel sorry for me or something like that. At any rate. (38:01)

</p><p>THERAPIST: That doesn't make one bit of sense to me. Does it make any sense to you? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Kind of. It's like I can't quite put my mind in a position or well it was what had led up to it during the entirety of his trip. I can't really remember it because I was so stoned. We had done nitrous oxide and Matt was just so screwed up. Some of the guys didn't even remember what happened several hours. You kind of knew what was happening at that second. You didn't remember how you got there. You had no idea where you were going. And I think that's what freaked Matt out. 

</p><p>I was kind of having fun with how crazy we were and I was kidding about it and someone did say "Wow, it's got to be dawn soon. I'd say "Man, don't bet on it the sun may never rise and I wouldn't be surprised as crazy as I am right now." And I was just constantly reinforcing that we're all nuts. Don't expect anything. And I don't know whether, I don't really think that's what upset Matt, but they got into a really heavy rap later that I even dropped out of because it was just more than I wanted to bother with. I was having fun just being face down. (40:00)

</p><p>PATIENT: And taking note of another person in the house. I think he's the youngest kid there. His name is Ross Zuckerman (sp?). And he's short. He's about as short as I am. He's overweight, not very good looking, extremely hung up on being a virgin and he's really uptight about himself. He's the kind of guy that the most you know of him is the image that he puts in front of him. And he's not even very good at that. It's obviously an image for as I know other people like that where they've spent years developing it. So, they're an interesting person even to look at that. 

</p><p>But I was talking with Jack whom seems to be a person in the house that many people confide in. And he feels that Ross because of the way that people usually just kind of ill about Ross. Ross is extremely bitter about things like that. He seems to feel that everyone has put him in a situation of being out of it. And before I used to wonder whether I should try and contact Matt and try and talk with him or not and I'm almost sacred to anymore. I'm, but Ross strikes me as a little bit interesting. I almost feel that if I can get him to actually feel a little friendship he might open up and loosen up a little bit. (41:53)

</p><p>THERAPIST: You know, does Ross have any feeling stop feeling as carried this image around, which you're saying doesn't work very well anyway. A kid feels shaky and angry and upset and uptight.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I remember about the, I used to do that in High School. I was healthy enough that I was always into the kind of jock image. I was also small enough that I never quite pulled it off. So, I was always uptight about it and all through high school I was perfectly miserable about it for the main part. Although it didn't really ruin me. I had, I enjoyed it. I don't know what I was doing. I wasn't uptight, but even after high school I was still into the idea of going out and drinking and getting a fast car and laying as many women as I could find in all of this. I can remember about the time that I kind of got out of that and I felt a whole lot better about it afterwards. It was fun just not to have to worry about not giving a fat lip what people thought of you or something like that. 

</p><p>And I have a feeling that Ross is just happened to be a little more hung up into the image kind of thing than most people are. The thing that surprises me is I know Ross is extremely intelligent and yet I can't understand how it is he hasn't managed to cope a little bit better. 

</p><p>I know another guy in the house that although he's several years older than Ross is the same way. He knows his image, but you don't know him and he constantly is talking about what that image is or into telling you about how he is or how he functions so that you can reinforce this image of him. Maybe he's reinforcing it to himself, but he seems to have had the satisfaction of after awhile the image is almost become him, but it's not quite true, but he's interesting. I mean, he's not ill at ease with himself or with it. Although I'm sure he could feel a little better about it without it, but I can't understand how it is that Ross could be 18 or 19 years older, whatever he is and still not managed to have gotten past the point that he is. (44:17)

</p><p>The only thing that strikes, I never considered Ross as being bitter or hateful or anything like that. Except one thing and that's that he has a very, very malicious humor. Anytime he can make a really subtle or not subtle, but vicious cut at somebody. He'll do it. I always thought maybe it was just stupidity. He never quite caught onto the fact that those kind of things aren't very funny. Maybe he was raised around parents where, a family where they were used to cutting each other like that, but I suppose it might mean that it's actually because he's bitter or pissed off at everybody. 

</p><p>It's strange when I see somebody like Matt or Robert Sylvester (sp?) as the older person. He's about my age to put this image forth and Ross Zuckerman always wished there was something I could do to make it a little easier. So, that if nothing else at least they weren't so confined with what it is that's got them hassled. Now I don't know whether it's because of, I just really don't know why. At one point I would have said it's because I liked him or I wanted to do something for him. Give myself some credit as a humanitarian. But anymore I often wonder if it isn't because I empathize with his position. (46:09)

</p><p>THERAPIST: You mean on in a sense that you know a little bit about what someone like Jack and you know about (inaudible at 46:27) 

</p><p>PATIENT: That and almost like if I can manage to help them out in some way. It'll also do me good. That kind of thing confuses me because I don't know how to say that, it doesn't very, it doesn't even come close to saying what I'm trying to say. That we can like call me a loaf or a guys really I just get really involved in what it means to them, how it works, what its functions is and all of this kind of shit, but that's eight and a half hours of speed rap there. But I also seem to have a counter side where I am me and everything, it's kind of the pleasure, pain idea that everything you do is in the basic for you. And I can see both ways. I can't find the way to make them compromise. I don't know whether there is. In other words if there's such a thing as real contact between people or real meaning between them or are we just stuck in our shell and all we do is react to what's around us. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: And, like, touch others for some purpose for ourselves. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. (47:57)

</p><p>THERAPIST: And it almost sounds, like, well it's been, it almost didn't matter which side of that was up, there's still something that draws you towards a person like Ross. Whether it's to help you or to, whether there's something in it for you or whether there really is something altruistic, I don't know, about making contact with a person like that. You still feel in some way something for one of those guys. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, I have no qualms at all about the feeling because I figure either way it can't be harmful. If it does then that's the only in the end where I've been the idea of help myself out. If it isn't why then I'd help them out and me out because I dig doing that. But I'd like to, it's like trying to follow back on the court myself again. I'd like to understand what it is because of this and where it will lead in the end.

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's kind of... 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's kind of like a karma, is my karma entirely. How would it effect good or bad? That isn't a very good way of saying it. I don't know how I've never tried to say that before. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You know what you're talking about these guys is that there's something about each of them that the word isolated comes to me and it's something about their isolation that gets to you. And I wouldn't necessarily define isolation in the way you usually do, but there's something about them that suggests that. (49:54) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, they, well, like Sylvester like I said he's kind of become his image and I'm sure Robert is very much like what he likes to put forward. He's a big guy. He likes to be very masculine. Although, I mean, he's very, he's an athletic person. He's very, well he's muscular. He's tall. He's the epitome of a frat man of ten years ago, balding at the front, not a trimmed hair cut. And although this kind of thing he loves to drink. I've never seen him around women, but that's kind of thing that never just comes into his conversation, but he's probably very much like that. I'm sure he does enjoy athletics and all of this, but Robert constantly has to reinforce his image by talking about it, by recounting tales of when he got drunk.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like how much he's had and this terrible potion they cooked up that he was able to drink X amount of and that kind of thing. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's like Robert has just a little bit of insecurity and that we don't believe who he is so he has to put it forward and it's like if we could just get him to be himself for a little while so that he'll realize we dig that whether he's putting the image forth or not I think he'd be a little more at ease. Like Robert really isn't uptight though. I'm, like I said, his image is pretty well fits him and he's pretty well compromised with it.

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's something more like integrated or together about him than I mean it might not be your choice for a person or for yourself, but he doesn't suffer and Matt this other guy are suffering. (51:48)

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, but I'm sure we all play the same game to a certain end. I catch many things that I know in myself are maybe more than I'd like, you know, not what I'd really like to think they were or that's kind of a strange way of saying it, but.

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(background noise - footsteps, door closing - 20 seconds)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Jordan), how was your week?</p>

<p>(background noise - bumping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was good. It was good. How about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was fine. (pause) Yeah, nothing, um, like really traumatic or anything. Today, this week, I want to talk about job stuff [0:00:44.0].</p>

<p>And today, my boss at the temp job said that he wanted to talk to me later about something. I said, "What?" And he said, "About your future employment here." Or something like that. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, I know I don't want to work there. I mean - I would, if - if it was the right salary. But it's not, you know. And -. So then I felt like something had changed, like some dynamic in the relationship. I mean, he's probably too busy even to be aware of it. But - I was, like, trying to avoid him and - like, I - well, I successfully ran out without having a conversation (laughs).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. But it - it sounds like it brought up some anxiety?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And -. It's kind of like when I was younger and growing up and, like, when somebody was interested in me, I really didn't like them anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So - you know, I feel that I should be very flattered. You know, he's a very nice man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he's - he is a very picky person. So I'm flattered that he wants me to stay, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I - but I just felt like -. I don't know, I didn't like the way he said it, you know. It - it was just that it's, like, his way of approaching me . [0:02:19.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're not interested in doing that. And I'm hearing from you that it sounds very positive, that he wants to offer you a job. When you first described it, I had the sense that it might be something negative that he was going to say when -. I mean, that was just sort of my reaction. Is - is that not accurate in essence? That it would be--?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well he presented it like in a negative way. I - you know, like -</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's - maybe that's just his, like, demeanor. Kind of like sounding like - "You'd better decide to stay or" - you know, "You're fired." Or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, that's the way I perceived it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. So he was - so his message to you was that he liked you, he wanted you to stay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But he offered it to you as sort of a threat. Is - is that accurate?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You - you know, I had to sit down with him, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And see, before I liked it because I was, like, aloof.  I had no emotional involvement at all. And now all of a sudden he's - I'm like sitting down and having a meeting with him. [0:03:20.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Sort of surprised by -. You don't know what - contact. He had no commitment. And - you know, I can get hurt even if I'm not involved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But now it's like - you know, he's - he's like acting like a boss. There's that scary feeling all the time, and paranoia, you know. And they want to sit down and talk to you. So I don't know. You know, it's like a kind of - I mean, realistically they don't really have any say because they don't have anyone to, you know, service his area.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. [0:04:03.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's not like I think I can get by or anything, because they need someone there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's like -. I guess at this point, you know, it's like you - you get hurt enough that it's (background noise - something dropping) commitment phobia?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. So - let's just back up just a second here or two (background noise - something dropping) And he said that to you. This - you know, "You better stay, or else I'll fire you."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well - you know, he didn't say that. But that's what I was perceiving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. OK.</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Like he said - "I want to have a conversation with you about your future employment here."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. It's a very veiled statement. And you don't seem to get much out of there. I mean, it could go either way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's a good word, "veiled". But - yeah, you know. It's - as I said, looking at it - I mean, my future employment. I don't know. I can't see - like, I don't want to hurt them, 'cause I like them. But I just can't - I don't know, make a commitment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's, I mean, it's - not enough money, as I said. But that should be on their - like, they were talking about it last week, that I wanted to continue with it. [0:05:31.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was, I was, uh, before I left, I was talking that - that last job was a nightmare. The person I worked for was. And - I don't, you know what the point I made was. But he was just, like, so- he was like, very controlling, and he - he got lost in this minutia of stuff, like. And sort of just keeping your eye on the - on the ball. He would sort of get lost in - like, like a letter. It's - you know, not in the same font, you know. Or the quality of the paper. You know, he just got sidetracked so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, willingly. Like - I don't know. Kind of like he - I really - he really chipped away at my self confidence. Like totally, by the end, you know, I was just -. Well, you know, see - what I was saying was, too, that I did - I went above and beyond what I had to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it got to the point where I was, like, really running his personal life. And I said, "Look. You know - it's so-and-so's birthday, so you have to get a card." So, like - A, I had to remind him he had to get the cards. B, I even had to go and get the cards for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I did. And then he - you know, after doing that - he got really pissed, because having the seven cards - one of the envelopes, the address is upside down. And -. You know, I realized that I did that. But - you know, there wasn't another envelope. [0:07:32.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So he was totally freaked out by that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um -.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When he freaked out, what was your response? Do you remember?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He didn't tell me that he was freaked, right away. But just at the end like when things were starting to fall apart. And, you know, he said, "When you did that" -. I was, you know, told that -.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it came up later? [0:08:04.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you feel about that? Like it came up not in the moment, but -.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it would have been easier for him to tell me then. (Chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he was just like building a store and not being [to let somebody in.] (ph) You know, like - why do these people do this to me? I'm very private. I'm very efficient. Yeah, and I do a great job; I really can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he st -. You know, he just - and it just - didn't work. You know, I, I really - I just can't understand it. I mean, I wonder if there is, like, some kind of - a sabotage thing I'm doing or I don't know, like it's -. Like I s - I just care too much, you know. I don't know. [0:09:01.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it is confusing.</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to say the least. Like at this job now - I mean, I don't give a shit, and I'm doing a great job. You know, conscientious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't give a shit? I mean, how does that - how does that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no, not like - I'm relaxed, I should say, because if they fired me tomorrow. I'm leaving here on the very next temp assignment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) No, it's - it's not like humiliating, when you tell all your friends and your relatives, "Oh, I got this great job" and then it doesn't work out. But, you know, these - partly, a lot of these people on top are just not nice I think. And I wonder if I just give too much and let them take advantage, or - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that this is important to you. You brought it up again this week. What do you--?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you said to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. OK, so you're responding to -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Right.</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You said to bring it out.</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I asked you to bring it up. I see. Do you feel -. I - I asked - in response to that, are you're feeling like - you know, I - either I'm wary of saying more? Because I want to make sure that if you bring it up, that you're doing that because you want to. Do you know what I mean? That - it feels like you're trying to please me in some ways. And I'm sure that you would do what I asked you to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Because - well yes, in a way. But then, you had pointed out that I was quite upset about it last week and to be sure to bring that up this week. So I mean -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So doing what - what I asked you to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But why not? I mean, that's what I'm here for. You know, it's to straighten out this job stuff. (pause, 10 seconds) So I don't know. I mean, I don't know what it is. But I -. You know, I - when I interviewed with him for the - for the job, there probably were, you know, a lot of, like, key issues that I could have -. He told how the end results was going to be. Now, looking back, I think that well, I should have known from this and this and this. But - from the sound of it all he had an assistant there before, and for many years. And also he decided that she - he wanted a new one. I don't know, for whatever reason. She was making a lot of mistakes, or something. And he said she was sneaking in applicants behind his back. Things like that. [0:12:16.1]</p>

<p>And then he had her, like, do all the interviewing when he couldn't. He couldn't - you know, he - he's a busy man, and he couldn't delegate that to someone else. To screen people for him? He had to do all the screenings, and he probably didn't want to deal with that - 20, 30, 40 applicants himself. And - which probably told me that - should have told me that he is very controlling. And then, you know, I met him. And then we met his associate, who - he's a partner of his - who is - say. I actually hit if off with him more. So that should have told me something, you know, that I wasn't going to be working for the guy I hit it off with, I'd be working with the other guy. [0:13:19.5]</p>

<p>He was like, the other guy was kind of scare - like he was kind of distant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. I'm sorry, I keep getting distracted as you're talking. And I just wanted to bring it up, because I - I guess that there's something that's still going on in my mind about what we were talking about. But just about the way you and I relate. And I wanted to just - sort of take that a little further if we can, because I know that in here - you know, as a therapist - I've got some power and, and some influence with you. Like I say, I mean, this - this sounds like it's important that - that you will bring it in the next week. And I just want to take that a little further about what that's like for you to hear, you know, you request that; and then what it was like for you to remember to bring it in today?</p>

<p>(pause, 11 seconds) [0:14:21.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - I think it's like, kind of normal. I mean, you know, kind of like - I kind of think it's a moot point. I mean -. And I think you're being very therapist-y by bringing that up, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. You mean by [I knew you were] (ph) coming?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well - I mean, it's not - it's not, like a big issue, at least to me. And I think it's, you know, reading into things too much. I mean, you're a therapist; but also, you're a person, too. So if somebody asks me to bring something up - it's not a position of power. It's a position of - I don't know, courtesy, I think? And I have power, too. I mean, I could not come. I could not show up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And - and what I realize is that you didn't use that again to say, "Well I'm not going to do what she's - asking me to do and not show up." But you still came and did what was required. I just wondered what that felt like for you. And then for me to bring it up again now. It sounds like you - it feels like we're analyzing it too much?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. [0:15:39.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's - let's stay there for a second, and then we'll just see what that's about. And that needs more analysis [I mean analysis] (ph). But I just want to get a sense of what actually happens, the true picture of us. So - so if I - what would it be like to say, you know, "I was going to bring this up." And to - let's, let's go back for a second. Tell-tell me more about the therapist or the feeling like it's too analyzed? Can you say more about that?</p>

<p>(pause, 15 seconds)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not - not much more. I mean - yeah, I mean - you -. My focus in this therapy is to work on - my work problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - it was - I mean, we have a meeting at work, let's say. We have an agenda. And then we - you know, if it's on the agenda to be carried over this week. It's always kind of logical to me. And I think - that if it's any kind of, you know, like, power or whatever -. So when I'm say that, you know, it fell within line of this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get used to it. You've done it before. People ask you to do something, and - and that's what you have been describing too, with, there's sort of, it's a pattern with - with bosses that sometimes when they ask you to do things, you'll do it and sometimes even go over and above your - you know, what they require.</p>

<p>I wonder if it feels like you're in a similar situation with me. When you're asked to do something, you know? [0:17:36.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean, I - I don't. I mean, these people that I'm talking about are people that are - like - I don't know, they're just driven by power and - all kinds of, you know. Its pathos and (chuckles) - I mean, I think it's a lot more complicated there, in those situations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What [made you *?] (ph) [0:18:18.5] For example, I could request about it, and you - you're not thinking about the implications of it the last week, you know. But I would just say, you know, "Alicia" and sort of play it out a similar pattern of asking you to do something without really thinking that, you know, you might just do it to comply with me. To not that, that would be your only -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) But then you could turn around and say, "Well she didn't bring it up." So maybe that's - powerful, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I could really use my power, then, to validate you? (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sighs) I didn't think, you know, if you want, you know, to feel as powerful. But it's not -. (pause) I'm not - it's that - you know, it's just - (pause). I mean - (sighs). I - I don't even know why. I just think it's stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like, like when - when I bring up that topic of that feeling like I might have power in some situations, with you - that you really - it's, it's difficult to see me as somebody with power.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, 'cause you're not like a president or a CEO.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - I'm not receiving a paycheck from you. So I don't feel indebted.</p>

<p>(pause, 5 seconds)</p>

<p>You know, if it - if this didn't work out, and then if I never came back again, I can still pay my rent. I can still eat out. You wouldn't threaten my life .</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now I'm attempting to speak, and I don't have as much power as, say, your boss, or - a president of the company. [0:20:16.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I would say like a boss is about a ten; and you're about a one. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, you know. If - as I said, I mean - if I never came back here again, I mean I might - lose something tangible to an extent. But my livelihood wouldn't be threatened. And livelihood being, you know. I - would be very embarrassed, humiliated, [0:20:52.8] confused. I wouldn't know what to do. I'd have to start - start thinking again how I'm going to take care of things. All the payments I have on - other things, and -</p>

<p>(pause, 10 seconds)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [So I'm] (ph) - I guess (actually) (ph) say that I'm doing [more than] (ph) therapy. And - and coming here isn't very important for you. Is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I mean, now that we've talked about, like, this stuff - I, I don't know. I - honestly I need, you know, validity to this. (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was talking about once. Can you just clarify?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just like - not the power kind of thing. But we just brought it up. And I just thought that was, like, stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. (pause) It's interesting that -. It's not interesting. I guess I'm - I'm taking it back a little bit. Because I felt like I had been given a lot of power at the end of last week, when this - you know, reported today that you had brought it up because I had asked you to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I felt that you had put a lot of importance and that that was a very important thing. And I didn't get a sense of why you might bring it up or, you know, there was any reason why you wanted to. So you need a sense of -. It felt like - you would go - and that you want to ask me to do things. I'll do that, is the way I heard that. [0:22:34.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean, you're - it's, it is like a double-edged sword. Because you ask me to bring it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I did. So - you know, you're kind of setting me up, here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And then, ] (ph) in talking about this and, and giving you my response to how it felt to [hear that -.] (ph) How does that feel to you? I mean, how are you feeling right now, processing this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well which part of it? That - that - you know, that I'm bringing it up and saying, you know, "Alicia", I feel like you gave me a lot of power today?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel, like, frustrated, because I don't think it's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>(pause) You - you say more about the frustration that (you -) (ph). You [really know] (ph) (background noise - papers) it's true, and -. [0:23:34.1]</p>

<p>(pause, 7 seconds)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because - you know, it's just that I wanted to bring it up because I wanted to bring it up, too. And because that's why I'm here: to discuss my work problems. So I didn't see how you can be representative of what's happening in the workplace. Which is a totally different scenario. And - I don't know. You know, I just -. [I mean] (ph) I realize you have to - you know (background noise - paper dropping?), you're committed to this type of therapy where, you know, the - in the probing this through (types) (ph). And - you know, this is the kind - I don't know what you call it, though. It's - what's happening in the room is what's happening out there. But I don't know if I'm buying it. I - I really don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's talk about that. You sound like that's sort of a - a cloud that's over both of us right now, [and it's -] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Well - you know when - . I spoke to (Maria) (ph) in the beginning. And she said - she explained the situation. Offhand, I was like saying, I hope I don't get that type</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: 'Cause I don't really believe in it. But then I said to myself that I would give it a try.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. So -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) [It's amazing.] (ph) Yeah, maybe there is something to it. But I don't know. I mean, I just can't - I don't see how this is going to help. You know, help me in the workplace.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Well let me tell you a little bit about what I'm thinking, because -. Think about that, 'cause I - I guess - You know, you put some really good words to sort of - the dilemma I've felt in here. It's sort of trying to bring - bring attention to what's happening between the two of us. And really feeling like I was staying away from that. A lot of times you were just sort of talking about work, or that you're not trying to relate it to what my experience of you is. And the experience about relationship. [0:25:56.4]</p>

<p>So today when I tried to, I mean, - I put it out there with a little bit of reluctance. Just not knowing how you were going to respond to it, and you were going to accept it. So you put some really clear words to sort of a dilemma I guess I'm feeling about how we're working together. Not knowing, it feels like it, you know, gets rejected every time I bring it up, that - what's happening in here isn't valid. Especially in relation to work situations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So do you think we should quit?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So are you - so where are we going with this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I mean, how do you feel? I mean, do you think that (pause) - that we are sort of stuck in this dilemma? We probably need to figure a way to get - move past it in some way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: OK. Well - you said, you know, how'd that make me feel about me being powerful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So - you know, I answered you. And - so why can't we just move on from that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess if - if, you know, that when we said that, I felt like all of my power had been taken away from me too, that I got compared to number one and that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Well I just feel bad - saying that.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I - I - I don't know. I guess it was a stab.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess we need to be more [active when we speak. Do you understand?] (ph) I'm not sure if, you know, that - that you see - that you would have done that or realized that - [0:27:50.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I did feel bad. When I was laughing because I - kind of -. It was like - I felt like I had - cleared myself. I (cut) (ph) that kind of fast.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um. As if I wasn't listening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>(pause, 8 seconds)</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you feel about it, you know - if I empowered you by - you know, responded to your request? I mean, how does it make you feel? Does it make you feel good? Or bad? Or-?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you have empowered me, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it felt good that you had, you know, done as I had requested. But there was sort of a feeling in the gut of my stomach, kind of like - like it scares me a little bit, not knowing sort of what you were here for. So I - I found myself starting to question, you know, if [I needed to do this] (ph) just to make me happy. Or is it - you know, and - and what am I doing to make me carry that on? To take some of that, you know. Do you get empowered from me to start taking that, too? In ways that might be helpful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [It's about seeing] (ph) me. Maybe I just empower these bosses too much?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, this -</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's nothing to stick to here since we know about - you know, that now it - it feels hard. And I want to just sort of use this, you know? We've been through a couple of things, now, and [mine is] (ph) feeling. You know, from my reaction I felt like I got a lot of power; and then I felt like you know, stripped to the - to the bare bone of it in some ways. And then, real - you realizing that - that you had given me, you know - you had found something to please me. And then also stabbed me. You know, it felt like you had attacked me or - or jabbed me. Well - well that's like you really realize that you had done both of those things. [0:30:08.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it kind of a defense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I think it - it was a nice thing, what I did. And then you analyzed it and put it under the microscope and moved away from it and looked underneath it and -.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. [I think that I'm - I'm used to] (ph) (inaudible - very soft plus white noise at 30:30)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you know. Or not to - like, take a jab in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you do when you're angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say more about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I can move backwards or not. 'Cause I can't remember the sequence?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like -</p>

<p>(pause, 7 seconds)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that I just felt like - like rejection, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Rejection. That it's frightening, like I wasn't accepting you doing this for me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I mean I - well [I'm really doing it for me, ] (ph) too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. It might be that I'm cognitive. With the way you know, the way you've rubbed it in today. It just felt like it was done from you. Not that it's a bad thing to do or, you know, that I didn't appreciate it in some ways. It didn't, you know - "Alicia is responding to what I asked her to do." But I wanted to sort of bring it up, because I also realized I got some power that I didn't necessarily need or - you know, that would be helpful, I guess. So it's - it sort of a - inquisitive kind of question, not to - not to make you feel like it - it was bad to do it. It just (crossed) (ph) to sort start taking this and being able to analyze without judgment. [0:32:18.8]</p>

<p>But I - but I understand what you're saying, that it felt like it was - it was, in some way, rejecting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So -</p>

<p>(pause, 7 seconds)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, right now I feel like I'm walking on eggshells.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. (pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like anything I say, it's just going to be like - I don't know. Like it's [over some fire,] (ph) you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that if you say something -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like, you're going to say, "So why did you say that now?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And - and how will that come across for you? [I'm not sure what you - ] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Like very restricting. That I just can't say what I want.</p>

<p>(pause, 7 seconds)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So like - I guess - I guess our dilemma is for me to be able to do my job, I need to be able to respond to what you're saying and to withdraw some attention to what's going on. And it sounds like what happens when I do that is, it sounds evaluative or rejecting, sometimes, if I brought it to your attention? [0:33:55.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And - .</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: So anyway -.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you waiting for me to say something? Like a plan to keep - keep this going?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You - you don't need to. (chuckles) 'Cause I - I want to take that pressure off of you. That - that you don't need to make this feel better right now. And I sense it. There's some tension between the two of us, since we're talking about something so present.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean - are we done with it? Or, like, I would think we are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well at this point I'm wondering what your thoughts are about how we can sort of work through this. Since - it may come up again. And as we work together -.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This sort of dilemma of - . I don't - I don't know. I don't - you know. To answer this, I don't know if I'll continue with this. I - I've got it down as, I - I don't like this type of, like, where it's going. I - I don't like, you know, just this type of therapy. I - I really don't.</p>

<p>(sighs) I - you know, I think it's stupid. I think it's not working for me. I think it's nitpicking. (pause) And -. (sighs) And - you know, I mean - like, I really like you a lot. And I think you, you know, you - you're a fine therapist. And you are, (yeah,) (ph) too. But I don't like this - this style.</p>

<p>(pause, 7 seconds)</p>

<p>It - it, like, just feels, like too eternal. It's not apropos to anything in my life. And it's just too - it's too, like analytical. And it's too, like, heavy, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. [0:36:07.7]</p>

<p> -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -</p>

<p>PATIENT: But -. Just, you know, so - you know, it's - it's like I need something lighter, you know. Just - like some practical direction in my life? I don't think I'm just - anything is like majorly wrong, or that I have to look at every nuance, every aspect.</p>

<p>(background noise - papers?)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. You know, I mean like I don't mean to suggest that something is majorly wrong, if you do look at the nuances, but that - that's really a rich place for us to work from, since you feel that's it's - really important. You know, I want to convey that to you  [0:36:47.9]</p>

<p>But - I find myself, sort of finding the words to say that to you. That how you are feeling, that it's very important. I guess I felt like you really tried to stay away from your feelings? [It broke us down] (ph) and what it's like at work. Sort of things got more distant. Actually, what Alicia is feeling, what Alicia is experiencing -</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't buy into the fact that what's happening here is - you know, happening in any outside world setting. I mean, I just - I just have a hard time, philosophically and emotionally, dealing with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. And - and you may be right. I'm not saying that I'm right. I guess that's -. The only thing I think I can really work with, it's what you and I have. You know, the experience that we create together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To do this. You know, first being able to come to work with you and being able to sit with you there would make a very different experience. [I don't know.] (ph) But I'm wondering if - you know. You're job, then, would be after leaving therapy, to take maybe some - some sense of, "Well I wonder if I do this" and to check it out through yourself at work.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So - you know, if that be true then what might I garner from what's happened here and into - in the outside world? [0:38:17.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you might garner sort of what it feels like just to be able to [relate to me] (ph) when I do different things. How it makes you feel that we bring attention to it sometimes. And - and your reactions to it are reallyimportant, 'cause in the outside world, your reactions are going to be telling you what your experience is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, if like my boss asks me to - like, analyze a report.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, that's - you know, I want to do that. And - and he comes in, or she comes in, and then like today and that - you know, he forgets to mention the report 'cause they have 100 other things coming up right now. You know, I'm going to bring it up and I think they would appreciate that, that I try to keep them organized. So - which is what I did here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so I would think - you know, you were the symbolic boss, that you should appreciate my efficiency in bringing it up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Sometimes) (ph). So it really confused you, then, when I do -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say, ("Yeah") (ph) I understand that.</p>

<p>(pause, 6 seconds)</p>

<p>I didn't do my job in some ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, that's why I couldn't understand the ta -. I mean, so - the boss isn't going to ask me how I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About the power. I mean, they are - they are the power.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So -. I mean, you were doing your job in - in a way. But I - I couldn't see where it was going.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How it was going to relate directly to your work?</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean I think you brought that up before, actually, that - you know, it's a - people in the outside world, they're not going to ask you. You boss is not going to ask you, "Alicia, gee whiz. How do you feel about that?" But this is, in some ways, a unique experience in that way. And part of what we need to find out is how you feel in these situations. [0:40:24.5]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>My sense is that you haven't had a lot of chance to really allow your feelings to be expressed. We need to talk about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean, like when it's happening? When -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you feel welcome.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, it could be. I don't know.</p>

<p>(pause, 5 seconds)</p>

<p>'Cause I - you know, I think that I have, like - a positive attitude. I mean, like - like a "can do" attitude.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. [It sounds like it's the same kind of feeling that -] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Yeah, [like I should] (ph) - do it. And then - I'm fine. You know, maybe that people just, like, take advantage.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>You know, like - of it, I guess. I mean, they don't, you know, have a hat or - or a tee shirt that says, "I'm taking advantage here. You're so charming and nice and -." But then they begin to expect that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I mean, I - I guess -. I don't know, I guess I kind of see things, but I just avoid them.</p>

<p>(pause, 6 seconds)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you probably [don't say anything critical)?] (ph) ] 0:41:57.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. You know, you - [he - he doesn't seem] (ph), like, the - the red flags. But I hear just very diluted - you know, I didn't want to see them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. So what would that mean, if somebody was to endanger you? To take advantage of you?[0:42:18.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I'd, like have to confront (them.) (ph) And -</p>

<p>(pause, 5 seconds)</p>

<p>I (wouldn't) (ph) - I don't know. Like, I don't like confrontations.</p>

<p>(pause, 5 seconds)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, do you get angry? Um hm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I - I just don't like to get angry (ph)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>You know, I mean you just never know. I mean, the next boss might really appreciate the fact that I'm, you know, like -. I don't know, open a door or (chuckles) things like that. It's like, I can't really categorize things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even when you just say that, I get the sense that you don't feel like you have a lot of control over - feeling like you overdo things. That it's like the way of - it's the only way that you can be - overdoing what's required of you.</p>

<p>(pause, 6 seconds)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's say - yeah. No, I do think that I have control. But I have a tendency to do that - to be that way. And I think it's a good tendency in most cases. But in some, you know, I - (shouldn't.) (ph) And then, I am worrying - (to) (ph) stop. You know, to - [I'd like] (ph) not to be so good natured, sometimes. You know, developing like a resistance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, you know, you can look at it another way. Why should I let my feelings, and - I mean, just, you know, had a sense that - you know, this - this situation is about to be played out again. And I just stop it. [0:44:25.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry, could you say that again?  I think - what's the word you used?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just had a sense that - the situation is about to be played (background noise - something dropping?) out again? So I stop my feelings. I guess that's what I said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. So you don't [allow this to] (ph) (background noise - papers)</p>

<p>(inaudible) ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's just that - you know, I just recognized the formula and, you know, that I'm setting myself up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.  (inaudible at 0:45:02.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. Yes.</p>

<p>(pause, 9 seconds)</p>

<p>(background noise - papers dropping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I remember when I started in] (ph) analyzing things. That you felt [similarly again.] (ph) Your response was, "Does this mean we don't work together?" And did a part of you have a similar sort of (affective) (ph) reaction in the pit of your stomach, wherever it is that you feel that sense of, like, you know, rejection is going to happen soon?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I did feel that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's like I - found myself, like - just like tensing up and - getting ready for the big blow. (sighs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Which - which happens a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something [like that.] (ph) I didn't like the way you - you [weren't my client,] (ph) somehow.</p>

<p>(background noise - bumping/thumping)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess. Yeah. So I - you know, I asked you if that's what you meant. But that's what it feels like, you know. Just - like, [well, with] (ph) my boss today. So that's me, isn't it?</p>

<p>(background noise - dog barking?)</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you." All of a sudden I was, like, tensing up, waiting for the big blow. (laughs) You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Can you explain that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know why I do that. You know, why I'm always ready for the big blow. So I - you know, maybe it just like, happens? Maybe it's like I set that up. I don't know, you know. I just don't know why I always expect the worst. [0:46:38.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like there's been - in the past there have been a lot of disappointments for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With people not coming through. And giving you blows when you least expected it. And [too late, that you've learned how to cope.] (ph) How did it feel today when I said, "No, it doesn't mean that I'm rejecting you or that I don't want to work with you, [but rather" - ?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt good. You know. It felt like, you know, safe - like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm.</p>

<p>(pause, 6 seconds)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know, it felt better than it did when I was waiting -.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, in anticipation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've been through a lot of affective states today. Right? [And just - OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must have been -. You know, I appreciate you bringing some of that up and letting me know about that. Especially because as you - as you sit there, I see you trying not to crack a smile. I think it's to my - it feels like you're barely holding it together. Even though you're probably going up and down, it sounds like, on the inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I guess I'm - you know, trying to get composed.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>And that, you know - [where it relieves him.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I'm thinking that's not the reason.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (lets out a big breath).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think you know the reason. [0:48:22.9]</p>

<p>(pause, 7 seconds)</p>

<p>But you're working pretty hard. Am I right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [It's been weird.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And not feeling good - inside.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like, he (puts) (ph) feelings that - you know. And he just did it (up) (ph). ["I doubt if I'm going - if she doesn't want to work with me, anymore."] (ph) I mean, just reduce some of this tension that -. You are holding a lot of that tension, although -. As I've seen you, on the outside, I don't see signs of it, you know? I see you are staying - [can coast around] (ph) all of this. You've been through quite a - quite a roller coaster today, as we've talked.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, I mean it's - like - you know, it's like a nightmare, like sitting here crying, screaming, and laughing. [I'm on your page.] (ph) It's not being in a situation that's appropriate for me.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I alr - you know, I don't know if it's right or wrong to - like - I'm already saying that I shouldn't show everything?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know. It just felt like I - I just commented on how hard you must be working.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The trouble with it all.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, you know, it's like I'm used to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you've been doing it for a long time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. I mean, it's like all these - like rejections and things that I just have to -.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>You know, like being more of myself, to just be composed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean - well -. I don't know if that made sense. (chuckles)
	
COUNSELOR: I think, like, you just hold it in. [0:50:24.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>(pause, 7 seconds)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I would hope that in therapy as we work together, you know, we don't have to - an unlimited number of sessions. But quite a few still left. But increasingly you can, you know, like you can let some of that out, that you don't need to be in that composed state all the time. I'm sure there's going to be times when you [need me, too.] (ph) There are going to be times -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Maybe that's just my, like, demeanor. So what's wrong with being like this? You know, that's - that person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Nothing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, people like me for being calm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause, 9 seconds)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you feel sort of accosted about that - as you're talking now? About how hard you have to work? [0:51:31.3]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>And even in therapy, when there should be more time to - be yourself. But sometimes you're not allowed to have your feelings in here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I didn't even, like, know that they were there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Until you point - asked me, or pointed it out. I mean I never even thought about it. Otherwise, I would - I would have said something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I get the sense that ] (ph) you might be feeling judged by me and that you didn't bring up your feelings [from day one.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean (leaving) (ph). I mean -.</p>

<p>(pause, 10 seconds)</p>

<p>You know, I was just - I guess (background noise, metal) that it's judge - like, I feel that you're being judgmental and that - that maybe I was supposed to do something, and I, I didn't.</p>

<p>(pause, 15 seconds)</p>

<p>So - I don't know. (background noise - chair creaking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like, bored. (background noise - metallic)</p>

<p>(pause, 10 seconds)</p>

<p>(chuckles) But I don't know why I [mean, I'm not leaving .] (ph) Just trying to work, you know. It's like playing - playing at these things [0:53:14.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like (inaudible)?</p>

<p>(pause, 10 seconds)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's a - like I want to go. It's past the time. And like I feel like you're holding me here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm. To 9:30?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well aren't we - well weren't we supposed to end, like, five minutes ago?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>You feel like I'm holding you here against your will?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're free to go whenever you want. (inaudible at 53:58)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean, I just don't want - like, I feel bad. Like -. I don't know if you're just, like, continuing because we're talking about something important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel bad now? Because -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's like I'm rejecting you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. You mean, if you were to get up and say, you know, "It's time to go", and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Yes.</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I hope we meet -.] (ph) I think I would - there was a part of me that would feel like, "Huh. Wow! That means that I've done that before." But I think of - the fickle part of me would feel like, "Alicia said no." That you didn't let me have power in one particular way. I mean, it was just [such a manner that she was] (ph) feeling. Otherwise she is feeling like, 'I want to get out of here.' And she did just that."</p>

<p>So - if you'd like to go, you - you really can go. I mean, like there -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Happy hour.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We are past time. So -</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Well I'd like to go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK (laughs) [0:55:03.6]</p>

<p>(background noise - metallic on desk)</p>

<p>OK. Thanks.</p>

<p>(background noise - metallic)</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. So I'll talk to you. (inaudible)</p>

<p>(crosstalking/laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) Actually - you know, we do have all the paperwork in that file (desk) (ph) ? [We always do that.] (ph) Do you feel like doing that this week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really hate those forms. Do you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. Do you want to skip a week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We can?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, we can talk about it next week if you don't want to do it this week. (background noise - metallic) I mean, feel free to say no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I - hate forms, but then we'll [actually mess with them then?" (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean that, you know, I mean that - since that's part of your participation. But we can talk about that next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh. (laughs) Pretend if I bring it up - when we have our dis -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about I bring it up? About?</p>

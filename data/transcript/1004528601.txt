<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh gosh. I sort of feel like hell today so I apologize if I seem more cranky than usual. I have more aches and pains than usual but they're not like normal joint ones. So it's always like ... I don't know really where they're coming from but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't sound good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. They make me kind of cranky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also it's kind of funny actually. I (pause) this is one of those things where it's by ... I tend to dismiss certain (pause) things in my life because I've decided, "Ah not that big of a deal." Or it's all in my head or it's not important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had been and I feel even embarrassed about even (pause) admitting to this or having not admitted to it earlier.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The past few weeks I've been having a lot of problems with tightness in my chest and I feel like, "Oh great." Now I'm just like suddenly developed panic attack. This is great. But I don't really think I'm panic attack about. What the hell. I mean actually should know what I'm afraid of if I'm going to have panic attacks. I have asthma kicking up. Yeah. And if I had just done something about it earlier, you know instead of being grumpy going, "Okay well I, you know, this is all in my head, no big deal."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>(00:01:23)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let me try to get this story straight. You had some tightening in your chest it first started ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just about everyday, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're like "Oh shit. I'm having a panic attack. And I'm really resenting the fact that I don't even know what the hell I'm afraid of and it's all in my head."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then it became clear in some fashion that it's with asthma.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which (pause) obviously you could have dealt with earlier had you ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There was a possibility this wasn't in your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And was a panic attack.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>(00:02:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you know I don't really normally get out unless I'm actively doing ... it's like (pause) unless I'm like swimming or running or anything like that so it's not a normal thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) and the reason why I even noticed it is because I ended up doing something kind of exerting and used my rescue inhaler because of that got rid of everything for a day or two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I started taking my asthma medicine like I'm supposed too. I'm like, "Yeah. That's actually what this is. It's not actually that I'm having panic attacks."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So (pause) But it is ... the symptoms do overlap a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you know. And both of them can be alleviated by just sitting still and focusing on breathing, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But at the same time, you know (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I guess you were pretty quick to decide.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. And the thing that mostly makes me even more bitter about the whole thing is, is that if I had a good trust relationship with my PCP right now I would have just gone and got it checked out anyways. But since I already, like have sort of a lot of problems with him I just decided not to bother, you know? Like I don't feel like having the discussion about the losing weight thing again and my blood pressure thing again right now because I (pause) (laugh) so ... (pause) So I have lot of ... both my husband and I get a lot of pressure from doctors about, you know losing weight. Ever since we moved here actually. We're just ... trust me I'm very well aware that you know I am in the overweight range but getting towards, you know basically being obese can be very dangerous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has not escaped you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This has not escaped me. I, you know I have a very screwed up metabolism right now because of the years of steroids. This is not something that, you know I'm not ... I'm very cognizant of my eating behaviors, all of that kind of stuff, you know? It's not your normal like, "I just went out and ate fast food kind of thing." So it just got me really frustrated. So (pause). I don't know. But ... so that's ... I don't like it when I feel like I have to take like ... obviously I was making bad choices because I'm not a physician and all but at the same time like (pause)</p>

<p>(00:04:38)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (cross talk) (inaudible_00:04:39).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like you know deciding, "Okay well this is obviously something that's in my head I'm not going to bother with this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But at the same time I'm just really frustrated because it's like if I had a doctor who I could trust, like you know within thirty miles ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Much of this just starts with you just being pissed off something else was fucking wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) like not wanting to deal with your PCP about it because that was going to piss you off even more. And taking some of the anger out on yourself by (pause) I think diagnosing in a way that made you feel worse about yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. It just (pause) I am so frustrated with my PCP about so many things, one of which is that he won't ... he will never actually like take responsibility for fixing anything. He wants me to go to see another like specialist for it. He is so concerned about screwing something up that he will send me to somebody else for everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:05:50)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is to get to see a specialist on certain things something that I've been, you know a particular thing that I've been dealing with for years is really not necessary. And it took a lot of time and a lost of frustration.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it's like I don't really feel like hauling my butt to Plymouth sometime in July to get seen for something that I you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have a splinter taken out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well not even just that but something that is if it were being diagnosed or even the first five years that we've known that I've had this problem that would make sense. But it's establish what, you know I have good records that I responded to this or whatever, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just (pause) you know he doesn't feel confident enough to make that kind of choice. That and he has these dippy ideas that drive me crazy like instead of taking allergy pills why don't you think about trying some local honey? Apparently I guess there is pollen in local honey? But it makes you slowly not ... like more immune to the local pollen, I don't know. He's trying to like move in some holistic things in with it too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which ... apparently I talked to many people and they're like, "Oh yeah I heard about the local honey thing." I'm like yeah, "I just want like, you know allergy pills though."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm a big believer in chemistry, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: If they were peer reviewed studies on this concept, sure. You know I'm not one of those people that doesn't ... there's nothing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Other than anecdotal evidence that if you eat pollen ... if you eat honey that contains pollen in the region that you're living that it helps you build up an immunity. But it's all anecdotal.</p>

<p>(00:07:34)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. So that's been sort of making me frustrated right now. It's just that I'm having a lot things that are not (pause) I am not used to, you know having tightness in my chest. I'm having a lot of muscular pain you know diffuse aching. Not like the same thing that I have in joints which is (pause) not only disconcerting but it's not like it hasn't been going that long to be like go to the doctor. But it's frustrating because I'm just very used to certain things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's different. (pause) So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For like it's bad enough to have a pain that you're used too, I mean awful. But at least you kind of ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have coping strategies.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a lot of heat pads. I do this, I do that, you know? I have a lot of things to try and get past that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? When it's something that I'm not familiar with it makes me very frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. (pause) And you know (pause) I have some ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How could you not be very cranky over this? I mean both ... just cranky because like hurting and hurting in new ways and hurting badly makes a person cranky.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm cranky because like (pause) "Now this is happening?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well I just want to have a, you know I would really like to have a lot more of a this stuff doesn't bother me kind of, you know attitude, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure you would.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there are people out there who like the small stuff doesn't bother them or they don't like ... they don't, you know let things, you know bother them very much that you know like, "Oh that's just what they said." You just let it, you know go roll off your back and that's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:09:33)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? I don't especially when it comes to my health because you know I'm getting a message of, "If you don't show that you're serious enough to try and lose weight then we're not serious enough to try and treat you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And you know so I am actively going to try and ... the worst part is that nobody dares me to do anything. I can do anything I want if I really want to, you know? I've quit some pretty horrible habits just because of the fact that I got annoyed enough with them or something else happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's unfortunately a family trait that runs on my mom's side.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a the point where you call somebody out on something, you'll never, never get like (pause) you know if you did standup ... we'll always standup to the challenge even if it spites everybody involved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... when my husband and I got married in the Catholic church they sort of ... the one priest made some sort of snarky comment about my mother's past and how that they sort didn't feel as if her dedication was not high enough that, you know ... I don't remember, but it was some sort of thing about like, "You know you're only whatever religion that you want to be when it's convenient."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so she ... this was 1998. Even like she had gone to 6 a.m. mass every single time (pause) like when she's been in Cincinnati and she actually attends mass other times too. And she makes sure that it is well known that she's attending.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? It's just ... she doesn't like to be around like a lot of people. Not like a lot of people but like you know Sunday morning there is a lot of kids, there's a lot of other things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she just decided, "Yup, I'm going to start showing up at 6 a.m. mass then for every Sunday. Because you just called me out on, you know if it is going to be convenient then that's what you're going to do instead of be judgmental." That's the way that my mom's side of the family works on that. And so (pause) you know this whole of, "Okay, well if you're going to do this I'm going to make sure I lose a lot of weight, you know?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's going to be difficult for me but I'll do it. But I'm not doing it ... I'm doing it more to show that it's not the problem, you know? So ... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a bit out of spite?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know like if I held up my end of the bargain, you know (pause) you know what happened to you, you're end on terms of trying to figure out what's wrong then, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what's going to be involved in this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea. I haven't really thought it through yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to go home and call my old doctor's lead nurse and talk to her about some ideas. So ... (pause)</p>

<p>(00:12:45)</p>

<p>I'll see. But it just (pause) disdain just makes me very angry, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think part of the reason why I get angry ... if it weren't like I wasn't already in pain or if I wasn't already out of discomfort I would probably be less bitter about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure that they're very much tied together but if it were a different situation ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like (pause) you know, but the fact that I'm getting physical discomfort just raises my, you know makes my fuse that much shorter on that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would make your fuse shorter on anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know. I don't like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you don't like that. I mean you hate being like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I hate being angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: By nature I'm actually a pretty happy person, that's part of the reason why it's just, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate that I ever has to resort to this, you know? So. But we'll see. We are going to attempt to go home for the holidays next week, so we'll see how that goes. Which actually I should think about that now. I should probably pre-cancel our appointment for next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. For Thursday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For Thursday because I'll probably be in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) Okay so still on for Tuesday as usually but that Thursday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>(00:14:44)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we'll see if that works out. So. (pause) (sigh) It's just exhausting and frustrating and you know stuff like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know to make things completely worst there's more drama going on in my husband's side of the family, so. I think I've told you that I believe that there's an awful lot elder neglect ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On his grandfather?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: His grandfather went back in the hospital.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. There was something he had fallen down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He had fallen down a couple of times people just never notice him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: More than eight, like eighteen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he had kidney failure because he hadn't moved the first time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But he's back in the hospital. Apparently he ... before this happened he had never been to the hospital in his life except for when he had shrapnel in World War II. So he's a very healthy man.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he started to get seizures and he's had a lot of cognitive confusion and things like that and nobody really noticed the confusion yet. Probably he's been confused for a long time. So ... (pause) we may have to take a trip out there to see what's going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We'll see. I really just like have exactly a zero desire to go out to St. Louis. We have very limited resources anyways. But spending any of it on going to St. Louis, Missouri is not exactly like ... Even though I've never been there and I'm not really certain what it's really like, it's the fact that going into that den of vipers really doesn't really sound appealing to me. So ... (pause) But that's been pretty much my past few days, you know? It just ... I'm just so sick of carrying all the weight around for right now, you know? Physically and emotionally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? (pause) A lot. Nothing is very simple. I mean it's not (pause) (sigh) I like to sit down and actually calculate things and be able to figure them out, you know? And make a choice based upon being informed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not something I can do with most of these things because there's just too many things that are (pause) unknowable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. There's a lot you can't know and like you can't be in control of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. I am really glad that I sort of had, not really a melt down but I got really upset with my husband about a few things and I sort of convinced him that if we're back in Cincinnati that he should spend some time with faculty members that he knew and talk to them about like, you know what he should be doing, you know? How to proceed for what he wants to do.</p>

<p>(00:17:48)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he's obviously, you know very frustrated about not being (inaudible_00:17:55), you know? It's not that he's not that great at research he just (pause) doesn't put the effort in. Never did, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what kind of ideas he should have that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean they would help him come up with ideas for doing research or try to do something else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just brainstorm about how to get out of the hole he's dug himself into.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible_00:18:22).</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the people actually is ... does entirely teaching. He's the assistant department head and he does know research.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He just does teaching and that's one of the people he's been talking to too. Because that would be something that he's very talented at and you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he a good teacher?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually I've never watched him lecture but he's won a couple of awards. So. It is a (pause) I'm a big believer of the concept in physics that by being there sometimes it changes the results and so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The observation of the event sometimes changes the results.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so therefore I try not to (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like in a double sided experiment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually that is exactly what I'm talking about, the appearance property thing. So I try not to watch him when he teaches so that doesn't (pause) this is a more noble way that he gets more ... you know distracted that kind of thing. I watched him defend his dissertation but that's not teaching.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. He doesn't, it's not so much the other way around with me because I do better the bigger group I have. Because then I don't focus on anyone person, I get focused on the group.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>(00:19:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. (pause) As a person who doesn't like to talk to people in general ... that doesn't not like to talk to people, but he isn't really driven that much to talk to people in general it's funny that I don't mind teaching an audience of people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. (sigh) But I'll see like whatever comes out of this ... but in terms of knowables it's funny because it's like when we're making a decision I'm like "We there are two different trips. We can drive our car down, which is kind of expensive to do. Or which, you know ... and calculated the cost of like renting a car and the cost of what has better gas mileage and all this stuff." And I was like, "Okay. So this is the actually cost and this the, you know cost of other things related to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So this is the decision. That's the kind of stuff that I do, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know in terms of that and I made sure that I had everything that I could think of factored in, you know? That was you know vaguely important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's not, you know something that ... most of my problems aren't as easy as that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. Actually I imagine it was kind of a pleasure to have one that was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's you know, it's two hundred dollars cheaper by the way to drive to Cincinnati with a rental car than it is ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To take you car.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To take my car. My car uses special gas and it gets very poor mileage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not what it's for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So (pause) but, yeah so that's sort of a (pause) that's the kind of stuff I get a kick out of being able to do. Figure that out and make an informed decisions. A lot of times people are like, "Wow. That's really impressive." And I'm like, "You're kidding me, right? This is algebra and the factor labeled and that's it." This is not hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But a lot of people do get impressed with that kind of stuff. Which I don't really have feeling, an opinion one way or the other, other than being confused.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. (pause) But I just need more things in my life that I can actually, maybe not control but at least understand or at least predict slightly, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:21:59)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would like to know how long we're here, you know? I'm not talking about the precise month, I would just like know is this going to be one year, is it going to be five years, you know? I just want scale, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I can see how long it's going to be for something. (pause) And I don't really have a good estimate on most of that.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:22:44)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess there's something about (pause) wanting problems that you can like apply your mind too or ... I mean because a lot of these ... you're certainly not in control of, you know gas mileage and gas cost and types of gas and all that. But ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's predictable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Yeah it's like a (pause) just the sort of thing you tackle. (pause) And clearly it's the problems that it can't that are (pause) so difficult.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So. And the thing that's more frustrating is it's not a matter of the fact that my mind can't work them out, it's just that there is so much chaos in it that it's not really predictable at all by anybody, you know? (pause) And so (pause) it's ... because occasionally I do ask other people's opinions on such things. It's not like I'm the one that's making the (inaudible_ 00:24:14), you know? That some things are just calculatable, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>(00:24:20)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and (pause) your mind is mostly useless when it comes to things like not becoming cranking when you're in pain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or beyond a certain point being able to manage how much pain you're in. Not that you're doing everything you can but after that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's only so much that you can do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean there's some level of there's certain amounts of ... there are certain tradeoffs that I can do. But they're not (pause) you know they're not as cut and dry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Like I can potentially go on steroids temporarily too relief some amounts of pain. But then it causes a whole out slew of other problems related to it. Therefore, it's not something I like to do, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. How it completely sucks either way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you have to make decisions as to what kind suck you're willing to put up with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. No absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess maybe that helps a little bit but (pause) either way there's a lot that isn't (pause) susceptible to being figured out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So for me it's just deciding what kind of suck you're willing to deal with basically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Can you handle being sick to your stomach? Can you handle like having less of an immune system and potentially pickup pneumonia on a regular basis?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like these are different things that are like these are different tradeoffs that you'll have, you know? Because one of the things they do treat you with and I do it now but not a whole lot of it is chemotherapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And although the great majority ... it's such a low dose of Methotrexate that it's not really ... the great majority of people don't get nauseas from it, I get nauseas as all get out from it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:26:24)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so you know I did the tradeoff I've been sick to my stomach all the time and then also potentially I've been having problems with my teeth from throwing up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Trading that off with, you know having less arthritic pain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much do you throw up when you're (inaudible_00:26:37)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) Couple of times a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Is it worth trading that out for the arthritic pain or not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it doesn't get rid of it entirely it just makes it manageable. And one of the other ... you know one of the other tradeoffs is, you know is Enbrel which again I take but I don't take it in high doses. Which basically ... one of them ... it has two side effects. One of which it blocks your body's ability to discover cancer. My doctor, she said, "It's not a matter if you will get cancer. It's a matter of when." Because you get cancer all the time in your life. You constantly get these, you know these (inaudible_00:27:20) cells and basically it's whatever, you know, tumor necrosis factor beta. Basically your body figures out there's tumors and gets rid of it. It quenches ... basically gets that whole system and shuts it down. And so, you know it's a matter of, you know trading off that which is a problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it also unfortunately interferes with your ability deal with your respiratory infections. And so actually there's a great majority of people ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Getting pneumonia?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You get community acquired pneumonia.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although I've been vaccinated for pneumococcal whatever, you know the actual bacteria, that's one of dozens of things that get into your body and cause pneumonia? So, you know? Again tradeoffs, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:28:12)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just (pause) ugly tradeoffs and people ... it's just not like getting it, people die from it a lot. I mean they've already gotten real funny about like giving this stuff out because people don't realize how pneumonia gets.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It can kill you now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. So and there's a new one out that apparently the only really bad things is you get AIDS like lesions all over you. Now I'm not sure if I'm going to trade that part off because I don't really know how bad that is in terms of you burning and feeling terrible for having lesions all over your body.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's just on your immune system you end up getting those kind of things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like there's no easy answer. And (pause) yeah, so I sort of have to pick one and make a decision on it. Kind of a pain in the ass. (pause) So. And it's a pain in the ass it's like, you know it's like I can't predict, you know a whole lot about my health or you know or one minute to the next, you know? I just hate being like this, you know? I like to be reliable. I don't like to be this person who is like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know I don't feel very well kind of thing. (pause) So (pause) it's kind of frustration and anger with that because it's like (pause) it's possibly the thing that I am the most powerless too of all the things. I could in theory make decisions in my life to rid myself of other external influences whether or not I want to make those decisions is a different story. But I can't decide to divorce myself from my immune system, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could just stop speaking to people who are crappy to me, you know? Or I could just do something else, you know? In terms of you know jobs but this is one thing that I cannot get away from. So. I must have, you know frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. I just (pause) I'm sick and tired of feeling sick and tired and down and everything, you know? (pause) I just want a couple of days where it's not like that.</p>

<p>(00:30:31)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Or feel like your old self.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who is like the kind of person you want to be and feel comfortable being.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know? Very much so. And so (pause) (sigh) I just also you know just (pause) part of it is that I don't like to dwell on it. I don't know. It just ... I'm not sure although I am talking about it I'm not really sure if talking about it is really going to help, you know? Something that (pause) you don't really have (pause) it's very hard to feel (pause) like you can make progress on something that is a degenerative disease, you know? (pause) In terms of picking feeling, you know that kind of stuff. And it just ... I don't know. (pause) (sigh) I'm not doubting, it's just I'm especially feeling very low about the whole thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe just (inaudible_00:32:01) and eventually will be like that. It just ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I expect that (pause) right there's some (inaudible_00:32:07) happens and I think I've seen some of this already with you. I think you're more patient with yourself on your reactions. Like you're less self-critical and a little more comfortable with being cranking, pissed off, down, negative, out of control, unable to think your way through things (pause) than you were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just when you're in the middle of something right now where you just feel so crappy ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very hard to see any progress in this. Just because ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel like you get anywhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My perspective on things is totally flawed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have a really good way to be able to see the, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you suggesting that when you're feeling really down, angry, and upset you might not be entirely clear sighted ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Balance in your view?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds plausible to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That sounds very plausible. It's just that (pause) knowing that there is progress I just can't see it and that, you know things will get better. It's just sometimes hard because I've had to do that whole thing of things are going to get better, keep wanting things for all my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well some things will and some things won't I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pardon me, I'm going to ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Turn this off. Yeah. (pause) It is for some things will not but maybe my ability to tolerate them will get better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? (pause) I hope. (pause) I just, like I said just for right now because I'm feeling so crummy. I'm just sort of (pause) not especially optimistic. (pause) You know? (pause) But (pause) I guess, you know see how things go. (pause) When I was in here the last time, you know the concept you were talking about the fact that, yeah I put off so many things to later in life because I'll always have plenty of time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Knowing that I did that and I didn't is really a bleak thing to have to really ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Come to terms with.</p>

<p>(00:34:45)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's haunted me a lot, you know? And it probably always do but I would like to make sure it's less so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. (pause) What have you been thinking about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well just ... you know (pause) nothing very specific but just, you know last Tuesday just sort of put me in a bad mood. I mentioned it to my husband a little bit. More than a little bit but that kind of thing and (pause) which was okay I think. I'm not entirely certain that sometimes like that though really ... mention that kind of thing is of anyway positive to do so though because it just makes him feel worse because he's pretty much decided it's all his fault. And I'm like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible_00:35:45)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's all kind of things that are not his fault that he's decided are his fault. Like really deeply irrational things. Like, you know my pain, you know? And then he gets subconsciously angry at me for thinking ... for making him think it's his fault. I'm like no way did I ever say that. In fact I've actually said this is not your fault.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yet, you know it's (pause) the conscious Mike and the subconscious Mike, you know are two very, very different people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I spend a lot of time battling over him being bitter at me for things that I never did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Either because I wasn't that person or because I never, you know implied ... he had decided that I thought, felt, you know at least something that way. Not necessarily cognitively but subconsciously and then him being angry at me for it, you know? And so it's an uphill battle, you know? I don't know if he'll ever get better. I hope so because I'm really sick of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:36:52)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm not that person. Never have been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so. (pause) I (pause) just wish I knew what I needed to do to prove that I wasn't, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well and this is also very constraining to you in that you're thinking about something, you know that's really upsetting and bleak.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it becomes all about him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You can't talk about it because it becomes ... right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If feels like a self pity thing, yeah. That happens a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so (pause) (sigh) Yeah. (pause) I'd like to believe it's going to get better. I think it might get better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least we'll condition him not to, you know at least ... I don't know. I don't really know. (pause) The only thing I can think of is that he had to have had a really horrifying childhood that he is (pause) terrified that things that aren't his fault, that are not, things are not his fault but they are. Not like, "Oh it's my fault my parents are getting divorced." But as in like, "It's my fault that my mother is like struggling financially." Or, "It's my fault that mother hates men or something." I don't know. It's not even like normal kid divorce crap. It's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know his sister used to give him a hard time for coughing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. (pause) So (pause) it's just ... it's because I'm the person that's there and nobody else is. It's just kind of frustrating, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Please hold on. Let me make sure this is not super important. No one ever calls me or texts me. (pause) Meeting was cancelled, no one told me. Okay, whatever. (pause) But (pause) you know it can be kind of frustrating. So the ... you know? We'll get through this, I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>(0039:19)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (pause) yeah in general (pause) you know certainly like the worst somebody's had or they've been affected by things they grew up with and sort of the way you're talking about (pause) the (pause) more difficult it becomes the more he's going to take it out without kind of thinking you need too. Or a way that would because he wants too on the people that they're closest with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm under the impression that there aren't that many they he's close (inaudible_00:40:12).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: His friends. It's really (cross talk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He does really have any friends at the time. He used to have a lot of very close friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But not so much, you know around here. And part of the thing is that you know, so much of this is isolating, so he doesn't want too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the ... yeah pretty much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know people nearby pretty much though is you know? Also I think it's also he cannot ... he's been already like conditioned into, if he gets angry or has any ill feelings towards certain members of the family that's going to be it. Because he is no longer going be, you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Allowed in there. And they've done it. They've done ... there is valid reason to believe that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. I mean his mom and him just after she said she wasn't interested in like hearing about day anymore or his interests you know, and he said I really not all that interested in the mortgage industry they just decided not to talk anymore at dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is creepy. (pause) You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. When was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh when he was like fourteen or fifteen, you know? She interrupted him while he was talking about something about his day or something about one of his interests and she's like, "I'm not really all that interested in this." And he says, "Well you know I listen to your day and what you talk about because it's polite." And She said, "Oh I had no idea. Well we'll just stop that then too."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah that's horrible and crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The more ... I used to be very reserved about this and talked about it in a more like clinical level. The more I talk about this the more I'm using the word monster and like other words that are vague and more emotionally charged, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it just (pause) it's (pause) becoming more and more obvious how deeply disturbing whatever happened in there, there is, you know?</p>

<p>(00:42:13)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And how much they're still trying to whitewash this crap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they're all, you know (pause) unwilling to admit that anything went wrong, you know? (pause) But, you know? (pause) It's ... it hasn't ... and it's sort of being ... his mom often said that there was only two men in the world that she even remotely like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Only two straight men. Straight men because it's different or gay men. Only two straight men in the world that she could tolerate their presence with. Now mind you the gay men she doesn't really spend much time around but straight men are born and like to her other people. Just like that's what they do. Was Mike and Mike's grandfather.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know his mother's father. And now that like there's this massive amount of neglect from that and the things (pause) I think it's just sort of unraveling him. Because it's ... Mike had always just sort of thought, "Okay it just must be me." It's like, you know, "She's, again claiming that she's doing it for other people like it's good teaching self reliance, doing this, doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know for Mike, but also like giving Mike's grandfather dignity and space and privacy and things like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? It's justified under these wonderful terms.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's easier for him to see how horrible it is when done to his grandfather see how it's more perfected on him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because he's not ... you know he's seeing it from farther away, you know. And seeing that nobody gives a damn. And so (pause) sort of replaying out on a different scale you in front of us via the phone calls, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We're going to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I will see you Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On Tuesday but not Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

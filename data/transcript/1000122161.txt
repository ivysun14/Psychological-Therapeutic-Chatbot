<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 16, session 16.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where are you moving to?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:00:10.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard (inaudible at 0:00:15.8) the [last time] (ph). But it might be worth mentioning since it's sort of (inaudible at 0:00:27.1) been on my mind. I got all involved over the weekend with a motorcycle and I was going to go down and take my motorcycle test.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was again a project, so (inaudible at 0:00:37.8) you know, it's all consuming. I was really involved in it. So Monday morning I had forgotten about this and I went down for the - and I didn't pass the test.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, wow, it's bothered me ever since.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bothered you that you didn't pass it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's the most ridiculous thing. It just shows again that I'm, you know, entirely oriented on achievement. And that was achievement that involved all of me, you know, all my side (ph) moments when I was thinking about (inaudible at 0:01:03.7) my mind is wandering I'd think about that. 0:01:05.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Think about the test. And I failed it and the interesting thing was I didn't fail it out of any disability of my own. It was lack of communication between myself and the inspector and kind of tester (ph). And it's not something catastrophic, I'll just go down and take it and pass it again, I'm sure I can do it. But it's just typical, it bothered me, you know? It gave me a heavy feeling for a couple of days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And of all the most ridiculous things, but there again, there was something well defined. And I had put this weight and this importance on it, and I didn't make it, so it bothered me. Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you mean you're disgusted it's bothering you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I thought that's - well, I think I pretty much decided what my basic motivations are and kind of what I'm going to do about. However, there's something that's been bothering me much more, and that I'll get to in a minute, but anyhow, this sort of fits in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just shows that I am, you know, very achievement oriented. And one of the achievements or goals I was after was in - to get along with other people and in - to meet that end is why I came here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:02:19.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I realize that now. However, something else has been bothering me, and that is why should I now begin to talk about the sexual problem again?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why should you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was something I had written off much earlier, we had discussed and it didn't bother me anymore. However, well, we've got 20 sessions, right, now we're in the teens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe that's the reason I came here, you know.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It certainly bothered me on many occasions. And maybe the real thing was that I came here to discuss that. And I thought, well, I've got - initially, maybe (ph) I said, well, I've got to discuss it, I've got to bring it up and I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I brought it out and we talked about it. And then I said, well, we talked about it. But I don't think I really solved anything, at least in my own mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now at times - well, not growing short yet, but I certainly have taken care of - or at least I know what the other basic problems are. And at this problem I really - really I don't think in my own mind it's solved. And I think just by the nature of - that it's a sexual problem, it's something that I'm reluctant to talk about or have been reluctant to talk about.</p>

<p>And it was brought up initially. I brought it up, I talked about it and I came to a pseudo conclusion that I felt comfortable with. And it was completely out of my mind as far as our relationship is concerned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:03:53.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: However...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now it's come back into your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the fact that I talked about it in the last session has brought it back to my mind and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you mean the fact that you talked about it somehow then made you think about it more afterwards?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, why would I have brought it up? I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. And so I now really think that my entire intent might have been more based around this than it was around the other thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, this might have been in the back of your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, now the other thing I kind of - I'm not satisfied yet with the other - what we've been talking about for almost all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not satisfied that I've accomplished what I want to accomplish. But I think I am satisfied that I know why I behave the way I do. And I know what I would like to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it might take some while for me - I'll either, in the next year or so or two years, I will either succumb and realize that it's unchangeable and live with it, or I will try to change that particular aspect of myself, you know, that particular way of behavior. But this, I feel no contentment about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In what we're talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, you talked about it, but you didn't get anywhere with it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you just feel...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the conclusion we came up with is that everyone has fantasies, and it's not unusual for someone to do this. My actions certainly haven't been abnormal, I don't think anyhow. Well (inaudible at 0:05:39.0) what's normal, that's ridiculous. My actions haven't been in my mind - have not deviated from what I would healthy sexual behavior in my own (inaudible at 0:05:48.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:05:50.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: So why should it bother me? But yet, it does, you know, because of the things that go through my mind and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because of things that go through your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, the fantasies.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So therefore - I mean, right now it's fine, it's easy, I (inaudible at 0:06:06.7) nice conclusions. I mean, I couldn't come up with the ones that came up before. That it is a fantasy and everyone has them, but yet, somehow...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That isn't very satisfying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, somehow I think that maybe everyone doesn't, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, maybe you're the only one that has them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no, maybe...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of the few?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe by virtue of the fact that I do - I am not in my mind healthy sexually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are in your mind what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Healthy sexually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, you aren't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Aren't, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aren't healthy, so it means you're what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, unhealthy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, I see what you're saying, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see, I have come to the realization that there is no really healthy and unhealthy absolute scale. But I'm the one I got to live with, so therefore, if I don't feel that I'm acting healthfully - I'm not acting normally. I hate to use that word, in my mind is normal, then it's going to bother me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:07:11.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's clearly something I can suppress. I mean, I did it for months.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you can not have those fantasies if you don't want them? You can stop them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe (inaudible at 0:07:23.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I can. Yeah, I guess I can. It seems to me as though the - well, I don't know what terms to use because I don't (inaudible at 0:07:37.3). But I would say the times that I feel bisexual are times when I feel more free about my behavior and my thoughts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that this would imply that, sure, it can be suppressed, but that's not really what's in there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What there's - yeah. There's something in there that would like to come out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I - yeah, you see, the thing is, like - well, let me just - (inaudible at 0:08:26.6). And it's also (inaudible at 0:08:30.1) to talk about it, it really is, with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Embarrassing you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know if it's embarrassing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I get - I don't know how I can - well, I get the feeling that this is something that one solves by oneself. And yet, I also - when I think not about it, but about other things, I think that the way to solve deep problems about myself is to bring them to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have those two things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The first one is that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: The sexual problems...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you should solve them yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's - yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, not should, that I'm (inaudible at 0:09:20.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I better take that. Hello, hi, I have a client right now. Well, I have another one at seven o'clock. Well, I guess after eight o'clock. I don't know, I've got to hang up. I might, yeah. Okay, goodbye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just - I don't know. Another thing is that I keep thinking that - well, it's down on tape, you know. This is something that should not be discussed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: For permanent record, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For - so tell me more, like, you mean you shouldn't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just, I don't know, I guess just the fact that we are taping it, you know, makes it something that's something else, you know? Something that one shouldn't discuss.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:10:23.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something more serious or something that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see, it's all of the mystique that you're brought up with, you know, those are private matters and should not be discussed. And anytime anyone's, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anyone's listening, like the tape?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the standard plot in a - well, (inaudible at 0:10:48.9). "Advise and Consent" where the guy 40 years earlier had some homosexual relationship, and it came out, you know, and it was a letter or something. And I get the feeling that this is just some way or recording a problem of mine, and it's hard to talk about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some way or recording?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we are now recording a problem of mine. I mean, even if that machine were not working, just the thought in my mind that - that bothers me. 0:11:20.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would it bother you - you mean if the machine were turned off, then you would feel somewhat better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Yeah, I think I would, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But nevertheless, I don't think there would be much more that I'd mention.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, frankly, it does bother me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But anyhow...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels more public I guess?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, anyhow, here - this is what's bothering me lately and I just don't know what to do about it. I - the only major conclusion that I've come to about it is - well, I haven't really come to it. I'm on the verge of coming to the conclusion that that's the reason I came here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As opposed to the other problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But this was the real reason for your coming?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That this was really in your mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:12:34.0) that question what that means to you for that to have been the reason that you came here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it means that I have a deeper problem than I made out to have. And I kidded myself about. Well, I kidded myself. I think that there were basically two things on my mind. And I think that the realization of the other, that is the (inaudible at 0:13:04.1) the sexual problem, the other problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Realization of the other problem, which I finally came to gave me a motive to come here and mention the sexual problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then when I got here I was - I mentioned both and came to a quick conclusion about the sexual problem, and beat to death the other problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:13:28.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think we've gone at it from every possible side I think. And now as we get farther along in our work, it crops up again. And (inaudible at 0:13:41.9). It just sort of cropped up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess you're saying, I was saying to myself this isn't a very big concern of mine, sexual thing. But now it seems like it really is a deeper concern.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, I think it's - yeah, all right, fine, yeah, all right. The very superficial level I was writing it off and solving the problem, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's sort of like, if you have a certain amount of time, do a certain amount of work and just leaving the worst for last. And you've got all these little things to get to first.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When you get to them and solve them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this now feels like the worst?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So far?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, and I just don't know enough about it. I just don't know, you know, to know what to consider about sexual behavior. I suppose I should (inaudible at 0:14:37.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, you don't know what to think of your...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know how serious what you feel is or how...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, I don't know. I - well, I just am at a complete loss. I mean, I don't know whether we should continue discussing this or we should come up with the same conclusion we came up with before. 0:15:13.4</p>

<p>(Phone Ringing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I see what you're talking about, my keys, weren't we, something like that. Oh, yes, and following up the whole - well, (inaudible at 0:16:38.2). I might as well fight my entire fears about the tape recorder and continue with a more explicit picture.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what it is about - well, first of all, while I have this problem, I keep as sort of a - I wouldn't say as an experiment, but more of a return to normalcy. I've seen June a couple of times. And I can't feel bad about it because she knows my feelings, she does, we've talked about them. She knows that I'm never going to - she knows I'm going to leave the country in a year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mention (inaudible at 0:17:24.7). And so she knows I'll never be anything permanent about it. So there, laid it down, lay down the law, but still.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Totally honest about it and still she wants to see you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I really can't feel bad. I almost try to make myself feel bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you really don't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think I do. I don't think I feel bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, you feel like you've been as honest as you could about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and even on that token, you know, she's been, all her life has been not too - well, not very sexually free. And so since we haven't been seeing each other, I've been something relatively new for her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, yeah, she (inaudible at 0:18:19.9) sex, she's quite active. And so I keep having to return to normalcy, and I kind of look at it as I say, well, there, I can behave that way. I can behave better sexually in a perfectly normal way and enjoy it. And, yeah, fine, so that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's relieving you mean too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be able to have normal sexual (inaudible at 0:18:44.4) with her? 0:18:45.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet, well, I certainly don't see her every night. I've seen her maybe once or twice a month.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so when I masturbate I have the fantasies that don't exist when I'm having heterosexual rather than self sexual relations (inaudible at 0:19:04.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes a difference in the way that you look at it, I mean, since...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if it makes - it just (inaudible at 0:19:11.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you noticed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just telling you a phenomenon. That I - there is no bisexual fantasy. There is nothing besides heterosexual desires and actions and thoughts when I'm with June. So it's baffling, I don't know - yeah, I must admit, it's sort of been as an experiment, you know? But I sort of behave - well, that I see June not only for a sexual outlet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But as an experiment about how...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just to see...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sexual things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to see how I behave sexually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, to see what it's like when you're having a sexual relationship with somebody as opposed to what it's like when you're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have no doubt that if I do ever have a deeper relationship with someone - well, first of all, I mean to say that when I have had deep relationships, I've really been slow, unbelievably slow, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Slow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't advanced myself sexually at all. With - when I first develop an affection and then I love someone - well, again, I only have really maybe one or two instances to draw from as an adult (inaudible at 0:20:32.7) consider it. You know, non-adult (inaudible at 0:20:40.0) thoughts or actions. However - and I don't think that if I ever went into a relationship with someone that was going to be deep that I would have advanced as suddenly as - well, had become sexual active (inaudible at 0:20:55.9) with June. So that kind of fouls things up too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how does it foul things up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it sort of makes me wonder about what our relationship is. June's and mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Makes you wonder why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's purely a sexual thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that makes you wonder (inaudible at 0:21:16.1)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes me wonder about my sexual behavior. You know, if I can isolate it so much, it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I don't...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What does it mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you're asking yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I don't know what it means.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's sort of like, you know, I'm being, I don't know - it's always nice to isolate problems. Just don't confound things with all sorts of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, keep them simple.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and that's a simple relationship with anything (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. I'm sorry, I really don't get - you know, I'm having trouble because something - some (inaudible at 0:21:57.9). But so that may be the problem. I'm really sorry, but I'm trying to concentrate on what you're saying too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's all right, I understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm not quite sure what you're saying about the fact that you have that kind of relationship with June. It makes you feel concerned about yourself or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I - first of all, I mean to say that I haven't got anything really figured out about it. (Inaudible at 0:22:24.9) thought about...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's confusing you mean? 0:22:25.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All I can do is bring up facts, you know. And I haven't really settled about what the facts mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: However, I know that I have isolated this as a sexual relationship in my mind. And I use it as really an experiment. I see if I can behave, quote, "normally" sexually, and indeed I can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet there are times when I don't when I have these bisexual fantasies and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you just don't have it all put together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean, I don't even have it pulled all apart.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, don't have sorted out either, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to think if there's anything else (inaudible at 0:23:05.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I - no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What - yeah, go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See, I have this - I think the problem is this, that I realize that a completely true and honest society, you know, who are sexually honest, Samoa or ancient Greece, whatever, I would not behave the way I am now. I just have that feeling that I would be bisexual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You just feel because of these particular (inaudible at 0:23:44.3)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I think if there were no sexual taboos in my mind because of the fact that I've been brought up in 20th Century America; that I would not behave the way I'm behaving now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that now like when you think right now of who you would be sexually attracted to? Do you feel like attracted to men?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's - hey, there's another good point. I'm glad you brought that up because that's another fact. I'm not sexually attracted to men unless I'm sexually aroused.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:24:18.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Walking down the street, the last thing I'd do was look at a man. However, when I am sexually excited and then some of the fantasies that I slip into involve homosexual relationships.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As well as heterosexual relationships.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes simultaneously. So I think that might be a more honest me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now you see - all right, now that I have that - that's a definite feeling. That if there were no taboos that's how I would behave. But now I've got to live with taboos.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now whether or not I am going to obey society's taboos or forget about society and worry about myself is another thing I got to wrestle with. I think by virtue of the other problem, I'm going to come to grips with societal standards rather than personal standards. And June is sort of a confirmation that I can do that, and not be uncomfortable with my sexual station in life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean she's an example that you can have a relationship with a woman?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And still be satisfied with that, is that what you mean? Not be uncomfortable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, I - yeah, I think I can - as a matter of fact, knowing that - if I were living with June, let's say, all right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I don't think the problem would really occur. Because anytime I wanted a sexual outlet, I'm sure that it would be a heterosexual one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if heterosexual things are available, then you would never probably?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I think that is because I have - it's been drilled into my head that the only healthy sexual relationship is a heterosexual one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, so it might be out of habit or what you've learned is right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I'm certainly not homosexual, I know that for a fact because of the pleasure I get out of heterosexual relations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But is it really more healthy for me to behave as all of my desires and to be bisexual, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something else came up and I want to - I mention it now because - well, I was (inaudible at 0:27:11.1) Tom Mitchell was a psychiatrist. And I couldn't help but think when his client came in of our relationship, as I have anytime I've seen it. Psychiatric relationship exist and it started out very similar that (inaudible at 0:27:30.9) started talking. And Tom Mitchell would just, you know, sort of prod him along and say, well, talk, talk, talk, you know? Sort of settle things down and re-summarize when a person maybe was getting confused or remind him of what other conclusions he'd come to.</p>

<p>But then after the guy had sort of gotten everything out, Mitchell came up with a conclusion. And they were right, I mean, as far as the movie was concerned, which of course was much shallower than this could be because of time and everything. And he was coming with the conclusions and they fit. And they were something that the client couldn't come up with, he just couldn't. And I said, wow, would that be nice, you know, to just spew it out for months and months and months.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then have me come in and tell you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and if you could just say you behave this way because, and this is what you're going to have to live with. And this is what you're going to have to do if you want to, you know, be comfortable with yourself. And this is the way you feel about this, don't you see that those are your motivations? Therefore, you know, live with the motivations, realize them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have - well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, hmm, do this, this is how to settle it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it wasn't so - yeah, all right, yeah. But you see, the thing was Mitchell never said do this because this is the only thing to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said - he sort of said - let's see, he came up with conclusions that were consistent with the client's mode or method of doing things and dealing with things in his lifestyle, so that it's probably the same thing we're going to end up with. But they were trickier conclusions and of course, I couldn't see them initially because, you know, I didn't under - well, you can't with the little bit of time that you see on a screen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But you mean they were how to do things or how to live that would fit in with what would really make that guy happy? 0:29:32.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Given the rest of his life (inaudible at 0:29:33.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, and it worked, which is, you know, all - you know, it was a great ending in a movie (inaudible at 0:29:38.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you thought, boy, would I love to have that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because it's really been a burden, you know? Of course, I don't know, I guess...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A burden to try to come to all the decisions yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like there are times when I come here when I'm torn between certain things that I just can't come up with the conclusion. I'm just sort of shooting off my mouth and maybe I'll come up with them before the hour is over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Other times, especially towards the initial stages when I came up with conclusions, and I was just here to tell you about them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And of course, the very initial stage when I was giving facts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In this relationship that I saw, facts were given, feelings were given and not so much the motivations. And then Mitchell came up with the motivations and how they fit in. And (inaudible at 0:30:28.1) explain why that happened. Of course, his problem was much more exotic. I don't know, well, let's see. That was a different (inaudible at 0:30:39.6). The guy had - he was - well, he - I guess the word is pederastic (sp) tendencies. He liked little girls. I think - well, it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>But anyhow, yeah, I watched that and I said, oh, that would be so nice. Because it's not so much that you don't do it, it's just that things settle so well when Mitchell analyzed them and figured them out. And there was no question about that is the way it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, yeah, it sounds like for you so many doubts and so many questions are always left.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so many...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I never leave the room feeling really comfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: About any conclusions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel finished, I got this out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, as a matter of fact - well, the way I initially started. There's nothing I really have about the first problem. I just know what I'm going to live with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know how to watch for developments in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In that particular aspect. So there's nothing that's a real...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing definitive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, well, no, it's - I don't know if nothing definitive is the right word. Nothing that I came - nothing like his problem, that is, he came in with a problem. He found out the source of the problem and he was told the conclusion and the answer to the problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I came in with a problem, I realize the problem, I realize what I'm going to have to do to either live with the problem or to either solve the problem. And how anytime I confront this again, what to expect and what I can do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now that isn't what happened with Mitchell.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he came in with a problem and - although at the end of the movie he didn't overcome it and (inaudible at 0:32:27.1) years. It was clear that he was going to overcome it. There was no question, (inaudible at 0:32:33.0) normal. Well, yeah, that was - it was very - it was comfortable to see that in him and uncomfortable in (inaudible at 0:32:43.7) what we do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, in our relationship not...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would just love to come in here some time and not know at all what's going to happen. And just to sit down and have you explain for one hour what has happened in the last 15 hours or whatever it is. And plus to have it, you know, follow as the night to day, and everything would be nice and neat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it would all make sense and everything would be fine. But... 0:33:17.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:33:17.2) you know, the unsettled quality of it is really very - not quite unsettled but, you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like (inaudible at 0:33:24.7) was talking, I think it was about, you know, putting pieces together in a puzzle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be nice if they would all fit together neatly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you're saying here is, you know, that doesn't really happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or lots of pieces out, but they don't all...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it would really be nice if I'd do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it - is most work done - well, I don't know. I know - I'll tell you what my conception is. There are different schools and this is just one of them. That is that the problems are basically solved by the client with the help of his - well, analyst or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Yet, the concept of, you know, the couch and the notepad and the guy with the beard is - I don't think - well, I imagine it's hardly used today where the guy comes in and talks for a little while and then the psychiatrist goes through everything, and straightens them all out and walks out of there fine, or $29 an hour or whatever. Fine, so those are two extremes.</p>

<p>Now the question, is it - are there many varying degrees in between or are most like us? Are most (inaudible at 0:34:47.4)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think - I don't have - I don't - you know, I only know - don't have much firsthand experience, you know, in a way. But, yeah, I think that some are much more like that than others. 0:34:57.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not as though, you know, I'm saying, well, I really feel bad about what's happened because I don't (inaudible at 0:35:04.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think I am. I'm just saying that it's been a burden, it really has.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A burden in the sense it feels very heavy responsibility on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but then I realize that that's the only way it's going to be done. I mean, you can't come in - you can't expect a guy that's messed up to come in and say, well, (inaudible at 0:35:28.3) this is why I messed up. And then straighten it out. And you go out walking in the world a new man. That isn't going to happen. The problem is going to be solved by the person, especially...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm wondering if you're having, like, mixed feelings about - like in a way you feel, yes, it's true, it has to be solved by you. But the way you tell a story makes me think that you're also thinking, well, but you really could solve it if you would just help me out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're right about mixed feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The second part is not the alternative. The alternatives are number one, what we're doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not that you really could solve it, but that you could change your approach to some other one's approach. It's not a matter of you being able to solve it or not. It's what...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What could I do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's - well, apparently, you could change all you know about the way you treat a client and do it a different way that would be easy on me. I don't think it has anything to do with anything except an approach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it would be ridiculous to change an approach now either on your scale, you know, the way you developed in your field or on our scale in considering what has transpired, and what will transpire in the next few sessions. So, no, yeah, sure, I have doubts, you know, about how I feel about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:36:58.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really think I probably would feel better if I could have come in and been - then been told.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Been told, say what about this sexual thing, like told what for example?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that's a good point. You see, that's probably why. That's probably why these two things came up in the same session.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I would preface it by saying another thing, and maybe it's not another thing. Maybe it's the same thing. Now I got no answer. And now while I'm beginning to realize maybe this is the problem that I came in for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have no answer to it. Now I think, all right, fine, I've done what I can, can you help?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you mean you're feeling much more lost about this whole thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And much more - really more helpless to do anything with it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that's what makes you say, come on, please help me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I feel like the way maybe I could help you with it right now is helping you to explore that more. I haven't really heard that much specifically about it even.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you see, it's so hard for me to talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Has it - it's still...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What can I say, you know? I just have trouble being any more specific. I have fantasies of being bisexual, of having (inaudible at 0:38:44.7) developing female parts, then of them being erotic zones, erosion as well, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even know the words in this field (ph). And I have fantasies during masturbation of making love to a man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's basically what occurs. I simply have trouble talking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can see it's hard, yeah. And there - you mean, while they're going on...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, now let me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay, go ahead. 0:39:30.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not just as well - well, they immediately cease upon climax.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Immediately, and they only occur when I'm sexually aroused.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. They don't start ahead of time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:39:48.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I go to bed and I realize that I'm going to masturbate, then after a while I will begin these fantasies, and then upon climax they will no longer exist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just between those two points?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they're very real. I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, my - yeah, well, I don't how I could be more explicit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're saying that, like, you really - those fantasies and you enjoy those when they're going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sure, certainly, certainly...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you find them really exciting when they're going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think a sexual fantasy, that's what it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what a sexual fantasy is and you think about it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then afterwards, you look back at it and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, afterwards, now I sort of look back on it. I used to look back on it and think, oh boy, what's wrong?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now that (inaudible at 0:40:46.7) happen again. Now it has never happened when I've been with June.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I even, you know, tried to see, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tried to have a fantasy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah - no, I even explored to see if her touching my breast was pleasing to me. And it wasn't, it was no different when she touched my left shoulder or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whereas when I'm masturbating it can be pleasing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have this thing in my mind where I become - I develop female - feminine organs. 0:41:23.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, I see. So that's part of the fantasies, thinking of yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As becoming a woman.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and - yeah, that's. I haven't been smoking that much, but it occurred the first time since I smoked. And it hasn't occurred since then when I haven't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It's occurred when you haven't smoked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't why. It's sort of occurred - yeah, it sort of occurred when I was studying. But I didn't bring it up because it didn't occur that often because I was often up late studying, I would just go to sleep, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it didn't occur often because I wasn't masturbating often.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [That's clear] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think the problem ever really stopped - ceased.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might have suppressed it as far as our discussions have gone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, but it didn't stop happening?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it only went down to frequency as a function of my sexual activity going down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how I could be more explicit, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, how did you feel like talking about it just then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I felt like I - every time I mention somebody - well, do I have to be this explicit, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And think it was tape recorded, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, it was a strainer (ph) and it seemed like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Working hard to be that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and I could be more explicit, but there's no point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that's the essence of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, in the same way it's hard to talk about it, is it hard to think about it in yourself or is that different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, it's not hard to think about it at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, just talking about it with somebody?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and no matter how much I think - you see, the other problem that I thought about - I think I had, what, seventeen conclusions to it during the course of our work. And maybe two or three each week, I don't know. I think I've finally come up with something that I feel is honest and feels kind of settled. But boy, this one, you know, I can think about it any time of the day and I can't come up with any conclusions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it that you're trying to come up with? What kind of conclusion are you trying to come up with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, that's the point, you see, it's something that I don't feel comfortable about. It's something that doesn't ring true. It's something that doesn't make sense. It's something that is not what I consider healthy for myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something that seems abnormal to you? 0:44:06.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, so I'm looking...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the sense in which you mean inside it doesn't ring true? It doesn't make sense or is it something else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, I think that's the sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's it, that it seems like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, if honestly is my (inaudible at 0:44:24.4), why don't I be bisexual, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying one of the decisions then is, do I want to act on this in my life, is that it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you see, I - yeah, and right now of course I can say no, of course not. It's not healthy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not healthy to act on it, is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, it's not healthy...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not healthy to feel that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not healthy to become bisexual. It's healthy to remain exclusively heterosexual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In your action or in your feeling you're talking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My actions, my feelings, I certainly have bisexual feelings (inaudible at 0:44:59.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now let me just say this, that there are two distinct ways I feel about it, absolutely as different as day and night. And one is right now, and 99.9 percent of the time when it's not happening, and the other time is when I'm going through this period. And I feel that, well, my gosh, if this is me why not live with it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see, I don't think I will ever put myself in a situation where with another person, I could have a sexual relation, I just don't think I will.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Another male.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, you can't see...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because right now, I just say, that is not healthy, that is not the way one behaves. And yet, I feel very strongly that that is something I should do on occasion when I have these fantasies and tendencies.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way you talk about it, it sounds like you feel, but (inaudible at 0:45:53.8) times like you're denying yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you don't act on them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, definitely. And again, it only occurs when I'm sexually stimulated. 0:46:04.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yeah, I don't feel good about it at all when it's finished.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Initially I felt reviled by it, now it's suddenly coming to the front, just still not be - not like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Say, well, that happens once again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, once again, is that sort of (inaudible at 0:46:27.5) to it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then I keep saying, well, all I have to go and do is go see Tom Mitchell and she'll straighten it all out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then she doesn't and then you feel disappointed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's - yeah, I think that it's just something that I'm - you see, maybe this is it. Maybe the other problem is not - is, you know - they're just two separate problems that I've dealt with. And the other is merely - is something that's another problem. And both of them were things that bothered me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both of them were things that were deep in me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And one I have solved, talked to you about quite freely, no questions, no problems. And - well, you know what sense I mean solve?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Went through that twice today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The other; because of the fact that I have trouble talking with you about it - well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have trouble getting somewhere on it, is that way you mean? Because you feel...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I also have trouble talking to myself about it I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, that's what I - yeah. That's what I was wondering before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so therefore, I'm at this complete loss and then I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now what's the part of the trouble talking to yourself about it, what happens?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know what to talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I've gone over it and over it and over it and over it, and I just don't come up with anything different. What's the point, that I can go through it again, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, it's, like, somehow you get stuck in going around some kind of circles when you think about it yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's no even a circle, it's a dead end is a better word. And I don't ever...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just get stuck?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's no logical progression from one step to another. They're just facts, that's it. And I can come up with the facts and I can state them again. I can state them more explicitly, I can state them less explicitly. They are facts, I can come to no conclusion about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, but I'm not clear, like, what the conclusion is you're trying to come to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something that's comfortable, I'm not comfortable about it now. Any conclusion at all that would be comfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, so where you are now is - well, it sounds like a lot of places. One of them is, just not being - not feeling that it would be - I guess part of it is, like, you're still sort of unhappy that you even have those feelings, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, if you ask me right now, what would I like to have happen? I would like to have it never occur again, and to enjoy heterosexual relations from now on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would like just to wipe it out of your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I would like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, so it's just - the whole experience is just something that you would just love to get rid of? 0:49:17.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, yeah, but I can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, but that's one part of the whole problem or one part of the whole, discomfort?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is with...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even having it there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's clear - well, I don't know if that's (inaudible at 0:49:36.9). I really don't think that's going to be - what's going to happen, though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not going to be the ultimate fruits of our labor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Getting rid of - no, yeah - no, that isn't what I meant if that's what you thought. But I was trying to, like, clarify the parts of it that were upsetting you (inaudible at 0:49:57.0) one. I'm afraid we're going to have to stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll have to come in the back (ph) next time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sort of depends on - do you want to come - I don't think you'll have to come (inaudible at 0:50:11.9).</p>

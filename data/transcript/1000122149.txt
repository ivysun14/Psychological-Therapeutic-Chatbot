<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what, something that's really been — I've been thinking about lately is how I feel about coming into each session and how it's changed. Initially, of course, the first couple of times you just sort of feel your way out, you have no idea what's going to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then there was, of course, that stage when I was just cataloguing as much information as I possibly could.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't even think about — well, when I say what I'm thinking about coming into this session, I think about what I think you think about it. So initially, I was just sort of waiting — wait and see. And then there was that period where I was really excited about finding things and making them fit and all. And now, I look back on it and now especially, I can't see you being really fired up for every session. Say, oh boy, he's coming in again, that's great. Just that it's sometimes, like when I first came it really was exciting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now, I wouldn't say it's exciting. It's still, you know, it's a different stage though completely. And well, the one thing that's really on my mind is that I can't see that — I know I've said this before, but it just really lately has been getting to me. But I can't see that you could really, well, care too much because it doesn't seem to be that interesting a thing to me anyhow, except for that it's my life, I mean, to someone else. Like harder to explain to someone what was happening, they'd say, oh really, I mean, that sounds like something that (inaudible at 0:01:48.2). That's probably the least dynamic person that could happen to — thing that could happen to a person's psyche. [0:01:53.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like it doesn't seem very interesting to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're also concerned about that it's not — probably doesn't interest me very much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I mean, well, the thing — what goes on here is clearly a two person affair. I mean, it would be something really different if I were just here talking to myself and I'm not. And lately I've been thinking about your side of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's what I've come up with, is that if I were she I don't think I would — I wouldn't relish each session as I did initially when I first came. I wouldn't think it was exciting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. If you were — yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:02:39.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that do to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What does it do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To you if you think, well, she really probably isn't really excited by each session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know that it makes a lot of difference to me. I'm caught up in the thing and it really matters to me because it's me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And well, as far as setting the tone, 98 percent of it is me. I mean, I could come in here and just sit too and maybe you would have to dig or something. Or I could just come in here — like some days when I just keep ranting and raving on and on and on, no coherency to it at all. But that's only — as far as what, you know, actually transpires as far as the deeper what's happening, it's a two person thing. I mean, it is. [0:03:34.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, it would seem to me as though now that I realize that it is a two person thing, that your part of it can't really be — well, it's not something you'd write a paper about or something you'd write home about, that you have this exciting case, or if you did something like that I wouldn't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what I'm not sure of is, say...</p>

<p>PATIENT: How does that affect...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like does that make you angry that I'm not more...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no, of course not, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't something, but I'm not sure what it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, see, the thing is — now the point is not how I feel about how I think you feel, but the fact that I do feel that way. You see — no, there's no reaction to it pro or con on my part.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Totally neutral about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, it's not something you would react to that would matter in this case. But it seems to be some — I mean, it could go unsaid very easily.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's been on my mind, so that's why I always bring up, you know, whether or not it's the deepest thing, the thing that matters the most.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing that has presence of mind. And no, I don't really think it would, it certainly shouldn't. And I'm almost positive it doesn't matter, and yet, it's there all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it's somehow in your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About wishing that it were really important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I don't think that's the case at all. I don't think — I mean, I can blow it up and just make, you know, exaggerate things the way I do generally in life, and somehow make it more interesting I suppose, but that's not the point. The point is I know it doesn't matter to you. I mean, I could just tell. I mean, it wouldn't matter how you would treat the case if I were, you know, the most challenging person ever to come into your office. And you did the greatest thing towards straightening me out. And it took some very grave problems in my mind and helped me, you know, get through them. Or if I just came in here with small problems and you just help me. I don't think that would matter to you at all. [0:06:04.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think it would...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure it wouldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Affect me in any way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you're not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or be important to me in any way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think it would affect the way you behave in any way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, you would still do your best professionally, it's clear. But the point is, whether or not you do your best professionally, it's still how you feel about something will certainly come into it. I mean, you're also a person, you're not just, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right (inaudible at 0:06:35.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: A psychologist. So that I'm reacting more to this personal thing I think than I am to the psychologist thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I can't figure out what it is you're saying exactly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the point is that it's a feeling that I have that's really predominated lately.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't think it's going to — well, like I say, it could have gone unmentioned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the feeling is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the feeling is that — well, perhaps — well, when you go home tonight, you know, if you take your work home with you — I mean, in your head not papers or anything, that the ones you think about, the ones you're really wound up in, and really find fascinating or care about would not be me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The ones who (inaudible at 0:07:35.8)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the clients, I mean, assuming you have one. I don't know if you have one or a hundred. I mean, I know nothing about how (inaudible at 0:07:44.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow you feel like one of the least interesting people like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I would feel that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of it must be sort of like anonymous, something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much or unchallenging.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Again, that's untrue wouldn't affect, you know, how you would behave.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it affects how — yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the point, you know, you see that I can say it again and again that I don't think it will make any difference whatsoever, and yet, it still bothers me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, well, that's strange that it — I do have, you know, that competency and I still have that — the gnawing thing in me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The gnawing thing is it maybe it will make a difference?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no. The gnawing thing is that personally I don't think you really give a damn, but professionally, which is what we're here for, I have extreme, complete confidence in you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, but it's like if you really had it your way, you would like in some way to make some kind of impact on me personally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think — no, I — you see, what we're talking about in these sessions is me. And if I am not the type that would, you know, would be interesting to you as a psychologist, then so be it. I mean, I'm not going to, you know, try and make an impact on you by concocting some strange thing in my life, wouldn't even straighten out what exists.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, I'm either going to come in here and be that type of case or not, and I don't think I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Therefore, it sort of bothers me, but yet, still there's, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It bothers you that you're not that kind of a case. That you somehow...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because then you're making it sound like I want to be, you know, why don't I have some great hang-ups? Why aren't I (inaudible at 0:09:51.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought that's what you said a minute ago. [0:09:53.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I did? No, if I did (inaudible at 0:09:55.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unless I misunderstood you. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I probably worded it wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, the...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of a realization that you aren't that kind of case.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that bothers you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:10:06.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before I've said, you know, wasting your time, I think is (inaudible at 0:10:10.3). But I don't know that — you see there's a real live function going on. I mean, certainly I've changed and hopefully, you know, it will help me a lot. So that's what the sessions are all about, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's something like, oh, I'm taking the time when she could be spending with really fascinating type cases.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, more of a challenge to you as a psychologist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Like I'm not using all my muscles, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the point is it doesn't — I don't think it really affects anything that will happen. But it is on my mind, so I thought I'd bring it up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, enough said about that. [0:11:03.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you feel like you got your point across, like I heard you or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah (inaudible at 0:11:08.9). The other thing was — and I'm getting back to the problem at hand. I get this real deep feeling, bad one that no matter what happens, after I walk out of here (inaudible at 0:11:30.3) you know, number 20 on the tape, that no matter what has transpired that somehow I'm just going to slip back, that there's just no way. And one of the things that makes me feel this way is the real deep inner belief that if I don't pass this exam, I'll go to another school and I'm still going to get, you know, the same three letters after my name just at a different school in physics. And it's not because I want to, but because I'm trying to please other people who expect this of me, and I just cannot see myself not doing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't conceive of it. And yet, personally — if everyone I knew now died, I think my life would be completely different because I wouldn't have any expectations to live up to, their expectations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I would have no problems at all, yet, they won't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. And as long as they're alive, it's like you see yourself fitting into the pattern of what they...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, of what I have constructed. Now, clearly the best thing to do is to be honest and go to each one of them and say, look, this is not me and I straighten it all out. But I just cannot see myself doing that. Now, I can see myself, on the other hand, optimistically developing new friends. Going to the friends that I'm closed to, is two or three people that I have some sort of rapport with and deep feeling with. And, you know, telling them how my head is now and how I feel about things, and tell them, well, this is the way it is, and then develop a new set of friends from that point on in life without trying to, you know, create these goals that I will achieve.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Without developing in them expectations of me that I will then have to live up to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, those are the good and the bad sides, but boy oh boy, the bad side is really predominant now. I just — well, now, if that's the case, because the case that I can't change much, well then, I'll have to look back and see why is it so deep within me? Why is it so strong? And well, how far back do you go? I mean, to determine one's nature and, of course, it's clear that you go back as far as you can I think. Some kids that I've seen growing up have such a strong personality like when they're five, and you know it's not going to change. I mean, a kid that's bossy and spoiled then probably stay that way through most of his life or adolescence anyhow until he gets up to the point where he gets shot down. So I think that I'd have to go back to see, you know, why I'm so strongly this way, why so achievement oriented. And I come up with some nice trite things about my life that I suppose a lot of people come up with. And it's — well, I might as well mention it now that I (inaudible at 0:14:29.5). My father was never really close to us at all, my sister and I; we grew up together, she's two years older than I am. And the pre-school days I remember only the bad things about my father. I mean, his losing his temper and the bad things he said about me. [0:14:58.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he was really a bad father in those years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He was working hard and he — I was scared of him, I really was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There was strong fear there. He would say things that — oh, he was just so lack — a great lack of sensitivity. I was really skinny as a kid and he would say things about (inaudible at 0:15:20.5) how is he going to change the fact that he's skinny, you know, can't do it. Why should, you know — that's one thing to really avoid, you know. But my mother on the other hand would say — I want to finish my father. Since then, of course — of course, when you're a kid there's nothing really, maybe a — there is nothing really that a father could be proud about. He goes to school the first few years and everyone gets A's, so it doesn't matter too much. But then as I began to develop academic accomplishments and later athletic accomplishments, then he seemed to take interest. And now it's at the point where it's just amazing, he's just the complete opposite. He can't say anything bad about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And anyone I ever talked to knows me through him, knows everything about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet, initially, it was just the opposite (inaudible at 0:16:17.3) the case. Well, because of that I, of course, was a mama's boy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, (inaudible at 0:16:27.2) until I was 12 and was really close to her. And yet, gee, I can remember lying to her just really young. You know, she didn't impress that upon me that lying was, you know — well, she certainly said it, but somehow I didn't believe it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It didn't come through.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. And oh, I used to lie like a kid used to all the time. Got away with it quite a bit and lied to her quite a bit too. And yet, it was sort of feigning an affection because there were these lies. When you build a relationship on pretenses the relationship can't be very deep and I was, you know, getting away with a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. So you didn't have very deep feeling for her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, you know, just as much as a puppy would have for its mother dog and (inaudible at 0:17:18.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, she'd read us stories every night. But I don't really think there was — well, no, I don't think there was the kind of love that a lot of kids have for their parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was sort of a complete fear of my father and getting away with what I could with my mother. [0:17:39.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now — well, then the other one in those early years is, of course, my sister, 18 months older than I who pretty much ran the show.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm trying to think back as far as I can before I get (inaudible at 0:17:58.4) with other kids around the neighborhood because number one, they long since passed and I can't remember those relationships. And I think that I was — I'm trying to get this, you know, like stopping when I'm full, all pre-school stuff. So my sister really dominated, we'd play what she wanted to play.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And stuff like that. And I was really in awe of her. I mean, you can see this, I look at movies, you know, my father (inaudible at 0:18:25.6) the movies when I was like, you know, between two and three, and I was always in her shadow. But literally in that, you know, and in life too, probably more behind her in doing, you know, what she wanted to do. Now, because of this, of course, then her academic successes then became my goals.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so, initially, I suppose, when I went away to school, I was not necessarily meeting the — any expectations of people. Expectations of people might have in me, but rather expectations they had in me because of my sister. Not because, you know, I was me, but because Lucy did well, therefore, Wes' got to do well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just follow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, it's the same family. So, that I think, was probably — because I was in awe of her so much and because she did so well, that was the initial part about why I — well, met all the expectations of others. I don't think I really gave a damn when I went away to school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Other than the fact that Lucy was going to school, that she did well, therefore, I was going away to school and I was going to do well. [0:19:48.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like just sort of automatically following in her footsteps.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But not really caring about the work itself or about doing well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think so. It always came easy and I didn't really care.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Say, but yeah, I think that's where it pretty much started, the idea of someone else's expectation. Now, my mother (inaudible at 0:20:15.5) the traits I see in her now are completely different than the traits I saw in her then. And yet, I know that, you know, she didn't change that much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She was well — her traits were well developed (inaudible at 0:20:25.8) I know she was about 43, so she certainly didn't change in the next 25 years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But to you she looked much different then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, that's because I didn't see what I see now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So now, let's take what I see now and see how that might have affected me back then. Well, what I see now is, number one, the trait that stands out most is her inability to admit error, she just will not. She'll just change her — if she's as wrong as can be on a matter, she will somehow try to change her position on the matter to make it sound like we misunderstood her or she stated her case wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When it's clear that she was simply wrong, she just won't admit it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the other thing is when something clever is said, she'll repeat it and just change the words a little as though she — you know, while the laugh is still going on, so that she will sort of get credit for what was said that was clever; notice this a lot. And well again, these are just the two traits that really, that have bothered me, these are the ones I noticed. And there are many, many other traits, but those are the ones I haven't thought about. Now, if we take that back, did I emulate my mother, you know, did I try to do this? She certainly isn't that clever and then she tries to be. Well, I do a lot of things I don't try to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do a lot of things...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Excuse me, I try to do a lot of things that I can't do, that's better. [0:21:55.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, (inaudible at 0:21:57.1) sometimes I try to talk, but I (inaudible at 0:21:59.0). Yeah, so I think I was just doing what she did. And I think that a kid is pretty perceptive and he can tell when someone's wrong and then trying to cover. I grew up initially — subconsciously, now consciously I never really thought my parents could be wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, they're adults and they're grown up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You always looked at them that they are always right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now, there is only one crack in this image, and that's the fact that my mother, when my father would lose his temper and do something wrong, my mother would, you know, get mad at him, but it was clear that my mother was right. There was no doubt in my sister's and my mind that mom was always right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I must have known this, it's so transparent now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Now it's hard to see why you didn't see it then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not that — maybe I just didn't want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then you see, oh, gee, up until just recently it's been hard for me to admit I'm wrong when I know I'm wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I did the same thing and just because I hate the trait so much in my mother, I don't do it myself. So I think that's where I got that trait, from her, and I think that from her and my sister I got the trait of living up to other people's expectations, to my mother's expectations, and to the people that expect something of me because I'm my sister's brother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think my father really had that much effect on me when I was young. There doesn't seem to be anything other than seeing traits in him that I didn't like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But he seems more detached from influences (inaudible at 0:23:46.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he didn't have time for us until he was — well, let's see, he retired in �55 and by that time we were — well, I was nine years old, you know, and he was over the hill (inaudible at 0:23:57.8). No relationship with a father is going to change after nine I don't think. I'm still really scared of him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the more I think back on that the more that's really amazing. It was just a profound fear of my father. [0:24:13.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Always have to be careful about how you're going to react. (inaudible at 0:24:16.7) he had a terrible temper, he would just fly off the handle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You always had to be very wary.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. He still has a little bit of a temper, but he's mellowed since he hasn't been working. And that's really sad because now I look back on it, my life would have been really different. But (inaudible at 0:24:34.8) going well for him at work, instead of having to work, you know, so hard all the time, if things had been better then that would have made a hell of a lot of difference in how I grew up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's sad to think how much easier a time you would have had if (inaudible at 0:24:47.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would have been completely different. See, if he were now raising a child, he would be the dominant force.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He really isn't, you know, involved (inaudible at 0:24:58.8) me right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And although I try to be — I don't know what the word "spoiled" means. But I don't think I could be more spoiled (inaudible at 0:25:08.1). So it wouldn't matter that much, but I think it was done by my mother. And I think having it done by my father — my father is an honest person really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If he's wrong or he has ignorance of something, he'll admit it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More often than not you won't see this ignorance because he won't — he'll just be quiet when we get into a field that he doesn't know anything about. But he's confident in the things that he does know about and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you really very much would have preferred (inaudible at 0:25:40.8)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think (inaudible at 0:25:41.9) from him the way he is now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's changed quite a bit, although my mother hasn't, of course, because her life hasn't changed that much. But, alright, so that's the way I grew up. Now, was I — well, that's the way I was when I was five, so that's the way I am now. [0:26:04.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you do something for 20 years, you know, when you behave a certain way for 20 years you're not going to turn around tomorrow and change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think. And I think that's why now I have this, you know, this complete inability to see myself behaving in a different role, sad though it is that I just — well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just impossible to imagine, and I guess you're saying, I've done it all these years, it's such a habit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My whole life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not only a habit, you see, it becomes so much a part of — well, it becomes you, it is you, that's what you are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that because it is me I'm either going to have to — oh, well (inaudible at 0:26:55.9). You see, I realize all these things now and I say, alright, that's why I'm this way, that's why I'm the other way. And I think it's pretty clear that that's the case. Now the point is if I realize that why can't I just function accordingly?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can't, I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow knowing how you got that way doesn't change the way you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it doesn't. And I still don't like it though, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But somehow it's like you feel caught in something, in a way of feeling that you know where it came from, but you still feel all (inaudible at 0:27:31.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and that's this other feeling that, you know, everyone I knew died tomorrow (inaudible at 0:27:38.1) another planet, I'd behave differently and that's really the case. [0:27:41.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's no doubt in my mind that I would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You're tied by the people who you've known all your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it matters very much to you how they...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that just is sort of the reverse of what we initially said, you know, that now we're talking about — well, I guess it's the same thing I initially said. The big idea that I only project what they want to see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's discouraging for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is. Just now, you see, initially, it was sort of like figuring it out and saying, well, now this is what we're going to have to do to straighten it out. And now it's realizing that that's the way it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's no real changing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It's like now you see what it is more clearly, but now it seems more hopeful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. If I ever break out — if I ever do the real brave thing like if I would — well, let's say I would take the extreme, if I would pass the exam with the flying colors, just do tremendously on it and then decided I didn't want to go into physics, and decided that art history was really my bag, and went back to get a bachelor's degree in art history just because I really ate it up and enjoyed it. And didn't really care about what I was going to do with it or anything, that would be really exciting and great that I could do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Cut loose like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess one of the things that makes me feel sad about the whole thing — I met a guy the other day — well, with changing roommates and one guy is moving out, and so, got a whole bunch of people in. And the guy that's going to eventually move in (inaudible at 0:29:57.0) he's really cool. He's just doing exactly what he wants and going to photography school. He went to high school and he decided that — you know, he's as bright as can be and he decided he didn't want to go to college, so he worked at a newspaper and he worked his way up to being sports editor. And after a few years of that he started to get into photography, and then decided, well, so what if I'm 30, I'm going to go back to college. And now he's in college. And he's going to get his bachelor's and he's doing a lot of filmmaking. But wow, there's a guy that, you know, cares only about what matters to him, right now a film matters to him. It doesn't matter what it is as long (inaudible at 0:30:32.6) at a time, that's his bag. [0:30:37.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's a guy just, you know, the opposite of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You're saying there's something about you that there's some way in which you don't care, or don't take care of yourself or something or do what matters to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The point is I don't know what matters to — well, I sort of do I guess. (inaudible at 0:31:07.1) there's something else that I just thought I'd bring up. Why am I the way I am? Now, let's forget about what we're talking about, you know, the way I am, you know, with other people. There is certainly something that is just me. And that if I were — if someone came down on a flying saucer and captured me tomorrow, and I would go to a place where there would be no more human beings, and I were to explain to them the world, I would explain it in my eyes. Well, why are my eyes this way? Why do I look at things this way? Why is life this way to me? And I can't figure it out, it just doesn't make any sense. If you see the first premise is correct, the premise that I'm only here to please other people, then clearly, the people that I've wanted to please all the way along is my parents. The way I feel now is very displeasing to them. I mean, they just tolerate the radical me because of the other accomplishments. I mean, if I didn't have any academic or any other accomplishments at all they'd (inaudible at 0:32:20.4) throw me out long ago I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. So, if your whole energy is put towards pleasing them, you really haven't done that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not — yeah, alright, the point is — yeah, I guess that was the point. So who am I out to please? Why do I feel this way about certain things? I mean, I feel very strongly about some issues. And why should I feel so strongly and displease those people?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only possible explanation is the fact that there are other people that mean more to me. That I have people and friends on all sides of the spectrum, and I can't see pleasing any one of them more than another. I mean, having that be the reason. So I say, well, let's see, Joe feels this way and (inaudible at 0:33:13.2) feels that way. And my parents feel it's sort of balancing (inaudible at 0:33:16.9), this is how I'm going to feel. [0:33:18.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow it doesn't seem to be worked out that consciously.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, there is a way I feel about life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And well, what I'm talking about now are just — well, (inaudible at 0:33:34.7) why don't I pick a few examples to see why it ends up the way it does, maybe figure it out. My parents are (inaudible at 0:33:47.3). Well, first of all, I don't really care about earning any money. I have up to the last couple of years. Whether I realize that a physicist never will earn any money and so it's hopeless, so why give a damn? But I don't like to feel (inaudible at 0:34:00.5) I realize and say, well, why should I care? That's what makes me feel better, and I think that is the case.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My parents have this horrible fear that I'm going to be a pauper all of my life basically because I don't know how to take care of money, and I give it away and I do. I mean, I've — on a whim I'll just easily give away everything. I mean, money just doesn't mean anything to me and yet, to them, it meant everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's all they ever cared about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, is how much money you would get. And it doesn't bother me at all. You know, payday is coming up in a week, and I (inaudible at 0:34:36.0) any food and there's no money. You know, I'll worry about it when it comes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also, they say they're terrible, they're not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow, they're just absolutely not. And I've gone to the opposite extreme on that comment and I can't see why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I certainly...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't fit in with the way you've been looking at this. [0:35:07.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. And then too, then I also — I think I kind of believe them when they kept telling me things and they didn't really follow them themselves, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you should be headed this way and it's really nice and should be headed that — except I didn't really accept the God crap they gave me, excuse me if I'm offending you here, but that's the way I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And although they were never really religious, I never felt that way at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just sort of go (inaudible at 0:35:41.9) an obligation, and now, of course, they don't go to church at all, it's waned over the years. I think they probably just stayed in — well, I don't think they (inaudible at 0:35:51.0) they'd go through the motion. And that should have probably been ingrained in me, but it wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Interestingly enough, my sister is very religious (inaudible at 0:36:00.5) a girl from the same household. Of course, it could have something to do with the fact that her husband is bible bearing Baptist. That could have something to do with it. But there's another example, I mean, that I'm not trying to please them at all and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's confusing in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:36:20.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless I just fit in completely to the people that surrounded me, that's the only possible explanation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then that's not good either because you see, when I was at Ryder, I was still pretty close to the way my parents were. And I was more radical there than here. There I was — well, Ryder is a pretty far left school. And I avoided, you know, smoking dope and I avoided the beard and the long hair and everything. There's just no way in the world I was not going to be straight and conservative and (inaudible at 0:36:57.1) and everything just right down the line. And then when I came here I lived in the business dormitory. [0:37:02.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And with anything, that should have reinforced the way I was — the way I lived at Ryder, but it didn't happen that way. As I came here in �68 I began to slip to into the radical identity, and completely threw out all the standards that my parents had established for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that if any — if I were taken out of this world now, that's the way I would feel about the world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The radical way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not radical, no, I'm not a radical. I'm a liberal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: On not just political matters, but life matters too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm really comfortable with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, that's how you decide how you feel, I think, is what you're comfortable with. I couldn't go back to the suburbs and live the way my parents do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just couldn't do that. And I can't see why that should be the case, all I've been doing is pleasing them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, do you come to the conclusion that you haven't just been pleasing them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it's hard to figure. Everything we said up to this is that I care only about what other people think about me. And had there been times when this identity of mine is really hard — well, it's been something that's really — well, it's a barrier at times to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your identity has been a barrier?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the radical me has been a problem at times, when I'm trying to interact to please parents and (inaudible at 0:38:54.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Old friends, you know, from way back when I was conservative. And it gets in the way at times. And that that's, I think, the identity I developed. If I developed anything on my own it's that particular identity. [0:39:14.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet, far overshadowing that is this other thing about just pleasing, you know, living up to other people's expectations, and the drive now for this physics thing or the swim, anything like that that I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like sometimes, very often you feel like what you're doing is to please other people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes it seems like what you're doing is for your own...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, the point is, what is me, you see? Am I (inaudible at 0:39:46.3). If like (inaudible at 0:39:50.8) said it six times today, if everyone I knew died tomorrow my lifestyle wouldn't change much I don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As far...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wouldn't change?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, as far as how I believe. However, what I'm doing like studying the physics now, I wouldn't be doing that or (inaudible at 0:40:05.7) like a year ago, I wouldn't have kept up the swimming I don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. There are some things in your life that seem more affected.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I mean, like if I had a neighbor, and everyone died on May 3rd. On May 4th it's like the neighbor wouldn't see anything different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would still behave and act the same way. And (inaudible at 0:40:23.6) so my lifestyle itself wouldn't change, but anyone who knew me deeply, I think would try and (inaudible at 0:40:31.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I would think of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like all of these people living are a real burden?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's hard to say what it is that structures one's behavior.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What structures my behavior, whether it's what I want or what they want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the way you were talking it sounded like you were saying sometimes it's what you want, and sometimes it's what they want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that doesn't satisfy you (inaudible at 0:41:04.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it doesn't. [0:41:08.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is there about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the point is, you see, I guess it just boils down to what I like about me and what I don't like about me. The things I like about me are the things that I have determined. Things I don't like about me is this horrible thing that I have, that I have to meet other people's expectations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I have put in them. And I go right along putting those expectations in people's minds and then spending the rest of my — all my waking moments living up to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's me too I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But that's a part of you you're not pleased with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And yet, there are times when, I mean, I really have to fight the two parts against each other. I mean, well (inaudible at 0:41:52.8) come up in a couple of days, I have to go back to Elgin to give a talk to all the high school kiddies.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And wow, you know, that's going to be hard. I'm going to have a shirt and a tie and I have to comb my hair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know they're not expecting someone that looks like what I look like. And I have a — well, I know, you know, when I go back into that world, things are really tense sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very tense to try to keep acting like you belong there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be a part of it because you really feel very alien to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I know I will just go out of my way to behave in a way pleasing to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It sounds like you'll spend a lot of energy, but in some way that takes a toll, it keeps you nervous.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'd rather just go back there and, you know — I'd rather be able to go back there and not put on a big show.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet, I know I can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. And that can't is tied up with wanting not to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Displease them, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Displease them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could never go back there and in all honesty, behave the way that — behave and say anything about life that exhibits the real — the way I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just couldn't do it. [0:43:20.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And (inaudible at 0:43:23.8) that's really bad. Maybe I will, then I'll blow the whole thing and (inaudible at 0:43:37.5). See, I got this feeling that there's just going to be something that's going to happen. I don't know if it's just a wish, that somehow I'm just going to say, well, alright, today is the day that I'm honest with everyone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just start. And but, it's just not coming. I mean, it's certainly not going to be tomorrow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be a relief if it would just happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Wow, what a great life it would be if it would just, you know, if I didn't really give a damn about what other people thought. Because I have this other belief that if I didn't care what other people thought about me, that the only people that really matter wouldn't be displeased with the way I behave anyhow. My parents would certainly be displeased because I'd no longer be — you know, they couldn't talk at the bridge party about how Wes did this and Wes did that. I mean, Wes is working on 42nd Street taking pictures or something like that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which would really be great, you know, I'd love to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or whatever I love to do, a whole bunch of things. I'd like to spend the whole summer just sitting on the beach reading and having fun. There's so many things that I don't know and I want to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it really cramps your style to have to please these people all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But, you see, to the people that really know (inaudible at 0:44:59.9) if I were to behave that way suddenly, well, she'd say well, yeah, that's really great, you're finally behaving, you know, honestly the way you should behave.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So some of the people who are really important to you, you would like that, that would please them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the two or three people that I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Josh and a friend I met in New York, Kevin (inaudible at 0:45:23.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Those people would understand that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:45:27.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wish I could get my degree tomorrow and do that, that would be great. You know what would really be cool, if I could get my degree and try for maybe a week to find a job. Oh, a week, I could try for a year I wouldn't find one the way the market is now. And then just saying, okay, that's it, I went through college. I went as far as I could go in college. I got my degree and (inaudible at 0:45:49.5) doesn't matter. Now I'm going to take and do what I want to do. [0:45:52.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just go out and be a bum, wow, that would be great. Then maybe in 1985 or something I'd say, well, got to settle down and then come back and then have my degree, that would be great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course, I wouldn't know anything because you have to keep up. But it wouldn't matter, you see, because as far as the world is concerned I've got the parchment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what do I care? If the world wants to be so materialistic that it's going to have it, you know, down in writing when it wants, then, you know, so many letters after his name. He's got to go on to this school and gotten this degree, well, then I'll have it, that would be great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you'd be all set.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, wouldn't that cool? Well, that being the case, I'm going to have to really start studying, so I can do just that. I really hope the job market stays bad long enough for that to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For me not to be able to find a job and it probably could.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Because that's a way to freedom.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Do you realize that last year there were only two openings in the entire nation to nuclear physics, two?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just unbelievable. Now, if I can pass this test and get the degree in two years, maybe the market won't change that much in two years. Oh, would that be bad if I got in as another (inaudible at 0:47:06.6). Like, if I were to get a — well, what I think I would like — well, what I say I would like, and I'd say to everyone else that I like but maybe not to you, is I'd like to get a job in a small or large college where I'd have classes of five and six people. Some people that really care about physics and really teach them and fire up and give a good lecture, wow, would that be work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I, you know, I don't have that physical mind, I'm just sort of plowing through this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And to give lectures, oh, for the first three years. Oh man, would that be hard until I repeated the courses four or five times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Really, really tough, but really exciting too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it would be exciting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the thing you don't (inaudible at 0:47:47.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that (inaudible at 0:47:48.6). I'm just saying that that would be just living up to someone else's expectations again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, I don't know if I'd really like that. Boy, I just don't want a nine to five it, I'll tell you that. [0:48:04.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, a quarter of a century of being a student, I mean, it would be hard to get in. Actually, that wouldn't be a bad life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To be a student all your life. Of course, you grow up and have kids and grandchildren. What do you want to be when you grow up? Just what my daddy was, a student, be kind of hard (inaudible at 0:48:24.4) to raise a kid, having (inaudible at 0:48:28.6). Well, there's the whole thing again, raise a kid without — with him having any desire to contribute. I mean, that's a contribution, just learning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:48:40.7) here's a human being, an organism that knows a lot, there, you've contributed. I don't have to contribute to other people, why should I care about them if I just wanted, you know? To be well educated is a (inaudible at 0:48:53.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why isn't that just okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I have this dream of being — and maybe I told you this, about, oh, 55, 60 and then have someone realizes me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Here's a guy — well, why has he swam the Channel and he climbed Mount Everest, and then he did some great thinking research in physics. Maybe I came up with some tremendous theory of — no, not physics, any other field. And then he did this, that and the other thing. And all these things without having — you know, anyone really notice them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then someone finally notices that one person did all these things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. And really recognizes you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now there, you see, that whole thing is just not fitting into — well, I'm just pleasing other people. So if that's the dream that I have and if that's what I think of is what my life is going to boil down to. It's kind of sad all I care about is what other people think about. [0:49:55.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Kind of sad that that's your highest goal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Then (inaudible at 0:50:02.5) asks me about it, I'll just — well, the standard excuse I have for why I would behave that way, it's just that it's a testimonial to what the human is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because then I could do that. Certainly, if I can get a degree in physics here, that shows that anyone could do anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, I just don't have a physical mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm not a good swimmer (inaudible at 0:50:35.4) to swim.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I swam the Channel, so there's all sorts of things that a person could do. And that's — if it boils down to anyone, you know, ever asking me why I would do such a thing, I think that's probably one of the reasons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To show what a person can do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But more than that, to show what I can do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Realizing (inaudible at 0:50:57.3) well, that is what it is. But it boils down to if anyone else wants to glean anything from it, do what you want, just try whatever you want to do because anyone could do anything really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But you mean it's really for yourself to show you what you can do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think that premise is pretty well established, that I'm very egocentric, and I'm just doing things that make myself feel good about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, yeah, well, I wouldn't feel that way if it weren't just — you know, I wouldn't think that, well, I'm going to be, you know — someone is going to recognize my life when I'm 60. I wouldn't feel that way about life now if I were only caring about what I value rather than what other people value.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Sounds like you're feeling a little disgusted with yourself? [0:51:59.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. We're going around in an awful lot of circles.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt like you were going around in circles this morning?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or end up one big circle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know whether (inaudible at 0:52:15.7) repeat ideas or go through things over again, if they make more sense the second time, or if they're getting more fuddled.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which way did it seem, like they were just getting more muddled up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know if "muddled" is the — yeah, muddled. After a while there I had everything all squared around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. And now things are all mixed up again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I keep plugging away and see what happens, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You (inaudible at 0:52:47.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You thought you had something straightened out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just — like when I say, when I first — well, not when I first (inaudible at 0:52:52.9) the second point (inaudible at 0:52:53.5) was the fact that I have this feeling that, you know, after 20 sessions I'm just going to walk out and there's no way that I'm going to change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's no way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just too much a part of me. I mean, I spent 25 years developing something, you're not going to, in 20 sessions, going to straighten out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too ingrained and embedded for you to change at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The only — ah, shoot, here we again not interacting. I should go out and interact so we could talk. Well, we'll have one or two more sessions before — this was 11, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. If we have twelve, that will make eight sessions during June, July and August. [0:53:35.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or June and July or June, whatever the case may be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is like (inaudible at 0:53:40.7) which is probably good and I'll be able to then look at life a little differently knowing whether or not I passed the exam. And maybe I'll be able to interact some too, to see if I can (inaudible at 0:53:51.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. That's part of the annual part (inaudible at 0:53:56.1) and how this will all work out. It still sounds like, you know, you're feeling pretty discouraged about can I really change? Like this is (inaudible at 0:54:07.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's sort of like sitting inside the other self, the self that pleases me and not being pleased with the self that pleases other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Excuse the double talk there. But realizing that just no way in the world I'm going to change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like that thing is — that part that wants to please other people is very large and very established compared to the little part that's dissatisfied.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, the other thing is it makes good practical sense for me to continue my physics now. Because, you see, I'm clearly going to get a degree, there's no doubt in my mind. If it isn't here it's going to be at another school. Because I've gone this far now, and I'm pretty sure I'm at the point where I know enough to get a degree here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's being a practical person, it just does not seem like a good investment at the time to have invested in time and then not get a degree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If it just (inaudible at 0:55:14.3) now, you see, if I were to quit now...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, wait, wait. What are you doing now, trying to say, yes, there are practical reasons behind just pleasing other people for me to get the degree?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I'm three years older than I was three years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In that three years, I've put three years worth of information in my head about physics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, three years is a long time. If I'm going to value my life at all for time I put into something, certainly I should say, well (inaudible at 0:55:46.2) three years of an investment. But it's not like drawing, you know, good money after bad. It's not like saying, well, let's keep going because I put that much time in. I've just now at, I think, a vast enough stage so that there's no — I mean, I've got the work done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wanted to accept the benefits of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've learned the physics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, when you say that, does that satisfy you as one reason to get the degree, or are you arguing with yourself about the time up here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Up to the point — that's sort of like the one last thing if someone said, well, why don't you cop out now? (inaudible at 0:56:28.2) cop out (inaudible at 0:56:29.6). That shows you where I'm at, right? Uh-huh, that was a little slip there. Why don't you do what you want to do now? Why don't you be honest to yourself now (inaudible at 0:56:37.2)? And I'll say, well, because I've invested three years. Yeah, it's pretty much a rationalization. But, you see, I'm a very practical person. I mean, I think about — I mean, there's never really a wasted motion in my life, physical wasted motion, and this would be a waste of time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it does have some sway with you that I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that argument doesn't (inaudible at 0:57:03.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, okay. Alright, here we are. If everyone were to die tomorrow...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this test was in a month, I would still keep studying like a madman for a month. Because there's only one month left, well, less than that, three weeks, June 1st. It would be ridiculous for me not to now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If everyone died tomorrow, would you finish your degree (inaudible at 0:57:29.1) pass the test because of practical reasons?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, probably. Because with a good sponsor and a lot of work, it could be, you know, like 18 months that I could have it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's all a matter of just getting more done. There's no real big hurdle left, or times when it was all the work hurdle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I've always been able to work hard (inaudible at 0:57:51.2). Yeah, so I think the practical consideration is now what's driving me. Gee, I wish I knew what was going to happen. (inaudible at 0:58:08.0) it's amazing how the different feelings go through my head and I compare them to sitting in England waiting for the weather to clear on the Channel. It was an just amazing similarity. Oh, just right down the line. I live with failure for a day and then I live with success for a day in the future. I think of all the ramifications of failure and all the ramifications of success in doing the same thing now. (inaudible at 0:58:28.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go over and over it in your mind, changing back and forth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. A little bit of evidence (inaudible at 0:58:37.5) bit of evidence (inaudible at 0:58:38.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good weather is coming, bad weather is coming, whatever the case may be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good sign though, we're taking practice tests and my grades are monotonically increasing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is, it can't be a bad sign, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it feels like you kind of have a lot of consequences, you know, whether you fail or pass.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Oh yeah, those are the biggest — yeah, that's the biggest thing in my life right now. (inaudible at 0:59:11.3) happen to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Was crucial?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've never been at a point where, well, failure was imminent or even possible. [0:59:25.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, there's never any way in the world that was going to happen. So that the fact that that possibility is there and I hope it's very slight. (inaudible at 0:59:40.2) possibility then that makes it a very important point in my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It will also be my greatest accomplishment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I will certainly overcome one of my greatest handicaps, the lack of any physical intuition.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is what learning means a lot of, and I have none of it or next to none.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're going to have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, one time next week and then two week break for tests.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then we can start again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Great, what day?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, Wednesday, how is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, next Wednesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:00:20.4).</p>

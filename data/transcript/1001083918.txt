<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so how are you doing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Actually it’s been going better.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The antidepressant I’ve been on for two weeks.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think it’s helping a little bit.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I haven’t been as weepy and I told [NAME OTHER] after I had been taking it for a week, I didn’t want to prejudice him against me starting it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So he didn’t know you’d started it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, so I, you know, started the little experiment.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did he notice any difference?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He said that he had but then again this is a crucial time because I’m coming up on my time of the month.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I get really really really weepy.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I had told you, that [NAME OTHER] came back from wherever he was, [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED], I don’t know for sure.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Not back here, back in the States, you mean.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Back in the states, yes. And he never called me and that really really upset me and [NAME OTHER] had to call him actually. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] had called me and said that he was coming back on a certain day, like two days later, and I was really disappointed in him that he didn’t, you know, call and say hey I’m home and [NAME OTHER] is not a [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, and [NAME OTHER] had discussed this and he knew that we’d been praying, you know, a lot for him and I just felt like it was really, what’s the word? It was, I can’t think of the word I’m trying to think of, as a son, it was just a, it was almost like we weren’t even family, you know, it was like we didn’t count, and I felt like he just, well [NAME OTHER] was the only thing that mattered to him. And I understand that they’re in love and I had given him a week before I started feeling like hey where’s my phone call?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And, you know I…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did you feel like you could call him or did you feel like you needed to wait for him to call?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I didn’t feel like I should have to call him. I didn’t feel like, I felt like it was his place to call and say, he knew we knew he was coming back. He knew that, well you know it sort of like protocol at home.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Does he, has he done that in the past when he got back, would he call?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I guess before he wasn’t married to [NAME OTHER] though.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah he was.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is this the first time since he’s been married that he’s been gone and came back.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But it’s the first time that we knew he had been gone. You see, he had a covert operation and this is only, had he not told us it was his fourth mission, I would have only known it was his second.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I just felt like he dissed us, you know, and [NAME OTHER] called him actually two days after he got back and I wasn’t home and, you know, and I in no way am jealous of [NAME OTHER] or anything, you know, I feel like why can’t we share. You know, and I’ve had this conversation with [NAME OTHER] and I said [NAME OTHER] were very close and we could talk about anything and I said [NAME OTHER] I hope that, you know, he don’t ever feel like I am butting in or, you know, I said because I always want her to feel welcome into the family from the first and even before I met her I said, you know, you’re my new daughter but I feel like [NAME OTHER] whenever he does call, he almost makes it like it has to be a really short conversation because he called to say oh we’re on a way to go to eat, um, so I can’t talk long. And it’s always like they’re on their way someplace and I called him on it, I said why don’t you call me sometime when you’re not doing anything. And so this last time, [NAME OTHER] called and [NAME OTHER] answered the phone and evidently when [NAME OTHER] got back he was sick and I told [NAME OTHER], I said when I do talk to [NAME OTHER] I’m going to ream him out because I am his mother and he could have at least had the decency to call me and say hi, I’m home, I love because we hadn’t heard from him in a week and I knew, I had a feeling that, you know, he was on his way back and I don’t care how old your children get, you know, you like to hear from them and you worry, you just worry about them, he was deployed. You know, and I just said to him, you know, I said you couldn’t spare 2 minutes to call me. He said well, I’ve been sick. I said, you can’t lay in bed and pick up the telephone and in 2 minutes say hey mom, I’m home, I love you, and they were on their way to eat, he called in the car and he’s like, well, you know, I just go to work, I come home, I eat, I go to bed. And I said, [NAME OTHER] you’ve got e-mail, you’ve IM’d me, you know, you can call me. I said, you know it was rude of you, it was disrespectful of you. I said, you know, I love you, all I wanted to hear, I’m home and I’m okay. I said I know you’re married now and you don’t drop your first family for your second, you know, or for your, for [NAME OTHER], I gave you time to be with [NAME OTHER]. I wasn’t trying to butt in or anything, you know. And his answer is always well you could have called me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME] he’s right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But I didn’t want to butt in our interrupt his time with [NAME OTHER]. I wanted him to have his time with [NAME OTHER] and then…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I know, but see you’re making him wrong.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What do you mean making him wrong?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re making, you’re saying that he was wrong not to call you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You don’t think he was?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No. The phone works both ways. It’s not his job or responsibility to call you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You don’t think so?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely not. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> As a son?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely not. Where is it written in the rule book that it’s the son’s responsibility? Why didn’t the mother call? Is the mother’s job to call?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because I don’t want to be a butt in meddling…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So is he butting in or meddling if he calls you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, he’s the one that was gone.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. My suggestion is there is nowhere that says who’s supposed to call. I mean you have expectations and desires that you want him to call but…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s not going to happen.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it may or may not happen but it’s not his responsibility to call any more than…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe he was waiting for me to call him.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, he may have wondered why, if I’m back, why haven’t my parents called me. There is no right answer to this. What I want to do is help you get out of the victim role here because you’re feeling victimized that he didn’t call you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Is that a victim?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Is it?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, he did it to you. You said he was rude and disrespectful to not call you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I guess because these preconceived notions…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Of how children should act toward their parents.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. Exactly right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’m wrong?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’m not saying you’re wrong. I’m saying that’s what’s causing the upset though and if you can let go of those preconceived ideas and say, you know, if I want to talk to him, I can call him just as easily as he can call me, then you won’t be upset if he doesn’t call. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know what I think I’m afraid of?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Rejection. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think you’re probably right. I think you’re right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And that’s why I don’t, well, and because it has happened before. I feel like, you know, I’ve called and he’s put me off. Well [NAME OTHER] are going someplace or you know, and that’s why I don’t initiate [INAUDIBLE]. That’s why I don’t call my children here. You know, it’s well, mom I’m busy, mom I’m going someplace or...</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And that’s hard, it hurts. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well yeah because rejection is a big thing in my life. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I would rather be alone than have to deal with rejection.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And so maybe that is why I, in my mind I make myself the victim before I really, even if I’m not. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That makes sense [PATIENT NAME]. When you try to protect yourself, the problem is in the long run you end up getting hurt or feeling hurt.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s like building a wall, huh?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So maybe that’s why my husband does what he does.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s probably a part of it, yeah. Do you see a way around that incident that happened?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Put yourself out there anyway.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yep, you have to take risks and some of those risks may work, some may not. You may get hurt sometimes but sometimes you may also get what you need and you can feel closer to people. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Do you know the funny thing is that I give that advice myself? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s always easier to give it to other people isn’t it than to take it ourselves. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. That’s okay. You’re learning about how maybe you can do this differently that will work better for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] and my relationship is going better.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I am learning about being honest with her at the time things happen. She told me that [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] mother might do daycare, you know, where she told me I wouldn’t and I said, you know, [NAME OTHER] if that happens I’m going to be very pissed off at you and she said well mom, my big thing is the dogs and I said, and she’s been coming over a lot more with [NAME OTHER]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] is?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and she’s been calling me and saying that she feels really bad and she had a six week check up and she only has 10 pounds to lose and I go whaa, whaa, whaa, you know, it doesn’t even look like she was pregnant. And, I gave her a pep talk and I went out and got her a card and I got her a pair of pajamas and I got her this singing card that says you’re wonderful, it sings something like that, and I told her, I said I want you to know that the granny hotline is always open for you even though you don’t take my advice. She always says, I’ve got to call the doctor first, and she says mom you have got to understand I’m a first mom. And so I do understand that but you’ve got to understand I’ve had six kids, I’ve got a lot of experience and it hurts my feelings when you don’t take my advice and she said, what is [NAME OTHER] your experimental. I said experimental? I’ve had experience and, anyway, she’s coming around a little bit. She said this doctor gives her some weird advice. Anyway, I said you know I would never let the dogs hurt the baby and I’ve done daycare around all by dogs. They’ve never bit any, I’ve done infant daycare and, so anyway, I said you would honestly rather have a stranger, because she’s thinking about having, you know, a stranger, a stranger take care of your baby than family. I said who would love your baby more and be more concerned. You know what [NAME OTHER] went through. She had abusive baby-sitters of her kids. I said you are so fortunate, you do not understand how fortunate you are to have family close by. I said I would even come to the house, your house, and do daycare. She said well I will think about it. I said, why are you stressing yourself out for something that is just not even a problem and she said, well I’ll think about it. I‘ll cross that bridge when I get to it. I said there’s not even a bridge for you to cross. I said it’s something you don’t even have to worry about and, anyway. She’s coming around a little bit because the more she sees me with [NAME OTHER] the more she sees how much I love him and so that’s, you know, sort of going to be a mute point, is that how you say that word, mute.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But, he’s such a doll. So anyway, I told her in the card, I said I just want you to know that you are precious to me and something occurred to me, [NAME OTHER] had said to me that you and [NAME OTHER] are like oil and water and I started thinking about that and I said, you know, I wrote in the card we are like oil and water but when you shake up oil and water they mix together, so if you look at our relationship, if you shake us up, meaning if we communicate, we won’t have a problem but if you let us sit and we don’t talk about things that bother us, we separate and we have problems, so I said think about that. I said sometimes I scare myself, I’m so profound. But anyway, I think I helped her think about that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So she’s, I think we’ve found some level ground maybe.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But she’s still having a hard time with her and [NAME OTHER] but that’s there problem. [NAME OTHER] called me last night and [NAME OTHER] is dying, her dog, she’s had for fifteen years but I think somebody kicked him. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why’s that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because he’s dragging his hind leg and that’s the synonymous with a back injury and he’s hemorrhaging and he was fine. He’s old but that’s, because my dog had back injuries, these things happen, and I think her roommate may have gotten upset because he got in the garbage and she came home and he was like that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh dear.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She called me, she was all in tears and said he’s really in a bad way so I don’t know how to break that to her but that sounds more like an injury to me than all of the sudden to have that happen like that. I said I’ll go check on him before I leave here.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s wrong. I don’t know what we do about that but that doesn’t sound like a dog that all the sudden that happens to.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did she get him to the vet yet?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She can’t afford it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, the last time she took him a year ago they said, you know, he’s old, you know, but a lot of times mom he’s fine, you know, he just walks around, he’s got cataracts and, you know, he’s just slow.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But he’s not, he wasn’t like that. You don’t just all of the sudden that happens to him. You know, my Docksons had, one of them had a back injury and he started dragging the back legs when that happened so it sounds like something, he’s been injured.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, that’s, that’s just wrong. It’s [NAME OTHER]. That’s her real name.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh. That’s right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And she’s not real good with animals.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So anyway, but you know, things are going pretty good. We’re doing, you know, we’re doing okay. [NAME OTHER] and I are doing okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We’re talking more. We’re not very physical. I don’t know if [INAUDIBLE] about it. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And who’s choice is that more of, yours, his, or both?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know. I don’t approach him so much. I mean I give him hugs and stuff but he just doesn’t seem interested.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And maybe that’s my fear of rejection.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Could be. Could be a lot of things.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, [INAUDIBLE] like, I don’t know. I’m not going to knock myself out if he’s not interested.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know. Maybe it’s his age.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That could be a factor.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s just been so long though, you know. I mean, once in a while we do, it’s okay but I’m not, I still have a problem with responding, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know what to do about that. I wish there was a magic pill you could take to make you be able to…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Unfortunately, there’s not yet. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They make all the stuff for men, you know, but Lord help me if he ever takes Viagra because he would go forever and it still wouldn’t help me, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Well they’re actually doing some studies with Viagra in women too, to see if it will improve responsiveness and pleasure and…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I haven’t heard any results yet but they’re looking into it to see if it will help women too, so.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Wish they’d find something.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Hmm. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But you know, what’s it called, Lex-, what am I taking?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The antidepressant?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Levaquin? Lex, Lexapro?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, Lexapro.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Lexapro. I don’t notice a big difference, am I supposed to yet?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> In terms of your mood or your sex drive or…?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, in terms of my mood.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well it’s been two weeks. The benefits tend to peak over four to six weeks so in the first two weeks you might notice some improvement but not the maximum improvement. I think we need to give it a little bit more time before we decide.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Excuse me. How much it’s going to do and then we can adjust the dose if it’s not doing enough. So are you having any side effects or problems with it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m sick to my stomach all the time. I don’t know if I’m coming down with something or…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> There’s a stomach bug going around again. I talked to two people today that have been sick. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s just like on the verge of I’m not sure if I can eat or not.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And when I do eat, I’m…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The symptoms I’m hearing are some nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation even, cramping. One lady she just looked pale and she said I just don’t feel well, I haven’t eaten all day, so it’s variable with symptoms but a lot of it…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m just nauseous.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so then it could be Lexapro. That can be a side effect but it’s very unusual. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I haven’t been for two weeks. I haven’t had it for the whole two weeks.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Like the last four days and I have a headache just, but [NAME OTHER] has had a headache and I just…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well it could be this bug that’s going around. If it persists, let me know because they are rare, or uncommon side effects of Lexapro but it’s very unusual to get them.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well it would start right away, wouldn’t it?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Usually it starts right away and it usually goes away within a few days, usually, so I don’t think it’s the medicine but, like I said, let me know if it doesn’t go away. We can always adjust the dose if it does seem to be related to the medicine.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t think it’s the medicine. I think it’s a bug.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think you’re probably right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My nose has been running too so…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve been sneezing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You have any problems with the other medications at all. Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The Adderall is doing fine.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you’ve got plenty of it, well about two more weeks.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. The Lexapro, am I going to run out?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I put refills on that one, five refills.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, you should be okay with that. The Topamax, we haven’t talked about that for a while. Do you think it’s doing anything?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t, I don’t…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is your weight going down at all?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t think it’s going down but it’s not going up, so. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I guess the question is, because you have a pretty high dose of it, if it’s helping we can stick with it, if not, it would probably make sense to get off it so you don’t develop possible side effects. There aren’t very common side effects with it but there are some rare ones over time that could happen. It can increase the risk of kidney stones, rare risk of pancreatitis, so it it’s not helping, it’s probably better to get off of it. I mean the reason we started it was to see if it would help you lose the weight. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Lose weight, yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It seems like it really hasn’t done that has it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I lost it initially.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. How much do you think you lost since you started it, do you know?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I was almost 200 pounds.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. And now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’m down to 164.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you’ve lost 36 pounds. So it may have helped.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But I don’t want to gain it back. Is it keeping the weight off, you think?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I don’t know. It’s possible it might be.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] is going to start going to the gym and I told her I’d go with her.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well if you want to leave it and keep taking it you can. You don’t have to stop it. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t want to get on this thing of taking too much stuff.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> My thought too is to find the least amount of medicine that works for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but I also, with taking an antidepressant I’m concerned about gaining weight because that’s one of the reasons I stopped taking them because I couldn’t find anything that worked and the side effect of weight gain.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well the good news is that Lexapro doesn’t cause weight gain so that’s one of the good aspects to it. Since we’re just starting the Lexapro, why don’t we leave everything else alone since you’re doing okay? Once you’re stable on the Lexapro, if you decide you want to back off on the Topamax we could, we’d probably do it slowly though, just to make sure you don’t start gaining weight and if you did we could always bump it back up again.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, good. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then, plus you’re going to start working out. That might help too. Do you know when you’re going to start?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think she said in a week or two the doctor said it would be okay for her because she just had her six week check up. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think that’s what she said.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And do you know where you’re going to work out. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think she’s going to go to the [DEIDENTIFIED] so she can do it at night because, you know, with her nannying she doesn’t know when she gets off so it will be contingent upon when they let her off work, so they’re open 24 hours so she can go late.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay that sounds good. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And with me being a night owl.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s good timing for you too. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That sounds good. So the things that are going good are your moods might be a little better, you’ve lost 36 pounds, I mean that’s terrific, and you may lose some more after you start exercising regularly, you’re getting along better with [NAME OTHER]. Things with [NAME OTHER] may be improving, and so a lot of things that have taken a turn for the better, it sounds like.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Well, I think, see I don’t notice my moods so much until I have to have input from other people, you know…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes you’re too close to it but, so that’s why I didn’t want to say anything to [NAME OTHER] about it but [NAME OTHER] says that I’m hard to get alone with but she’s pretty hard to get along with too. In fact, the last get together we had, Christmas, she was really upset with me about something, I can’t even remember what it was but we had a misunderstanding and I could not, I tried to talk to her about it and finally I just went to [NAME OTHER] and I said, I told [NAME OTHER] I said, you know, I apologized to [NAME OTHER] for our misunderstanding and she won’t even listen to me and I just want you to know that I’m sorry. I can’t remember what it was for but he said to me, and of course she didn’t hear him, he said she’s just a pain in the ass.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] said that about…?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, [NAME OTHER] said that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] said that about [NAME OTHER]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> About [NAME OTHER]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And he takes a lot crap from her and he said so just don’t worry about it, she’ll get over it and it was something really trivial but she won’t, you know, she just gets to where she won’t even let me finish a sentence and, you know, it was in front of [NAME OTHER] and everybody, you know, and I said, you know, please don’t be angry with me anymore, you know, I’m trying to straighten this out and she’s like, wouldn’t let me finish and wouldn’t let me straighten it out and, you know, it was a family get together and I said well, you know what then, I’ve done my part in trying to straighten this out and I guess if you want to be angry, be angry, but, you know, it’s your call. But she, oh I know what it was, it was the thing about her not letting me hold [NAME OTHER] in the hospital. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It was that whole thing and she was angry because I never called her or went over to her house or anything and I said because I got my feelings hurt in the hospital on how rude you were to me and you said you didn’t even want my gifts and she said you could have held him and, once again, like you said, I probably should have asked her but she was very rude to me and, so anyway, I said, I said, you know, I apologize, I got lost and I couldn’t get you to the hospital, you know, what’s done is done. I know you were tired, whatever, but I did get my feelings hurt. I wanted to hold my grandchild and you were rude to me and she said I ruined her whole moment with her birth and her child and she said I made it all about me. I went out and bought her all these gifts and, you know, told her I wanted it to be special for her and she said I made it all about me and I ruined her whole day with the birth of her son. And I said, [NAME OTHER], I don’t know where you got that, you’re turning it all around on me. I said no, I said and that’s why I stayed away from you. I said I wanted you to have your time with her son. I didn’t want it to be all about me. I did get my feelings hurt but I wanted you to have your time with your son, I didn’t want to make a big deal about it, you know, well you never called me, you never came over, you never, you know, came over to my house to, uh, you know, see your grandson. I said well you made it clear to me, you know, that I wasn’t welcome. If you wanted me to come over, why didn’t you call and say hey mom, why don’t you come over and I said I’m trying to straighten it out now and you’re still angry. I’m not angry anymore, I’m just telling you that I had my feelings hurt and you don’t even want to discuss it, you’re just still angry and that’s when I went to [NAME OTHER] and I said look I did get my feelings hurt. I understand you were all tired, [NAME OTHER] got lost, you know, I know I got back late, but my understanding was that there were going to be people in and out of there all day long. I didn’t want, you know, I was not going to intrude. I wanted you to be able to have time with your friends, [NAME OTHER] was coming in. [NAME OTHER] demands all the attention, you know, and I wanted you to have time, wanted [NAME OTHER] to have time to take a nap and, obviously, she didn’t. And I said I just wanted to be the last one in there to give her her gifts, you know, maybe held the baby and then leave. And I didn’t realize that [NAME OTHER] was going to get so upset. You know, I said I tried to apologize to her. She doesn’t want to have anything to do with it. I said I’m just going to apologize to you, okay, and let you know that I am sorry about everything that happened. I wasn’t trying to make it all about me, you know, and [NAME OTHER] said she’s just a big pain in the ass.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He said that about you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh about [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Don’t worry about it. He said I don’t have a problem about any of it. He said don’t worry about it. It’s a good thing he is so easy going. And that was the end of it, you know, and [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] are saying in the kitchen, you know, [NAME OTHER] like this, [NAME OTHER] brought [NAME OTHER] in to me. [NAME OTHER] wouldn’t even talk to me that day, that night when they came over. We were exchanging gifts.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Christmas and [NAME OTHER] brought [NAME OTHER] in to me and that’s the first time, Christmas. He was born on the [DATE]. It was the first time I got to hold him was Christmas Eve and he said you want to hold your grandson and I was in tears because it was like [NAME OTHER] didn’t even bring him in. She wouldn’t talk to me and I’m like I don’t want to hold him if [NAME OTHER] doesn’t want me to, you know. And I just sat in the back room and held him and cried. You know, it shouldn’t have been like that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well it would be nice if it wasn’t but [PATIENT NAME] the way your issue with [NAME OTHER] isn’t [INAUDIBLE]. It’s probably going to be that way isn’t it? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well it isn’t now.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s better?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well yeah, it’s all fixed now.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But she, it should have been a happy.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I wish it would have been a happy time for both of you. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I just, I didn’t make it about me. For her to say that I ruined it for her, I didn’t, I didn’t. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re not that powerful to ruin someone else’s day. She chooses to react how she reacts. She’s being a victim there. She’s following the victim role. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But to stand there in front of the whole family and say that I ruined her day, her birthday for her son.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But [PATIENT NAME], is that any different from the way she’s been for the last years? That’s just [NAME OTHER] isn’t it? And I think the challenge for her is to not take her behavior personally. Don’t personalize it. Don’t look at it as a reflection on you, just look at it as this is [NAME OTHER] this is the way she lives her life. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean anybody that knows me knows that the last thing I would ever do for anybody in my family is hurt them or want to do anything malicious to them or, I just think that was pretty mean of her, [INAUDIBLE] her. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> When she gets angry, she lashes out doesn’t she?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She can be pretty evil with her…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She can be pretty hurtful yeah. So, thinking about the situations with [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] and how you got your feelings hurt in both of them, and what can you do in the future so you don’t get hurt again. I mean one of the things that you said and I think is a wonderful idea is, it’s okay for you to speak up and ask for what you want. With [NAME OTHER] it’s okay to say I want to come see my grandson. I want to hold my grandson. With [NAME OTHER] it’s okay for you to call them up and say I’ve been worried about you. I want to know how you’re doing. And I think you’re right, I think the fear of rejection is what stops you. If you’re willing to take risks, ask for what you want and need, [PATIENT NAME] I think you’re going to get it more often. And I think if you wait for your kids to do it for you, you’re probably going to end up feeling frustrated again and again and again. So what I want to empower you to do is to go for it and really ask for what you want. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I put myself out there with [NAME OTHER] and I did get hurt. I mean but I didn’t go the extra and say I want to hold [NAME OTHER]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Which is really what, on one level, what you wanted.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. She said, why didn’t you just ask me to hold him?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well and the reason I think is because you were afraid to be rejected again, right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well because she said I’m going to call the nurse and have her come take him.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So your feelings were hurt. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I took that as go home mom.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right so you took it as a rejection. She doesn’t want you to hold her son and so you didn’t ask to. [PATIENT NAME] here’s the next step for you, I think, which is even if somebody does and it hurts you, just still go ahead ask for what you want even if she says I’m going to have the nurse come and take him, still say, you know, can I hold him before he goes back to the nursery, I want to hold my new grandson. If you can put yourself out there to that degree where you really ask for what you want, it doesn’t mean you’re going to get it every time but you’re more like to get it. And so [PATIENT NAME] what we can work on is helping you face that fear of rejection and ask for what you want anyway. Okay?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s what I really want to focus with you on, is helping you, because that’s, if you wait for people to meet your needs, I’m afraid it’s not going to happen. I think the only way it’s going to happen is if you really again feel strong enough to ask for what you want even though you’re afraid that people are going to say no or criticize you or reject you, all those fears can come out. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It took me back in time to being that little girl again at the mercy of adults. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And back then, it didn’t matter if you asked or not because you probably weren’t going to get what you want anyway and it does put you back in that same position, that’s the hard part is realizing that even though there are similarities when you were a little girl and you were powerless, now as an adult you have some power and authority you didn’t have back then and you can do things like f back then you wanted to talk to somebody, you couldn’t pick of the phone and call, now you’re darn right, if you want to talk to your son, you can pick up the phone, you can call him and if he’s too busy to talk, you can say well when would be a good time because I want to talk to you, I want to find out that you’re okay. If [NAME OTHER] says no, I’m going to send him back to the nursery, I don’t want you to hold him right now. Well, then when can I hold him because I really want to hold my grandson, I’m excited about having a grandson and I want to hold him. So you don’t give up on yourself. Because really that’s who you give up on if you don’t ask, you give up on yourself. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, it’s a self-esteem thing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It is, it’s feeling like you desire to get what you want or what you need.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well often than not, I feel like I don’t deserve anything.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I understand, that’s the thing that you battle the most and when you start asking for it and getting it, you’re going to start feeling like yeah you do deserve this, you do deserve to talk to your son, you do deserve to hold your grandson. Those are reasonable things to ask for and as you get them, it will build your self-esteem [PATIENT NAME] and it will be even easier to ask, it will build your self-esteem more, it will just be a positive snowball.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It doesn’t take much to knock me off.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right now it doesn’t, it doesn’t because the wounds are pretty deep when you feel rejected but we can work together to help you feel stronger so when people do those things out of thoughtlessness or meanness or anger or whatever the reason is, if you have some armor, some protection, some shielding, it won’t hurt so much, you can still go get what you want.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Why do the people that you love the most hurt you the most? Why do they feel like they have a pass to say things that they wouldn’t say to, strangers are nicer to me than my family. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Look [PATIENT NAME], part of it is how long you’ve tolerated it, you’ve put up with it, you know, after a while people just feel like it’s okay because they’ve done it over and over and over again but once you teach them it’s not okay, they’re going to stop.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I wouldn’t say things to, I wouldn’t say half these things to people that, I just don’t understand why people think that they have a right to, a carte blanche…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well [PATIENT NAME] I don’t know why they think that, but I think what’s really important is the answers of what can you do to put a stop to it, okay? We’re going to have to stop. I didn’t look.Do you need any prescriptions today? Do you know?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t think so. Is the Adderall good?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We did it two weeks ago. Okay, so we’re good there. What about, do you know about the Klonopin, are you doing okay?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think I have two more.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Refills?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think I do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Actually they’re going to expire though after six months.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Are they?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it’s been six months so why don’t I get you a new prescription so you don’t run out.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And the Topamax let me look at that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah the funny thing about that is if I was getting it at Safeway, it would be different but, oh and they don’t, you know what, they don’t carry the antidepressant at the hospital.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And at Safeway, it comes under a whole different [DEIDENTIFIED] thing. You have to pay like twenty some dollars for it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I never heard of that. I thought it was either three or nine. I guess a new… </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> More expensive thing. I mean it’s still…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Still not…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. It would be hundreds and hundreds if I didn’t have any insurance.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, [NAME OTHER] is real understanding but he said I’d much rather do that than, you know, he said it’s worth it to- </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’m glad he’s supporting you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He surprised me for my birthday. He got me a new cell phone. Actually he got me a PDA.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Look at this thing. It’s a quick phone, it’s a PDA phone, it’s a computer.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that’s nice.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it’s the one I said I originally wanted and he said you don’t need something like that and then he went out and got it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He was trying to surprise you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I can never get on the computer. It also is like an IPOD too. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It plays music.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you can download, if I can ever figure out how to use the whole thing. I got this whole book I’ve got to read. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> They’re getting so sophisticated.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They’ve got Windows on it. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So it’s like a computer.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It is a computer, it’s a personal computer. And they kept it on my old program which is, they didn’t want to, but I got, its a hundred dollars [INAUDIBLE] and everything is unlimited.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they didn’t want to do that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s great. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right [PATIENT NAME]. All right, so in…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Two weeks.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Two weeks, let me look at the date. Let me check real quick.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My birthday is on the [DATE]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well have a happy birthday. The [DATE] will be the next time, does that sound okay?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, great. All right, well take care of yourself. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you too. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, see you later. </P>

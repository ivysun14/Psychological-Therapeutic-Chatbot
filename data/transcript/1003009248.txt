<p><b>DR:</b> I know, but I'm one of your doctors too, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and um, and I, I just wondered if it was her idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If it was, it was my idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I made a remarkable recovery within my arm, my leg, you know, I, I couldn't move it very much, it, I even gained some weight in my leg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're doing okay.  Um, how old are you now, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE].  And, where are you living?  What sort of place are you living at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In a assisted living.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so that's new for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, and how is that going in assisted living?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How is what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How hard, how's it going now at assisted living?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's very good, I, I like I have my own room, and, and it's uh, I get all my pills and everything from the doctor there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So it wasn't so bad moving there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pardon?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It wasn't so bad moving there, was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it wasn't bad at all, because uh, [NAME OTHER] couldn't take care of me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Over there.  And she had several fits of anger all the time, and, and I was uh, having to go to the bathroom a lot and I quit going to the bathroom when I moved away from her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right, now they did not list your current meds, so let me take a look and see what I got in my chart here.  Uh, let's see what I got, your discharge summary.  Uh, admit, admit, admit, discharge.  Yeah, I think I got, let see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Apparently some medications that they're giving me are working well because I feel fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well that's good.  Um, I'm just looking in my computer to see if I can find what I discharged you on.  Here we are.  Transfer summary.  Discharge medications, okay.  You are on um, did you get, did we give a, an, one of the shots?  Let's see.  Um, Cogentin, 0.5 mg three times a day.  Um, just [INAUDIBLE] how it all [INAUDIBLE].  Okay.  Oh, there you are, Seroquel, 25 mg in the morning and 50 at bedtime.  Okay, how's that working out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's good.  Well I'm, I have eye problem but I have an eye doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and, this eye, this eye is, I'm almost blind on this eye, but I have an appointment with the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Eye doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  All right, um, now are you hearing any voices, or any -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now, how about your daughter, are you still, uh, I know you're, you're thoughts are that she's stealing from you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, well I can prove it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can prove it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ye, because um, when I came to um, New Mexico, uh, I couldn't write, I, I was sick, and she was writing all my checks -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I had a, a, a, I had a um, a savings account and a checking account that was pretty good, when I called over there they told me that my daughter had used it all, and, and I'm going to have that looked into because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wasn't writing the checks, she was writing the checks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well how much did you think your, do you think your daughter stole from you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't, I have no idea, but I was, I get good retirement and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm very frugal and I had quite a bit and she was very interested in paying her mortgage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and uh, all of a sudden I don't have nothing in the, in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I, I think, you know, I know I've talked to your daughter and it, it is all explained and that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's what they say, but I'm, I'm going to, I have an attorney that's going to take the checks to the bank.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but this has happened to you once before with another one of your family members that you thought was stealing from you, and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, nothing, not so, nothing happened like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But did you contact the police and everything about that other family member?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, okay.  Now you have a court date coming up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  That's what, I thought she was referring to a court case and my attorney told me that she had no, when she told me I had to come and see you I said, they're going to, the, the attorney told me, hey, they have to approve it and he, he hadn't made that appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, right, well, I want to see you both as a follow up, but, but I am part of that because the issue is sort of are you, is overall competency, you know, to make decisions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, that, that's what, I already took, I already took that test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and you're contesting that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not contesting it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well your lawyer seems to think you are, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which lawyer did you talk to?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, I didn't talk to your lawyer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I know the county attorney -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We going to have a hearing on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that will, that, I already took that competency test and uh, the, the man that gave me the test said I did very well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I answered all the questions he asked me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you, you seem, but regardless you're happy with the situation without, your living situation, are you happy with your daughter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm happy with her, but, except that uh, she doesn't tell me the truth about many things like she didn't tell me she was playing around with my money.  They were taking it out from, when I found out she was taking it out, you know what she told me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You want to see me in, in the penitentiary, don't you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, I really don't think your daughter is stealing your money.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well what happened to my money?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think, I can't remember the details, but we went through this before, and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what they have it there, they're very sharp.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was all accounted for and it's just that there, uh, I think you, for, you're confusing some things up, and then you keep on contacting the police and this, this -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I have never contacted the police, she says I contacted the police?  She said I was calling an attorney -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well maybe not the police.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've never done any such thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you have contacted attorneys -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've only contacted one pro bono attorney, uh, and asked him what I should do.  And then I said, the, how the money was going away.  I had a, I had a savings account and they told me that my daughter had taken it and that, and the savings account, and so uh, he said you better try and, and straighten it with your daughter, so, you don't have a legal service, and see if you can make it up, so that was it, but he said that's a criminal charge.  That's what they told me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, but just the same thing happened in, was it New Mexico, or where you used to live?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing happened in New Mexico, she's building up that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, but it was with, with one other relative you did the same thing, it wasn't with your, do have a, a son?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, but he's never here.  I've never done anything with a relative.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well she sure tells tales.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know she's trying to build a case against me, that's why she brought me here.  I shouldn't have come.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I like, and I'm going to tell my lawyer about it because she's doing something wrong here.  My lawyer is the only one that has to ask all these questions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well what is your lawyer supposed to be doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My lawyer is always, we are going to have a hearing, and, and it's the first, uh, [INAUDIBLE], of um, of my sanity I guess you want to call it and, and uh, in April.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I hope things work out, because it sounds like your living situation is good and you know, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The thing is this, once she found out how much money I had she wouldn't let go, she wouldn't give me my CD's, she would keep everything from me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and you know, and, I mean, the reason I have money is because I'm frugal with my money and her husband want to get her in a hurry to pay the mortgage and so he can retire.  She said so herself, and so what happens, they use my money to pay a mortgage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All righty, but I'm not sure I agree with that's what's going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I hope it isn't but, it, it, well where is that money?  It's, they say it's there, where?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let me ask you what day is it today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pardon?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What day of the week is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Today is uh, let's see, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, and the date?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The day is uh, the, the, let's see the date, is, I can't tell you for sure, the [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of what month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> March.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And what -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you're giving me a competency test without my permission.  I didn't want a competency test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'm, no, I'm just doing a mental status test right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and what year is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's 09.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And that, that's good.  Actually it's the [DATE], not the [DATE], but you know, people forget those things.  Okay, who's the current president of the United States?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And who was the previous president?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  You know, I think you memory is good, um, let, let me take, use um, give you three things, repeat and remember them.  A car, a dog, a house.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A car, a dog, a house?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got that?  Repeat that again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A car, a dog, a house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, can you remember that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now spell the word world backwards.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> World?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Backwards, world.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you spell that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> D W O R L D, is the way you spell it right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> DO U R, I can't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And what were those three words I asked you to remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A car, oh, gosh I got mixed up now, a car, a -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's a little confusing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See you're giving me a test that I already took, this is unfair.  I got tricked into coming here to take a test that I don't want to take.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it really isn't a trick, this is a follow up from my previous, um, meeting with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You weren't my, my, my doctor then, it was, I had so many other doctors.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, well I had you when you were, you remember when you were on the inpatient unit, right?  I was your doctor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, yeah, when I was here, uh, when she brought me in because she was, she's trying to build a case against me, and she's very clever.  Because she wants to get a hold of my money that I, see I get a good, uh good, um, pension every month and what, and you know what makes me sad?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We sold our house and I gave her all the money that we sold the house for.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you know, when you talk to your husband too, he, he doesn't agree that, that that's the case.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well he doesn't know, they're probably using his money too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now, I, but you're still friendly with your daughter aren't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just around the money, that it kind of hurts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well you're sure making a good case for her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, [LAUGHING] I'm not trying to do that, I'm just trying to help the situation out if I can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're not trying to do it, but it's very, uh, it's, it's so, because I'm going over something I already went through with the uh, that, the lawyer appointed me, and I told her, and the lawyer told me the only one who could make appointments for me was him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, but I made this appointment.  I was the one who called up and wanted this appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How come?  Did she tell you I was uh, making, hearing voices?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, because I've seen you before and um, I follow up people post hospitalization.  You were just in the hospital in, let's see when was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well you must be very busy to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In December.  Well, that's what I do, I see patients.  Okay, um, it's not such a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I'm very unhappy because she's building cases against me and you're helping her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, but the good thing is that you're, um, you know, you're in a place and you're happy with the place, and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, but she's trying to take the, have somebody handle my money, not me.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think that she just wants, you know, where your, the assisted living costs money, so you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's none of her business, that money -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now your husband doesn't like there, does he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, that I worked hard all my life, I was a judge, a retired judge, I am.  And worked for the department of , uh, for labor for 15 years, and I, I always took good care of my money, why did I have good money set, because I'm not, I'm careful and I'm not foolish.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were a judge?  Did you, did you go to law school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I was a judge.  I was a judge for the, um, for [DEIDENTIFIED] and what I had is, I, I worked as a, a, a claims examiner for the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I passed the tests, uh, and I went as a court clerk, and I knew everything that was going on with the clerk, and the judge died, and the governor said, we don't need to hire anybody, [NAME OTHER] knows very well how to handle this office, so I became a judge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's good.  What if we met again in July, how about the end of July?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pardon?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What if we met at the end of July.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What, what was it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't we set up another appointment in July?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I don't know that I want another appointment, since I'm tired of going to doctors and I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's, that's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I went -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a long time a way, in July.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, you want another appointment in July, and is it for what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a, just a follow up with the medications and stuff, okay?  So, uh, I'll do Friday, [DATE] at um, 1:45.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay, um and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She sat down with you and told you all the dirt she could about me, or invent about me, and that's, that's not very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I could tell you a lot of dirt about her too, but I won't stoop to that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well she really hasn't told me the dirt and stuff like that.  All right, let me see you um, in July, okay, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> July?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're looking good, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, and, and you know, uh, I, I don't know whether, what, what is it they're trying to prove here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not trying to prove anything, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just that I'm doing okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  Because I have you on that medication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What medication do you have me on?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that the one they're giving me at, at uh, at the home?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], all right?</p>

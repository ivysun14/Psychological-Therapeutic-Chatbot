<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, let's turn this fan off too real quick.  All right, so you met with [NAME OTHER] earlier today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, did you tell her you're not feeling well, right?  You were feeling depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, we really didn't talk about that as much, um, the sleep is my biggest concern.  I've been sleeping like 12 to 15 hours.  I mean like every time I, there's nothing to do I just want to sleep -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I, that's all I want to do.  I have no motivation to do anything.  I feel the crashes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay well that's not good.  Um, how are we doing with the drinking and smoking you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't drank since the last time I been here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent, well good for you, that's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I smoked once or twice a week if that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Last time I seen you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right well that's good that you're cutting down on that.  Uh, it would nice if we could get to no marijuana, you know, even though once or twice is pretty good.  Um, what else are you doing?  Are you using the, uh, Klonopin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Klonopin every night right?  Right, just a tiny little dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then are you taking Elavil at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was a medicine we gave to you for sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you ever fill that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, yeah I did but I don't want to take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I feel like I've been sleeping too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Too much, yeah that makes sense.  Did you, um, did you take it though ever do you remember or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, okay.  Okay are you going to counseling at all?  Are you seeing, you know, [NAME OTHER] or [NAME OTHER] or anyone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  All right well we're making some progress in some areas and then in others I guess we're having some trouble.  This Cymbalta, um, you, you know, I don't recall you, um, complaining about sleeping all the time on the lower dose right?  I don't remember that being an issue.  You definitely are very sensitive to a lot of these medications and we might find that, um, a lower dose and then, and also shifting the dose to, to nighttime instead of in the morning might be a better way for you to take this.  Uh, what do you think about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ah, you know anything if it can help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's pretty high that's an anxiety.  Do you feel like you're more anxious or depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Both.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Both.  What are you worrying about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, my son's father is in jail, my Grandma had a stroke, my brother just had a baby and he's in jail.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's a lot of stuff going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My son is out of control, I mean he's just, he won't listen to me.  Ever since his dad is, hasn't been around as much it's just like, um, like he just won't listen, he, he's the biggest stress in my life [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel that I can control me and him and I can't control him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's not listening to me.  He's being very bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He is literally, he took bubbles last week and dumped them on the floor in front of me, on purpose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't understand what, I, I think maybe he wants attention or something but we go for walks, we go to the park -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We go to stores.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, he gets snacks, we go out to dinner, I mean, we just went to Longhorn the other day, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do things with him all the time but I think maybe he's feeling my stress, maybe I'm sleeping a lot -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So maybe that's taking away from him too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old is he now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He'll be [AGE] on the [DATE] so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you are falling asleep at night and then you're just sleeping a lot during the day also?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I go to sleep at like, it was going until like 5:00 in the morning and I like started myself to like, okay, um, I'm going to get to sleep by 2:00 and then I started I'm going to get to sleep by midnight -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'll get to sleep by 11:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So lately I've been getting to sleep around 11:00 or midnight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't know I'm like, the next morning when I wake up I'm just so tired that I wake up with my son and I get so tired that like he's lying back down for a nap early and I'm going to sleep early, you know, maybe he's getting too much sleep or I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I'm sleeping so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, um, it's, I think, uh, very good thing to hear that you've shifted around your sleep, wake cycle to some extent.  That you're not staying up until 3:00, 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning.  Um, and I would continue to encourage more of that.  Um, in regards to your energy, I mean, I, I don't want to harp on the smoking of marijuana but, but obviously that's not helping I don't believe.  Uh, but also anxiety, you know, with your anxiety being so high you burn up a tremendous amount of energy, um, with, with your high anxiety, okay, I mean it's wasted energy and it's, um, you know, it's, and there's restless energy that goes along that, so it's not only becomes mental but physical right?  Would any of the medicines that you've been on in the past to address your mood or anxiety, I mean, is there anything that stands out that worked better than, than the next?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I just really go back to Abilify.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really liked Abilify but I think I had a lot of energy with Abilify.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah I think the dosing of it caused what we would call akathisia or some kind of inner sense of restlessness.  Um, but that generally is a dose related and time limited side effect for a lot of people.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Abilify was making me like, I got, it was like, like sh, like shake, like, um, I know I'm taking it and I was feeling like I was just had to move so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.  All right, um, there are like 6 other medicines in its class, um, but you've been on a couple of them.  Invega and Zyprexa are 2.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Zyprexa made me gain like 100 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah that was a bad one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Invega made me more tired than what I am from this medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the other things you took Seroquel right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You never took Seroquel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No weight gainer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you ever take it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No I didn't want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well then you never took, um, right to told me that before.  You've never taken, um, what about Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wellbutrin people, um, tend to lose a few pounds or at least stay even on it.  Same thing with Prozac, ever take Prozac?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.  So these are a couple options that are out there for you, you know, they're not habit forming, they don't cause weight gain, they're usually a little bit more activating than some of the other treatments that are there.  So we could do, ah, a simple swap with the, ah, Cym, Cymbalta and look at what happens with some Prozac.  Prozac is fluoxetine, it's a good medicine, it's been around for a long time since the 80s.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Has anyone ever died on it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably.  Has anybody ever died because of it?  Using it in therapeutic doses, I doubt it.  It's been around since the 80s.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you take it in the morning or at night?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would take it in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fine with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah I think you'll really like it.  I think you'll really do well on it.  It's, it's really what they call a gold standard treatment so it's a, you know, a lot of these newer medicines that come out have to be tried against it to say hey, we can do what Prozac can do.  Have you heard of it before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Prozac, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so but at least it's worth, I mean there's not an endless amount of options.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What is Prozac like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a serotonin reuptake inhibitor so it works on serotonin, um, whereas the drug you're, which is a chemical messenger that is thought, uh, with depression and anxiety to be out of balance.  So essentially it will reset that imbalance, the chemical imbalance.  So it increases your serotonin.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what you're doing now you're on a medicine that that has serotonin but also neuro epinephrine and sometimes that neuro epinephrine while some people find it activating I think you're finding it makes you tired, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But people, but it's, it's not in the class of medicine like, um, the Zyprexa, you know, when you gain weight.  That's a different -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just can't stand sleeping like this anymore.  I mean I get up and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going back to PHP and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before I was, I needed to be able to be motivated to get out of bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But then I don't want to go to PHP from 9:00 to noon and then I go home and sleep -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From noon to 5:00 either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.  I would really try your best to try and, and, and stick to this, ah, you know, sleep, wake cycle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the caffeine I figured would keep me up -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's making me tired too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you have been using lots of caffeine right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that's what you told me last time.  And, you know, your, your son I mean, children are difficult, um, and, and being a parent is never easy, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean you see these shows on TV do you ever watch like, you know, The Nanny or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right or, or, what is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nine one one Nanny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> J, J-camp, you know, someone and Kate Plus 8, whatever, what's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Jon and Kate Plus 8?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah have you seen that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I mean these are real life situations of parenting and it's, it's a challenge so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just very stressing to me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because it's like I don't have control over my father or son.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or my son's father.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see what you're saying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have control over my brother or anything right, but I do have control over myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I feel I should have control over my son.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he's not listening to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I'm, I'm trying to, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean he's getting to the point where I, I'm giving her a cup of chocolate milk -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And say, "Drink it in the kitchen."  He looks right at me and walks in the living room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  You know, some of the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's what gets me is the stuff that's on purpose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I, I'm not saying there's an easy fix for this but I, I want to give you some, some strength to understand that, you know, it sounds like you're doing good things with your son and you're trying hard and you, you know, don't give up, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you need to, um, what I found to be the most effective way of dealing with this, kids of all age really, and all relationships, you know, is to have some consistency.  So if you say to him, you know, if you do that, this is what's going to happen and you have to do it on their age level and what they understand but, understand that there are consequences and that you mean what you say.  Even if it makes more work for you.  In the short run it will make more work for you but in the long hopefully it will pay off.  An, an example, you know, if you keep this behavior up, you know, no TV for, for tonight.  So even though no TV might mean more work for you because he's not watching TV in the long run, you know, if that's an example, you know, or if you're in the restaurant and he's throwing stuff all over the place even though it will maybe cost you money and certainly be an unpleasant to get up and leave in the middle of the meal, if you do it once they're going to understand, hey, mom's not messing around so you say, hey, you know, straight in the eye, this is what you're doing, this is what I, you know, need you to do or not do and if you don't this is what's going to happen.  On the flip side you could say, if you do something good, you know, whatever you, you want the outcome to be, drink your milk over here, then you can do this, whatever that might be.  Read a book, go outside, play with your whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we do, we do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you've got to hold, hold to those things and don't give up and I agree there's a lot in your life that is out of your control, uh, and, and, and making parenting even more difficult.  But as you are well aware, you're not the only, you know, mom out there trying to manage without all the resources that might be available to other people, you know, so just you've got to stick with it okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And do your best in trying to, um, to stay away from smoking.  I do appreciate your honesty with it too because, you know, we can't help you if we don't know what's going on.  So it, it factors into all of it and we'll see how, how it goes.  I think you'll feel better about yourself and also just in general, you know.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we're going to make that a, a shift.  We're going to take you down off the Cymbalta and I'm going to give you a weeks worth of 30s, so we don't just pull it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh I have some of those [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thirty for a week, stop it.  At the same time, Prozac okay?  You, you'll do fine on this.  And then, you know, get back in here in another -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thirty for week and then go and do the Prozac.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no.  At the same time you're doing the 30, you'll be on both for a week.  So it'll be a cross taper here okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm taking 30 mg for a week along with the Prozac.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Correct.  Okay?  You going to able to do this?  Or, or are you not comfortable doing that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well if it's safe -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's safe.  You'll be all right.  Okay?  All right, [PATIENT NAME].  I'll see you back here, you know, um, in a couple weeks.  Two to 4 weeks, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll see what happens with this.  All right?  Give you some examples next time in your parenting area.  Good or bad we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah hopefully good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Try it out okay?  Hopefully good, you're right.  Okay.  See you.</p>

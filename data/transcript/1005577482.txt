<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(starts at 00:06:05)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Hello. How are you? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Thank you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sorry about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oy. Traffic, traffic, traffic. (sigh) Thanks. (sigh)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Hi. Anyway, (inaudible at 00:06:25) (sigh) Hi.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (sigh) What's new?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Not much. I just got out of work. (inaudible) I'm exhausted. (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I got out late.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you usually work until (inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Last night you did what? Seven thirty or eight to eight to eight in the morning.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Until nine. (laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Nine.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Busy day.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We would have been here earlier but I couldn't get out of work. So I'm trying to -  (sigh) Where did we leave off? (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it hard to know where to start? [00:07:26]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think so. Especially right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We've been doing fine. We had like one argument, or not even, that like lasted ten minutes and we were able to like talk through it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So, other than that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, as long as we don't argue about stuff we're fine. You know? For the most part.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So that's nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then I guess the question is, well all couples argue sometimes - </p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the question is, when you say, "As long as you don't argue about stuff," well what leads you to argue about less stuff? (laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um. Less time together (laughs) to fight about stuff.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Preoccupied. I don't know. Just I'm not bothered by the stuff that usually bothers me. [00:08:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, if we don't have time to -  Like we're arguing about something while we're like running around doing something, it just doesn't seem like it ends. But if we have time to like, to ourselves, and we're arguing about something, we can usually either take a break for a minute and then get back together and figure something out or -  You know? Does that seem right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (whispers) I don't know. (laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You don't know, meaning?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know what you're trying to say?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Like if we're running around doing stuff and we argue about something, it's usually worse because we can't -  We're doing it when we're doing stuff.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right? Doesn't that make sense? If we're not running around doing stuff and get in an argument we can usually figure it out.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: We won't like prolong the argument and we get over stuff faster.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: At least I think so. Do you? [00:09:31]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh. I just thought I heard you say, "I guess."</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I agree.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I agree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You guys seem like you're in like a different space today and I wonder if it's, in part, just because you're tired? (laughs)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I'm exhausted but no we've been good. We haven't argued. I haven't been annoyed by like any little stuff, I guess. But I'm preoccupied.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So things haven't bothered me. And you've been busy, so.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm hm. Pretty busy. Work, work work, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You describe a lot of your, sort of, how your relationship is going based on circumstances. Like if you're, well sometimes if you're busy you feel like there's less time for fighting. Sometimes if your busy, Marlene (ph) - </p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST:  - you feel upset that you're not spending time together.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it actually makes things worse.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But a lot of times the way you think about your relationship is on like sort of week by week the circumstances of your week. [00:10:41]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that's like with every relationship. There are stressors that come up and it depends if you're like exhausted or something's been bugging you like repetitively, how you're going to react. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So that's usually what it is. Like if I am overtired and he continues to do something that like would bother me, but I usually get over it, but depending on like, you know, if I can deal with it or not and how I react towards it. It's how our fights usually, you know. Either it's a quick fight or it's a longer fight. (laughs) It's how I react towards it, pretty much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And that's what I'm like learning. That I don't need to react like that. It's not a big deal. As long as he knows like what, you know, aggravates me and he understands. It's nice to know that like he understands me. You know? (laughs) That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't sound like it makes sense to me. [00:12:01]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Did you say "stressors?"</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Just like I'm stressed out and there's something that's bothering me, and then something happens, like say you did something that really aggravated me. If I'm not stressed out I'd probably, you know, react differently.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, I know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Or as opposed if I'm stressed out I'd probably like dig into you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I'm trying not to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So. I don't know if you can tell.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm hm. You're getting better at it. Definitely. You know?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (laughs) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You guys have your triggers, as most couples and people do. I see when you guys get triggered you go to a sort of dark place quickly.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, like the last argument we had, like I felt that way. Like I felt like hurt by whatever. And he was like, "You know, mood," or what not. And I felt hurt because I didn't understand why he was acting that way. And I kind of just left. [00:13:18]</p>

<p>And instead of, like I'd like obsess and look at my phone to see if he called me. I didn't look at my phone, I just continued doing what I wanted to do. And like I got back in the car and saw that he called me and we were able to talk about it.</p>

<p>But normally I'd like stress out about the fight and I wouldn't continue to like, you know, go on with my day. It would just like bother me so much that I couldn't do anything - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT:  - except just be upset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And this time it was I had more control over that. Him not making me feel, or myself not making me feel horrible (inaudible at 00:14:05).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It was just a little argument.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, she's gotten a little better. She's gotten a lot better with, you know, not like extending our argument throughout the rest of the day. It used to be if we got in an argument it would bother her for the rest of the day. You know? Especially if she went to work she'd tell me, she'd say, "My whole day is ruined." You know, "I'm starting off my work day like this." </p>

<p>But that doesn't happen as much as it used to, at least. And it barely happens anymore at all, I guess I should say. Which is really - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think helped you let go? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, that's okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think like just because I know - what you said - like we're not trying to hurt each other. [00:15:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You know, it's not that big of a deal. Like knowing that, like you can see that, you know, other people can see that he loves me and like and I am accepting that now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And that I am making things up to be a big deal and I don't need to because it's affecting my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know it's, you know, it's easier if I don't react that way too because he reacts different. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm not like over emotional and then we can talk things out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I think that's what helped - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT:  - was knowing that he's trying too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. It's sometimes really hard to separate the affect it has on you with the intent. And that's what you're describing.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That even if you get hurt that doesn't mean that's Steve's intent.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Being able to separate those two things out has been very helpful. [00:16:08]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Absolutely. Yeah. So I think that -  I saw myself doing that that day we got in a fight. Like, "Oh my God." You know like, "I can't believe he's acting that way." But I kind of, I was able to have more of a control over it than before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So it turned into a positive. So that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like, Steve, you've noticed a difference too.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, things are a lot easier, you know, when stuff isn't, be repetitive but, you know, when things aren't drawn out and, you know, things aren't blown out of proportion. You know, it's a lot easier to talk things through and, you know, put things in perspective and rationalize whether it was really worth it. You know? [At least I think so.] (ph) [00:17:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel that when Marlene does feel upset that you feel overwhelmed?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, I'm not overwhelmed. No. I mean I understand why she's upset. You know? And I used to think that, you know, that it was, you know, like you would bring things to that point where it's like almost life or death. You know, like extreme, very extreme. You know? </p>

<p>But she doesn't do that anymore. You know, I think she's taken it down a few notches and I think she's thinking about stuff. You know? I mean I can just tell that she's thinking, "Is it really worth," you know, "the argument?" It's good. </p>

<p>Plus I think she might be focusing more on work too. You know, she's really trying to (sigh) -  She's trying to get things together so she can get back in school and stuff. So I think the less we fight the more, you know, it benefits both of us. So I think that's also shortened things a little bit too. You know, the length of our argument or just things in general, so we can be happy while we're at home spending time together. [00:18:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. I know you've expressed, Steve, feeling kind of like stressed about the limits of time or the time constraints. And I'm wondering if you're still feeling that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: We talked about this the other day. Not really. I mean, things have changed so much. You know, it used to be like, you know, if I'd go pick up my paycheck, you know, I couldn't -  I mean I knew every half an hour she'd call me or she'd send me a text or something on the dot, every single time. You know, whenever I left to go somewhere.</p>

<p>But, you know, now she just does her own thing, I think. And, you know, I think she realizes that, you know, I should be allowed to go out and do that stuff. If I want to give her a call, I give her a call. If she wants to give me a call, she gives me a call. [00:19:56]</p>

<p>I think just knowing that she can do that is a little more comforting, rather than, you know, being in touch with me while she's at home without being with me. Like, you know what I mean? Like, I don't know. It's hard to explain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you feel like you're given a little more space?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Or at least that's kind of -  It's been a while. I'm just trying to think. That's I think how things felt, at least for me. Like even though she wasn't with me she wanted to be like with me through the phone. Like that used to be a big thing. </p>

<p>But I think, you know, we try to spend more time together when we're together, so I think that kind of takes off some of the pressure of the whole phone thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know? And that gives me a little bit of feeling of the freedom. [00:20:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know? When I'm out and about just doing whatever. But, I mean, I know we -  She brought this up I think, let me see, yesterday or the day before yesterday, that she doesn't, you know, she's not texting me and calling me all the time like she used to. You know, it wasn't a bad thing, but I'm just saying I was -  You know what I mean?</p>

<p>Like she's just a little more relaxed I think, is the word I'm trying to find. Does that make any sense? No. (laughs)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I am. I don't worry as much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And like I feel like my last relationship like I really had a bad relationship. And, I mean, I dealt with like some post traumatic stress because of that relationship. But I had to do like the phone because it was a long distance relationship and that's how we kept in touch. [00:22:02]</p>

<p>And it was always like, "You didn't pick up." Or, "Why didn't you answer my text?" And I found myself like behaving, like picking up the bad habits of my last boyfriend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I think I brought that into this relationship because that's what we used to do with each other. So I had like something with the phone for the longest time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because that was our relationship, so. (inaudible at 00:22:34)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That -  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Go ahead.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, to put it kind of mildly, that relationship seems like it really did a number on you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. It did. Absolutely. But, I don't know, it doesn't bother me anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And the whole phone thing doesn't bother me anymore. But it took me a long time to like get over that anxiety.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So if he doesn't answer me it's not a big deal. But it's funny because the person I was with never trusted me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And like made me feel fear when I always trusted. And I want like the opposite. So like after that relationship I didn't' trust at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I always like trusted everybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you didn't trust him, I know that, but did he not trust you too?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, that was the thing. He was like possessive and never trusted me. [00:23:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And wanted me to feel that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Like I shouldn't trust him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I kind of brought that into the rest of my relationships I've had after that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I never, never was ever like that. I trusted everybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So it was weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And it was like for a long time. We were together for like four years. So we had a weird relationship like that. But because it was like kind of long distance because we were in school, it was the phone. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's how we communicated. So like I had anxiety about if he didn't text me, like you're ignoring me kind of thing. And I did that with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I know like I don't have to get back right away and it's been busy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And it's the same with him.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. It doesn't bother. I know you're busy.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm hm. [00:24:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I was thinking that, before you were talking about this, that if you have trust and confidence in the relationship it's not the end of the world if you don't hear from somebody.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you feel like kind of they're with you even if they're not, you're not in immediate contact with them.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everything's okay. If you don't have that feeling, nothing is okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everything feels very shaky.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right. So it takes a lot. It takes a lot and I feel like you lose trust in people and you have to build that back up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I feel like I'm there more than I've ever been in my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So that's, yeah, it's a good feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. If you don't text me it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm. Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He's usually sleeping. (laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So then when he says he's sleeping, he's sleeping. (laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. My nap turns into a deep, deep sleep sometimes. [00:25:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is sort of a random fact but it relates to what you're saying, like if you categorize emotions - people have done this - there's actually more negative emotions than positive emotions.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you know, just universally. And the theory behind that is that it's more important to keep - Emotions help keep you out of danger, right? When you're angry or fearful you remove yourself from situations.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so good emotions are nice but they don't do anything for you the way bad emotions do. They keep you out of danger.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think that's true of experience more generally. Like it's hard to let go of those bad experiences because they keep you out of danger, even though they're keeping you out of a danger that no longer exists. (laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so those things really stick with you because of that. Because you sort of, you know, we're sort of made such that it's better to err on the side of thinking things are too dangerous than thinking things aren't dangerous or upsetting enough. </p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But then, of course, in terms of the quality of your life (laughs), it really can take a toll on that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But negative experiences really have a way of just sticking to you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like corn in your teeth. [00:26:43]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And then you just develop behaviors. And it's just like a pattern.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And it's really hard to get out of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But he's like the opposite.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Like he would never, ever feel like I would cheat on him. He would never doubt me. And I'm like that would be a nice feeling, but I'm like, how do you not feel that doubt?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He's not afraid of that at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He's like the opposite.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I don't know what that feels like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So is that a good feeling or is that -  (laughs) To like not worry at all?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. It's good to know that I don't have to worry about that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I wouldn't have any reason to worry about that because I know you wouldn't.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I always took that as a negative thing that he - So that means like he's not going to try hard enough - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT:  - because he doesn't feel like, you know, he has anything, you know, to lose. Like he has me. You know what I mean? [00:27:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I thought that that was a negative thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then if he valued you more he'd be more possessive.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, because of my last relationship. I think that's how it was. So very confusing because you're so like laid back.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm. Yeah. I mean do you know why I feel that way? I mean do you get it? Like I mean I know maybe - </p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's like a thing like because I'm a good person, right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Everything. Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And that I've never given you any doubts.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And that just goes back to like trust issues. Like how can you trust somebody because people make mistakes all the time, for him to think that I could never make a mistake. [00:28:41]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, you know, the way I look at it is if you're going to be in a relationship you want to have, you know, a nice clear head and focus on, you know, using your heart. You know? And taking all that weight off your mind things just, as far as I have had experiences in the past, it just seemed to fall in place for the most part. </p>

<p>Things are a whole lot easier. You know? That I don't have to worry about things. I don't worry. I mean I worry a little bit, but I don't worry, you know, about you running off and meeting somebody at the local bar. You know, stuff like that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's good. </p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I can say that's a good thing, not a bad thing. (laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like in this way this is a really like sort of nice antidote or corrective experience to your earlier relationship, where it's so different to your previous relationship. [00:29:55]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause, laughs) That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Like I want to have a normal relationship but I [don't want to feel that way] (ph). I guess like I had to own it. I had to like, you know, bring that stuff -  Like I would deny like doing behaviors like that, but [if I keep doing that] (ph), act like you're not like being possessive or afraid then you like never get past it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You just keep doing it. When I look at it I think it's, you know, foolish. And I would never want anybody to do that to me, because I have had that done before. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I would never want him to feel that way.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What way?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Just like you didn't have your freedom. You always had to worry about what I was thinking. You know? If like you upset me and how I was going to react. Like that's exactly how I felt in that relationship. [00:31:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: [And I guess] (ph) it's like mimicking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. That's an interesting insight.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I know how he feels.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's stressful.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, kind of. I try not to let it bother me - </p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well that's good.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT:  - because I just, you know, I want to have a clear mind, you know, when we're together. I'm happy just being with you. You know? We don't even have to do anything, I'm just happy to be there with you. You know? </p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I understand. I'm the opposite. Like I like to go and do stuff. (laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well I like doing stuff. I'm saying, I mean I just think about it as I'm, you know, it brings me joy just to be with you. Never mind doing stuff, just to be with you. [00:32:11]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And that's like hard for me. I can't just like sit somewhere and be like, "Oh, I'm happy just being here."</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Like I'm always a step ahead.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I always have to be doing something. And like it's so hard for me to just sit and relax.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Which like he's taught me how to do, which is good.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's not what I'm saying though. Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I do. But I like, I have never felt that way. You know?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just that being happy to be with me?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: To be like, yeah, to like be in the moment. Like, I'm happy to be with you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, yeah, I don't mean -  When I say that I don't mean like happy to be with you like literally just being here.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Like sitting here not doing anything. I mean I'm happy that I'm in a relationship with you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay, but I thought.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh okay. [I guess I went the wrong way.] (ph)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, no, I like doing stuff with you too. Yes.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know, I'm happy I'm in a relationship with you. I guess I should have said that instead. [00:33:14]</p>

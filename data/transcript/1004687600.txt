<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I knew it was going to happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What? Being late?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [inaudible 00:18]. I don't know if I screwed up. Well, basically, on my condo case—the one where I thought I won all the accounts—there actually were three counter claims by the defendant. And I don't really know how this happened but, in my motion, I asked for summary judgment on my three counts, and then on counts one and two of the counter claims. But in my memorandum, I never argued about the two counter claims. What I think happened was I was probably cutting and pasting from another motion that had one and two in there and kind of screwed up that way. Because shockingly, I didn't think that we were entitled to summary judgment on counts one and two, but I think the judge just saw, you know, read the affidavit of this woman, saw she was a lunatic and they didn't refute any of our material facts and just granted us judgment on counts one and two. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there's a count three and I don't know why. I thought I checked it, double checked it that how many counts there were. And double checking it, my recollection is I only saw two. And I called the court and I said, you know, there is not going to be a trial; there are no counts left. And the other attorney, I gave her a heads up that the hearing had been canceled, which the clerk did, and she said that I was; that there was another count and that I was wrong. It was kind of very rudely written e-mail. And I replied, "Which count?" And then I went back and looked and sure enough, there was this third count. And it's a total bogus; it's interference with the realtor. There's a; she didn't word it correctly, but there are two types of ways you can interfere with the contractual relationship with...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 02:47].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's one way; one way would be to, you know, screw that up. But between the plaintiffs on the counter claim, between the contract between the plaintiff and the realtor basically saying they didn't allow the realtor to do her job. Which is a bull shit claim. The reality is that she's counter claimed against the trustees and any actions that my folks took were not trustees; they didn't sit down and have a meeting and say okay, they can't have an open house. These were actions they took as unit owners. So even if they did anything wrong, which I don't think they did, she's not suing the right people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So here I am. I've got to do this trial having never tried a case in my life; not even knowing where to begin, I called Jess and I left a message and Jess responded about how busy she was and this, that, and the other you know; that I should get my friend, who has never tried a case in Superior Court. And you know basically just gave every reason in the world why she wasn't going to help me on it. It's not an appeal; I feel once it kind of clicked in my head, which was actually walking over here this morning—I mean I woke up and I couldn't go back to sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about it. But once it clicked in my head, I was like wait a second, you know; she's suing the wrong people here. But still, I've got to go through this trial that I've never done before. I don't even know where to begin. I don't know how to enter exhibits or rules of evidence or...picking a jury, you know, it's just; it's something I think, you know, I'm just going to look bad in front of my clients, I have a feeling. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When is the trial?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It hasn't been set yet. So they've got to reschedule, put the pre-trial conference back on. And I'm kind of ticked off because we've come close a couple of times and you're supposed to come up with a pre-trial memo which kind of sets everything out so there are no surprises. And the plaintiff is supposed to do it. Well, she's the plaintiff and counter claim and she's never sent me the first draft of the pre-trial memo. Also, the question I have is well what's her damages? The realtor told her to rent instead of selling her property, you know. I mean damages are speculative at best. I mean you can't be awarded speculative damages. Is the realtor even going to show up? You know. </p>

<p>And then there are all these questions of is the realtor's opinion an expert opinion? Well if it's an expert opinion, they're supposed to give me a report, give me notice that they're having an expert. You know there are all these things. So it's like with all these little issues that I have to worry about and work on and I've never done them before. You know. So it's going to be an awful lot of work not knowing what I'm doing. So I'm kind of freaked out about it. I found this all out late yesterday and luckily I had practice to just go run and not think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But once I woke up like 5:00 this morning and didn't go back to bed, and I felt like an idiot because I told my clients that the conference was canceled because there's no more; there's no reason to have a trial. And now I've got to go back to them and say oh, this thing's really screwed up and explain to them how everything happened and you know. One of my trustees is out of the country. It's another issue I don't know how to deal with. </p>

<p>So you know, it's something that they should probably, I don't know, maybe throw a little bit of cash at her and see if she takes it, or offset the damages from the other judgment. But they're not going to do that. There's just so much vile and hatred between these people; the e-mails that go back and forth that they CC me on are just unbelievable. It's just, talk to the Chief of Police. This woman is fucking crazy. She's got these tenants in there. </p>

<p>First of all, there are like four people living there; you can't have more than three unrelated people living in the condo. They're like maybe a tiny little two bedroom or whatever. The funny thing is they complain about how awful their condo looks. I drive by the condo all the time and there's a house right next to it that looks like it's about to fucking fall apart. And it's like your place looks great compared to this other shit hole. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But they just, you know; then they just, oh...driving me crazy. And I don't know; I haven't been paid in months. I've got thousands of dollars in fees that they owe me and it's just ridiculous. Now I've got to fucking do this trial. And even if I did find someone to help me, they've got to be at the pre-trial conference. All trial counselors are supposed to be at the...and the other attorney is a total just shyster trying to slip anything by that she can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So just, it will be a very unpleasant experience all around. I never, you know, examined a witness before. I don't even know what to ask. It's kind of stressing me out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm really pissed off at Jess that she's leaving me flapping in the wind here, you know. It's like not even, well, let's see when the dates are or you know, maybe I can help you out. It's just a long e-mail of why she can't do it and just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just find reasons to loathe her more and more every day. You know, it's like I was always trying to find her business and do things in her interest and you know; because I saw her interest an interest of the kids. But she doesn't do anything that has any concern for me and that's going to make my life easier you know. There's nothing I can do about it. [inaudible 10:39] treat me nicer. Part of the reason I took some of these cases was knowing that I had her to help me try the case if it went to trial. </p>

<p>We had our last regular season for the beginning of [inaudible 12:06]. There's practice on Tuesday and then pasta dinner on Thursday. I think I'm going to ride my bike there. I might be putting my life in to harm's way. I need the exercise. </p>

<p>And then in a couple of weeks, fall practice should be starting up. I'll have a couple of weeks off which I'll probably need, but you know, I've got to find a way to stay active. </p>

<p>Barbara's playing for the fall [inaudible 13:43] a bit more there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 13:48].</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it doesn't make it easy. It's not like there's any awkwardness or anything like that, but you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes you feel bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With my luck, she'll be put on my team. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I feel like, oh, maybe she'll change her mind, you know, but it's like being stupid. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think you'll do about the trial? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean even if Jess just sat down and helped me to prepare it and you know, like...I don't even know what preparation I need to do, you know. We did a trial together and she was putting all these things together and these motions you need to bring up at certain times and a lot of these issues it seems like I have to put forth in the pre-trial memo. Kind of like the issue of the opinion of the realtor. It seems like something you've got to put forth in the pre-trial memo. I don't know anything about expert testimony cases. Jess knows all this stuff. She knows. But I have no access to research other than going to the library. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if this is really a financial issue. What if the issue is that you're either going to have to hire somebody to consult with because this is not within your experience?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have the money to do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or she's going to have to sit down and help you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the thing; is I have non-paying clients. It's not like I can say, "Oh, you know, come help me with this trial and you'll get paid, you know." It's not going to be like that. You know. It would come out of my pocket.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. I'm talking about negotiating this with Jess. I'm not talking about what you can necessarily afford. Like, she's not helping because she's busy or because she wants to put distance between you; like she's seeing it, I would imagine, as kind of a comment on your relationship. But I guess what I'm saying is, I don't know, maybe it feels that way to you; I'm sure it feels that way to you too. But there's also a way in which this is business and you know, it's certainly going to cost you time and maybe it will cost you money if you've got to find some other way to get up to speed on this rather than spending a couple of hours with her. </p>

<p>My point is like what if you take it up with her in a way that makes it explicitly not about your history together and your relationship, which she seems to be making a clear comment about in how she's responding to you. But rather about like essentially the way you're still financially tied together. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's kind of like I took with the office space, you know, even keeping the firm together. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. She's already said she essentially cares less about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Her actions say she's not concerned about my business...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, or your combined income.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think she feels like I'm not putting forth the effort to get enough business or you know I'm not working hard enough or whatever; I'm not doing what I need to do, you know. I can't remember exactly when, but I remember her saying it one time, you know. She's like you're just not doing enough to get business or something. I was like, "Are you fucking kidding me?" You know. I think she's so overwhelmed with work. She's at the beach today. That's the irony of it all. I'm not saying she's entitled to take time off, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today is the day that—I don't know if Stella is not in daycare on Friday or...I don't even know. I have no fucking idea what's going on. It's probably her friend Erica. I think they get a place on the beach every year. So she's going for the day. They're going to be back tomorrow. It seems like a lot of effort for...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For that amount of time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There's nothing on the beach you can't do. Anywhere else it's not going to cost you and...you have to get up early and drive down. I don't know. </p>

<p>There's no presumption that Ian is going to spend the night over on Friday anymore. It's now I have to ask, which is partly my own, you know, because I got so pissed off at him; the kids were just totally out of control. They've been behaving better. But now he'll stay over Saturday night. </p>

<p>At least the Olympics are on. We can watch TV. I don't know what else to do with a kid. He plays with the kids downstairs for a, you know, until their bed time or whatever; suppertime, whatever. I've got to feed him. Totally broke. </p>

<p>I asked my mortgage broker if any of the deals I have are going to be closing any time soon. He was just like, I know when he had to think this hard about it that the answer was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that answered your question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: None was closing soon. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when you say you don't know what to do with Ian, I guess I sort of imagined uncharitably you, that you don't like want to deal with figuring out what you can do with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's probably true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it kind of...probably because it would make you think of things that would make you feel crummy like, not having enough money or knowing how he'll be annoying, or knowing how you won't be patient, or knowing how it'll feel like too much work or other things like that. Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Watching TV is the easiest thing. Give him my phone, let him play with the phone. The only game we have is [Vowel-opoly—27:31] monopoly with all the Vowel...he was interested in that for a while, but doesn't seem interested in it anymore. </p>

<p>I wonder what the schedule is like for the trial? Like how soon the trial will be, you know? Potential that it could be a couple of months which gives me time to figure out a lot of what I need to do. I just got to do it. I can't wait until the last second. Hopefully there's a book out there—trying a case in Superior Court, or even a conference I could go attend, you know. I'd pay money for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to go anyway probably right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really? Oh okay. We do [inaudible 29:18]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: We probably should, but I think in most states you have to. I know in New Hampshire you have to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Lawyers are self regulated. I don't know if you guys are, but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think so. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The Supreme Judicial Court regulates us; the board of our overseers. So, lawyers looking after lawyers. They are really focused on screwing over clients and that's about it; stealing money from clients. All that kind of stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does it work with getting paid by these people? Like will they ever pay you or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to put them on a payment plan and that's something I've got to bring up with them. The other part of it where we were the plaintiff, we were entitled to attorneys' fees. I just know that they don't have the money. You know, they've paid me some money and so hopefully I can collect the money for that and get my fees. The judge didn't order attorney's fees, which I've got the feeling he's going to fuck everything up. But he's supposed to. </p>

<p>Just not happy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 34:44] sad? [inaudible 34:48]? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, a little of both. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uh. Lonely? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely lonely. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You don't have any fear of living by yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. The market is really busy and I'm just not seeing any of it, which is even more depressing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there are a lot of sales and great buys and stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing, just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just feeling crummy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just feeling crummy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you thinking about? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not having any money. Not really having anything social. I don't even know how I'm going to meet someone, you know. You know, if I did some sort of Match.com or something like that, I'd have to be paying money for date after date after date, you know. I guess I've become so desperate that one of my friends said to use eHarmony. It takes you two hours to fill out all their...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's how he found his wife. They don't allow homosexuals on eHarmony.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's lame.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm morally opposed to that. It just never seems to get better. It seems to always get worse. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is it getting worse? Are you feeling worse? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just I feel more hopeless. I get the shit dumped on me like the trial. Like there are just more and more things in my life that are broken that just doesn't work. Had a box [inaudible 41:38] that would pull in the air from the AC to the TV room and that thing is making some crazy squeaky noise. I guess I can get some grease or something but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hardly feel like trying? We'll stop for now. We're on Tuesday, but then I don't know, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, we were scheduled already but I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we talked about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We'll talk about it after the...I'll see you. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Should we look at the scheduling stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So yeah I have some time next Friday in the morning if that's any good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. So we're not meeting Wednesday. Okay. So Friday... Oh, I have some time Monday like how early can you meet? I mean what's... [00:01:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably anything before 10:00 is just asking for failure on my part.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well we don't want to do that. So let's see I could meet...</p>

<p>CLIENT: See I might not be in town on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh that's right. That was why I hadn't looked at Monday before. Okay. I could do 10:15 on Friday. How's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it looks good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Okay. And then I'll see you Thursday and Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. It's in my calendar now too. [00:02:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And congratulations on the interview.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. I had a phone interview with this company yesterday and typically the way things go in this industry is that phone interviews are with someone from HR who verifies that you can talk about your resume and you weren't lying and maybe ask you one or two questions that the tech people gave them like softballs generally just to make sure you have a pulse. Then they forward your information to the hiring manager and it's a week or two before they tell if you can come in. My phone interview yesterday was actually with the hiring manager so he was able to make an on the spot decision as to whether to bring me in for a second interview so that was good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's great. What's the company?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay. You had mentioned them I think as a place you were interested in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Yeah. [00:03:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still hate my thesis and I still hate myself for not making progress on my thesis. And I don't know. I'm super bitter and resentful about my birthday which was last Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, happy birthday or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's just... Ever since I can remember my birthdays have been disappointing. There was the year where - my sweet 16 actually. I was turning 16 and I planned this big party and no one showed up except my best friend. There was the year I turned 13 and I planned this big party and no one showed up at all. [00:04:04]</p>

<p>There was my 21<sup>st</sup> birthday where this guy who I was - we were the same year and took most of the same classes and our social circles overlapped by a great deal. His birthday was the day after mine and we were both turning 21 and I planned a bar crawl. My birthday was on a Saturday that year and his was on a Sunday. And his girlfriend who lived in my co-op and hated me planned a bar crawl for him on the same night as mine and explicitly told me I was not welcome at his. And then invited all of my friends in addition to all of his friends to his bar crawl and no one came to mine. Birthdays tend to be disappointing and (pause). So anyway two people in my social circle - three actually - three had birthdays the same weekend as mine and they all threw parties so I didn't even bother because there was enough overlap this year. [00:05:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This year.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And this one guy I know, Tom, he's a great guy, gregarious, fun, everyone loves him he plans three days of events for his birthday because he was turning 32 and that's the power of two. That's a special number. You need an extra bit to represent my name in binary. So he had birthday events Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. And it's just really frustrating for me because I turned 30 and that's also kind of a landmark birthday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. (inaudible at 00:05:40) birthday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Dave tells me that I can't be disappointed because I didn't even try to schedule a party.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course you can be disappointed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm really bitter that no one thought about throwing me a party.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd totally be disappointed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've always wanted a surprise birthday party. This is so dumb but I've always wanted a surprise birthday party. And I've thrown surprise birthday parties for a half dozen of my friends and no one's ever thrown a party for me and I'm just - I don't know. My feelings are hurt. [00:06:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No that just sucks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But how would anyone know I wanted a surprise birthday party?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who cares?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel so childish about it all, but it's been bugging me. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is very sad and hurtful. It wouldn't surprise me that you were bitter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But I should get over it. That's what I keep telling myself. I'm like well that could be dumb.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For what it's worth I mean, and of course I'm going to say this, you're going to have better luck getting over it talking about it and looking at it than being annoyed with yourself and sweeping it under the rug. I mean I know spoken like a psychologist but (laughing) I do believe it's true. [00:07:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. (Pause) Dave got really mad when I told him that I was upset about not having a party. He made reservations at my favorite restaurant and we went out to dinner and that was nice. And he says, "Isn't it enough that we're celebrating your birthday?" And his contention was... And I said, "Of course I enjoyed our birthday celebration." "I enjoy our time together and going on a date with you, but I want a big party and I want to know that there are people who care." And he's like, "Am I not enough?" And then he said that he had no interest in throwing a party for my entire e-mail address book." [00:08:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need a tissue?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What I really cared about was lots of people. He could just hire a professional birthday celebrates like in Egypt they hire professional mourners to make lots of noise at funerals. I don't know if you're familiar with the system. Yeah, in Egypt they hire professional actors to play mourners at funerals to make the deceased appear more beloved than they were and that's a really common thing. So Dave suggested that he could just go on craigslist and hire a professional birthday celebration. And I think - I don't know - that made me feel really crappy too that he was just completely dismissing my feelings. [00:09:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. What matters to you about having a big party?</p>

<p>CLIENT: See that's the thing. I don't actually know because when I go to big parties I find myself very uncomfortable. I don't like big parties. You can't hear anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you picture at your big party?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know; a lot of people having a good time, maybe dancing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm imaging there's something about they're all being there celebrating you. I mean not that they're necessarily talking about you every minute or whatever but being there for you that feels terrific which to me that doesn't seem like any slight to Dave at all. You're not saying he's not enough. [00:10:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think Dave though is a genuine introvert whereas I'm just full of social anxiety and would not be an introvert if I had a choice about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you're just a socially anxious extrovert. I mean that's what it sounds like. (Pause) And do you think that's why he doesn't understand or why he takes it personally when you say something like that which is not how you mean it? [00:11:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. (Pause) I guess I'm not interested so much in why Dave is taking it personally or getting defensive or hostile so much as that's just something he does and occasionally he takes things personally. And I shouldn't take that personally. I shouldn't take his taking things personally, personally. I should just... [00:12:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean how are you not going to take it personally when you tell your husband that you wanted a 30 birthday party and he gets dismissive about it, and hurt, and says well maybe I'll go on craigslist and hire a professional celebrant? (Pause) I mean I guess if I'm thinking about it denial seems to me like that's the only way that that could not be hurtful. And it may be different for you. There may be something I'm missing there but that's how it seems to me. [00:13:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I guess my big fear is I have a habit of holding grudges and my parents hold grudges and they still harp on each other for things that are 10, 15, 20 years old. They don't just harp on each other like my dad is still harping on things my mother's parents did 25 years ago even though they've both been dead for years now. And I don't want to turn into that because I know that Dave loves me and wants the best for me. And for the most part we're able to talk things through and there are just a very small number of things where he just gets completely irrational, and I don't want to end up letting that poison our marriage the way my parent's marriage has been poisoned. And I know I've ruined friendships because of my inability to let go of a grudge before and I don't want that to happen. [00:14:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (Pause) I suspect there are ways... I don't have a real full sense of him because we don't talk a lot about him but I do have a hunch from things you've said and what you're saying now that you guys might be able to sort out some things in a way that didn't leave you so hurt and angry over it that you would bear a grudge. I mean (pause) I'm being very speculative here but I could imagine something like this. That he planned this nice dinner, decided to take you out, heard what you were saying in a way that you didn't mean it, which is that you really would've rather been doing something else and you were kind of blaming him for not planning something you would've really wanted and something that he wouldn't want himself so it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to him, makes him feel a bit belittled or insecure or something, and he kind of lashed out at you as a result. And (pause) it seems reasonable to me you know what you said today to say that you have a fair amount of birthday baggage. [00:16:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so it really struck a nerve with you (pause) and so you guys are both pretty unhappy with each other about this. But if something at all remotely like what I just said is true is true then I could imagine (pause) if each of you looked at it more that way you might not be so angry at each other. I mean if he really misunderstood, and was hurt, and didn't quite understand where you're coming from, and then when you could make it clearly he would get it better feel less hurt, not be so critical of what you want you wouldn't feel so angry. You could get going in a better way. I don't know. What do you think? [00:17:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Dave prides himself on being rational and logical and being in control of his emotions and not lashing out. So that's a crock of shit and I know it is because I've seen him lash out before and he's even admitted it before. But it's really hard to get him to admit he was reacting on emotion instead of logically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So even if that were true that would get in the way of having this conversation with him about it because he wouldn't want to see himself having done that. I see which then gets in the way of his being able to say to you that he - you know - sort of could be more understanding I think. [00:18:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tried to explain to him the horrible birthday baggage and he was like, "You know I'm not real interested in listening to all of your complaints about the past." "You should just get over it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure you wished nothing more than that you really could (inaudible at 00:18:40)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's actually a running theme of his repeating horrible things that happened whether it be birthdays, or shit my parents have done, or shit my sisters have done isn't valuable and just reinforces negative thinking and I should focus on good things that are not related to my parents, or my sisters, or my basis for whatever. And he's not always dismissive about it. Like occasionally when he's tired or frustrated he'll be dismissive but more often it'll be repeating these things is just making you miserable, and you're miserable enough, and I want you to be happy, and why are you doing this. [00:19:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's sounds kind of concerned the way you're describing it. Is that how it feels?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) Even so it puts you in a tough spot, I would think, in that while there may be times thinking about something else or trying to be more positive could maybe help I wouldn't think that's often very useful for you. [00:20:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean I often don't trust my reactions and feelings because my parents would routinely tell me what I was feeling was wrong. I was crazy for feeling what I was feeling. And despite the fact that my dad thinks psychiatry is quackery he is board certified in psychiatry and neurology. And I understand that the boards are conjoined. You can't get one without the other. But he would throw that in my face and then say I'm board certified in psychiatry and you are certifiably insane or things like that. And you know... [00:21:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's horrible and horrendous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if I was an adult of someone else who I didn't have history with came up to me and said that I would say that's an abuse of power and you need to cut that shit out right now. But as a kid I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course. As a kid and as a daughter...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so a lot of times when I'm reciting things my parents have done in light of some new stupid bullshit they've pulled, mostly I want reassurance from someone outside my head that this is not okay. And I've tried explaining that to Dave and we've had that conversation that I'm not wallowing for the sake of wallowing. I'm trying to make sense of things and I really need you to say that you're not crazy. And he said that he understands that but still in the moment I guess he gets flustered, or upset, or whatever. But yeah it's... [00:22:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there anything that (inaudible at 00:22:16) for you is having faith in your reactions in how you feel about things and that your reactions in how you feel about that make quite a lot of sense as a sort of painful as they could be or unfortunate. Anyway, it sounds like it makes things, not a lot of the time but sometimes, difficult between you. [00:23:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what happened on those birthdays? I mean you sort of gave me the thumbnail for 13, 16, and 21. They all sound really bad. I would imagine you were devastated. (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: On my 16<sup>th</sup> Jessica was the only one who showed up. And I was devastated as you said and decorated the house and everything. And Jessica was just like you know what let's get out of the house. And so we went to the half price book store which at the time had free hot chocolate, and tea, and coffee for customers. I bought a bunch of books, and drank enough hot chocolate to make ourselves sick, and then went back home stopping by a grocery store on the way and getting a pint of Ben and Jerry's, and then ate enough ice cream to make ourselves even more sick. [00:24:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like a pretty good prescription.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except for the being sick. (Laughing) That was Jessica's answer to everything the pint of Ben and Jerry's. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How'd you feel besides sick? I got that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Miserable. Unloved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many people did you send out invitations to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Forty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what happened? Did they not R.S.V.P? Did they say they wouldn't come like what happened? [00:25:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most people didn't R.S.V.P. A couple of people said maybe, maybe not. I don't know what's going on that Saturday. Jessica was actually the one to R.S.V.P. back. I'd hoped that some of the maybes would show up. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you were pretty shocked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [00:26:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hurt and disappointed but I'd said in the days before the party to my parents I bet no one's going to show up because no body loves me and I have no friends, and everyone hates me, and I might as well go eat worms. You know the song everybody hates me, nobody loves me, I guess I'll go eat worms?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I don't know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a popular song when I was in elementary school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who sang that? Where did I miss that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I never actually heard it except other kids singing it on the playground. So it might have been a spontaneous playground thing. [00:27:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe I was just out of the loop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well everybody hates me, nobody loves me, I guess I'll go eat worms. First one was Grammy, second one was (inaudible at 00:27:19), third and fourth came up. And then I can't remember the rest. There were more versus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean (pause) how much did it reflect how things were for you socially at the time versus just how 16 year olds are? Do you know what I mean? Did you not have other friends? Did people...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't. I had frenemies. I had rivals, competitors. I had people who would pretend to be my friend for the sake of a mutually beneficial exchange. But I mean... [00:28:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like helping each other with homework? Is that what mutually beneficial exchange means?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not necessarily. Sometimes it was for the sake of competition. You know I need a partner who trusts me and believes in me especially for things like mock trial or debate where you have to rely on your partner to not screw up. So my mock trial team I had what as an adult I would describe a collegial relationship and none of them were my friends. I suspect most of them didn't actually like me as a person but respected my work. And then the Science Olympiad Team I don't know how much I've told you about our coach, but she was a horrible, horrible woman. [00:29:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's mostly what I remember. Like she'd set you against each other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She would start rumors. She would manipulate students. (Pause) And most of the people I knew were either from the Science Olympiad Team, or the debate team, or the mock trial team. Yeah for my birthday I basically sent invitations to all of my teammates hoping that some of them would show up because I didn't really have friends outside of teams. I mean my parents didn't let me go anywhere after school. I wasn't allowed to go to the mall. I wasn't allowed to go to the movies. I could go to the book store. That was okay. I could go to the library.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you go out at all at night in high school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like no Saturday night at the movies?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No Saturday night at the movies. No Saturday night parties. I was only allowed to go to birthday parties that were in the afternoons on Saturdays which as you can imagine put a damper on my social life. [00:30:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Who has a high school birthday party in the afternoon?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I competed on so many teams that had practices in the afternoons and the evenings and it was not at all unusual for me to stay at the school, like in the school building, until 9:00 or 10:00 at night and then go straight home and go straight to bed because I was exhausted. You know there'd be Science Olympiad from 3:00 to 5:00, and then mock trial from 5:00 to 7:00, and then debate from 7:00 to 9:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No time to have any other life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope. No time for dinner a lot of times. There were many nights in high school where my dinner was a bag of vitamins and some can of coke from the vending machines. (Pause) I don't know. At the time I liked being busy because it took my mind off the fact that I had no friends and no social life, but in hindsight it feels so bleak. [00:31:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there any more you can say about dealing with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I mean by bleak? I don't know. It's just I was exhausted all the time. I would routinely sleep through classes or frantically try to do work for other classes during lectures that weren't interesting to me. And then I'd go straight from class to a practice, to another practice, to another practice often not having time to eat dinner. There was one semester where I didn't have a lunch hour in my schedule where I had classes all seven periods. I mean the debate team had class so our coach kept us an hour a day on top of after school practices every day. [00:32:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was never any downtime and I certainly enjoyed winning medals but oftentimes I just didn't care about the content of what I was doing. I only cared about... I mean for example one of the events... The Science Olympiad is kind of like the track and field for geeks. That's the analogy I come up with. There are 20 or 25 different events and you have a team of 20 or 25 students and you shuffle them around so the day of competition there might be nine competition slots with three events going on in each slot. And so you have your events that you do some of which are solo and some of which are with a partner. So there were practices for each event. [00:33:24]</p>

<p>So there were a total of 15 coaches each one of which had their things. So like the Earth Sciences teacher would coach all of the geography based events. And there were two Biology teachers who would coach bio based events. And you had as a student, in my high school at least - I think other schools ran their teams differently - but my high school you didn't do the events that you wanted to do. You did the events that coach told you to do and if you didn't like it you could take a hike. There was always a waiting list like there were competitive try outs for the team. Like three days of try outs with written exams and lab events. [00:34:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She said you're running the 1,500 and you wanted to run the 100 yard dash. (inaudible at 00:34:09).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tough luck yeah. So I would go to these practices with people I didn't like and cram material that I didn't really care about. Like there was one event that was basically identifying samples of minerals and then regurgitating information about them. There was no creative thinking. There was no problem solving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the histology of rocks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. And you know look at the sample. You can't use any tools to detect what it is other than visual examination. It was ridiculous but I went you know twice a week every week for a whole school year for an hour and a half at a time so I could memorize this shit. [00:35:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Types of rock.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So our practices were basically an hour of lecture and then a half hour of sprints. The teacher set up rocks at lab stations around the room and you just sprinted around them answering the questions as fast as you could and try to sprint faster than anyone else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like speed was important in a competition?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't important in the actual interschool competitions but for choosing who actually got to compete because Coach would assign you ten events to train for and then two days before the competition these are the one, or two, or five you're actually doing. So the geology event was a two person competition but she had six of us training for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Two competitors and four alternates or whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Four losers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it. [00:36:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And some of it was the competition wouldn't give you the schedule of what events were running when so it might be the two events that you wanted to do were in the same spot and you could only do one. But a lot of times it was just politicking. And, of course, the kids whose parents were big donors always got on the competition team and they usually were not terribly bright and were paired with someone like me who'd actually win for them which everyone knew what was going on. It just caused all kinds of problems because the kids whose parents were big donors were resentful that they weren't valued for their intellectual contributions. And the kids who were actually smart and could win were resentful that they weren't put on the competition slot because (inaudible at 00:36:54) son had to be put on there even though he was not that smart. So it was a horrible and (pause)... So that's what I mean by bleak. [00:37:08]</p>

<p>And I'd come home and if I didn't fall asleep right away I'd get on the Internet and just stay up until 2:00, or 3:00, or 4:00 in the morning surfing the web. My bedroom was in the basement of my parent's house and our computer room was in the basement. My parent's and my sisters' bedrooms were on the second floor. So they would say its bedtime, and I would go to bed, and wait until I heard them go upstairs, and the first floor was quiet, and then I'd get up and get on the computer and just surf gaming sites, joke sites. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It just sounds terribly bleak, and terribly lonely, and unfulfilling, and inhumane. We'll stop for now. We'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:38:28]</p>

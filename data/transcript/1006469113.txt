<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are the beautiful, brown corduroy pants coming back?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. I usually only dress more casually like with the snowstorm or [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:52).</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was fun. [00:01:00] It was. (long pause) Sometimes I feel I say things just because I don’t want to embarrass you a little bit more than I already do. (chuckles) [00:02:00] (pause) I don’t know if that is care [of you.] (ph?) I was going to say I really like them because they fit really well and they were hip and they were sort of cheerful, but there, I said it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think your more formal pants fit well, too, but they’re looser. [00:03:07] They’re a little too loose, in my opinion. There you have it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There I have it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The pants [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:22). (long pause) [00:04:56] Something came to me this weekend and I can’t really describe it fully, but I’ll try. There is something going on or there is something that (pause) has the feel of moving in the direction of love, [like the last attachment here.] (ph?) Like by me of you. [00:06:05] And there is something about the way that you’re approaching this and me that like it seems all about that or it seems your knowledge of it seems aware of it. (long pause) [00:07:33] And that’s really, really, really different from the way it is or from the way that it’s [getting through to other people.] (ph?) (pause) [00:08:17] I think sometimes Ben and I could exist on that level, but because we’re married we can’t. There are conditional aspects of our lives that will always have to be there, but the way we love each other, if we were both just to float away forever right now, there is something about that love that would be completely preserved. [00:09:07] Not that that’s what love without attachment is, but like what it makes me think of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m not clear about that part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m thinking about how not knowing how you feel about me is like a critical (pause) part to make grow the love part and make not emphasize the attachment part. [00:10:14] Also, out of that emerges that even though it feels like it’s a point that we don’t share, like it’s a point of difference, there is actually something a little connecting about sharing a difference like that; or holding a difference like that together. [00:11:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it actually, among other things, gives you a little more freedom, in that if you’re asking [ ] (inaudible at 00:11:49) me to tell you and I don’t consequently know. Then you can do what you want. (chuckles) [00:12:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can do what I want anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let’s be honest. Then you have to worry about what’s fair to me or can I handle it or do you really want to know or what’s right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get what you’re saying. I think there is a different kind of freedom in not knowing and a different kind of freedom in knowing. [00:13:03] So far, it feels like it’s started to shift, like when I thought about it this way this weekend. Like love with less attachment or love without attachment. But so far it feels like I’ve been bound by not knowing – like it’s in my way; it’s limiting my freedom; it’s forcing me to act in a certain way. It’s eliminating most of the ways that I could act. [00:14:00] Or most of the ways in which I want to act. I think that’s because I assume . . . (long pause) [00:15:09] I think I assume deep down that the balance of your feeling is your feelings about me are similar – positive and similar to the balance of my feelings about you. I see you as quite different, both because of who you are and because of how you see yourself in this and how you see me. [00:16:04] But I think I feel bound by not knowing and I feel like a lot of ways of behaving aren’t open to me because if I did know, I would know something that would allow me to behave affectionately in a different way than I do. It just occurred to me that I’m making an exception. Also that I hope it, but that that’s what I think is happening. [00:17:06] That’s what I assume is happening for you, positive feelings similar to mine; but you’re just not telling me about it. Clearly, there is so much doubt that comes up that that feels like it’s deep down and then it doesn’t really rise to the surface as much as the doubt, in that way. (long pause) [00:18:25] </p>

<p>There is something about this that has the potential to not be anything about what I assume or anything about what really is, regarding how you feel about me. (pause) [00:19:04] There could be something very powerful and healing and maybe even feeing, but it hasn’t really felt that way about it. (pause) Like slowly dropping or letting go of the things that I need to know and still love you. [00:20:07] (long pause) [00:21:39] It’s in the letting go that the power and healing becomes entangled up and with that appears to be coming a shit-ton of pain. (long pause) [00:22:56] But not as much pain or the type of pain that shows up when I think I’m not supposed to love you or like I should stop or I should get rid of it or it’s wrong. (pause) It’s absolutely right for me, but there is a lot of other very attached attachments that seem to show up. [00:24:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Attachment and anxiety are very close in the way you’re talking about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like by attachment I think I mean things aren’t okay unless “blank” – unless I know this or unless you do this or you say this or you look at me this way or unless I feel a certain way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think it’s wrapped up in anxiety and sadness, like I’m only happy if . . . There is only joy if . . . Maybe that’s still anxiety. [00:25:03] (pause) They feel a little different for you. Both of them seem like they kind of . . . (pause) Sadness and anxiety. [00:25:57] (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think when you love somebody, you like to feel like you’re driving the bus.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You get very anxious when you feel like you’re not, in part because it’s like it could go away or it won’t feel like it’s there. (pause) [00:27:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:07) Yeah, like what? There is so much about my own love that has nothing to do with driving the bus, but somehow that’s what’s most accessible or that’s what’s most powerful or that’s what’s most comfortable or makes me worry the least, to be in that position that there is so much there still if I were to get out of the driver’s seat and sit on the bus with everybody else or get off the bus or whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other person driving the bus, though, is another option. (laughs) You know, just the volunteer. [00:28:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You can’t have a driver if I’m not the driver. No, I’m kidding. I guess that’s an option. It doesn’t really work here as well as it might work in other love relationships because I’m not quite sure what you’re doing. You’re sort of driving some bus, but you’re not driving my bus. (sniggers) I don’t even know if you’re on the bus. (pause) [00:29:06] Yeah. Sometimes it feels like you’re at the bus stop and I’m waiting for you to get on. The doors keep opening and closing. It sometimes feels like I’m on your bus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that often when we’re talking about different buses it feels like I’m driving the bus; and I think that’s terrifying. (pause) The example that occurs to me is that I don’t think I’ve gotten anything right today. I mean, I’m teasing you a little bit here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Didn’t wear the pants. [00:30:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the pants, I think, is related, but I think that’s like you feeling like you’re driving the bus and that you’re going to embarrass me; so you were like, “Can I say it or is that too much for you, Jay?” And the first thing I said this about like control and freedom coming with not having to be in control. You were like, “Maybe that’s not what I’m talking about.” </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I was like “maybe,” but I don’t feel free being on your bus. [00:30:59] I think it’s a nice idea, but . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s just the bus talk that [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:11) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn’t say that the freedom idea is wrong. I sort of explained that I feel bound by not knowing how you feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:34) you’re saying that you actually feel both, that you have felt bound, but actually something is changing and there are moments where you feel more free from that; not less love, but less bound.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s right, so that’s not an example of how you were wrong. What’s your next one? (both laugh) [00:32:04] I think you’re insecure about being wrong. I don’t have the impression so far today at all that you’ve been wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. I’m pretty sure you used the word, that you said something like “no or well that may be true, but what I am talking about is” this other thing over here. Actually it doesn’t seem like we’re far apart on what the actual point is, in my mind. But yes, you think that there is some part of it that I’m insecure about being wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:33:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There’s another association that I’m having. I guess I’m a little reluctant to say it. I don’t mean it in a critical way. I’m a little concerned that it’s my own recitation of it, but have you read the Pigeon on the Bus books? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great kid’s books about don’t let the pigeon drive the bus. It’s in the second person. The bus driver goes away and says don’t let the pigeon come over and is like, “Hey, can I drive the bus?”</p>

<p>CLIENT: And is that the refrain? Don’t let the pigeon drive the bus. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. Ninety-five percent of the book is the pigeon asking to drive the bus. Come on, I have a friend who drives the bus. I have an uncle who drives the bus every day. What’s the matter? It’s just for ten minutes I’ll drive the bus. [00:34:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are all these kids on the bus and they pick one pigeon?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, nobody is on the bus. It’s just the pigeon and the pigeon is talking to the reader and it’s second person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And does the pigeon ask all the time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s the whole book.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can imagine fits and giggles like, “No, you still can’t drive the bus, pigeon.” Is it the type of book where the reader feels compelled to answer? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s more like watching the pigeon. The pigeon goes, “Let me drive the bus.” And has this [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:00). [00:35:05] The response depends on the age of the kid. Sometimes it’s like, “No, pigeon. No, you can’t drive the bus.” Just watching the pigeon for the [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:16).</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is just a reference point right now, but I’m imagining what about that and his whole life is through his books and it’s starting to expand into play with Nora and himself. The first two some years, he was just like having this constant recitation of books and incorporating new things about the world as they show up in books. [00:36:07] I don’t know, like a little [guardian] (ph?) with a red hat and a fluffy white beard. There are four or five books that make me think of and those books will come up and then the guardian will be grafted into it. But now there is a lot more. This is kind of like this book, but there is also this other thing, this real thing, and I can just imagine throughout the day asking him should the pigeon drive the bus, Abe? [00:37:06] I can imagine him saying, “Noooo. Noooo. He’s running around my [throne] (ph?).” I think the pigeon should actually just have a try, don’t you think that would be nice? It’s also funny because Abe only talks about himself in the second person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The second, so he would actually be one of us?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He never says “I”. He only says, “You really think that we get to see a fire truck at school today?” or “You really hope that you get to read the pigeon book?” [00:38:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:38:10) </p>

<p>CLIENT: So Michael, what do you think about the pigeon driving the bus? “You think that the pigeon should not drive the bus.” Or I can imagine some funny constructions with the pigeon book being in the second person and Michael talking in the second person. So I interrupted you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that was about all I had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I’m the pigeon, is what you’re getting at?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) That’s what I said at the beginning. [00:39:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that’s pretty right. I don’t think that was critical at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s how I feel. There’s something very shameless about the pigeon. There is something very shameful about the way that I feel about wanting to drive the bus. The idea that I could love you very, very much and know that that means I feel like I really need to drive the bus, but it doesn’t have to mean that I can still love you very, very much helps with some of the shame. [00:40:01] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe it makes me feel more like the pigeon for a while until, I hope, maybe I stop asking altogether. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We will stop for now. </p>

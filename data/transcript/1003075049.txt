<p><b>DR:</b> And who was before him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, Bush.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Before him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Clinton.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One more if you would.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, Reagan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're missing one between Mister Clinton and Mister Reagan.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just a hint, you already said the name.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, oh Bush again yeah it was the father.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that's good.  Um, tell me the names of five large cities anywhere in America.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED], um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's cheating you lived in Washington.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah I cheated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm just kidding.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can cheat, it's, it's allowed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you um, [DEIDENTIFIED] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Five of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And um, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hey, what's wrong with Texas?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You haven't become a true Texan yet then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many, how many nickels in a dollar?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, 50?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nickels?  Fifty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No it's going to be, well um, about I'd say 20.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh, that's more like it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you are walking on the street and on the street you find an addressed, stamped and sealed envelope laying down on the street, what are you going to do with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would look at the, the uh, the, the person, the, the address that's uh, it came from —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and I, I would probably make contact with that person or if I could I would then drop it off in the mailbox.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wonderful, now what were those three words I asked you to remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, red, smile, tulip.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well tulip is correct.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One was a color but it was not red.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want, have a guess?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Obviously at this point it's not a guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, right, right um, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, did uh, brown or black or blue it's one of those three.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay brown, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and the, the second word is not smile but it has the same, it's a different words it has same meaning as being truthful but it's a different word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Truthful um, um, honesty?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, [INAUDIBLE] that's good, okay.  Well um, seems like uh, that you were told about the diagnosis of schizophrenia uh, probably it is at least one of the problems that we need to handle and also the anxiety issues and the sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you will definitely benefit from counseling if you are willing to do so, I would address about this childhood trauma, trauma issues.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think uh, it's best to help both medication and counseling, just counseling I just really don't think it's going to address all your problems but they can be addressed if the uh, combined the approach of both biological and psychological treatments.  Um, first of all the biological treatments uh, have you had any blood work lately?  To make sure that your diabetes is under control and your cholesterol is okay are you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, about a year back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh no, no it has to be at once a year if not sooner than that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I will ask you to have some blood work done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure, that's sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We need to do it uh, fasting nothing to eat or drink after midnight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No breakfast in the morning until they get the blood from you and who's the doctor treating you for diabetes and blood pressure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] at, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they haven't done any blood work for you, that's interesting.  In a year it says?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] as in, um, [DEIDENTIFIED] or we're talking about a different [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No it's, yeah, I'm talking about uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Downtown maybe?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, downtown area yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, what, this, where the you live the tell me two main big streets nearby.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh um, [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED], they're right here, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In that case you probably would be able to go to, there's a lab on [DEIDENTIFIED] next to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or there is [DEIDENTIFIED] right next to it, the big building, a Quest lab there you can go to either one, I don't really care where you go as long as you get it done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, sounds good, oh, good deal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Again, like I said, it has to be fasting nothing to eat or drink after midnight, no breakfast in the morning until you get the blood work done.  Um, as far as uh, treatment I will refer you to a counselor uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] are probably the easiest way of [INAUDIBLE] but these are counselor I know that is good with these kind of problems and let me uh, [NAME OTHER], he's at [DEIDENTIFIED] too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, I'll give you his number and his card and you will need to call him and make an appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He works here on Sundays uh, so, be a little easier to get into his office as opposed to some others.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Medication wise uh how much Tranxene were you taking way back —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not a bad anti anxiety drug but uh, all anti—anxiety medicines are habit forming and you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, they are?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Need to watch out on what you use.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you use them as prescribed and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Should be okay as long as you don't abuse them or use them things like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You remember how many you were taking a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I, I was taking prob, probably two a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and, and, and that was a p.r.n.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know that, that's best way to use those medications they work best in the bottle meaning you know it's there available for you if you need it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If you need it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But uh, as long as you don't need it, don't take it and hopefully you won't have to open the bottle meaning hopefully you don't get the dose but it could happen.  And as far as taking care of the voices the Haldol 100 mg three times if indeed that's what you did really get that's a no no, I should not be treated with that much of Haldol or antipsychotic medication of that range.  Uh, what I would suggest we do is uh go with the medicine that's uh, going to help you with a couple of problems.  I actually have something in mind that would help you with three different problems.  One it will, it's a sleeping, sleeper it's a sedating drug —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two it can help you, it will help you with the voices it's an antipsychotic and three it's been used off label it doesn't and real have any indication to treat it but off label it also helps with anxiety.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh really, I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The name is Seroquel I don't know if you ever heard the name or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's literally newer one compared to Haldol, Haldol was there since 1940's and 50's.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> These new medications came to market only in the 90's.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> New generation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> New generation, that's what they exactly called them, new generation antipsychotics or second generation antipsychotic medications.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we would want you to take the Seroquel, you can just take it at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, even though you're taking it at night it should help you all around the day pretty much, you know, build up in your body uh, start with one tonight, tomorrow night take two, the day after night take three and stay with three until you come back, talk to me in a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it is best to take it about uh, three hours before you want to actually go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And again not with a full stomach, but uh, don't take it after you eat a full meal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you eat a full meal and wait like a couple of hours and then —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you want you can eat a light snack just don't it, be take it without eating anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There are five or six of these medications that can again, there's antipsychotic medications.  Uh, Zyprexa, Risperdal, Seroquel, Abilify, Geodon and Invega you don't need to remember all these names.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But they are five or six of these and there is one more Clozaril that's the first one that came into market actually.  All these medicines have the same warning posted on them that uh there are cases of, for diabetes and complications with uh, some serious complications have been reported in patients taking any of these medications.  No one is uh, any, um safer than the others they are all have the same problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So know that we do know there's a problem, that's part of the reason they want you to have blood work and I know you're diabetic and I need to make sure that your diabetes is under control uh, you respect all medications but especially when you're taking these kind of medications it better be under control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, if not this, you should not be taking this medication maybe we need to go back to the old generation antipsychotic medication which have their own set of side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like Tardive dyskinesia and involuntary movements and those kinds of things.  Uh, diabetes can be treated whereas if you get tardive dyskinesia which is involuntary jump movements like this, that's irreversible and untreatable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The diabetes can be controlled with medication and your diet and exercise, what all you need to do.  So if we had to choose between these two, I would rather go with the newer generation and take extra precautions than to make sure your uh, sugar is under control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> An uh, 150 mg of night, at night may not be enough but we'll gradually go up on the dose if we feel the need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have to give you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How's it going to be for uh, agitation?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, it will, it will help your agitation —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is not a tranquilizer like you can do the Haldol charge but uh, it comes in the same group of medications so it will you that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or the Tranxene or the, as you said as you use it as needed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, if you are not feeling nervous you're not feeling anxious you don't ever take it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But night medicine it should be taken every night without fail.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] get one more signature from you, that's basically giving me permission to treat you and again that signature there until you need [INAUDIBLE] what, what appointment what we talked and what you understand from what I tell you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, you have questions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, in that case we will meet in uh, four weeks, if not sooner, please uh, if there's an issue please call before that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here's a card for the counselor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, the counselor, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take care of that blood work.  [INAUDIBLE] I'm reminding you it has to be fasting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay, fasting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] two medications there, the Tranxene 7.5 number 60 —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the Seroquel XR 90 pills for 2 mg a piece you start at one increase to two and then go to three by the third night and stay with the three.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, unless you are having some issues with that and the one issue some people have is uh, too much sleepiness, they may experience too much addition to the next day —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you do that don't go to the next dose, stay where you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Got you, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If one is making you sleepy a lot the next day, the next night don't take two.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't explain what happened to you but again I can't —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We don't know everybody is different and everything to different, different medications.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, like that if you have any other questions please give us call and we'll take it from there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you so much, thank you, have a wonderful day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You too, sir.  Please don't, give this to [NAME OTHER] up there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]?  Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just trying to find.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you sick?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just trying to (inaudible) because when I started I was hustling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was trying to help find ... a man who can do some painting for (inaudible) for myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid to be too deep because I like you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. And I'm getting control over of it. I was so ... into my black coffee there was about 20 minutes that I wasn't thinking of you know I wasn't even watching which I normally do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ... it feels very good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm curious - I'm curious at where you're at. And I'm curious about you getting sick. I also am very aware of where we ended for (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I think (inaudible). Last Wednesday I was looking after (inaudible) (coughs) and I spent almost the whole day with her. And because (clears throat) she (inaudible) vegetables under (inaudible). And she was getting one. And (inaudible). I spent the weekend with her in isolation for not letting - not getting harder to repeat (inaudible). You know the (inaudible) diet and (inaudible). And I knew that I had done everything that I could for her at that time. [2:45]</p>

<p>I thought about ... I felt that I couldn't do anytime about that ... illness. And now that I'm going to the doctor I'm not so you know I decided to put that out of my mind. Although reading a book which as been giving me a lot of nightmares. I can't remember the name of it now. I can't (inaudible) remember it really. Although it's about leukemia and that - slowing the (inaudible). And I heard (inaudible) for an hour or so. I guess an hour. And I thought I better read this because it's what he's saying is what I'm saying about I'm not - I'm not ever going to have the patience for it. Why it's (inaudible) how upset I am about it. Same way with I went through the nightmare scene but was - it was - it was involved with my own cold and my own congestion and my own inability to (clears throat) deal with this cough.</p>

<p>And - and so I've been dreaming about death again at times. But at the same time I was reading a book about (laughs) post traumatic.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stress Disorder.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Stress in children. And so I - these two were (laughs) coming together in the reading. And I was like oh my. You know this is just me. So I've kind of just counted that as just a part of what I'm reading instead of ... what's going on for me. (Inaudible). I think that's possibly true. Although I usually give my dreams more personal credence I'm not sure that's true for these particular dreams. I think they're directly related to reading and ... and doing tension reading because I was sick so I was ... in bed reading all day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm - I'm wanting - I'm kind of torn between the going into ...what's going on inside you with you being sick.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well I - I'd rather not deal with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But where we ended last time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you remember?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) go back to that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because it's - it may best to work on the control instead of working on the content.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I would much rather work on that. Yeah which ever way we're going to. I'm just getting my breath. That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Where are you at with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: With that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know. Or what is it for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it was some really interesting things happened after we talked about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And let's make sure that you're talking about the same thing. [5:39]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. We're talking about me challenging you like to - to you - you're worthless. Okay. So I went - walked down to my husband's office and ... and I was still dealing with this issue. And I picked up the telephone and then I talked to a friend of mine. And I said so are you (inaudible)? And I said yeah. And I said in fact I just came from there. And she said - and I said I was just dealing with the fact that I'm so worthless. Did I tell you about this? I guess I haven't. I haven't seen you.</p>

<p>And she laughed because she's been my friend for ... 15 years I guess. We use to work together at (inaudible). She's a sculptor. And I like her a lot. She goes through a lot. She has cerebral palsy. And does extensive therapy and (inaudible). And she went oh that's number 307. What - haven't you dealt with 307 yet? We all dealt with 307. Just change the numbers and you'll feel better. </p>

<p>You know okay Tanya did because she's a very funny person. And I said okay let's change it around. If I didn't get worthless what would I get? And she said worthwhile. (laughs) And so I think we had a big laugh about that. She said oh you know I think we all deal with this. We all deal with this. Like every 2 or 3 months we all get our worthless kick. And then we get over it and. So ... it's - that's weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. Is that the radiator?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought - I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ... so I laughed and I had a good laugh about that. And then I felt well so you know why would I - why was I challenging you? Here's a person who knows exactly what I'm talking about when I say worthless. And she turns it into a joke. I - if I say that to myself I turn it into ... let's beat you over the back. You know let's get all the old whiplash. </p>

<p>And ... and when I said it to you it was ... as a challenge. You know like well you know how in touch are you with this concept? Because it's a concept that many women have obviously. And ... and women - if you say that to another woman she recognizes right away what you're talking about. And what I thought was so helpful and honest on your part ... probably more honest than helpful but you know I said well I'm not sure what I think about worthless. Or what I mean or what you mean or what I would mean if I said that. [8:25]</p>

<p>So ... I thought you know what I'm supposed to know what he thinks is worthless. You know? Because what do I think about worthless. </p>

<p>(Lapse in tape at 8:33 to 8:41)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That this - a word.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is so full of ... weight is the word that I would think about. Worthless gives you weight. And what do I think about that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well here's how - here's partially how I've heard you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And ... you're saying there's - that you're not quite sure what you think and feel about it. And I at the end of the session pointed to the fact that I wasn't quite sure what you meant by that. But I wondered if part of what you were asking was ... can I help you with this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like am I occupied?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I was asking you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. When I said - because I think that - I think that what one feels with people who can help you is empathy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ... and I've gone through this business about well if - and we talked about this before. If a therapist has never felt this or been here or done that or whatever. Like if you've never had an near death - if you've never been diagnosed with a terminal illness can you help people who are terminally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think I do and can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know if you've never felt worthless can you help me with this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's part of the way that I hurt myself. So if you know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then maybe you can help me. If you think it's just you know. There are times not necessarily with you but in a way with the other therapist that I felt like I was ... a clich�. You know oh you're just a clich�. Let's see you're in empty nest syndrome. And now you're stuck. And you're mildly depressed like all women. And ... you feel worthless. And ... well that's just the way it is. You know but well it may be the way it is but it's not the way I want it to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So ... let - I know there's another - I know there's a way out of here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. And you're not those things, right? I mean that the way you say that well you may fit - that may describe you on some levels. But I agree that that's not a clich�.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I mean if you do that. If you said - if you lined up what I say, you would sort of fit me into categories which you could say okay that's just your - you know like ... menopausy or time of life or whatever. So what I was asking in that was can you relate to that - worthless?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [11:27]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know that I'm not worthless. You know intellectually. I mean I know that I am a value to any number of people including myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ... there's an overwhelming feeling of it anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of ... tell me this though. Do you know what it means?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you know what it feels like? And how does it - is it different for everybody?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I don't think it's different for women necessarily. Is it different for men? I mean my husband says I felt that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But see I don't know how you experience worthless (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I - let me tell you sort of what I mean by that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My experience with you is you spin your wheels a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You - you're very adapt at thinking. But I don't know what you're feeling is. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am [like that] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you right now - you do beautiful philosophical treatise but I'm not quite sure I as I sit here where we're at.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From my end is I'm not sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What worthless feels like?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Now. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well how do you - I mean do you just - how do you describe feelings? You feel feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's not - don't seem to me to be things that ... you - I mean however big your vocabulary is I don't think it helps. I mean I don't think it ... it doesn't. I mean words don't really explain. I mean are words in the same line I mean as feelings? I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I say Gavin. Well I only know a very little bit about you. I know what you look like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know but that's about all I know about you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that part of this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no but it's a metaphor for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I'm trying reach - explain like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like there's.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Say like. Okay. I know who you are. I know your name. I don't know anything about you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So ... how ... if you tell me a word you're feeling I don't know what you mean by that. If you say -give me a feeling - say what's - what's love? You know or what's sadness? I don't know what your term of that would be. I would love to hear it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When I'm - when I say I'm not quite sure what you mean by worthless yet. What - how does that feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels as if ... it feels two things. It feels like you probably wouldn't because I haven't been able to explain what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [14:16]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I haven't as yet explained worthless. Or I can - maybe can not explain worthless. One of those options. And ... worthless is something so intensely personal that there aren't other words. And that may be the fault of using things like - of saying things like that is that it's just a word. But in so many words what does it mean? What does it feel like? </p>

<p>Or you say anger. I know what anger feels like. If you say sad I know what sad feels like. If you say love I can really ... I can think of all different ways that I love people. But worthless doesn't have ... worthless is just like a way of hurting yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You take away a part of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say those words I have more of a center (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I see what you're saying. What if this - I don't know. And worthless is an excuse. Worthless is a way that you feel so bad that you don't have to do anything about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ... but I can tell you something that I did feel which really surprised me last week. And I think in some ways it's a - it's way under there. But it's -it's a foundation of what I'm saying. We were driving home. I walked down to George's office and got the car for him and waited for him. And we were driving home. And he said you know you could so easily get a job. And I said I wish I - I wish I believed that. </p>

<p>And I know I could. You know but up here I can't. But anyway he said well I don't care if you get a job. But it would make my life so much easier if you were working. And the immediate thing that came to mind that really - I could almost feel it. It knocked me back. And I was driving so I was trying to concentrate. Was that I was really angry.</p>

<p>And I thought un-huh - I - I'm - I made things easier for you for so many years. I don't want to make things easier for you anymore. You know? I want you to just do what you have to do. And for me to get better and go do what I have to do. I don't want to make things easier for you. And I realize I was very angry with him. [16:57]</p>

<p>But in my ... shape of the world - my lifestyle ... women don't get angry with their husbands. If you're asked to help you do. If you're asked to nurture somebody that comes first. And he's been through a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what did you say to him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't say anything. Because I was so surprised at how angry I was. And I thought if I say this to him ... I have been angry with him in - before. And it's always been around the issues of money. Because he's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would happen if you said something? What are you afraid might happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. He gets devastatingly sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're afraid that you would make him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he feels guilty. I mean he knows that we used all of my money ... for his business. And that everything we make for the next three years is just going to pay lawyers and taxes. So there's a part of me that says this - I stood by you for this. This is not my problem. You know yes we have no money. This is true. But ... and I - and it causes me anxiety. Because I don't need a lot of money but I need to be able - I need to feel like a (inaudible). </p>

<p>But there was this anger that I thought I can't - I'm not allowed to express this anger. And it - what - the reason it made me feel so ... jolted was it didn't come out of nowhere. It's been there for a long time. And I - and it just went - it just was there again. </p>

<p>And it was like okay you really have to recognize that you really are angry with him. You have told him that you're angry with him. It doesn't help him for me to tell him that I'm angry with him. He - he senses that. He knows that we've talked about that. He'll say things like ... now as a joke but he didn't use it. I think I'll start another business. And I'm saying with what will you start another business? You know with what? For whom? For you're ego? And it's a - it's such a male thing. And many, many (inaudible) talk about this. [19:30]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you angry when (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think so. I was - I wanted something from you that I wasn't getting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I - I just wanted to say you know think about this because I need something from you now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? I'm here a long time. And I need something back. I need - but I wasn't - I was - I think I was just aggressive. But I wasn't - I wasn't angry. But I was angry with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was like what are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's - let's keep it here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you want? Or what is the feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I want is to feel like the person that I am. And I haven't felt like that for a year. And it makes me extremely sad. I feel like I've lost something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I lost myself in this bankruptcy and trying to make everything okay and feeling like my life got split apart. And I - I've always recovered. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So and.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have recovered. I want to feel powerful again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how - when you say you want something from me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want some ... I want some clues about how you get that back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to know how do I get that back. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because the person I am now is really just in the world. And it's a very weird. And I'm glad I experienced it in terms because now I know what so many people have been talking about all of their lives. But this - now I'm experiencing okay I've had enough of this experience. I want to go back and be the person that I am. And I lost it. I mean part of that is lost. And it's like immobilization. </p>

<p>And I know it's immobilization. It's hard because I'm sad about what happened to George. I'm sad about the fact that I was so involved with it that I didn't - I was glad that I was involved but I was so involved with it that it hurt me as well as him. And it hurt me in the way I think about people. It made me very cynical about people. I'm not a cynical person but I'm cynical about many people now. And ... that cynicalism (ph) (sp?) is very disruptive to me. [22:02]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you want that from me and you - and you haven't been getting it in the way you want it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know what it is. I think what it is, is I think of some feedback. I mean I think it's about what do you see? I mean are we walking - are we going somewhere? Is there a place - is there a way out? It didn't - it doesn't seem to me that it's real complicated but I can't see it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't feel like it's real complicated. Because I feel - I feel like myself ... maybe three or four things a week. And it's like ... yes, that's me. And then it's gone. And it's so ephemeral that feeling like okay I know that I haven't kidded myself. I know there was a person called Gerry Singer and that's what she was like. And when I - but something's been drained out. It's like - it's like the ... the oil is still there but the gasoline is drained out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? And the vital signs are still there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the spirit - the person. And I think in part - I think in part it's because I think I did it to myself. I think that I didn't a lot of angry that I felt. And I just kept pushing it down and pushing it down and pushing it down because other people needed to be taken care of. And so I was ... I pushed the anger down. And normally I let the anger out. I mean people do get scared when I blow up. But it's like over fast. You know I can - I get angry - what are you doing with that - well what's not over here - how you know? And that's it. </p>

<p>It's like it's - it dissipates for all kinds of reasons usually because it's just ... marginal plea. And I think that's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe that's sort of what I experienced last week at the end of the session which is why I want to go back to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is that it felt like you know you felt something strong like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you know about worthlessness? How can you help me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then it quickly when subterranean. You know it quickly when underground. And.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I started thinking about well it's not his fault that he doesn't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but I don't care.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See and that's what I. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I know. But that's what happens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? I mean I will say c'mon I want some help from you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: God dammit give me an answer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then ... and then like I walked out the door. And I said well ... you know first how would he know? He's not a woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [24:56]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Secondly I didn't define worthless. So what am I suppose - what am I asking for?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I thought that's not his job. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So that's very rational.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's very reasonable. But see this is a space where we can let go of some of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. And so what happened was the - I mean as soon as I walked out of here the rational took over. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So right away you had - so somehow all of those thoughts obscure, of being - of you being able to experience and of us being able to feel and experience.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A feeling like that. You know like right now when you said come on God dammit I want something from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Well I didn't feel angry then but I was re-experiencing what I was going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What was going on then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because ... you know I guess in a way if I can demand something and you can say I can't give it to you then I have to go get it on my own.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm not sure that this time I'm capable. But that is my mode. Can I get it from you or not? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you can't give it to me I'll go you know I'll go make it. I'll make it happen. I'll do this or that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's always been like or I'll do it your way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I'll do it your way. Okay. You want to get married this way. Okay. It's your life. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's - you're talking to one of your former husbands?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm talking about my daughter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know she wanted to get married this way. And I said to her like - and I really - it just all of it went. All of it that - the anger stayed for about five minutes and then I'm fine. Because I can say right away - I can think of a million reasons not to be angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See what I'm - so you can understand my logic - I mean I want to grab it in here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because then it will be alive. If it - the problem is that I don't play a role in your life like somebody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's easy to say it's not his job. I need to find my term. But if we can let go of even a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For the sake of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. But (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) it happens out there too. Okay. For the sake of experimenting but or say that way if you can understand what happens between us and the way you make a feeling go underground.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean that was what was so useful about that. Because I realized as soon as I left that I had been assertive about this. And you had backed off. In a way just like fear does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what - how did I back off? </p>

<p>PATIENT: You said well I don't really know what you mean by worthless. I'm not sure that I know about what I mean by worthless.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's talk about it next time. [27:39]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it felt like ... like you wanted something right then from me. And I kind of backed off. Or what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well do you want me to rationalize a little further. I can say that we were - we were finishing up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But how did it feel? Did it feel like I was letting you down? Or did it feel like I was wimping out? Did it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt like you were wimping out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt like I don't really want to - I don't want - this woman is nuts. I really don't want to answer this question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't deal with that right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to deal with this right now. (laughs) You know I got plans. I really don't want to deal with this now. You know sorry. You know? Let's talk about - I don't know what you mean. I don't know what your terms are. I feel so you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it - yeah it felt like wimping out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was ... and oh course immediately I left. I mean I wasn't even on the street before I had rationalized your behavior and mine. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then - so at first when I went to talk to my friend I didn't have to rationalize with her or anything. I said you know I've just ignored him because I felt like shit. And she said which - what was it the (inaudible)? And I said feeling worthless. And that's when - you know she knows that we know. We've experienced this together. Drop it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She said drop it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. She didn't say drop it. But I mean it's what she was really saying was well you're the person that I know least - I would least attribute that word to - so screw it you know? Get rid of it. It's laughable. You're absolutely you know you're comical in your insistence on this. And ... that's another way to deal with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So she's suggesting a strategy. I'm actually suggesting probably the opposite strategy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I think that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean she's saying a strategy you know that you're not so cool it. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But you're.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you're suggesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm suggesting how do you understand? Or do you want me to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Say well that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you feel moments of worthlessness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That ... I don't think it's - I think that that could be integrated into a larger, functional you. You know that it's to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And what do you think it has to do with? Why do people feel worthless?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I - I don't know why. I mean I can spin for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Spin? I'd rather you spin for a minute because I'm ruining my voice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why do people feel worthless? Why don't other people feel like? Nobody will talk to me about this feeling worthless. Other people say yes I felt like that. Okay. What - now what? You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what does it feel like? You're saying that I don't have words for feelings. So tell me about feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What does it feel like? What does worthless feel like?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [30:31]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then maybe I'd have some words. Maybe I'd have some feelings. It's like this deadness. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel - I'm not quite sure how to go. Because I feel like unless I answer you (laughs) I'm going to be wimping out for you. You know? Let's find out what's - let's say - I mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now come on don't wimp out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Please.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I - if I answer I'm not sure how it's going to help. I don't know how (inaudible) give you an answer that'll help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. That like you're a human being and you have feeling and that you could explain this. Because you're asking me to feel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So do you feel?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or are you just asking me to do it and not you? You're being very therapist like. And why don't you just be ... feeling like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're asking me to be feeling like. So why don't you be feeling like?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well worthless ... (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). All good with you. You do it. I'll do it with you. I'll see if I can figure out where - what does it feel like. But you got to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's fair.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Worthless to me feels like ... being in that particular experience it feels like either not being able to catch it. Like something's moving so fast and I can't catch up with it. Or like things are so complicated that I can't think them. That's sometimes how I have feelings of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So worthless sounds to me like you feel out of control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah feel like that. [33:25]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when you feel out of control what do you feel?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I could disintegrate. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And what would you be if you disintegrated?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like sand. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd be like this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would have - I would ... I would ... I would evaporate. And I would just - I would just become (inaudible). Then I would evaporate. And people would wonder where I was. But I wouldn't miss me. </p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I feel worthless I feel like I don't see myself. On the outside it feels like I'm not doing anything worthwhile with my time. The other side says I'm not earning money. So if you don't earn money you're worthless. That you wasted a year. You might as well have not been around. </p>

<p>I mean my - I mean I know rationally my family and people that I know don't believe that. But I think my enthusiasm and spirit is not good ... because they're in fragments.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you feel like right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel sad like I lost something. I feel like I'm missing myself. I feel like hollow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel hollow. I feel hollow but I literally I don't - I don't think this is the (inaudible) for you. But because it's been just since we've been talking I have this weight across my back. And I'm not even leaning on it. Do you know what I mean? (laughs) So (coughs) it has to do with (coughs) it has to do with feeling weighted down. [36:38]</p>

<p>And I feel like - I feel deprived.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And deprived of myself. I feel deprived of my - you know the - my abilities. I feel deprived of my ... skills.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or my ... I feel deprived of my - I feel like I should be going around with a (inaudible). Not ... and this is what I tell people all of the time. I'm - and I'm saying if you feel deprived go get something. You always get it back. And so the work that I've been doing has been keeping me alive. But ... because I know I'm getting a lot. </p>

<p>But I wonder what these people are seeing. I mean what are they seeing? I feel so hollow that I'm not sure what they see. You know? I mean they're responding to me all of the time. But the way they respond to me? It's like - it's the outside and the inside aren't connected. The stuff I'm doing on the outside is ...you know energetic and helpful and intelligent and problem solving. But the - not for myself. For everybody else but me. </p>

<p>So I feel like I have turned into a (inaudible). I think maybe I should become - go back and become spiritual maybe it's a little of that. But ...that has to come from the inside and not from outside. And it certainly doesn't come from the intellect ... or the emotions. It comes from somewhere else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you feel like when I talk about myself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I liked hearing about you. You felt like a real person to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just - you know I mean what you were saying I just connected with that. I mean I could feel it. I could feel you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had a real sense of you. I was really grateful for that. [39:22]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What about (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was gratefulness. (laughs) Just there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah on your face.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt like ... when you think that you're the only person experiencing something you feel crazy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you feel much sicker than you probably really are. So I'm glad you did that. Thank you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel very alone in that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Because as I was saying before - a couple of weeks ago it feels like - sometimes it just feels like an intellectual activity here. I mean I know (laughs) we're working on - on feelings. But I mean I can relate to people when they have feelings. You know like - it's like show me your feelings and I'll show you mine. You know? </p>

<p>It's not just - otherwise it's just talk. And I think that ... when I'm with people who are dying or people who are very scared and I tell them how scared I am about other things then I know that if I make myself vulnerable first I don't have to - I don't have to do it very often. I only have to do it once or twice with people and that sends that I'm not just there because I'm well. I mean it - you sitting there and you're well right? I'm sitting here and I'm not well. When I'm in the group home and I'm walking around and doing stuff, I'm well. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they're not well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know what kind of - that builds up a - eventually it builds up a kind of mistrust. And it feels up a sense of that the other person is the observer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're a (inaudible). And not a participant in your well being.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I mean obviously here I can go out and I can rationalize or see somebody else. But when you're in a hospital most of those people are never going to be any place else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're saying that ... have you felt that in here like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That split between.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean it feels like it's too - sometimes it feels - it's [me oh course] (ph) but it feels too like you're the guy with the answers. [42:25]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you're not giving them to me. Like I have to guess what they are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ... I use to always think that I had the answers. And all you had to do was ask me the right question. And I would figure out the answers. I'm not so sure about that anymore. It use to be my idea that you knew the answers and I knew the answers. And all we had to do was commune a dialogue and that you would ask me the right questions and I would pull out from my store of life the answer. And since that hasn't worked for quite awhile I don't think that's going to work. So ... I think I need more from you because I think that I'm not getting closer to the answers.</p>

<p>I'm feeling better. I mean whatever is going on. There's something good that's going on in here. Because it's the one place I allow myself to feel sad. I don't allow myself to feel sad really any place else. And all of my - the - a lot of these are things that I had clearly are tension and they're gone. When I sleep at night and I'm not interested in food anymore. Food does sit - so lots of things are happening. But there's nothing you know maybe I'm waiting for something that's not so - that can not happen but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it - unless when you share with me then I know that you're - that you really are - that you know what feelings are about. Because otherwise you ask me to feel and I don't - I can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm not sure I know that you're concerned. But I'm not sure that you're feeling it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's like you're - I'm feeling it's something that you've said many times. And I think you're absolutely right. I have to get in touch with my feelings instead of my intellect. Because I could rationalize all of those situations. Because feeling was so hard to do. I've always been told not to feel. </p>

<p>I feel happiness. I feel passion. I love making love. I love being happy. And I'm very good at being happy and being upbeat. I'm not good at being angry. And I'm not good at being sad. And I've always known there's the other side. So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now let me ask you this. What - what's it feel like that for you right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry that it (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think that ... because I think I finally feel like you're something - that you're there. I wasn't - not always sure you were there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I know you're watching me and listening to me. But I've also watched and listened to people for hours sometimes. And I'm not quite there. I'm not - I don't know that I doubt that you're there but I feel like you're not there. [45:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So rationally I know you're there. And I know you're thinking. And I but ... I guess I think we're probably very different. And so I wonder if you know if you think I'm just ... just withholding deliberately for some reason. I'm not. But I think that there's a part of me which is withholding ... unconsciously. But I don't - I mean I think I want to come in here and work. But I think that there's a part of me that's unconsciously holding back too. Because ... I need to have an experience of who I'm talking to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Otherwise I can put up a mirror. You know I need to have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you're a really good at catching me on the feeling stuff and that's been helping.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying that you - it's like you can't quite be here until you know who you're here with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well in a way yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know I need - and for some reason that seems to be such a puzzlement to people. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know and I'll tell you the truth that you know it doesn't - it is not exactly ... you know about therapy has social norms to it. It (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I'm here to help you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm thinking in an intuitive way it makes a lot of sense to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As a person that makes a lot of sense to me. I've had - I've had feelings very similar in my own therapy. So. So it makes sense to me. Although again there - you are different from me in some ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm always more curious about ... what you know subtleties of what it feels like to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you see what you're saying? You see where you are? You're saying I'm curious about. What ... I think people are - are great inventions and so an interesting thing. I mean I've never, never found anybody that I found was really boring.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if you're curious that's one thing. And I don't need to know a lot about - I don't need to know anything in - about you. But you know. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't need to know any facts about you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't care about the facts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I'm saying is are you there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So curious - how.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Curious is like a scientific.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Observation. I'm curious about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's - if you say to your friend I really want to know what you think about that. You know because I have something to give you. But if I'm curious because I wonder what made you like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm curious about that. It's like a scientific endeavor rather than a human endeavor. And so I just. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I need to know sometimes that you're there. [48:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that you're - I mean not that whoever Gavin is. In a way it's about my concern because I - this is a special kind of relationship I know. But who you are at the deepest feeling level. Why are you sitting in that chair?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you - so - it's like we want - you want to know that I'm something about you but it's not curious because curious - that word has a kind of scientific ring.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm not really concerned though. I just meant that it - it's like it gave you away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In that moment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it said I'm curious about you like - like a scientific thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not really - think that's really the case.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: N but - but it's a clue to what you think about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The relationship too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm curious about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So when I know you're there because you're willing to share something. I don't need to know anything more about you. I don't need to know whether every - what (inaudible) or not. But you should. And you know I don't really need to know about you know family or anything that really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything substantial.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm talking about are you there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you know what worthless means? That's what I - that's in a way where I was last week. Do you know what worthless means? Do you know what I'm talking about? Or are you just - you going to - you know you just write notes the way I do. </p>

<p>Like Thomas was really hallucinating today. And I spent some time with him. And I - his hallucinations are you know getting worse bla, bla, bla. He's no more you know. Because I can do that too. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. We'll pick up with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you have a (inaudible) by the way? I didn't say the last (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you got an envelope?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Great. Well I'm sorry that I called your other number. (coughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's - that's - the other number is like (inaudible) and I prefer not to be called on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright. So there's one - another - group that you're.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's this office. That rings in this office.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have another office as well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the office number for.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you got a pen?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be at - all of us.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder if I just thinking so much about death because I work with all kinds of dying people. I'm not really sure. It's certainly on my mind all - with this. You know I usually lose two patients a weekend. It's like. [51:02]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm wondering when that will back up on me. But it's not so far. I wish they were getting well instead of you know. What - what session is this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is 11 if I remember.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you remember. Do you remember? (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's sly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's 11.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Well done. Oh some kind of genius there (inaudible) remember. Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thanks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright. I'm going to start - I'm going to try to get angry with you. I will try. I'm going to work up - I'm going to work up even a false anger. Nah. Too hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like you don't want to leave.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I don't. That's because it was a good session. Thank you for sharing. Was it hard?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're welcome. No. It was great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good. I'm going to ask you to do it again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See you ... next Monday at five?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye-bye now.</p>

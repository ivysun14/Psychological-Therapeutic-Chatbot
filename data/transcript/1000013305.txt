<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: I went to work for a few hours on Wednesday and that was it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha. I am wondering, do you want to pull the chair up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When it is way up, it doesn't necessarily feel that much better. Maybe I will just switch my position around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So how are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 0:36)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is a good way to start a session.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I was just noting some things of some real concern.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I have some things I to talk about. Uncomfortable things but I guess I will jump into it if that is okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am having lots of conversations with Cole and last week he was kind of flipping out on me again. He took real good care of me while I was had my surgery and everything and then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday he started to distance himself. You know, I told you how he shuts me out. You and I talked about how maybe I shouldn't be so sensitive and insecure and take it personally. A lot of people have told me that because he gets that way with his work. I learned just to leave him alone when he gets that way because when I do say, "are you okay? Is everything alright?" he will jump down my throat and say: "It has nothing to do with you. You are just being insecure." So I didn't ask him at all. I will just chilled out. If he is freaked out about work or whatever, fine. I will deal with it and I won't bother about it. And then he called me last Wednesday night at work and he sounded...for Wednesday...when was it. What night was it? Yeah Wednesday, and he was in a horrible mood and when I got up to leave that morning, I felt like things were like: "What is going on? I am not going to bother him but this just feels really bad."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was he just very abrupt on the phone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He called...I called and he never returned my call for a long time. Like, hours later he called and was like: "I am just having a bad day at work." And I was like: "Well, I am sorry. I hope it gets better but I am having a pretty shitty day myself." You know, I was. My back was killing me. I had to rush to get a show done an he was being a jerk and that was making me feel really bad. I said: "Fine, I hope your day gets better."</p>

<p>And then he called me, because when I do a show I work until late at night. He called me around eight o'clock. He was in a restaurant with his friend. He was like: "Hi." I am like: "Hi." He was like: "What is up?" I am like: "What is wrong with you - you sound horrible?" He was like: "Yeah, I am." I am like: " What is up? Is it work." He was like: "Ah, it is everything." I am like: "What do you mean 'everything'? Is it me?" He was like: "My whole life." What he had done is he had worked up in this head that things were not right with us or things were not right with anything. So suddenly here he was; I did what he told me to do and I gave him his space to deal with it. But what he does is he does turn it on the relationship so I am in catch 22. I cannot do anything about it. Then later, he called mean again and he was like: "Hi, I just realized how many problems I have and I thought I had worked through them - my problems. And I don't know what is wrong with me. I am so confused. I know I should be really happy but, you know, blah, blah, blah." Pretty much taking the blame for what was going on which he usually doesn't do. He was like: "I really thought I had worked through my problems but clearly I haven't blah, blah, blah." (3:53)</p>


<p>COUNSELOR: Does he let you know what the things are that are bothering him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or does he always think they are banal?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he pretty much generalizes it and makes it so I never quite know. Then that way if I get worried that it has something to do with me, he can turn it on me and be like: "Oh, you are just being insecure." You know, because he never draws specifics. I said to him : "Look Cole, I have done everything I can do. I really don't know what else to do. If you need time away from me, that is fine." I said: "I will be miserable and I will be really sad but if that is what you need, take it because I don't really know what to do anymore. This is not me - this your problem. It really has nothing to do with me." And then he was like: "No, no I don't want to do that and then I will be so upset and I will be more miserable than you." We talked a little more the next day but when I try to talk to him about it, he doesn't feel like talking about it. He just feels like: "Shut up."</p>

<p>So then when I learn to work through things myself, he then turns it. He really is kind of a jerk. And I will turn around and say: " You are a mute and you never talk to me about the way you feel." So yesterday we had a whole conversation about: "You have to make it safe for me to talk to you. You want to be closer and you feel distant from me but when I try to open up to you, you make it really difficult. If you don't want to talk about it, you don't let me and if you don't understand, you will just tell me I am insecure." So we just had this whole weekend where it was like: "I do love you and I do want this to work and I am going try really hard."</p>

<p>Then we were out of town at this house for the holidays over the weekend and I went with his mother and sister shopping and he went with his dad to look at a club. You know, he plays tennis so he wants to join a club. Am I just blabbering too much? I am trying to get all this information out. Let me tell you, I am getting to the gist of it. He said, we where outside and we ate with his friend, and he was saying how all these people were married and blah, blah, blah and his friend at the club asked him what was going on and he was like: "Ah, you know." And he was telling this story to his friend and I was sitting there and I he was: "Ah, you know, da, da, da - I am not in any hurry." (6:10)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not in any hurry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To get married. Basically, he is like: "I am not in any hurry." Basically the gist of it was that he told his friends nothing was going on with him right now. I mean, there are other times in our relationship, we have talked about getting married a lot. At one point we wanted to; at one point he was not sure. You know, we know in this relationship that ultimately - because of our ages and what is up - that we are going to get married or we are going to break-up. We are not just going to spend years together. And last Sunday when I was at home sick, I was watching this movie and there was a scene where the couple had a little baby - a little girl. They came in and they were all happy and crying. I started hysterically crying and I realized: "I want to get married and have a baby. I don't know what the hell is going on in my life - with my relationship." And that really, really upset me.</p>

<p>So yesterday - with all this that had happened last Sunday and his comment to his friend - I was really feeling bummed out. Not that I necessarily know that I am going to marry him but hearing that from him when I am working so hard to make it work and he is like constantly pulling the rug from underneath, I just started thinking. He was like: "What is wrong?" and I was like: "I will tell you what is wrong. I am really upset. I feel really sad because I am working really hard to..." And then I told him about his comment and I told him why I got upset when I was watching a movie and I said: "You know, I am ready for all of this and I don't know what is going on. I cannot do anything about it." So we had a hole conversation. Part of what it comes down to and part of what I think it is - his issue with me or the reason...I know this is not only...this is the issue that he has that really bothers me...he doesn't feel the chemistry for me that he has felt in past relationships.</p>

<p>Like his ex-girlfriend - who I knew nothing about but I hear their relationship was absolutely horrible from everybody and really got him down. They were always fighting but he was so attracted to her - physically and sexually. He thinks she is beautiful and they had all this chemistry and she still calls and everything. That is one of my insecurities. I said to him yesterday: "I don't know. You have to love me 100 per cent. I don't want to have to go through the rest of my life thinking I am not good enough for you in some way or that you are going to be attracted to somebody else. He always tries to minimize that and play it down. He was like: "Well, that is not important. Yes, I felt that way more for Sarah." Because I asked him and he told me. "But sex is all I had with her and what does that mean in the long run? I doesn't mean anything." He tries to minimize that issue in a relationship and I blow it up because it scares me - it really scares me. (9:14)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, maybe it goes back to...I don't know. There are enough people that think I am terrific and find me really attractive, you know? I should think I am entitled to have that in a relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it goes back to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: My father and that he cheated on my mother. Maybe I feel like if I am not attractive enough Cole is going to run away and...I don't know. I mean I could analyze it to death but the bottom line is...what I said to him after that: "Well, if we were going to break up today Cole, what would you tell people? Is that what you would say?" And he was like: "Well, yes, I would say Mae was insecure that I didn't find her attractive enough." He was like: "I think you are gorgeous. I think you are beautiful. I think you are attractive." He doesn't have that chemistry with me that he had. And sometimes I say to him: "How can you say you are attracted to me when you are running scared all of the time? You are frightened and you are numb and you are anxiety-ridden. When are you going to have the time to fell attracted to me?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Umm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Of course you don't. You are full of all that crap." He is so scared of committing to me and being in a consistent relationship that he is constantly running away from it so how is he going to find the time? wouldn't it make sense that he would kind of try and turn off from me because he is so scared of me? I don't know if I am making too much of a big deal. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is not that you are making too much of a big deal but just in that question and that way of hearing things, it does sound like you are both sort of slinging the blame or throwing the ball of blame back and forth. Him saying: "You are insecure." You saying: "You are wound up and numb to feel anything."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, when I am trying to explain, when we are trying to figure out...he thinks there is too much importance on that. Maybe that is why I think: "Well, maybe this is not right for me." Because he cannot give me a good reason why he is running from the relationship so I think: "Well, that must be it." He is missing something - he is missing something. So is he missing the attraction that he had for Sarah? I mean, what is he missing? And I was explaining that to him and he was like, well, he listened to me and he understood and everything. He was like: "There..." I do personally have a lot of issues when it comes to sex also."</p>

<p>Like I told you my ex-boyfriend gave me genital warts - Tim gave it to me. When Cole found out about that - I told him about that right at the beginning of our relationship, he hard a really hard time handling it. He wanted to deal with it but he didn't know how. Some people handle it -some people don't. He kept away from me a lot and didn't want to have sex very often because he was very scared that he could get it and things like that. So that has been something. And because I am on the Prozac - you know that - that gives me a problem. It has reported (ph) a little but it makes it...it is much harder for me to...I feel so nervous talking about this, but having an orgasm get wet. So he said to me last night: "It is me but think of what you are giving me too. I feel bad because I feel like I can never turn you on. And like it could be that too because you are..." He is like: "I have gotten over the genital warts thing for the most part but he is like: "Now, I feel like, once in a while, yeah. Okay, so I don't know, I don't know if that is." So he is like: "Well, talk to your therapist." Could that be fair or am I just trying to put the blame back on? I don't know. So there is just all that stuff going on with that. And I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A lot of stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't think...I don't know. The whole thing just makes me feel inadequate in our relationship. It makes me feel insecure. It makes me feel like...or maybe because I am insecure I don't know...I need to know that he is completely interested in me. And do I deserve to have that in a relationship? Am I being fair? I mean, there could be a lot of reasons. At first, he pursued me. He called, he wanted to date me. It is not like I chased him and I forced him to like me or anything like that. So clearly that attraction was there at the beginning. He wanted to go out with me but it has become a problem for me because of everything else that is going on also. I just don't know how much importance to place on it. And yesterday I was at the point where I was basically telling him that: "If you can't love me completely, I don't want to be with you. I deserve more. I want to be with someone who loves me completely. You would want the same thing."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Umm-hmm. Let me ask where you are? What these questions mean and being here - is there some sense of what you are feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am kind of feeling that it is a big ball of crap but I am keeping it down. I am trying to find an answer. I am trying to find...I have been emotional about all this all weekend. I am still trying to feel everything in this relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about marriage? (14:57)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I am not. I mean, I am trying to get an answer. I don't know what is right or wrong. I don't know if I am being...It has been in the answers before that I have like...at times when you would get any feedback that maybe I am being too antsy. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have a sense of wanting maybe some feedback or whatever?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I guess what occurred to me when you were speaking with that, you want someone who makes you feel less insecure but I feel strongly that that insecurity begins with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so does Cole. I mean, he said you have to be secure with yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, in some sense I think that he is right. I can certainly understand feeling frustrated with that line because he seems to be a lot into that line. You seem to get it a lot from Cole. It seems to be disowning of any responsibility from you and your feelings. But because I think you are susceptible to feeling badly, it is hard for you to sort of stand up for what you want in a relationship and to be able to say "bullshit" to someone whose explanations are, I would just like to say, straightforward. "I want more from you." I am not quite sure you feel like you deserve more...I guess that is mostly it; you feel like you deserve more. It seems to me that you are very ready to doubt yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No really, I know that I have had someone love me more than he does. And I like the way that feels a lot better. And maybe that does go back to me feeling insecure or whatever. I don't know but it feels a lot better when someone loves you and accepts you for who you are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, I was concerned about answering your question or giving you feedback because I had a sense that it wasn't going to be something that you would take, you know, without you saying: "Well, that is not quite it."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I always do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you do - you do that a lot and I am kind of curious about what is behind that. What you are expecting when you ask me for feedback. What it is like to get it from me? "Well, that stuff is an inconvenience."</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think I listen to you openly but then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel to get that feedback? (17:58)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Fine. It is not like I was looking to argue with what you were saying or argue with what you were saying. I just kind of thought because of what I know about myself or I am (laughs).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we have some sort of dialogue?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I feel that I deserve to be unloved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not at all. I feel like I do deserve it and I don't understand why Cole doesn't feel that way about me. And that scares me. I think I have felt it from other people. Is this is not right for me if I don't get that from him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you asking me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am just asking myself - those are the questions in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those are such hard questions to answer. I mean, they are hard to answer for yourself and they are hard to ask somebody to answer for you because they are your experience - they are unique and your own. It is complicated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I don't want an answer. Because I know...I mean no one can give me a definitive answer. That is what I am struggling with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like I do not want to give you a answer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't. I feel like that is not for someone else to answer. I guess I really do feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I know that is a sensitive issue for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Me looking for answers?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, still looking for answers and feel like someone is going to give it to you because you need to find it yourself or whatever. And you are really sad about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I just don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where are you right know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I am working with someone - Cole - who is not really working back with me. Maybe he has got his own things to work out too but it is just so much...it is so complicated that I don't know whether it is supposed to be or whether ultimately I am going to realize something from this or figure it out or whether to just run - like go the other way. (21:15)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the last time that we met, our exchange was pretty heated or involved - do you remember?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm-hmm. Kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you have any feelings or thoughts about that later?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I feel that I got a sense of how confusing or complicated it gets for you and it gets for Cole. Just, in a sense, disagreeing gets very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But all this - it just seems like a veil, a web of...kind of insignificant things. It is almost like there is nothing behind any of it; that it is all created for the effect. All these stupid little arguments and it is just causing...it is like something that is not really there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean in here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I mean with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not sure what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it is all fabricated. all the arguments and all the disagreements, it is all just noise. It doesn't need to be there because really none of it means anything or relates to anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I heard you same the same thing about what goes on in here. And I am wondering is that connected with that feeling - the manipulation feeling? Like things are superficial on the surface - it is a game. That kind of stuff?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it is kind of different. I feel like there are all kinds of diversions. With Cole...I understand what you are talking about, but with Cole it is like he is creating this web of problems that don't really exist to create a diversion, so he doesn't have to deal with the real feelings that are there for him - that are scaring him or whatever. I really think it is him - I don't think it is me. You know? (24:12)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I am not quite sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, if you were to visualize it and you visualized two people that could be really different - like you and me sitting here - and everything in between us was just...imagine a big spider web and each piece of the web was a different disagreement or conversation that is for a reason for why we should not get along or why it might not work or is an anxiety. It doesn't connect to anything. None of it is really meaningful. It is all variably between us but none of it leads to anything. There is no reason why Cole and I shouldn't get along really well except that he is constantly creating problems and trying to sabotage what could be or what is. Because he is scared for whatever reason I don't really understand. So all of this stuff - including him not feeling attracted to me, you know. My responses are reactions to his kind of confusion. I try to make sense to something he says or feels and then he takes it to another level and none of it really connects to anything. Do you understand what I am saying?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I am actually having a hard time following you. I like the spider web analogy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) All of it seems like nonsense to me. All of the things that I come to you to talk about and complain about, it seems like they are all avoidable. They are not real problems, ultimately. If he and I could just communicate better or he wasn't running scared and triggering my insecurities and I in turn triggering his back, none of this noise would be happening. We would be just on our way - be really good friends and have a nice relationship. I feel like it is all created. I mean, Cole grew up with a father who was constantly fighting. It was a constant struggle for him so there is not a struggle here. He creates one because that is what he knows. To me, it is like: Where does this come from?" To me, none of it makes sense. I don't feel like I am really starting any of this. I am reacting to it but I am not starting it. I feel like it doesn't even have anything to do with me. (27:00)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe what would help instead...you know, I don't want to take you back to us but maybe explain how that happens in here too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it is us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel like there is a sort of a web between us that might be stopping us from getting along smoothly, becoming friends?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really. You do obviously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I would like to hear more about...I mean, how does it...I guess I do feel that there is sort of a lack of connection between us and I like the web analogy because I feel like there is stuff between us. And I was wondering if you felt that at all?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel a lack of a connection, definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you think...you see now I am going to start analyzing this because I guess...am I playing out my relationship with Cole in here. Am I going to do to you what he does to me basically? Is that what you are suggesting? Like he creates all this noise and puts it up as a wall in front of him against me - like to block me out. Do you feel like I am doing that to you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Boy, sometimes I am not able to answer your question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would rather hear about how you don't feel a connection in here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe that gets me excited if that is what I am doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is the excitement for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because if I am recreating in here what Cole does to me out there then I can understand more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where he is coming from. Because I don't do it on purpose. I don't think I do. Maybe I am trying to protect myself from something. I don't know what. (29:41)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think I have experienced both how you feel with Cole and maybe how Cole feels with you. But I think that you are doing this to communicate to me something about yourself and something about your feelings and that is important for me to understand. What is not so easily communicated by words or recounting a certain name for that. I can get a sense of what it is like between the two of you just in terms of what our communication is like - the pattern is kind of like in here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I do the same thing. I go all over the place, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little bit. I think in a sense I felt like you last time we met when I was just saying: "Just talk to me. Just tell me about your feelings."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I felt sort of clingy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) You felt like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Desperate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is not a good feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A-ha.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then I also felt I think like Cole and felt very sort of patronizing and disdainful to you at times and that is not a good feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, I wish I would just melt away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now you have to give me back some feedback. You just heard some feedback from me. What was that like to hear me say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt like when you were describing feelings, I could feel them because I have had them all. And that, "I am sorry if I make you feel that way but I can relate," doesn't feel good, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think I am angry with you because you make me feel that way sometimes? Or I feel that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I would think that...angry? No. there is that word again (laughs). No, I am kidding.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it like to get that kind of feedback from me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it just makes me feel like you understand how I am feeling. You see the relationship and the dynamics of it and you have experienced my actions - my experience with Cole. Is that what this is all supposed to be about? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why does that matter?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, what were you thinking then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Am I learning what I am supposed to be learning. Are things happening in here? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, are you learning what you want to be learning in here? (32:58)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I am definitely learning things about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. You know, when I understand certain things, it feels like it clears the way to get to the next level and start understanding more things. I mean, that is good. And I understand things about my relationship with Cole. You know, like, when I have these parallels. I feel that is really neat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think the difficulty is in getting a connection with me? do you have a semblance?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A sentence?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A semblance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You are not going to like my answer. I feel like it is you that cannot connect with me. Or I cannot connect with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What odd you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't feel like I am not open to being connected to. I feel like you are the one with the barriers. I really don't feel I am - maybe I am, I don't know - but I feel you are the one with the barriers, not me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well tell me what those barriers are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what does it feel like to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, look how you are sitting. You look like you are shutting me out. I feel tension from you. I don't feel a sense of ease from you. Like you said, maybe we should develop a friendship or just break but I feel like the communication is kind of one way. You know, to develop a friendship and communication is one way. I am giving you everything. I am not getting anything back or as much as I am giving. It is not an open interaction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is the inequality of our relationship which is partly to blame?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I mean like right now you are sitting there analyzing me. You are looking at me and you are thinking I am not allowed to know what you are thinking but... (36:06)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are not allowed to know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it doesn't seem like I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you going to even ask me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I do and you don't answer me. You are more interested in hearing how I feel, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean everything is about: "Well look, I am not telling you anymore until you answer me."</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I am not like that. I am not confrontational.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was going to say not aggressive but I can be - when it is comfortable for me to be I guess. (Chuckles.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is the way I am with Cole too. He says things and I just accepts what he says. I feel like I am not supposed to...you know, where I cannot ask. Or maybe I don't ask because I feel like I am not going to get the right answer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is the right answer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That somehow you won't get the answer you are looking for?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. What do you think about my feeling that the lack of connection comes from you and not me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think I certainly have a part in it. I am not as clear what my part is though. Maybe I need you to tell me. Maybe you can see things that are happening in me here that I cannot notice or am aware of. And I actually welcome your feedback that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think you look very uptight right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. How come? Why do I make you uptight?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, okay that is...I feel a certain tension from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe it comes from you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well see, that is possible but I think the part of the difficulty is I am sensing some tension between us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not knowing exactly how I am going to get it out in the open between us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Get what out in the open? The tension?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I feel that that kind of stuff is most important stuff that goes on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The tension?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The tension.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do we experience each other because I think you draw a lot of parallels between you and Cole and I think that it...I think this is one way of understanding what happens when you are with you Cole is sort of what happens between us. So when you were answering my questions, I was sensing you were feeling: "Ah, you know, (inaudible 40:06) thinks." I don't know. I often feel like it is a little anger for me and I was trying to figure out how we were going to use it instead of let it come between us - come between us in the communication. I don't want you to feel blamed in here but I am sure some of the way I put things makes you feel blamed. But then I just feel like we are doing the tension instead of: "Alright let us just get it out." Do I (inaudible 40:58)?</p>


<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) I felt like that was a stab at me when you said: "(inaudible 41:15)."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt like it offended you that I said you looked tense so after you got (inaudible 41:23) in a joking way. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is alright. I feel lucky that you are giving me that feedback. Most patients don't ever tell me that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not a blame game and that is what kind of goes on with Cole too. It seems like a blame game. "Who made you feel what way?" Who cares. It doesn't matter as long as you don't give up, you know what I mean? (42:00)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Here, it is not like, "oh you make me feel tense" or "I make you feel tense" or what are the dynamics of the tension of what is going on and whose fault is it. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well....</p>

<p>PATIENT: The idea is not to feel that way. It is not to, you know...get part of...well, maybe it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand. I don't want it to be a blame game. I don't think it is a blame game but I think it ends up being like that or feeling like that. I am just curious how that happens.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it is funny; the tension is there but I just try to ignore it. I don't like dealing with it. I don't like the confrontation. I would rather just absorb it which is a lousy feeling too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wish you could take it in yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, hold onto it and forget about it or move onto something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think you want to avoid it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Because it is uncomfortable and I guess I like things to be smooth and easy. As you know, I speak to my parents every once in a while. My mother, you know, "how is your therapy going blah, blah, blah" and I tell her things that we are conflicting on or whatever. I thought this would be an interesting point of information; the whole anger thing." I don't feel angry." She said: "It is interesting: I had a conversation with your father and when you..."</p>

<p>When I was a baby - a year or younger; in the first couple of years of my life - I had such a bad temper. I would, like, run around screaming and yelling; throwing my hands up above my head and turn bright red. I had temper tantrums constantly and I was aggressive and I use to beat up my older sister. I would wiggle before I could even walk. She said I would wiggle on my stomach and I would crawl up on her rocking horse and try to pull her down. When I was at the pool...just different things about how I acted. I would run up to different kids and I would steal their toys. She said I had a really bad temper but the way they handled it was they just decided not to really acknowledge me. They kind of thought me at a very young age that I am not going to get anywhere by having a temper tantrum. She said that I learnt at a very young age to be manipulative because I didn't get what I wanted. I guess I learned that I am not going to get what I wanted by screaming and yelling so just learned to, you know...and just trying to figure out why I do have such aggressive things.</p>

<p>So I think on top of that, I don't think I have all this anger that I am holding back. I just think that I deal with it differently because I was taught that at a very young age - and I believe it. I don't think yelling and screaming gets you anywhere. I mean I have always felt that. It was interesting. And trying to understand: "Do I have anger? Am I suppressing my anger?" Or whatever. (45:58)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are just trying to make connections?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was going on just there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I am trying to make connections. I just thought it was something that was interesting. When you were talking about tension, I guess I thought, you know, you often say: "Does that make you angry?" Or whatever. It is just my little explanation that makes sense to me. You said to me like you feel there is a lot I keep inside of me that I don't reveal about myself because I think I am very open and let everything out. You said there is a sense that there is a lot that I don't let out but I assumed to a degree that you meant a lot of anger and feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that yawn?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am just waking up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem kind of sad to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really. I am just really, really tired of all this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All of this stuff just leads to nowhere? Just escape?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A-ha. It is like too much to deal with all the time. Too much emotion and too much thinking. I don't know. Today I don't feel like I am getting anywhere. (48:00)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say more about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel that all these emotions are flying around and I am not making sense of any of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not being much help?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Maybe - I don't know. There are days when we figure things out. It doesn't feel like today is one of them. Maybe that is me trying to avoid where you were directing the conversation again to the tension between us - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you ever go back there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can still feel it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) I know you feel it - I think you always feel it. I think you feel it a lot more than I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Umm-hmm. Do you ever really feel that you have an awareness of it yourself now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I focus on it. But I feel it from you and then it creates tension on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where do you think the tension from me is coming from?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe you are frustrated because I am not playing the game the way I am supposed to or I am not focusing on the things you would like me to focus on or you cannot get control of what direction I am going in - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 50:03) something I can get to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is a good deal of it. I think what results is this feeling of not being very much help to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that makes you mad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't really know. Well, it would be easy to get mad and I think I do get mad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Once in a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it comes from all this feeling in me of not just being able to tolerate being so ineffective. Not liking that - wanting to be sort of competent and helpful and have you feel that I am competent and helpful. It is just not often the feeling that I get.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am sorry. I am but I feel like - and this is going to make you mad - but I feel like that is your problem, not mine. I don't mean that to be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just unloaded all of those feelings onto you - that was a burden, right? Was that a burden?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess I felt guilty. You made me feel guilty because you are basically saying that I make you feel ineffectual and incompetent. I don't think I am. I don't think that is my responsibility.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see, I don't feel like I am putting it on you Mae. I really don't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I take it all the time (laughs).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like I am actually happy to tell you that is often what I feel but I really don't feel like it is your fault; it is something you do to foil my good attempts. I don't feel like that. I am just trying to understand the dynamic that happens between us. But there is something about my telling you this that lays all of this burden on you. You have to say: "Look, alright, that is you. I am right here." You know, that starts with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that goes back to what I was looking for when I first came here, which is someone that understands things better than I do; that can teach me or give me some answers or whatever. Whether they were what I was supposed to have or not, they were my expectations, so those are hard to let go of I guess. Again, you cannot explain it to me again I know, but more so I understand why the dynamics of whether we like each other can be helpful to me. By just focusing on how we are feeling. What is going on right now, right here and why you are feeling tense. I am not purposely trying to be resistant to it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't feel like you are but I do feel like when someone has a reaction to you, you feel burdened. Or it seems like you are very susceptible to people's feelings. It is easier for you to keep responsibility - your sense of responsibility - for other people's feelings out. (53:52)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are people sometimes responsible for other people's feelings? Like I know I say to Cole: "Look, you may think I am a swine (ph) but this is my reaction to the way you are treating me. And he is like: "Well, you feel that way. I am not responsible for how you feel." And I am like: "Well, yeah you are. If someone is treating you like shit and you feel bad, they are responsible." Maybe they are not - okay, you get out and you don't deal with them. People can make you feel a certain way. Don't you think they should feel responsible for it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ever?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I notice this is a big issue for you. I understand why - it is a big issue for me too but if you feel a certain way in response to someone, I don't feel like it is their fault that you feel this way. I look at it differently. I am not quite sure what happens when you tell Cole: "Look, you make me feel this way." In a sense that is what I could say to you: 'You make me feel incompetent."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and of course I am going to say: "I do not. It is your problem, not mine." Right? Of course I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, anybody would do that. No one wants to be blamed for someone else's feelings and no one is responsible. You are right. When you put it that way I can see it clearly. Like, that would be ridiculous if you said that to me.</p>


<p>COUNSELOR: I am responsible for these feelings but I am also not putting them out there to blame you. I am putting them out there to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Explore them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so the ideal relationship is where you can ask someone about their feelings and not feel threatened by what they tell you, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I learned something (laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel so (inaudible 56:12)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Am I really stubborn? You make me feel like...or I feel in here like I am really stubborn sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are really stubborn.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, your spirit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) That is what my mother always says about me. It is so funny because I don't perceive myself to be that way at all (chuckles). I don't at all. I am determined though I guess if I think I am right about something, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. We have to end.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Aw okay. (56:59)</p>

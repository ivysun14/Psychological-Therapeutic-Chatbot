<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Darla called you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. She called the house phone first but I wasn't home and Deborah had come up to meet me halfway with the shopping cart and she didn't take her phone with her so Darla had called my phone, she called Deborah's cell phone, she called my cell phone; and, of course, by the time I reached my cell phone she was off the phone. So we get home and there is a phone number and it's the same phone number that was on my cell phone, so I called back. She was over at her girlfriend's house, and she let her use her phone. She called back and she started to talk to me and then she went and talked to her mother and then she left me this long message on Facebook and then we talked later on that afternoon. It was like - wow. I had called the girl back, and I said, "Can I speak to Darla, please. She said, ‘Nana, this is Darla. [00:01:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my gosh. How long had it been since you guys had talked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Three years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Holy cow. Oh, my gosh. You didn't recognize her voice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Her voice changed from a younger voice to a much more mature girl. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was that? [00:01:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like - wow. But she said some word and I said, "Yeah, I know it's you now," because it was an expression she's always had. [00:02:06] We must have talked for about a half hour, then she talked to her mother, and then she got back on the phone with me. It was like wow, this poor kid is not going to have any minutes on her phone. It was very nice, very nice. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Gosh, three years, Louise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Isn't that a long time? She started calling me on her lunch break.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it might be the same time. I'll just say hello, goodbye, and she can call me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What have you got there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What have I got here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my gosh. Wow. Some photographs of your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is you, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where was this taken? [00:03:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Up north.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? Whose place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My parents' place. They were still together at that time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how old are you in this would you guess?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had to be either 16 or 17.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right? Wow. You do not look 16 or 17. Mature. And that's you with...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's me pregnant with Deborah and my mother is carrying Jack.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? Oh, my gosh. I need to get my glasses. Wow. Where is this taken?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Over where my mother worked at a nursing home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your mother did that, too, huh? [00:04:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She worked for the city for almost 35 years. That's me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When was this taken?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was probably 16 or 17. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: July ‘64.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay. That is my father's brother, Conrad, Mary's father. (pause) That's me and I think that's my mother. [00:04:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It must be your father then. I'll come to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. That's the asshole. See this [...] (inaudible at 00:05:08).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They used to make them, my grandfather. He was a carpenter and an electrician. ‘54. Aren't I adorable? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that you? Yeah, you were cute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The sweater - my mother used to make them with all the designs on them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is your home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't too pleased with having curls in my hair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Fuck. That's me. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You must be like seven...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It might be on the back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ‘56 [00:06:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (phone rings) Darla. "Hey, Nana. I won't be able to call today but I'll call at this time tomorrow. Love you." (laughs) Isn't she cute?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she got your phone number and texted?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. That's me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Big doll. Oh, my gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was one of those things you could win. That's me and my mother. Don't I look awful? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. What do you mean you look awful?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't going to bring that picture.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I didn't like it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What don't you like about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My face, the hairdo.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't like that, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I didn't. Does it say what year it is on the back? [00:07:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ‘65.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm getting old here. That's me and Darla.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That one I recognize.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, my baby. (chuckles) Aww. Aren't they cute?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was pinching me on the back, the little bastard. Yeah, he'd look like that. He had the Brylcreem and the t-shirt rolled up with the pack of cigarettes in it. Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many years older?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Two years. Look at you. Wow. Very cute. [00:07:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So cute and adorable. They're all school pictures, though. That was in my little car (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are great. Those are great pictures.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's Mickie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is Mickie.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's my father, Mickie and a friend of his down the Cape.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? It's got his name on it. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Here's Mickie. Here's my grandfather, my father's father, and me. That's at my grandmother's house with Mickie and me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Big old ice cream. Look at that thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the only thing that would keep us quiet. That's me in the school across from our house. I've got suspenders on with my jeans. I was just stylish. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were stylish. You were a stylish young lady. [00:08:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A few front teeth out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think if you turn it over you might find some.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mickie. Oh, my gosh. Look at that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Easter Sunday. Save that one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's Mickie and that's me in the car. That's over at my grandmother's house; and there we are out in the backyard, Mickie, my mother and me. Now those swings, my grandmother had them in the enclosed porch out in the backyard also. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right? There's a bike over there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's probably a boy's bike.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably a boy's bike; you weren't... [00:09:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's my cousin, Iris. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mickie at the Cape?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and one of his friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that your dad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that your bedroom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did I know that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had twin beds. Mind you, I had the master bedroom. (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had the master bedroom? Why was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. My parents gave it to me. I had two closets.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. Who is this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's my mother's brother. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where is this? Is this your school? [00:11:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's the school we used to roll out of bed and I'd always be late. My brother would shoot the windows out with BB guns. Also, my father had barfed on them. (laughs) That's Mickie, but that's not his room. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's not his room?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think so. I think that might have been my room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The wallpaper wasn't like that. Cowboy stuff. Horses. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well then that might have been his bedroom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a painting above it. That's your father. Wow. There he is. Look at that. You were looking smart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A style nut. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Looks like a pixie haircut.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's see. That's my father's sister. [00:12:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. That's cute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's more of my big smile. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's you, huh? In front of the school, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is your house and that's right across the street? How about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is like my father's car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? And who's that with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My girlfriend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You and Mickie?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I didn't think I [...] (inaudible at 00:12:54). Now, see? Boy's bike. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Boy's bike. Boy's got the bikes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's Louise on? Boy's bike. It was Mickie's. (laughs) [00:13:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, this is probably the happiest you've looked in all of these pictures - on that bike. (pause) Who's this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's my cousin. That's his mother that was on the other photo there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is Christmas morning. (pause) How about that. Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like - did we get enough gifts? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Yeah, that looks like a big Christmas spread.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Those are all me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is, again, in front of your...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is your place. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) That's me. [00:14:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is that do you think? Is this your home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that was the same home you saw before in the pictures. I probably had to be about 20 or 21.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So it's still the home. Wow. How about those?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing like oldies but goodies. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, they're amazing. So he was in the...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was in the service.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. A lot of nice pictures. Look at you. How about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I ought to show these to Donald. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, they're great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He won't believe me. Darla got an e-mail from a college in New York. [00:15:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: New York?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. They want her to go there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? What year is she?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's in the tenth grade, but her scores were so high on the PSAT's that they sent her a letter already stating they wanted her to go there. She doesn't want to go there. She wants to go to school for design. There's some other school here also that she thinks is better. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she wants to go to Boston?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She wants to be near her grandma. [00:15:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Two more years. Two and a half more years, right? Yeah, about two and a half years. They haven't been able to figure out Christmas yet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. She'll be spending it down there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I figured.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now she's working on them for Spring Vacation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is what, March or something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'll find out, you know? But, yeah. She sounded so altogether different. And she's dating this boy, Shane. They've been seeing each other for nine months, and Shane is as black as the Ace of Spades. He's what you call a dark chocolate, where Mark is a Milky Way chocolate. He's not that dark. I said to Darla, "What do Ellen and your father think of him?" She said, "They think he's nice and everything, but Ellen is so watchful we can't even go to the park together." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's in tenth grade, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She said, "The only place that we can go is we can sit in the living room."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She doesn't want them to go out and be by themselves?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They've got to be under the watchful eye that they were minding the daddy. I said to Deborah, "Well, we know Evelyn doesn't have a boyfriend because she's so ugly she'd have to find one just as ugly and hairy as she is." So then when I was talking to Darla I said, "Tell me, does Evelyn have a boyfriend?" She said, "No. She's too ugly." I said, "You know, that's the same thing I said to your mother." (laughs) [00:18:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, she's going to have a tough road, Evelyn.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope. Especially when she wears a 24 size women's clothes. She's a big girl. Very big. If there were six of us for dinner and we didn't finish our meal, she'd eat what you had left and what the next person had left until her mother would finally stop her. [00:19:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she has a tough time in school, is that right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't like doing homework or anything. But kids do pick on her and stuff like that. She brings it on herself. If she doesn't want to bathe, of course somebody is going to call her stinky. I don't know if she's still peeing herself, but she peed herself getting on the bus and went to school smelling like that all day. Darla says, "Well, I try to stick up for her as much as I can, but - you know. I don't see her that often because I'm in advanced classes and she's in the behind classes." I said, "Okay." [00:20:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she's kind of an outcast - left behind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, well. (pause) Let's see, Mark was by on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was also wondering - just thinking about all those pictures - what your experience in high school was like. How you felt back then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, shit. I was suspended, detention - you name it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Suspended and detention?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. All around juvenile delinquent - yay. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Juvenile delinquents. [00:21:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was still that way when I got out of high school, went to work for my father. It was hot in the summertime and a couple of the French kids came and said, "You want to go to Revere Beach?" I'd be out that door no sooner than anything and leave my aunt in there working. I said, "You don't need two of us. Bye." My father said, "Make sure you get home for supper by 5:00." "Yeah, okay, dad." So I came home a little later than 5:00; it was 6:00, 7:00. "You know your mother had your supper waiting here. All this time she kept it warm." I said, "Okay." [00:21:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did your mother react?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing. (chuckles) She'd get mad at my father when he'd punish me, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She would?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She'd get extremely mad for taking it out on her son. Mickie was her favorite.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mickie was her favorite?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Mickie wouldn't do this, Mickie wouldn't do that. Me? Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would Mickie not do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, he wouldn't shit the halls in the schoolyard. You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She believed him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being caught at the with no clothes because he and his friends were swimming in it. They'd get out and somebody would have stolen their clothes. (chuckles) And he got into a fight. [00:23:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She saw him as an angel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not my Mickie. Nope. So that's why I was kind of pushing my way out of the house. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet. Well, Mickie wasn't easy on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. I think by the age of, I had to be 14, I was spending more time over at the neighbor's house babysitting than anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just to get out of the house?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just to get out of the house, yeah. I came home late and my father would have the doors locked with a dead-bolt on them and stuff. Yeah, it was nice. One night he put a bureau up against the front door. Didn't faze me. I just turned around and walked back a few doors down and said, "Ellen, can I sleep over? My father threw me out." [00:24:11] She bought it. It seems so funny. Ellen's middle child, lives two doors down from me in the building I'm living in now. My Deborah babysits his dog. It's this little - well, she's not little. She weights like 50 pounds but she's very close to the ground; very, very close to the ground. Deborah babysits him Monday through Friday. She gets him from nine to five. He'll be sleeping over until tomorrow. She'll have him all day tomorrow, he'll be sleeping. I also used to babysit the little sister. Then the other brother, I don't know whether he killed himself or what, and I don't dare ask any questions. I'm just afraid to. They never mention him or anything, so I said, "Well, I don't know where he is." I guess it's something they really don't talk about; and I guess when it happened he just had a nervous breakdown because he and they were like two sticks in a pod. You didn't see one brother without the other brother, that's how close they were. And, of course, curious me - I want to know. [00:26:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course. Something happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Drives me crazy. It does. I'm just eventually going to ask what happened. Let's see... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were going to say something about Mark.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He came over Monday and I was mad at him so, needless to say, after a while he left. He came back Tuesday and I just didn't pay any attention to him, so he left. He didn't come by Wednesday. [00:26:58] Thursday, well, my darling Deborah had gone to see her primary care physician on Monday and he did blood work. Thursday morning he called the house and talked to Deborah and told Deborah that her white blood counts are extremely, extremely high; and he wants her to go see a hematologist. She called and made the appointment with the hematologist and made an appointment for the day after Christmas. Then he called back in the afternoon and he asked Deborah if she was feeling okay or if she was in any pains, because then he'd want her to go up there right away. What she has is called leukocytosis. It's a form of leukemia. [00:28:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did they...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Her white blood cells were so, so sky-rocketing high. I said to Deborah, "Did you tell him that you generally run a temperature every day between 101° to 103°? "No." I said, "Well, do you think maybe you should mention that?" "Well..." So, who knows?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did they say to her about it? Did they give her any information about the prognosis, the treatment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not until she sees the hematologist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which will be when? Is it still the day after...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Christmas. The 26th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Unless she's feeling worse? How's that for you? Did you look it up online? [00:29:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I looked it up online and it did say it's a type of cancer, leukemia, and they didn't really say what's going to be... the doctor's remedy... whether she's going to be treatable... they'll have to do a bone marrow... so I don't know if it's going to be a medication they're going to be giving her or if she's going to have to have all her... maybe five pints of blood taken out and then five new kinds of blood taken in. I don't know. [00:30:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a very general, broad diagnosis, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, of course, Deborah is saying she doesn't want treatment. I said, "What do you mean you don't want treatment? You don't know what the treatment is yet, Deborah." "Well, you know all I want to do is die. I hate this fucking world and I want to fucking die. No treatments." So then I said I'm not going to argue with her. I'll just wait until I hear what the doctor has to say. So yesterday, when Darla called and she was talking with Darla, after she got through talking with Darla, I said, "Now do you still want to kill yourself, Deborah? What do you plan on doing? Do you plan on being alive when this daughter of yours comes up here to go to school? That's really going to put one on Darla." [00:31:03] She had a grandmother that died; it wasn't even her grandmother, my mother, and now Deborah?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did she say? What did Deborah say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She didn't give me a straight answer after that. I said, "Yeah, that's really going to do a number on Darla that her mother doesn't want to have treatment, her mother just wants to die. Deborah, this kid wants to be in your life so much, that you can't do this to that daughter. You can't. Wait until the 26th and find out what the story is going to be. [00:32:08] Deborah, what if it's just taking a medication? That's not going to kill you." "What if it's in my system?" I said, Deborah, radiation? Chemo? You don't know what the story is."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's very scared.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "Deborah, I've survived cancer twice. My mother had cancer and she lived for years after. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease, which is cancer of the lymph nodes and everything, so I said, "In those days, they had to have open heart surgery to get rid of the lymph nodes that were in here. Doctor said, ‘Six months. Lillian, give up smoking. Lillian, don't go out in the sun.' What was your grandmother doing? Still smoking a pack a day." And my mother loved the sun, she worshipped the sun. She would be out there all day. [00:33:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Deborah is very scared. That's what's happening. That doesn't sound like a death wish happening, it's more that she's very frightened about what's happening to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She has said more times than one that she wants to die. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I know that. I don't mean to dismiss that at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think this is just an easier way for her to say these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's understandably scared as hell about what's happening. Anybody in her position would be scared and "I want to die anyways" is such a way of confronting that - not confronting that. [00:34:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "Deborah, you've got to be strong. Shit, when I was told my diagnosis, I went out and bought all the things because I figured I was going to have chemo and radiation and he's talking about if I ain't dead in a week. How do you think I felt, Deborah? That was a rotten diagnosis I got. And then when they did the surgery, it was all contained in the one kidney. Nothing escaped, nothing. I'm fucking here, Deborah. It's just the outlook you have to take on your life." [00:34:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, she needs to get more information and has to hear what the treatment plan is and what the prognosis is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. So I'll be going to the doctor's with her that day. I'll have all the questions and - you know - find out what the treatment will be for her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. It will mean a lot for her to have you there, obviously. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Are they going to be doing a bone marrow? Are they going to be doing a biopsy? You know. You don't know. I said, "Deborah, these are all the things we've got to ask them. If he doesn't bring them up, we ask, Deborah." It's the only way you're going to get any answer. [00:35:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you need more information. You need to find out what's the... wow. How are you doing, Louise?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. I mean, as I said, I want to just wait until we see him before I even jump to any conclusion, but I think she's going to be fine. If they just find it in the white bloods - they were high the last time she saw her primary care physician, but evidently they really have shot way up, so I don't think a week or two is not bad for waiting. I mean, she's not ready to croak right now. She doesn't have any other symptoms. She doesn't have any pain, no nausea, and her primary care physician put her on the patch for smoking and then the Nicorette gum. She wore the patch for a few days and now she hasn't been wearing it. She's tried the gum every hour on the hour, but she gags and spits it out. She's going to ask her doctor today for a Chantix patch, for the non-smoking, and see if that works. [00:37:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much does she smoke?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I never thought she smoked a lot; sometimes maybe ten to 15 a day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot. That's nearly a pack, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but now she's cut back. She rolls her own cigarettes, maybe three or four a day now, so we'll see. And I don't know if it's supposed to help her with not smoking the pot either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think so. Maybe the second data?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean if you crave cigarettes, she craves a joint... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it's Nicorette, it's nicotine based and it's really decreasing the craving specifically for nicotine, as opposed to marijuana, TCH or THC. [00:39:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course, now she thinks that she's got leukemia. She can get a prescription for marijuana.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh - oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Her little mind is running there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's always got an angle, that one, right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. That's the first thing she thought of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See, there are some benefits.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm back to carrying my methadones with me because last week there were six missing, so it's like, "Deborah, why do you do this?" "I don't know." "But, Deborah?" "I don't know." So she's replacing her marijuana with my methadone pills. This ain't going to work. [00:40:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's trying to cut back on the marijuana?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. She's got no money for it. I won't give her any money for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? What made you stop? Was it the diagnosis?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's just that if I give her $100 and she buys pot, it's gone within a week. $100 worth of pot should last you quite a while. I mean if you have it, smoke one joint, but - oh, no. She's got to call up Mark and say, "Mark, I've got some," so Mark comes down and then she smokes another one with Mark. Then he comes back later and says, "Okay, Deborah, let's smoke up the rest of that stuff," if they didn't finish the whole joint; and then they start again and then she goes again at night - so that's like four a day. And if you divide them, that's $20 right there. So Deborah has it all the time. I'm not giving her $100 a week to buy it; nor am I even given her $20 a week to buy it. [00:41:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the marijuana has been her way of coping with all that's happened in her life and it's certainly kept her in one place, running and staying still.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. And then the clonodine makes her - she's in bed by 6:30. She's got the lights all off in the living room, TV set is going. I have to go and stop it, but yet, she's [...] (inaudible at 00:42:12) She wants to take a nap during the daytime. I said, "Deborah, I don't know if it's the clonodine, I think you really need to be checked out for C-Pap," for sleep apnea, because she snores and everything. She needs to get that checked out, but who am I. She won't eat all day if she doesn't have any marijuana. But if she has the marijuana, she'll eat breakfast, lunch and supper - and whatever else she can throw in there. [00:43:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is not a healthy life she's leading.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She won't eat anything else again until 5:00, and then all she ate was a small piece of kielbasa. That was it. And, of course, she drinks a lot of caffeine, a lot of caffeine, which I would think she'd be so wired that she wouldn't be able to pass out. Nope. She can still pass out. But she has the marijuana. She'll eat a large supper, then half-hour later she's eating cereal and a half-hour later she's eating ice cream, and then a half-hour later she's got cookies and milk, pretzels, chips, cheese curls - you name it. [00:44:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot of junk food.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What the hell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. A lot of stuff up in the air now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it ever. I've got Reese's Peanut Butter Cup on my lips.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How's your diabetes doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was 252 this morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We'll see how much Elliott-boy raises up my insulin again this month. He's got me on 13 now, so now he'll probably move me to 15.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right? And I told you my dates of vacation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I've got you down for the 17th, and then I have you down for January 2nd; and then on the 7th we'll be back to our regular times</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

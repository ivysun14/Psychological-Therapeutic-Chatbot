<p>COUNSELOR: Grogan. Interview 12. Grogan. Interview 12.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:00:15.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:00:17.5) And in fact I think there's a sign on his door.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:00:21.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: There (inaudible at 0:00:23.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure (inaudible at 0:00:30.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it's not there anymore. I didn't even know (inaudible at 0:00:34.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pardon me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I taught a lot today. (inaudible at 0:00:48.3) I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feeling maybe you worked a lot (inaudible at 0:00:53.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I was jumping around. [0:00:57.1]</p>

<p>(inaudible from 0:00:58.6 to 0:01:35.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't — I'm (inaudible at 0:01:37.9) I was a movie called the Wild (inaudible at 0:01:41.5) (Laughs) It reminded me of the way I feel sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand. (inaudible at 0:01:52.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:01:53.1) No. He was (inaudible at 0:01:55.8) I don't know if he would have done that. [0:02:03.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:02:03.8) for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:02:05.8) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:02:07.8)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:02:54.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. All I can think about is money. [0:02:58.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:03:03.9) That sounds like a concern.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. It is. When I come back from Europe, I'm like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going to have like $600 left. I mean I have that all (inaudible at 0:03:22.4) That's what's bothering me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you only — when you come back from Europe, it's going to instant (inaudible at 0:03:35.2) or something (inaudible at 0:03:36.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like I'm — today I was saying when I come back, I'm going to have to get a job as a waitress or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. In order to support yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well (inaudible at 0:03:47.0) And I thought that was kind of ridiculous. I don't see why it's ridiculous. I feel that it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you shouldn't be waiting on tables (inaudible at 0:03:59.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. Like I didn't have to work. [0:04:01.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's all. Like I should have been smarter and saved more money, that's what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the more that I'm trying to save money these days —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The faster it goes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm spending a lot more money than and I'm just — I've been upset about this for a long time. And, that's all. That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Irritability.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I used to be real horrible about (inaudible at 0:04:35.0) and I'm not sure that I was (inaudible at 0:04:40.1) live on a lot less. And now all of the sudden, I'm not (inaudible at 0:04:51.6) like I used to. I used to spend enormous (inaudible at 0:04:54.7) horrible (inaudible at 0:04:56.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:04:59.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know where it's going. Up until a couple of months ago, at least I knew where it was going to be going out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you — it's kind of like you don't have any track of where money goes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't. And I certainly need to. I don't really —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like you woke up one morning and found out you had no (inaudible at 0:05:21.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I keep track (inaudible at 0:05:24.9) I mean I (inaudible at 0:05:27.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:05:27.0) Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I learned another thing is that the only times that I have any (inaudible at 0:05:43.5) is about money. And I think that's horrible. And I realized I was very (inaudible at 0:05:48.5) But I also think it's not — it shouldn't be worth having an argument about. It's like — but then I decided that money was — must have something to do with roles. And, I don't know. But I still get upset about it. It doesn't matter. I just tell myself not to. [0:06:11.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I got lost in the money and (inaudible at 0:06:17.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:06:19.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's kind of like the — I think because (inaudible at 0:06:34.2) about money and (inaudible at 0:06:35.6) because we went out to dinner. And he doesn't like to go out to dinner. Therefore he feels that — I'm not sure if he feels — I have to pay for it or I have to pay for (inaudible at 0:06:53.4) And I don't mind paying (inaudible at 0:06:58.3) sometimes. Then sometimes I do. Oh well. We go out to dinner. He asked me if I wanted to go out to dinner. Then I feel that he's inviting me out to dinner. [0:07:15.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I shouldn't have to pay anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the way I feel. And then when I find out that he expects me to pay then I've gotten angry. That's the only part.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you didn't expect that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then — I don't know. There's something though. I think that someday we could have a big fight about money. I do believe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I — what I had said about roles (inaudible at 0:07:43.4) like most of the time, he's in kind of a masculine role and I — that role (inaudible at 0:07:53.4) And then all of a sudden when it comes to money that doesn't exist anymore. It's (inaudible at 0:08:03.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:08:05.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like (inaudible at 0:08:12.5) And then all of a sudden (inaudible at 0:08:20.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:08:28.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:08:29.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of — if he's going have you (inaudible at 0:08:32.1) you're going to work around the house or do that kind of thing like that's - the least he can do is treat you like a woman when you go out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:08:42.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't mean to be horrible - like some - I don't want to pay my way or (inaudible at 0:08:51.0) Maybe that's — maybe I'd rather (inaudible at 0:08:53.4) rather than (inaudible at 0:08:59.1) find another (inaudible at 0:09:01.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But — [0:09:10.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well we didn't even (inaudible at 0:09:12.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you resent kind of all of the sudden waking up and finding out you're the one that's supposed to be there with the money when you go out. And then you thought it would be all right if you asked him to and could anticipate — expected to pay for.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that's how — yeah, what you're saying is correct.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe that's not right. I guess (inaudible at 0:09:39.3) Yeah. I'm not sure. If I thought that he was right then I would talk to myself about it. (Laughs) But I'm not sure that I (inaudible at 0:09:50.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not — you're not sure whether it's — what (inaudible at 0:10:02.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know if he's right. [0:10:03.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean but — in what way or -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. If he is like that I should — and it's not always — it's like (inaudible at 0:10:20.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know if he wants to talk about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't even know. It just seems like — I'm thinking that (inaudible at 0:10:36.2) sometimes he gives me money (inaudible at 0:10:41.3) Sometimes he gives me money of his own to hold. And he doesn't care if I spend it as long as like I spend it on (inaudible at 0:10:52.4) And, sometimes when we go out, he gives me money to hold and then I don't know what I spent. [0:11:07.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think — what I thought you were saying was something like you're confused with him. You don't know what to expect. Like (inaudible at 0:11:17.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like he has a bunch of (inaudible at 0:11:19.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You're right. Yeah. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Once I said something to him about making a system and he said no, that's not necessary. And that's about what he said (inaudible at 0:11:44.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like (inaudible at 0:11:47.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He doesn't know (inaudible at 0:11:52.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. And usually it isn't (inaudible at 0:11:58.0) I'm sure that there's (inaudible at 0:11:59.7) just building up. I'm sure that there is. [0:12:02.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you can see that blow up coming.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But I can (inaudible at 0:12:16.2) the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you kind of expect him to spend a certain amount —</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. It's just — I thought (inaudible at 0:12:47.1) What happens, I think, is that he'll spend a lot more money than what's supposed to be spent. And all of the sudden, he realizes that he's done this. And then he'll suddenly decide that he's not going to pay. Again, I don't know why this is happening. I tell myself (inaudible at 0:13:13.5) And I know like what I was saying, is that he probably hasn't spent most of his money on (inaudible at 0:13:26.1) Like maybe he spent it on buying himself stuff or (inaudible at 0:13:32.9) And I feel that (inaudible at 0:13:35.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:13:38.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like the fact that he's spent all the money on — well like he spent all the money on himself but like you're the one that winds up having to pay for it in some way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like whatever (inaudible at 0:13:58.7) spend on myself and if I feel I've spent too much on myself, it's true. I don't want to then go out and spend a lot of money going out on entertainment. [0:14:08.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if I feel like it's my turn to pay for (inaudible at 0:14:13.2) I mean I still would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't think he does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. It's like you can separate the two and say hey, I should put some more money into James and me because that's what's fair right now. Regardless of the fact that I overspent there or else — but like for him, he doesn't make that conscious thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that really (inaudible at 0:14:42.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel like you're taken advantage of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I know that I really — I'm not sure that this is right but I know that I feel that he should spend more money on me than I spend on him. And, he does. But sometimes I guess it's (inaudible at 0:15:07.7) I don't know. [0:15:09.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the money and how he does it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:15:15.8) and the thing is that I find (inaudible at 0:15:18.4) not to spend money. And, so (inaudible at 0:15:23.2) the money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think it's more (inaudible at 0:15:27.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? Like (inaudible at 0:15:29.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like all of the sudden I expect it to be —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like all of it's like matter of fact.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I — then I —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Without warning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I get resentful. I know I do because we're not married and we're living together. And (inaudible at 0:15:49.8) I know basically that I do all the work or almost all the work around the house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you've earned it in some way. [0:16:00.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And (inaudible at 0:16:01.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:04.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because nobody tells me to do the work. And nobody is saying to me —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He doesn't care.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. He (inaudible at 0:16:15.5) And it's not (inaudible at 0:16:22.7) like the laundry and (inaudible at 0:16:25.6) stuff like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But it's like (inaudible at 0:16:33.6) expected (inaudible at 0:16:34.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well now he does. But if I didn't do it; he doesn't expect me to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. So he doesn't expect you to do it because you ought to do it or —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. In fact a lot of times he tells me not to do something. Because he (inaudible at 0:16:54.6) to do it and then (inaudible at 0:16:56.1) that this is my fault I guess. (inaudible at 0:16:58.6) I can't stand it anymore and just do it. Probably being (inaudible at 0:17:07.2) [0:17:07.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's why you do what you do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then you say you shouldn't expect him to (inaudible at 0:17:22.5) because he doesn't particularly care if you do it to begin with. He doesn't want — you do it because you want to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I shouldn't feel like that. But I think I (inaudible at 0:17:36.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And that really feels like crumby to you. (inaudible at 0:17:46.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's how I feel. I feel that somehow I might be right but I don't know how. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I feel like I'm a daytime TV drama (inaudible at 0:18:01.0) I really do. And — [0:18:04.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. (inaudible at 0:18:06.0) It's really not extremely (inaudible at 0:18:13.0) probably important but it's the only thing I guess that we ever had (inaudible at 0:18:21.3) really a real system at all about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the kind of system that we have isn't really that great. But I'm — I know that I'm — I'm sure that he's probably resentful. (inaudible at 0:18:38.1) however it is that I feel about and I'm not clear how I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, however it is you feel, he thinks you're wrong. Yeah. But it also sounds like you're saying well, it's not a major — that the only source of friction. It's not a major one but you sort of see it getting worse. It's like an opening wedge or something. [0:19:06.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because there's nothing — it's very clear to me over time (inaudible at 0:19:13.8) And he's very much like that in his whole life (inaudible at 0:19:19.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of (inaudible at 0:19:21.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's very. So, that things like that bother me (inaudible at 0:19:27.4) he just pushes them out of the chair until the next time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like (inaudible at 0:19:31.5) things don't kind of stay with him and simmer.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't think so. But I'm sure that like the third time we had an argument was — there was more that was underneath it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know if I can talk to him. [0:20:06.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a — why is that (inaudible at 0:20:12.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I can talk to him about almost anything else. But I don't know if I can talk to him about that. Because I don't know — he doesn't want to talk about it because (inaudible at 0:20:30.5) And (inaudible at 0:20:39.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's so hard to talk with him about it when he doesn't want to hear about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And even if I said to him that it was bothering me, he (inaudible at 0:21:32.8) I don't know. I don't know what — he would feel that it was — I don't know. He's (inaudible at 0:21:43.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like (inaudible at 0:21:48.6) uncomfortable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe. Maybe. (inaudible at 0:22:00.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why he doesn't want to talk about it because he doesn't want to fight. [0:22:12.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I don't want to fight about it either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you won't bring it up because it feels like you fight about it. Is that -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I want to bring it up because I want (inaudible at 0:22:26.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't know what that is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't — I can't quite tell you. Because I'm not sure. He might be disgusted or he might be angry that I brought it up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or maybe he's like that because he's (inaudible at 0:22:46.3) Because lately, he thinks that it's horrible because (inaudible at 0:22:53.7) not necessarily. And he says that terrible for a person (inaudible at 0:23:05.7) But he feels that he's (inaudible at 0:23:08.5) And probably because maybe it's true that he's not (inaudible at 0:23:14.7) but he acts like he is. [0:23:17.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He acts like he's all right. What (inaudible at 0:23:24.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or correct about that. Like —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like his head is together on it. Yeah. Like he says it isn't but he here is acting like it doesn't bother him.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just do not get him. [0:24:04.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:24:06.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:24:11.1) is all right. It's the same things that I see in myself. It doesn't make it any better because (inaudible at 0:24:18.3) him. I'm not going to leave. Then I say to myself well, now I can discuss it with him because I don't (inaudible at 0:24:33.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This isn't going to change that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It' really hard for you to be able to talk with him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Probably about something (inaudible at 0:24:47.0) I think he must say — I don't know (inaudible at 0:24:53.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: However, I mean whatever the truth of it is; it sounds like anticipating him reacting negatively. Like doubts (ph) make it impossible for you to do anything about it. I mean you can talk about it until you're both blue in the face but (inaudible at 0:25:18.3) nothing. (inaudible at 0:25:20.0)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not (inaudible at 0:25:54.6) of me because I'm (inaudible at 0:25:58.2) throw me away because I know better. Oh. I don't know why I do it. Maybe I feel like one — maybe I feel like little bad things. I don't want any bad things. I guess. And, I don't — like (inaudible at 0:26:31.0) I don't think really would go away no matter what we say about it. Maybe they would. But I don't think (inaudible at 0:26:48.2) And I guess I don't want anything to be built up anyway. [0:26:51.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like if you introduce this resentful, he's going to harbor in some way. And like then (inaudible at 0:26:59.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:27:00.4) I'm saying that because I know that's the way I felt about (inaudible at 0:27:05.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like when Drew did it to you, it built up for you. You mean one after another.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. And I would be unaware of that unless I got — was very angry. And then I would think —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like when you were looking for ammunition or something you would always think —</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would never say —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it (inaudible at 0:27:36.0)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess little things happen just because you're a different person. I don't know. I must be wrong. [0:28:10.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wrong about what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I don't know. I really feel crumby. I don't know. I'm real — I'm more tired today than I think I've ever been. I just shouldn't be talking today. Like little things that we do (inaudible at 0:28:49.9) some things (inaudible at 0:28:55.7) We're different people. And most arguments don't make a lot of (inaudible at 0:29:00.0) And, I guess I feel that on the (inaudible at 0:29:08.4) things that I don't want to introduce — [0:29:10.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kind of going out of your way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it's almost — the way that (inaudible at 0:29:17.3) it's almost as if you have two strikes against you already in something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe just one. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. But it is like you irked him enough without —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:29:38.4) the more irk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Feels good not to (inaudible at 0:29:48.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it does. (inaudible at 0:29:52.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I believe that it's (inaudible at 0:29:58.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't mind it. I really don't care. [0:30:15.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:30:21.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:30:32.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think (inaudible at 0:30:41.0) because I just (Laughs) (inaudible at 0:30:44.7) I think about myself almost all the time now. I think I have — I — it's because I'm in therapy I know. And I talk about myself more. And I'm (inaudible at 0:31:25.0) not that I dislike it, it's just I feel that I'm terribly more boring. And I wonder but I guess (inaudible at 0:31:35.0) I was going to say that I'm (inaudible at 0:31:38.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:31:45.5) sounds like therapy then has made you more boring, self centered, reduced your perspective or something like that. [0:32:02.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it's the boring. But that's only once in a while. Self centered, I think, is (inaudible at 0:32:08.6) I mean at the present time — I mean I understand why but I know that I'm always thinking about myself now. (inaudible at 0:32:18.4) things like that. I don't know. I'm all — now I'm constantly reasoning with myself about why I'm doing something. I tell myself to stop it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes (inaudible at 0:32:42.2) because I don't stop.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sometimes it makes it worse.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes. Sometimes it's not. It's not that I have a problem. For a while I think it is — it is like I was depressed more. But I'm not so depressed.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:33:32.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About what? (inaudible at 0:33:39.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. (inaudible at 0:33:55.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:33:59.3)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:34:23.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:34:27.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. (inaudible at 0:34:28.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Those are (inaudible at 0:34:31.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sounds like a tea kettle. (Laughs) It's not bad though.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: One thing for sure that's bothering me now that I know — it never bothered me until — it did bother me but I didn't bother me in my waking. It was just about (inaudible at 0:35:41.3) I couldn't (inaudible at 0:35:42.5) I think it might be bad because I don't —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Like whether it's good or bad, it sounds like it's — you need to kind of push it away and you can't do that. (inaudible at 0:36:03.1) [0:36:03.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess I (inaudible at 0:36:06.9) really like understand (ph). I mean I'm not sure (inaudible at 0:36:17.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like it's (inaudible at 0:36:29.7) for you that it goes back to something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. I really do. I don't know about (inaudible at 0:36:36.5) I mean I don't even know what my parents — how they were with my (inaudible at 0:36:44.7) old enough that I was growing up. But I don't remember how my parents were with them about stuff. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:36:58.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I don't know about that. And probably my earliest experiences with men weren't good I'm sure. That's not — that was probably (inaudible at 0:37:13.1) They weren't good and I (inaudible at 0:37:15.0)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that like hard to talk about or just like (inaudible at 0:38:08.6) [0:38:09.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've told him not to talk about it. That's what's —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Is that -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But really a lot of girls like to talk a lot — but what do you do? (inaudible at 0:38:25.2) I think. I know that it (inaudible at 0:38:31.4) And it seems like I know that there's something in me that stops me from like (inaudible at 0:38:47.3) but I don't know (inaudible at 0:38:50.1) So I think that there's nothing (inaudible at 0:38:56.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I get what you're saying, it's like the fact that there are a lot of people with that problem. It makes you think — [0:39:07.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Almost that it's worse I think than if it was a —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:39:16.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't either. Because if it weren't just me, I'd think well, if you adopt the right attitude or something then you'll —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it were only you then there would be a chance to do something about it because it wouldn't be — if it were only you, it wouldn't be a fact of life. But the fact that it's so many people — happens with so many people makes you feel like you're (inaudible at 0:39:48.6) yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm not sure if that's completely true I guess. But I do (inaudible at 0:39:56.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:39:59.8]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I — what's (inaudible at 0:40:26.5) Why does that happen? (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I mean just like — that's like a specific question asked in a general way. Like —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know for you. I don't know —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything about you except that you had some experiences that you feel like that is making (inaudible at 0:40:58.1) That's the only thing I know about you. I can give you a general answer (inaudible at 0:41:03.8) how helpful that is. [0:41:07.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. See I don't know what it has to do with. If it has to do with like (inaudible at 0:41:23.5) I'm sure of it though. But I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you've had — what to do or like troublesome feelings for men in general.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm not always aware of it but I'm sure that I must. Otherwise I would be able — I feel. That's what I feel. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But — all right, let me get — so you think about it's not that you're aware of some feeling. Really all you're aware of is that you can't climax. And you (inaudible at 0:41:59.0) from that or -? [0:42:00.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know that say I hate men or don't touch me. I mean I'm not —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whatever (inaudible at 0:42:18.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm sure that — yeah, I am sure that there's something wrong because of that. Because I'm sure — I know that it's not physical because I can have —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Climaxes in every way except (inaudible at 0:42:36.5) And, so I'm sure that there's something. I mean I know (inaudible at 0:42:43.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:42:47.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like any other way but there's just like something that gets in the way or something that happens to you when you're (inaudible at 0:42:59.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I feel hopeful. I guess. [0:43:03.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hopeful but it just won't happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then like other times I don't have a problem. Sometimes I don't you know. (inaudible at 0:43:24.6) I'm not (inaudible at 0:43:32.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I (inaudible at 0:43:43.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like there's nothing that you can do or I can do that will change that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And get it over it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And sometimes I feel hopeful (inaudible at 0:43:58.5) [0:44:02.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like (inaudible at 0:44:14.3) easier to just kind of expect nothing to happen. (inaudible at 0:44:21.1)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:45:04.4) I hadn't thought about that. I'm sure that it must. [0:45:08.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like you — like (inaudible at 0:45:12.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the hypothesis that you're playing around with is (inaudible at 0:45:19.8) is something that you feel pretty guilty about with James.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Not that I'm aware of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. That's like another thing. Like how you're feeling like —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. (inaudible at 0:45:37.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Say well if it's guilt than maybe I should (inaudible at 0:45:41.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel guilty?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that I'm aware and when I said I was (inaudible at 0:45:58.5) I guess (inaudible at 0:46:01.0) There was some point anyways. But I probably did feel guilty about having (inaudible at 0:46:12.9) And I say to myself that I didn't. And I would say that I don't feel guilty about anything. I would (inaudible at 0:46:28.2) I would say that but (inaudible at 0:46:32.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And probably — maybe that's just (inaudible at 0:46:37.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I see (inaudible at 0:46:40.4) But it sounds like you're saying that maybe I never really had examined how I felt guilty about (inaudible at 0:46:51.2) I never resolved it. And maybe I still (inaudible at 0:46:55.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But not likely. [0:47:02.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm trying to think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think like and I don't know about (inaudible at 0:47:19.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:47:22.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pardon me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't really remember things like that. I guess like I know (inaudible at 0:47:32.1) I don't know how (inaudible at 0:47:43.1) finding all (inaudible at 0:47:58.7) I had (inaudible at 0:48:02.2) But together, we were wondering about this. It's like ask my mother (inaudible at 0:48:11.5) And so, now we knew how it was done. But we asked my mother very clearly (inaudible at 0:48:24.4) My parents, they had their fights because they had two children. And her parents (inaudible at 0:48:30.8) people. And (inaudible at 0:48:33.2) three or four times. (inaudible at 0:48:35.0) and it wasn't that often. So I know that I thought was (inaudible at 0:48:40.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like as long as you can remember knowing about sex (ph) like it's —</p>

<p>PATIENT: See I laugh at that. But I do feel (inaudible at 0:48:52.7) I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe that's (inaudible at 0:48:54.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like part of you is (inaudible at 0:48:59.9) and funny and stuff. But you feel like you also have (inaudible at 0:49:05.0) whether it's — that's all there is to it. [0:49:07.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean like if I still (inaudible at 0:49:10.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I — maybe that's true. (inaudible at 0:49:17.2)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now I don't — I mean for a long time (inaudible at 0:49:49.2) I don't know. I don't think that sometimes (inaudible at 0:50:01.4) tell myself (inaudible at 0:50:04.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. If it's not coming you, you give yourself a pep talk or something. [0:50:11.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I (inaudible at 0:50:11.7)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it — excuse me. I'm (inaudible at 0:50:35.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. No. I didn't mean like that. (inaudible at 0:50:44.7) I'm sure that before probably something (inaudible at 0:50:59.2) probably something to do with Drew. But I know that there were times that I used sex just to express physical affection. I don't know what that has to do with it though. [0:51:13.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But — well, no I don't know either. But that sounds like seeing it kind of as a weapon or a way of — weapon's not quite right but like a thing to fold out (inaudible at 0:51:28.3) like territory.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know if that's really — there might be (inaudible at 0:51:36.3) I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that's the only way anybody could -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think — yeah, things like that I think are true. Like I probably (inaudible at 0:51:57.9) like he's — I think (inaudible at 0:52:02.0) too that I know — I'm sure that I felt that nobody really wanted me. That's because of (inaudible at 0:52:13.3) I'm sure that had something to do with (inaudible at 0:52:17.6) too. [0:52:19.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:52:22.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because maybe I didn't (inaudible at 0:52:31.7) like it or maybe I felt guilty about doing it. Or even when I was (inaudible at 0:52:37.8) I still heard the same thing (inaudible at 0:52:41.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, I probably do feel guilty about it. But (inaudible at 0:52:51.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was like you may have felt guilty about it but that was mostly a part of it. [0:53:02.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I — yeah, maybe it was. But at the time, I thought —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Like better to be — feel guilty and real territorial than to feel lonely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's times when I found that intercourse (inaudible at 0:53:29.8) like intercourse was just what I (inaudible at 0:53:34.5) I didn't care if I did or not. It was easier to do it than just get rid of him. And, I'm kind of — at the time, I was — told myself I was scared when I — I'm probably saying things like that really now because it's bad or I feel sorry for myself. And it's like the (inaudible at 0:53:58.9) dumb. Or, maybe I was telling myself (inaudible at 0:54:10.3) I have (inaudible at 0:54:13.2) I think a lot of (inaudible at 0:54:14.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like you're not sure exactly what it is but you're saying you're sure of the feelings that you have (inaudible at 0:54:25.0) feeling you have now but the feelings that you had then were sort of a variance with what you were telling yourself even if you're not sure exactly what those feelings were.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. But I always (inaudible at 0:54:35.9) telling myself. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I must have some of those same feelings now. I'm sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like at the time you were believing them but you're pretty sure they're (inaudible at 0:55:01.3) taking their toll now. [0:55:04.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually (inaudible at 0:55:04.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know (inaudible at 0:55:30.9) It really didn't — I don't know how much it had to do with (inaudible at 0:55:37.7) Like it was (inaudible at 0:55:41.2) to think about myself (inaudible at 0:55:45.4) like being — what's (inaudible at 0:55:52.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wishing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or something like that. Now maybe nobody else knew but I did. In my own head (inaudible at 0:56:00.1) making it sound like that but I did I'm sure. [0:56:05.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:56:06.2) made you feel like not different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe. But I thought — I knew I was (inaudible at 0:56:22.8) because I was bad. (inaudible at 0:56:27.3) because I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's probably made me resentful too. I mean I was building that up myself. Like I'd go to bed with somebody and I must have known. Somebody I didn't care about (inaudible at 0:57:22.0) And then I would probably resentful for not (inaudible at 0:57:30.2) or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More like a role.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I (inaudible at 0:57:35.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes you —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not tell myself that I was (inaudible at 0:57:39.8) I was telling myself it was okay (inaudible at 0:57:42.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:57:49.3) Like on the one hand, you say it is cool like — [0:58:01.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:58:01.9) (Laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And on the other hand, it's like there was more in it for you though. Like a whole thing about you like to be cared for or something. And then when you weren't, like the guy didn't come back then you get real angry or hurt or something. (inaudible at 0:58:30.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know about (inaudible at 0:58:32.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure that I was hurt. I feel like I was hurt now. Looking back, I really feel like I was hurt a lot. And I feel as if (inaudible at 0:58:47.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But like that really (inaudible at 0:58:50.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It does. It's like (inaudible at 0:58:58.6) really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say that again? It's like — [0:59:04.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I was like — like looking at it (inaudible at 0:59:06.2) and saying you're real stupid. You did a lot of stupid things. It's different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like when you look back at that (inaudible at 0:59:28.6) like you really seem kind of (inaudible at 0:59:36.5) and vulnerable and all those (inaudible at 0:59:41.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I suppose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was wondering what made you feel (inaudible at 0:59:46.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking I still think that about myself. (Laughs) That's all because that's stupid. But I don't know. I don't know about (inaudible at 0:59:56.1) I don't (inaudible at 1:00:00.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [1:00:04.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't come on Thursday. Can I come tomorrow instead of Friday? No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tomorrow instead of Thursday you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I can't (inaudible at 1:00:15.0) but I thought we were going to (inaudible at 1:00:17.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:00:19.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You can come tomorrow if you want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Like (inaudible at 1:00:30.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What time do you (inaudible at 1:00:34.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Yeah. I have school. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What time (inaudible at 1:00:38.0) your school?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:00:40.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that means you get here by?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:00:44.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me tell you what (inaudible at 1:00:50.1) Okay. We're all moving. (inaudible at 1:00:55.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:00:57.1) Now they tell us (inaudible at 1:01:02.5) can't tell you in advance (inaudible at 1:01:04.5) You can't make an appointment next day (inaudible at 1:01:08.3) [1:01:09.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:01:08.6) Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the man is going to call me before he's coming. So it may turn out that he's going to call me (inaudible at 1:01:18.5) at 4:00 p.m. that he's coming.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm not sure. Like that's a bit of a possibility that that would be the case. I doubt it. I don't think they start jobs at 4:00 p.m.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:01:32.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 1:01:34.4) So I think that's a good time. I think 4:00 p.m. is a good time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

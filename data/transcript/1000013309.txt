<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not happy today. I'm not feeling very well. I don't really feel like this is helping me. I feel like I'm just coming in here, I might as well just be going normally without the video, which makes me very uptight because I don't see what it has to do with short term therapy. I don't feel like there's anything worth working on that's going to make me change. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let's talk about that some more. I guess I'm feeling a little stuck, I guess, in working with you as well. I understand, I think there hasn't been much of a progress in our work together. I don't know if that's what you're picking up on. And we haven't focused on feelings as much as we could. And I'm feeling a little bit stuck in the sense that, I think it's a few different things and one is difficulty focusing with you. And also just kind of, I think I'm a bit... feeling a little bit... I've been watching the tapes, a little bit defensive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like she's going to come in again and say, I'm not confidant or how the therapy's not good. I think that's been affecting my work with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like that's a dependency problem on your part. I don't think that has to do with me. I'm starting to think that it could be just the way this is set up is not... it's very haphazard. It's not necessarily your fault, but I think it's this program. I don't feel there's anything short term about it. It's just got a time thing on it. I really feel that there's no plan and there's no real focus for helping me focus. I feel like we're not really doing anything. I feel like it's just a very rambling kind of thing, and all it's doing is I'm feeling humiliated about being on videotape, and I'm feeling like, what's so different about this than my other therapy except I get to feel hung up about being videotaped and nothing's happening. I feel good sometimes and I don't know if it's just because I'm coming in and talking, or if it has anything to do with it because I'm so into, I want to make changes, and so I've got it in my head. Because I was feeling good and some things happened that didn't make feel so good, and also I'm not really doing anything to change my life. I'm not making any more money, I'm not moving. Nothing is happening. I am stuck, and I came here to get unstuck. I kind of resent that it would be my fault if you feel a certain way, or you feel stuck. I'm stuck. [03:21]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I think we need to do is maybe come up with a new way that you and I can work together that will be profitable for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would like that. I'd really like that but I just feel that now we're making it up. I just feel that I would like to be involved in something that there's a plan or there's something that I do need that's definite. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like this thing that my friend didn't even tell me about, that this woman had this thing mapped out where she did this. It's not that I want to do that in particular. You know, they took it from there and that was a direction. I don't know, I just feel really directionless. I feel like I'm directionless. And then I feel like I can't even talk about my dreams in here because you don't do dreams.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a direction; I don't do dreams.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I'm having a lot of dreams. And I feel like since I can't really... I don't know it seems talking about reality I can't really get a handle on my feelings because I'm always doing other things other than feeling my feelings, or when I start to feel them I have to cough them up somehow. If it's coming out in my dreams, then that's a place to start from.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If what are, your feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, that's fine. I never said we couldn't talk about them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you said you don't, so I'm not going to talk about something... I'm not going to get into something that's not your specialty because at least I want to feel like you can handle me, or handle it. I mean, I don't feel like you're incompetent or anything, that's not it. It's not about you. It's about what's going on with this.</p>

<p>[interruption 05:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorry about that. [05:29]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's all right. Something like that happens every week too. [inaudible at 05:36] I had a bad feeling about it. I had to wait for an elevator and I've been dying to go to bed and I've got to wait for this elevator. And then somebody's doing a smart-ass remark to me. I mean, I just feel like there is a lot going on with me and yet, I don't know, I just feel like you and I haven't even begun to really work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way I feel that way too. I find, I don't know, I guess my wish is that we could just do the work.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What is the work? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, well, so what is that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well for you to bring in things that have happened to you and are happening to you and for us to focus on how they make you feel and how the feelings influence...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why is talking about this part of it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Talking, what do you mean? I think it is part of it. I think it is part of it. Are you asking why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm asking exactly what you just answered, talking about what I'm bringing up here. Is that part of it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're feeling really angry about me tonight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm feeling really angry about a lot of things, and I'm feeling angry about... it started out with this thing that I went to last night which I just shouldn't have gone to. It was a really stupid thing. It reminded me of when I lost my apartment and it reminded me of not being able to... what was the thing? I went to a community board meeting. I went for my parents because they're planning on opening up a group home right in a house behind mine. I don't care if there's runaway youths  living there. I don't care about that; I wouldn't begrudge anybody that. I just think I don't like that they're going to have people working in there that they change a one-way street. And there's a lot of things that I didn't get up and say what I really wanted because it was in a community board meeting, I was nervous, I didn't know what to say. I felt like, I'm not going to be a hero I'm not going to change anybody's mind probably, and I didn't want to come off as a prejudiced person. Because it's not that I'm prejudiced against that, but I guess I was feeling protective of my parent's house. I felt very... like here I am once again not saying anything, not knowing what to say. I hadn't really prepared myself to be there and I just felt very humiliated by the whole experience, because of course we lost, and that most neighbors didn't show up but everybody showed up at the meeting we had. I've already wasted two nights that I could have been working on music or something else. And it turned out to be a very painful experience for me. Another one of these situations where I'm just like... like I'm helpless. It's like I could have just been sitting there, just twiddling my thumbs. I mean it just made no sense for me to be there and I wasted another night of my life and I spent two nights of my life with this where I had no say really and It didn't matter. And then I ended up being humiliated and looking like some kind of a bigot.[09:15]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you felt powerless. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, very powerless. But also mostly not just powerless, but a powerless asshole. I'm feeling kind of asshole which is not me. And I didn't get my side heard and I just ended up being lost like a loser and being an angry loser and a sore loser. I'm very resentful that these people all won and that they have their shit together, they all looked good and I'm just the kid hanging around at my parent's house. And I only have failed situations I never have gains it seems to me. And I don't know what talking about my feelings is going to do. It's just my feelings. I'm obsessing about this. I could hardly sleep, and then when I fell asleep this morning I was dreaming about ghosts in the house and stuff I can't even relax at my parent's house when I'm alone there. I had a very hard time sleeping there. I'm always hearing noises. I'm not getting enough sleep. And then I came home and I ate food, which I didn't need to eat anything, but it's like I'm lonely and I guess I'm also... but I just had the feeling I had to eat I think just to comfort myself. So I don't know what discussing my feelings is going to do for me. I don't know how it's really helping me. My feelings are just....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, they're just... I don't know what they are. I don't know, they just don't seem to help me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's so painful?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no, I'm not really... I don't know whether I'm in touch with them or not, but they don't seem to help me. They just get in my way because I don't know how to get to any really rational side of life or a part of life that's going to be helpful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about having gone to that meeting and feeling like a little child when everybody else seemed to have their act together? [12:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just felt very embarrassed, but I feel that I embarrassed myself further by not... because I was kind of hostile to somebody, but I never really stuck up for myself. For instance, I didn't get up in front of the community and say, my failing is because I didn't have anything prepared and I didn't know what to say. I was very intimidated by the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you wish had in looking back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I really didn't know what to say and I didn't feel I was going to sway them in any way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel now thinking about being powerless?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very angry, very angry. I'm angry at myself, I'm angry at them, I'm very angry at the people that were there, I'm angry at my parents. That I did this for them and that I ended up getting... that I wasted another night, and it was for them and they weren't there and nobody else really came.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you were there doing all the work and ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I wasn't getting the work but I was getting the negative attention. I didn't do any work, I just showed up basically. And then I put my name down, twice he called me and twice I declined because they picked us first, the people who were defending themselves, to say something when nothing else had been discussed yet. It was like being thrown to the wolves.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would have had to prepare a whole case.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I needed to, to make a difference. This is even before they took a vote, before they discussed the thing. They had people come up and discuss the... it was weird. I had never been to anything like that before. It felt like a closed clique. The guy who's supposed to be on our side voted against us. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 14:46]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I just shouldn't have bothered going. Other people who own theirs didn't go. I don't even own the house. And the thing that's upsetting to me is I'm so upset with this and it's not even my house. And I don't know what I'm going to do for the winter. I'm really upset about living at my parent's house. They're coming back next week. I don't have my own place, I don't have my own money, I'm making terrible money. I was down to five bucks this morning because I didn't really take care of my money. I'm spending a lot of money I don't have. And I'm just not taking care of myself well enough. And then I get to look like this fucking rich person when I show up at this stupid thing because it was like I was trying to protect the interests of that house. It's not me at all. Like I'm always being totally misrepresented in some way. I mean, it's like what do you think of the snow falling this morning even. That I'm angry and I'm thinking of my own thing and everybody's like... these guys are getting off the elevator, they're taking their time getting off the elevator and they see a whole bunch of people waiting, somebody in a wheelchair. You know, we've been waiting and waiting and waiting for the elevator here. So then, this person with a wheelchair and these women with... and these guys start walking on instead of letting her go first. I was standing there to let her go, right, so then everybody's in this jumble and I have to get on first an I'm like stuck in the middle so I like go, excuse me to this guy because I'm getting off right away. He goes, oh I see you're in a hurry this morning. And I'm like, oh well I'm glad you noticed. Thanks, I am. But I've got to be this schmuck; I've got to be the schmuck. And that makes me feel like that too when I come in here, oh, I'm the schmuck because I have needs and I'm coming here and I feel like... I mean I feel good some of the time and I do realize that I'm coming in here, I'm in a place where I'm upset, and then I'm lumping stuff together too. I mean, maybe it has been good being in here. On the other hand, by the time I got... I don't know if it's the real feeling or if I'm just taking it out on it, because I would prefer to feel good most of the time than get into all this shit. I don't know if this is really good for me. And I hate to say it and I feel bad. I feel like I'm hurting your feelings when I say it. It's not about you, it's about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you're hurting my feelings when you say...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like when you say you feel stuck too and you feel... I don't know, what is that supposed to mean when you say you feel stuck? Is that supposed to mean that you're feeling stuck because I'm stuck? Or is it that you feel stuck because... I don't know it makes me feel like you're saying that because I'm not doing something for you. And here I am paying money. I'm part of a study, and I feel like... [18:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me stop you for a second. I want to apologize if I made you feel criticized by me. Like somehow you're not doing something that you should be doing. That is not my intention. I just was thinking, gee, maybe we need to decide a slightly different way of relating in here so that I can be and you can be more helpful to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. I just feel like I don't understand what is short-term therapy about it. Can you tell me what is differentiating this between any other therapy in short term, and why this would be more helpful to me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's focusing on a few things as opposed to kind of being all over the place like a lot of therapies are. It's focusing on feelings and understanding them so that the work is a little more focused.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't feel like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't either. That's what I was saying. And that's why I think we need somewhere along the way talk about how we can help you to be focused. How I can be more focused too. I take that responsibility.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel like that's something that you guys have to decide. I would imagine that that's part of a plan that you've got. Or watch your video and all, for taking this I would imagine that somebody could figure out something. Because I have no clue; I don't have any idea of what it should be, and that's what I come for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have any idea what would help you to, say, talk more about your feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm not comfortable talking about my feelings but I mean I experience them I suppose but I don't know if that's good enough or how that's going to help me to change, or help my situation to change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, all I can say is that I think it will, but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what makes you think that? Do you see people change?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I wouldn't do it otherwise. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know, you could say anything of course. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean of course that's how you feel. That doesn't mean that that's going to work for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if it's going to work for you. What are you thinking about?[21:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just thinking about all these things because I don't want to get hung up on this. I'd like to work out something. I feel like time is going very fast and we're not accomplishing anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to get hung up on what? You say, I don't want to get hung up on this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what we're talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean about us?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes and that this isn't working. If you want to talk about feelings...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I have a feeling that talking about us might be doing work too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, I also have this thing that, like, if it doesn't work out with us too at any time I'm going to be called and it's not going to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think that's going to happen again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What some new therapist?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You only get one switch.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you would like more focus, more of a...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thread...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Excuse me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thread.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A thread, right. And it feels frustrating to you, you feel angry and a bit schmucky that I have not been able to provide that thread for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know [inaudible at 22:25]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't like being seen in the video, especially if it may not work out. It may just be more to my humiliation to open up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's more humiliation in public.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I feel that I am giving a lot. I don't feel that I'm that closed when I start talking. I think I am cooperative.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, did you hear me say that? That you weren't cooperative?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel like I'm being difficult. And also I don't feel good about being angry. I feel, well isn't this a place where I'm supposed to be able to be angry. I guess I feel like I'm not really allowed to feel my feelings. Like I'm being told to feel them and I'm being told not to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's interesting. Yeah, I think you've got a point there, but I guess sometimes, when you express your feelings say about the therapy and about me, it gets to me. It gets to me. And that I think I let it, you don't do this to me, I let it affect the work that I do because we spend a lot of time talking about how difficult this situation is for you. You're being honest. You're absolutely right; I think you should express those feelings, but those feelings happen to affect me. [24:25]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, it could be too that I do have a degree of power about me and intelligence and stuff, and it's very possible that I use it in safe situations. Do you know what I mean? Like in a situation like this. I mean I don't know if that's really true or anything. You know, if I could give myself that credit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what do you mean? I need to understand a little bit more. I'll tell you my experience.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it's when I feel safe or something, you know? Like these feelings I'm dumping on you, instead of like having gone in last night and said stuff where I would have felt... do you know what I mean? Like where I could have spoken about my feelings there and gotten maybe... at least have felt like I tried. I did something where I don't feel like that now. So everywhere else I've got to act out this like powerful person that's not really powerful. It's like this safe place. It's like on the subway - I can hate everybody there, be angry. I can be on the elevator and be this safe person, this big shot. Or I can come in here. But I just can't really do it in real life and come out and take a stand for myself, really support myself. I have all the veneer of somebody who can be powerful and strong, but I don't really have the... I don't really have the stuffing of that kind of a person, I'm not really being... so I could let go of all these other things, I really was working on myself in this area so I can make money and take care of myself or find my own home or something. But now I just have trappings. It's like oh, lovely, I'm living in my parents house. So it's like safe for me to feel a certain way and pretend I've got money or this or that, when I'm just coasting in a sense. And I've got a job, you know, I'm not making enough... I'm not really making changes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are the tears about? What is that about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About frustration, I don't know, sadness. I don't know what they are. It just gives me a lot of pain to... You always ask me that and now I feel stupid for crying. Like I wasn't allowed to. [27:34]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I asked that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That you pointed it out to me, now I'm self-conscious about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I noticed you stopped crying when I asked you about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what it's about; I wish I knew. I guess it's about what I was talking about, that I'm in a lot of pain about the fact that I'm this like fake person. I make like a big shot, but I just cannot seem to really help myself in life. I don't know, about helplessness, hopelessness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say that again, I can't seem to help myself in life?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just can't seem to help myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you feeling now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Inaudible at 28:53] and I'm just really embarrassed about it. And I feel really helpless. I have no idea what to do. I feel like I'm running around like a chicken without a head. I guess I'm just... I'm scared. I don't know how I'm going to help myself. I don't know how I'm going to begin to. Everything's the same, the same; I don't really help myself. And then I have good days and I just forget about all my problems, and then stuff happens and I'm filled with terror. I kept dreaming about these old ghosts showing up, these things. This gate I had gotten rid of last winter that was broken, my parents insisted on keeping, and why didn't they just spring for a new gate. I threw it out and I had the dream this morning. It kept coming back; this ghost was putting this gate in places. Like I was trying to get ready for work in the dream and the gate kept showing up or things, and I had no control over these ghosts. Also there were these little baby shoes on my bed. It was like really weird. But then I was so terrorized, and usually I'm not scared in the morning when the light of the day comes, I'm not scared. But I was even scared, it was light out, it was time to get up and I was scared to get out of bed and I was really scared. I guess I'm just really scared that I'm not going to do anything; I'm not going to make changes. Everything to me is like more acting out and more not changing. [31:02]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really finding out I guess; you think that this is it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Inaudible at 31:20] the tissues, but thanks. I feel like... I guess I'm mad at myself. I don't know what to do; I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel very sad though listening to the pain you're going through.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You do? You don't feel I'm just like a spoiled child? That I have everything; that I have nothing to complain about? I don't feel like I really have anything. There's this song, you know, standard God Bless the Child, and I like it. I always sing it. Ever since I've known the song I wanted it to be my song but it couldn't represent me because I don't have my own, and I don't really work with having my own and I'm stuck and I don't know how to get unstuck. But then I've made strides through life and I feel I'm doing better in a lot of ways, but I feel like there's stuff I'm really not taking care of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that stuff that you're not taking care of? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Everything in my life. I'm not making decisions about what I'm going to do to make money, where I'm going to move, how I'm going to make money, how I'm going to really help myself. And I'm feeling desperate now because my parents are coming back next week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I kind of feel like you're asking me for help, like to do some of this stuff. I don't know, maybe it's my imagination.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't feel like it at all. I feel like I'm asking for help with how to help myself. Maybe that that's what I thought I was going to get. I suppose if we're going to be talking about these feelings, and then I suppose it's going to be that I'm just going to be talking about my feelings and figuring out from my feelings what I should do. Why would you say that you would feel that I'm asking you to do things? [</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It could just be me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well if it's coming from me, I'm just curious to know what about it, about what I'm saying we're doing? I mean, do you think that's why you asked me why I'm crying? [34:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I really just usually want to understand where the sadness is when you cry. There's no ulterior motive. But sometimes you say when you don't know what to do and you need some help or that... it could be my own issue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But why isn't it legitimate to ask somebody who's in a helping profession for some kind of help? And I'm not asking for your advice necessarily, but something that's going to get me to help myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is doing what you're doing I think. Here. I don't know. I'll have to think about why I feel that way. I need more time to figure that one out for myself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I'm also curious to know how is this going to help me. What feelings of mine are getting in the way, I mean in the present at least, that are not helping me to help myself better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Isn't that why it doesn't work?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm lost.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel there are feelings that are...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'm saying that your contention in this therapy is that my feelings now are getting in my way, but I guess, I don't know. What are you saying? I don't know. What I want to know is how [inaudible at 36:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're understanding that you're feeling more? Because new possibilities in understanding how we get along. What I can do for you and what I can't. And be here while you go through the pain and help understand it and in doing that the pain isn't so great later on. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible at 36:44] It just seems like too much to me; it seems like a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. You know what I think it is? I think it's coming from me. I think that when I say, I think you're asking me to take care of you or solve a problem it's that I see so much pain in you, and I want to be able to do that, and I can't. You know what I'm saying, like solve your problems? I look back at some of the tapes that we have, I realize I get very kind of directed towards you sometimes. More than I do in this approach normally and I think it's because I'm kind of like, man, she's really got a lot of pain, she's really... like I said I'd like to be able to do something, but that's not the way to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to say I'm sure that's what it is with you, but I think, I don't know how most people come off and stuff, but maybe my effect is that of somebody who... maybe it's that I'm more dramatic than other people and I'm coming off in a more meaningful kind of a way than anybody else. Maybe that's why you would get hooked in. But I feel like that's what I feel about you. Do you know what I mean? That's the first thing I noticed about you was you have this way about you that's very over-emotive. That's why I said, were you an actor, in the beginning. I remember we had this discussion. You said, yeah I was. I think that... I feel like sometimes we could be hooked into each other in that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could be true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and I feel funny saying that in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you feel funny?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I just feel uncomfortable about that and on top it's like a sexual kind of a thing, being hooked in and, you know... You know, where, like, some people have to be drawn out, I probably don't in a certain way, but I could be cutting off in a certain way. I don't know, maybe what's going on inside is different on the outside too. And maybe even everything that I'm... maybe when you ask me what you're feeling and it stops me maybe I am full of shit about crying. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was pretty real to me though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems pretty real to me too. I guess I just want to... I mean there's stuff... I guess I don't want to have to get into the feeling stuff because I don't want to become like this... I'm always like my feelings it seems like, and I'm not being rational about it. I'm not really like getting my shit together, not like taking steps or deciding well I'm going to go to school or do this or that. Or I'm going to step up my job thing. I mean, and sometimes everything's all right, but then when it's bad it's very, very bad. [40:43]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about having cried in here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, at first I felt good about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Part of me, I don't know if this is in my head or what, I feel like it probably feels good to me to humiliate myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you felt good but also humiliated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean I felt good about being able to share that with you and I felt like, well happy to get rid of this. For myself I felt I was expressing myself and feeling my feelings. I felt like I was doing what I was supposed to do. And I felt good about that. I was being a good patient.</p>

<p>So I feel good about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also, like, I did because I knew I would probably cry and I felt like good about that. Why do you ask?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just wondered how it was for you to share those feelings in front of me and with me. That's really all. I wonder how it feels to you to be so honest with your feelings, and so up front in front of somebody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The committee.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I felt like, you know, that's what I'm here for. [43:02]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm thinking about how I'm just feeling. I feel very... I think part of my wanting to... I mean, I say like, gee, I want to make it all better, and I want to give you some direction, which I know I really can't. That's something you have to come up with. It's because I do feel very connected to you when you're talking about this feeling stuck at home and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what's interesting about that, is that when you do feel... because it's funny, I feel like I've been to a lot of therapists and stuff and, when you start crying and stuff you get a lot of sympathy, you know? And I felt you had that, and I was kind of pissed off because I felt like, oh sure we're getting sympathy now. Because it's easy to sit there and give anybody sympathy, anybody can. I mean it's good to hear that you really feel... you felt connected did you say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, that's the word yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, part of me thinks, oh it's bullshit. And I guess maybe you're right. Maybe I do want you to fix it for me. Maybe I do want... maybe I am coming here for you to give me the answers and to help. I mean now that I think of that... I figure well, it's an empty, oh great he's feeling sympathetic. Sure give me sympathy. I need some answers here and you're giving me sympathy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're getting a little pissed off, like man he's giving me sympathy and I want answers.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm fine, give me sympathy but do you need a PhD for that? I do the same thing in my job and I don't have a PhD. Of course you'd think that I was working towards one it's taking me so long to get a degree just earning a normal amount of money in my job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Get an honorary one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you felt pissed when I said that. Like, I want more and I'm not... give me some answers.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like now what? I mean great, okay, I'm feeling you're just giving me sympathy, all right, fuck, I'm still in the fucking condition I was in before only I feel a little better. Big deal! Next week when something else bad happens I'm going to feel shitty again. And between the feeling good I had my high moments, like I actually had a good week in a lot of ways, and then this thing came up last night and I can't let go of it. I'm obsessed. And I don't know if it's possible that's because I was feeling so good too that this happened. And I'm grabbing on to that bad feeling and not remembering the good, because I was feeling very good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's interesting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I used to talk about that with my last therapist, Cheryl, where I would forget. You know, I just would forget the good stuff. And I mean this one thing became so big last night. I was feeling... I had a wonderful week. 46:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good to know. That's great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how I'm going parlay it into money and career. I mean I'm freaked out. I feel good about some things. One of the reasons is my parents are still away but they're coming back next week and I'm prepared to be in a very deep funk next week. Just be aware of it. I think it's like being a little spoiled. Like a spoiled child I'm not getting my way. And maybe I can get used to the thing and maybe I can gain your sympathy too getting into the painful part instead of... I think I said I'm being a sore loser. I've become a sore loser about this thing last night. I've got a really bad attitude about all this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, that's probably, when I said at the beginning about feeling a little stuck sometimes, I think that's where it comes from in part. Like if I give sympathy, it's not enough. I didn't do the right thing, you know? You want answers; you want more. And if I offer something more direct like, no, that's not really good enough, so then I don't know what my options are any more. I have to kind of just... well, what I do anyway, I don't have to, is just sit here and listen and then feel that's not doing anything. I guess you know where to go. And it takes away my [inaudible at 48:09], gee I really did feel a little sympathy before, you know, understanding.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't take away your [inaudible at 48:17].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, yeah you're right. Well it's not good enough... well, you could say like [inaudible at 48:25]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, right, I'm saying sympathy is nice but what can it do for it. And also it all right, okay I can get sympathy from people, but you're a professional. I have to get more than sympathy from you. And also I just feel it's like you did this thing that to me was typically a therapist's reaction to my being in pain, which is the voice gets lower and you take on the demeanor of somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel a little insulted by that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, doing a typical therapy thing. A little voice in my head said, wait, I do that in real life too. [49:16]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know that, and I do it too and maybe I don't totally buy it when I do it. Maybe I could just be relating it to this... maybe I'm relating it to my experience with my parents or something. I felt like they could be sympathetic but it didn't really matter that... I don't know what it is. Maybe I wasn't really getting real help. Even as a young person it didn't sink in in a certain way, you know, like the sympathy. For some reason I'm not that affected by somebody saying they care because I guess I need to see action. I don't want to just hear. I do it too, but like... I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want action from me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want something where I'm going to come up with it. I guess maybe for you to show me the way. I guess I'm afraid of getting too caught up in my feelings and not enough in the total picture of life, which is feelings and... see feelings don't seem to matter in the real world. My feelings don't seem to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean in terms of like having a course of action?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe. [51:04]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean, they don't matter? I didn't understand that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what I mean, but I just feel lost right now. I really don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am going to ask [inaudible at 51:37]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just feels like a lot and I feel like the session's about over and I'm just worried that we get into this place a lot of times where I get lost. Maybe I was just full of shit, whatever I was saying. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it wasn't making sense what I was saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just in the last few minutes? It's okay with me if you don't always make sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it's just hard to get into feelings and then get back into the outside world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is hard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is real hard, I know. It can be real intense here and then you have to go out and pretend like everything's in control. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. Or hopefully, not necessarily if you really get into this process here you don't have to pretend. But on the other hand, a lot about life is... or you want to be able to not pretend but somehow integrate life and feelings. I'd like it to work for me. I would like to come in and participate in this openly and eagerly from the beginning. I feel like it's going to help me. Maybe it will. I just feel like I'm in a lot of pain now, and I guess maybe I just feel like the same way I felt when I was in toilet training. I'm always bringing that up, you know. I'm feeling very scrutinized and watched like something was expected to come out of me. Maybe that's what I feel a little bit like. It's just hard to answer, to tie things up maybe, make it neat. [54:22]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And get a neatness, yeah. I don't know about you but I think life's pretty sloppy and messy. I like it too when things feel nice and neat, but they don't a lot of the times. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think this is a really big issue with me because being brought up watching movies and TV where everything is neat and done and done perfectly and stuff and everything is figured out. It's not like that in real life and it just feels shitty a lot. There's no music playing over the credits and nothing to make nice. It's like, I'm stuck with shitty feelings a lot, and good feelings a lot too but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This might be me again, but are you looking to me to make things neat. Is that another thing I'm not doing for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You and this program I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean at the end of this session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Well, maybe. I'm also nervous about, I feel like you don't watch the time and that I have to remind you and tell you. I've noticed a few times that we've run over in the past. I think we did. Well I run over in my job sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess it just has me a little bit nervous and not taken care of. Maybe I am looking for you to be perfect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or to take care of you better. That's what I'm hearing. Maybe I'm putting words in your mouth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But why shouldn't I expect to be taken care of better? Why is that so much to ask? If I'm not going to be taken care of in a certain way, well, what are we here for?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean that? Because you're laughing...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I kind of do because I feel like, like then what am I here for? I guess so I can experience the feelings. So you can help me with the feelings more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe so we can understand what it's like for you when you're not taken care of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that's what I have to learn to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we have to get into that. People don't take care of other people all that much in life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, and I think I've felt that when I started taking care of people and what was going on with me. Then maybe that's why it's such a big issue because I'm doing an awful lot of care taking. And I'm not taken care of, and I'm not taking care of myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like even when you talk about the time it's like you feel you have to take care of it when I'm not good at doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm worried about you getting in trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Taking care of me, yeah, you're feeling like I'm not taking good enough care of you and then there is that other how about you taking care of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this was a very big thing with my parents. A big thing with how I am with my parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, just taking care of them. You talked about it a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like a very big thing in their lives.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're always taking care of somebody else, but not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really taking acre of yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, well I'll [inaudible at 58:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

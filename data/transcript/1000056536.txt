<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 1927-112. Interview #10. This one is recorded on a (inaudible 00:00:10) It's January 27. Austin counselor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure how I left you last week...what we were talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want me to tell you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were feeling very down. Some kind of decision was ending [and the fate about your wife.] (ph) You felt very close to [wanting whatever you need.] (ph) You weren't happy with your wife and afraid to leave her...afraid of being alone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, with me, we've actually last week...we've started talking. (inaudible 00:01:37) And we talked about quite a few things...things that were bothering both of us and things that...although we've been talking about things, we haven't gotten to some of those things or getting quite so specific, I guess, about certain things...things that I'm sure both of us felt before that we were afraid to bring out. And we talked about them.</p>

<p>And I was feeling very depressed when I left last week. And we talked about that because it seems that every time I'd leave, I felt more depressed than when I came. Because generally when I walk in, I'm not aware of feeling I'm happy or low. Then when I leave, I'm very aware that I'm feeling low.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's more like kind of when you get in here...when you walk out of here, it's like you really do feel down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I realized, too, that it seems that we talk about the same things all the time and those are the things that make me feel low. And I don't know if I'm...if I feel that I'm necessarily doing anything about the things that make me feel low. [00:03:24]</p>

<p>So, I don't know. We talked about our original goals...my wife and I did...about the things that we really wanted to accomplish out of therapy. I felt that I've accomplished some of those and others I think that...I have a feeling that we're accomplishing at home. We're working out certain things and it's made changes in my behavior and hers, which have changed then my attitudes and feelings. [00:04:50]</p>

<p>At this time...at the present time, I think I'm kind of at a stalemate. I felt like...or at kind of a plateau...and I've felt that way for about three weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A plateau where? There? Here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Here. When I come here, I feel like I'm kind of going over the same things without feeling that it's beneficial. Not that I expect an immediate change, but kind of like I don't know if this is taking me anywhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know if you...yeah...if anything is really happening to you, although what seems to be happening to you is very different. You said the last couple of times you walked out of here feeling more depressed and angry (inaudible 00:05:47).</p>

<p>This is part of my impression. [I hadn't really noticed that] (ph)You're right. You do walk out of here feeling more down that when you come in. I also kind of think that what has happened in here the last few times is that really, it has kind of hit you where you are. It sounds like your depression is there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but at the same time, it's like that's not where I'm always at. You know what I mean? But perhaps this is the one time out of the number of hours in the week where I sit down and talk about how I feel and it comes out. I do leave depressed. But then again, we only talk about the depressing things or I only talk about them. But I suppose that's because those are the things that I'm unhappy about and yet I don't feel that I'm really doing anything about them. Do you know what I mean? [00:07:18]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you're not doing anything about those unhappy things. I mean, I guess the last couple of times where we've been...where it's left...the thing that has always made you feel down is when you start to think about what you should do and what you should do with your wife. I mean your feelings about happiness there and does that mean that you leave? Maybe you don't know what to do (inaudible 00:07:45) Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not an answer I can tell you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't expect you to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's yours.</p>

<p>(period of silence 00:08:00 - 00:10:01)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think what I'd like to talk about now would be quitting and terminating. My wife and I talked about that, that night. And I don't know...she felt like nothing was happening with me...that I was just kind of spinning my wheels. And we talked about different kinds of treatment...other kinds of treatment. So I don't know. I think I kind of feel really like I'm not getting anywhere. And I've thought a great deal about it...about why and if it's that I don't want to face up to certain things and I'm not using treatment or if I'm kind of rationalizing about things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah (inaudible 00:11:32)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, blaming...kind of like blaming what I feel is a lack of change on the treatment method.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean on me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, on the method as opposed to you because, well, I just kind of separate it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like this type of therapy, you feel may not be what you need for change?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't feel really responsive to it...me. Now why...I think there are a lot of reasons why. And I think there are probably a lot of reasons that I'm not aware of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are the reasons why that you're aware of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'm aware of?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I need help in developing more insight. And I guess I need kind of a guide to help me focus on things that are seen...when we talk about them...that are seen as important by you. And I just kind of feel...it's like I feel, well, the responsibility for focus is left to me. [00:13:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And one reason I came for therapy is because for years I've kind of done like kind of an introspection and I got to a point where that was just no longer successful. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You needed help to do an introspection. That's what you needed. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now it's like (inaudible 00:13:35)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I don't know. It's kind of hard now. For example, certain things that we'll say I've thought about in the past, like maybe I've dismissed them as unimportant or I feel, well, I've worked them out, okay, so I don't even bother to mention them because they don't bother me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think they're really important. You don't think that some are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. My wife thinks some of them might be...many of the things that don't bother me...the things that I don't think about anymore at all. So I don't know. I guess I feel like I need a kind of direction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or a directed insight to treatment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to help me pull things out that seem important to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. So if I understand what you're saying, you're saying that you'd like to quit and focus on some other type of treatment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. What my wife and I are talking about now is marital counseling for the two of us. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can...I really understand what you're saying. I mean you feel like kind of you can't really sense changes of that this is leading to changes (inaudible 00:16:59) That's the real thing (inaudible 00:17:05). I think you and your wife were asked when you came here if you wanted marital couples' therapy as you call it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know because we've talked and I don't know...we were offered the research group. I really don't remember what we were told because that's what we came asking for and then we didn't get it. I don't know if...I don't remember now if we were told or given the impression that that wasn't available, or if it wasn't available in the research program and we'd have to wait awhile or what. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't know. I mean it just...I know that often with couples having problems...married couples having problems...they'd want to do it together. They could do it together while [also practicing] (ph) some of this on the side. I mean perhaps it is best. I mean maybe there are things that bother you and bother you a lot separately, but I think a lot of what's going on with you has to do with what's going on with her and with the two of you. I can understand that that makes sense.</p>

<p>It's part of the type of therapy. Therapy (inaudible 00:18:47). Yeah, I can really see that. I mean this is not an insight-oriented therapy. It's kind of a therapy more into trying to...really, what's important to people is not what they do, but what changes what they do is how they feel about what they do and what they do with their feelings about it. And that may not be the best for you. It's not always the best route to go. [00:19:24]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think it has been helpful in a lot of ways. And I think that my wife and I both see differences in our position from where we were when we began and where we are now. But I really...I don't know...I really kind of feel at a loss now about whether or not I'm making any kind of change now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it's like you feel like some things have happened, but it's... (inaudible 00:20:20) when you were [that] (ph) before...before Christmas. But it's kind of like you said. You feel like you've reached a plateau or something. And is it worth the added...you don't know if it's worth the added time, investment and energy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I already invested in a different way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is your wife planning to do the same thing, also?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's planning to continue?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But also touch on the marital problems?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. She wants to. I don't know. I guess that the method that Tara uses, my wife has adapted to well. And she likes it. She's comfortable. And there are things that she consciously wants to work on...things that she's aware of that she wants to continue to work on. And then at the same time, we'd like to work on things together. [0:22:41]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can...I mean I (inaudible 0:23:15) For me, I don't feel it's a question of you're wrong or you're right. I mean that what you think is really (inaudible 0:23:22) most important. (inaudible 0:23:39) I don't know what you want to do with any of this. We still have another 25 minutes. (chuckles) You understand what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know. Well, if I remember correctly, they told me when I began that when we terminate, there would be...I don't know...[more casting?] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. And will they contact me? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, they'll contact you. And there you'll have (inaudible 0:24:23) specialists (inaudible 0:24:30) It's important for research. (inaudible 0:24:34) So they will contact you. (inaudible 0:24:57) </p>

<p>(period of silence 0:24:58 - 0:27:39)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were you thinking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was...it's...I went to a doctor Friday for a physical for an insurance policy and after he examined me, he sent me to the hospital Friday night for an EKG. And I went back Monday and found out I have an irregular heartbeat. And I was just thinking about that...how that kind of changed our relationship...my wife and I. I don't know. It brought it a little bit...it was almost a defensive maneuver like we started talking about the future in different kinds of terms and things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Different (inaudible 0:28:46)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, it was...it was almost...I don't know...kind of like two things happened. First was to deny that...we were both denying that anything was wrong with my heart. And then after that, it was...that was over, we were...well, I was denying it and I was kind of thinking well, there's no point in worrying about our relationship anymore because I don't know how much longer I'll last. And I don't know. After that happened, for a while at least, my marital problems seemed very unimportant and transient, although this happened after my wife and I had talked about terminating. [0:29:38]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 0:29:47) is of greater importance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's actually put my feelings about other things into the background right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you really upset and worried about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I will be for about three weeks, yeah, because I have an appointment with a heart specialist. He told me to go back to the hospital.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 0:30:18)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know, but I've had seven physicals in the last three years for different things. It's never been detected. I've been "physicalled" (sp?) to death for jobs or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not something that maybe you just developed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not like the result of a disease or it's not congenital. It's the result of some kind of damage. And I'm worried because I want to know what brought it on so I can avoid it. I don't know. It's not like I think about it constantly, but it's frightening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's frightening because now you have to worry about how long you're going to be around. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm, really. And the doctor...I don't really have a regular doctor and I just went to this guy because he's convenient and I could get in quickly. And he has given me two physicals in the past two years when I was in school. So this guy has examined me before. </p>

<p>And then he sent me to the hospital that afternoon and I said, "Well, is there something wrong with my heart?" and he said, "Yes." But he wouldn't tell me anything else. And then I had to wait four days to find out what was wrong. Then when I wanted to ask him questions about it, he wouldn't answer them. He said, "After you see the specialist, ask him." Now I have to wait three weeks to see the specialist. [0:32:02]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it sounds like [it all adds up to such worrisome stuff.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, it makes me very anxious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it makes you anxious. Does it make you anxious to go through thinking there's something that they aren't telling you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, he won't answer any questions I have at all. I said, "What might it have resulted from?" and he said, "Well, rheumatic fever." Well, I never had rheumatic fever. (chuckles) And that's as far as he would go. So it's frightening, really. He's not a very good teacher.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like he's (inaudible 0:32:48)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I keep saying that he's not a very good doctor, too. He doesn't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He sounds like, well, either he doesn't know or else he (inaudible (0:32:57)</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I'm...we both have been worried about it. That has made us feel closer together, I think. I think we have...I think we have begun to feel closer in a lot of ways because we've begun doing more things together. And we've...I've talked about it before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It truly has been my feeling the last couple of weeks that just from what you've said here, I somehow felt that you were at a critical period at least from what you said and how you felt about it with respect to your marriage. And you would either kind of go one way or the other, but you certainly didn't (inaudible 0:33:48)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I think we've made shifts and we talked about the need to...just to do it if we felt it. We want to be doing different things and we ought to start doing them and we have. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kinds of things (inaudible 0:34:09)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, just small things, but things that we do together as opposed to doing them with other people. We rarely ever do anything without each other, but we almost always do something with other people. We've quit doing that and it makes a difference. It really has. In a sense, it's kind of a reversion back to the way things were when we were first married because then we really didn't know very many people and we never had any money because I was in the army. So we did everything together. [0:34:53]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of feels like you're sharing more things and are closer in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. We're sharing the things that you don't really share with other people. And we had gotten away from that because I had started earning money and we started doing things that we hadn't been able to do all the time we had been married because we never had the money to go out and do anything. Then we really kind of went overboard with it and it got...it just got to be too much. So we've cut back a lot on that.</p>

<p>(period of silence 0:35:36 - 0:37:09)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do they do marital counseling here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They have. I don't know what's available now, but you can always call the person you first saw. He knows about what they do here more than I do. He knows also about every place or most places that do it. He knows (inaudible 0:37:38)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I have a problem in the fact that we live in Ohio and it's difficult to get accepted in most places in the city.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 0:37:49)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, but many places...many places, like the school here are state or state-funded or united fund and I don't...I can't get into those places.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, he probably knows something about that. (inaudible 0:38:09) I mean I don't...he may not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they have to be cheap. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand this stuff. I really don't. I don't know much about it...what's going on [with the state] (ph) And the fact that you work in Detroit...you do work in Detroit, don't you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that doesn't make a difference?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. And there's only one place in Ohio we can go and I know every teacher there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 0:38:45) I really would suggest that (inaudible 0:38:55) is the person who would know exactly (inaudible 0:38:57)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should we stop?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I mean I know it's a little early, but I guess I didn't provide you with (inaudible 0:39:20) tranquility. You said what you wanted to say and I do want to say that I think that going into marital counseling could be very helpful. You really kind of...I do sense you really have a commitment to this...to really try to make something [of your marriage] (ph) and make it more like the kind of thing (inaudible 0:39:54). Okay. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sigh) So yes, I had emergency dental surgery on Saturday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! It was, um, somewhat stressful. So, and in that way, so I...I had, um, also had four fillings earlier that my doctor managed to do in one appointment, and so I had last Friday scheduled as a dentist day? I just took it off as a vacation day? So it was like fuck you work...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...whatever. And I actually had a little bit of toothache the day before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So wait, sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I had planned again on Friday. You had told me...it must have been Monday or something that you were going to be out Monday, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hadn't you told me before that you were out Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh uh. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really? I thought...cuz I thought...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember from last Monday knowing that we weren't going to be meeting for like a week and a half.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but because of the Friday off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think we got our days confused, cuz I was out Friday. I'm sorry...you're right. I was out Monday. You were out Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're...right. Okay, so we wouldn't have met Monday anyway, which is why I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm, just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Okay, that makes sense, yeah, cuz it was the (inaudible at 00:01:24) thing, the Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, so you knew about the appointment for Friday, or whatever, which is why you were out and I didn't know I was going to be away but we wouldn't have been able to meet on Monday anyway...</p>

<p>[00:01:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cuz you were having...okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, um, but the Friday appointment...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it didn't happen so I was like vacation day...except that on Thursday I was having like a minor toothache and Friday it just like I couldn't chew on one side of my mouth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I, ya know, called the dentist they were like you need to be...so Saturday morning I hauled myself in and, um, (pause) they...they said, they were like you need a root canal right about now. [00:02:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I thought that they were just going to kind of, um, (pause) um, I just thought they were gonna like say it's just a toothache, or...like, I don't know, here's some antibiotics, but my dentist was like just said you can't leave. We have to...we have to do a root canal right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And what sucks is that normally, um, he does twilight sedation...which is amazing, um, and it was like he did Halcion there before, someone drives you home and you just kind of...I mean you're out all day. It's fantastic. But I had taken all my morning medication which had included Ativan and he didn't want to mix them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ohh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So, he was like okay you can double up on your Ativan...that's...it cuz. Like he gave me a little time but...[ 00:03:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, and I think...I would imagine that the emergency root canal is precisely the thing you'd want the twilight sedation for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes. Oh yes! (laughs). I was...and when I had gotten up that morning I kind had this moment of should I not take like my drugs? It was just like this running routine...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and, um, yeah. And I had a friend who was going to pick me up. And I was like oh, it's just gonna be a quick appointment. You can pick me up after and I actually had to text and be like yeah...I'm having a root canal right now. Can you pick me up two hours later? And like there's a little bit of like...well I don't think so, I have another appointment back and forth, which managed to get settled before we actually started thank God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:04:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) so part of what...so that, ya know was sucky. What was more sucky in many ways was that one of the reasons why it got to the state of needing a root canal was because I'm grinding my teeth...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...at night, which (pause) so, ya know, he has all these...he has digital x-rays that's he's looking at...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...they're looking at the x-rays of my teeth and they're looking at like the jaw in general. And he's like this is your jaw six months ago. Like, ya know, a year ago. Here it is now. This, this, this, this, this and this and this is all because you're grinding your teeth...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...at night probably. You're just stressed. Um, and it also makes my dental anxiety worse? Like he, um, part of twilight sedation is he took blood pressure and other things and it's always, it's gotten like...usually I go in and it's like a little high and now when I go in he's like you should see your doctor about high blood pressure. I'm like it's mmm, it's just stress. Like I did go in and see my doctor after and she's like yeah, it's stress. It's not yet so high that I'm gonna die, but, my doctor's fear was basically it seems to be completely...it seems to be really stress related and you're stressed so (pause) like a treatment regimen for something that is probably gonna go away. Doesn't that make sense? Which I'm okay with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry. Say that again. [00:05:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I went in and I...I went and talked it over with my dentist. My blood pressure was just sky high and so I scheduled an appointment with my doctor to just check my blood pressure...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...like one month out and then two months out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...which also leads to the very inevitable discussion of you should lose weight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I hate. Um, my blood pressure is normally really excellent. My blood cholesterol is excellent and like all that crap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, even like my father's family has a very strong history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, like everything, and I've managed to skip it all. [00:06:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank God, yeah. My mom's family are healthy as horses. I feel like I got that. (sighs) I, uhh...it's just...I mean I don't...like I'm actually usually not very stressed at doctor appointments. It's just dental work that makes me stressed. But I was stressed at my doctor's appointment because I knew what was gonna happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was going to be like you should lose weight. And the other frustrating thing is, ya know, she's doing...she's saying...and she's like well, you should lose weight. And I said no. And she's like well, you know you really should cut out soda and have less processed food. I'm like I don't drink soda. I don't eat processed food. I just cook most of my meals from scratch. Like you really...you possibly didn't ask me what I eat...[ 00:07:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and she was visibly shocked that, like...she said ya know (inaudible at 00:07:38) diet sodas disgusting and that's one of the things that I loathe is going in and the doctor doesn't believe you. Like she somewhat did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...when I...mostly when I just started rattling off like this is what I ate this week. It included several pounds of kale, which was delicious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...so that sucked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it also was really frustrating to find out that...like I really think that like, I'm like yeah this heart condition is not great for my health, but I just had a root canal. Really? (sighs). But I have to go back in on Monday because, um, it was really painful and I wasn't, and I wasn't, ya know, very well sedated and he couldn't, he didn't get...he did as well as he wanted to. Plus it was an emergency appointment so I was kinda shoved in. Um, so Monday morning I get to go back for more dental work. Which is why I canceled. I e-mailed you. [00:08:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, I also like...now that he's done work on my mouth I'm really super aware that I'm grinding my teeth at night, cuz I wake up and it hurts a lot cuz I just had a root canal blah, blah, blah. Um (pause) so yeah it's really (sighs) like...hmmm (pause) I don't know. Again part of it I think is I've been...I've been checking out emotionally of a lot of things just because I'm like, I'm really stressed, but I have really been thinking about like (pause) like that like, how stress affects my body? Even though stress always affects my body? Like I usually get like really acid stomach or like horribly clenched shoulders or stress headaches. Um (pause) and I just...I think I've just been blowing them off and not really thinking about it, um, because once like, ya know, especially in the root canal and I was thinking like oh, yeah...it's true that I've been having a lot of headaches and, yeah...like I've had several afternoons where I didn't want to eat because I was nauseous. Um (pause) and I really hate that...like I don't know, like I find it extra frustrating that emotion always hits me physically as well as like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. [00:10:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...emotionally, um (pause) like I had this one special job where...well, the job was fine except for then they hired a coworker who was sexually harassing me and so I had my therapist and my psychiatrist and my GP all say you need to quit this job, um, because it's like, ya know, like it's gonna kill, you so you need to stop. Um, I had horrible stomach problems for like six months. I just like, I couldn't eat anything. I mean, whatever I ate just like acid stomach, acid stomach, and like my stomach always was burning. It was just horrible. Um, they did one of those (inaudible at 00:11:25), like low fat, no caffeine, no spicy food...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...no alcohol...and so I was kind of miserable (laughs) because I didn't eat anything. And it was also frustrating because after I changed jobs it still took a while. Like it was three months like after I switched my job for my stomach to finally be like alright you can eat again. (sigh) So I just don't, like I really don't want that to happen again. Um (pause) I don't know. (pause) And then Tuesday I had just...we had another all-staff meeting at work...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and (pause) I had kinda decided that, um, I would probably stop asking questions during the staff meetings because it wasn't going anywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:30)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, actually...mmm...and (pause) um, I had gotten there a little late so I kinda was stuck at the back of the room, which was (inaudible at 00:12:38) . I was like, because I had also planned to sit near the front of the room so I could get up and leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:12:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...which somebody had done in a previous meeting and kinda thought was brilliant, but I was sitting in the back of the room, and (pause) so for the first like 15 or 20 minutes Karl was talking about some job-sharing thing which didn't really make sense, and so I was asking about it that it just didn't make any sense. He was like well, you know, when things are really busy in one part of the library we're just gonna do this job sharing where you can take someone from another, their job and they can do this other job. And I was like what? Like so...and it just didn't make any sense and so I asking about it and he was like well, I mean it doesn't really apply to you at all because you're not...your local services, not shared services. And I was like well...the whole department's local services. Like Karl, why are we discussing this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...so, like that was just really confusing and I'm like okay, seriously, don't ask questions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and everyone else (inaudible at 00:13:44) But one of my coworkers next to me, like I kind of thought that he was...(sighs) like he was turning like beet red, like pulse throbbing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Throbbing temples...[ 00:14:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! Oh my gosh. He's gonna die mid meeting. Um, and he says like Karl's just stupid. This makes no sense. Because what they were announcing...and he didn't announce the two retirements in our department. He only mentioned one of them. And his comment was, so I guess Timmons is retiring, and ya know blah, blah, blah, thank you for your service. I'm like you don't guess she's retiring. She is retiring. And the other person who is retiring, maybe he could mention that, but he didn't. Um, so apparently the library was shocked that a lot of people took early retirement.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They said they offered it to everyone that was eligible, so it wasn't like they only offered it to certain people. I mean it was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, like Karl lost a third of his reference librarians.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know! Which I find really kind of terrifying. It was like...what? Like—it's the big library.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What the fuck...and the head of reference retired also. So...yes. He had already been like, like planning to retire (inaudible at 00:15:22).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When he was offered it, he was just like yeah, fine. He took it instantly. So there's no head of reference. The librarians are gone. We're losing our reference librarian who is also the head of government documents and I'm just like (pause) so then I was kind of like and he says like and like this was harder than we thought, and, ya know, people took retirement in places where we didn't really...they just...like some people took retirement and didn't want to. Some people who wanted to retire, they didn't retire. Like they didn't want to lose all their reference librarians.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, which led to my coworker having (inaudible at 00:16:09) and just saying this is stupid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, how do you not...like you should plan that in targeted fashion and also how do you not have a plan for people taking it. [00:16:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, um. And so by this time they (inaudible at 00:16:29) like well, there is no plan and we're reassessing everything and blah, blah, blah...and so like several of the people were like yeah, okay, um, June 30th was supposed to be the deadline. What the fuck? Um...and just nothing. Like Karl hadn't really given responses to anyone. I mean he sort of like mumbled his party line but essentially he was saying that there is no structure yet for any part of the new library except that there are five affinity groups which take...they're just, he doesn't want...it...I can't explain it. No one can explain it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Instead of there being like the law library and the blah library...there's now the affinity group conceptually of circulation or an affinity group around the concept of research.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think have some clue as to why you can't explain it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to explain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, and they've decided I think, um, they had the three, two or three of the five affinity group. They were supposed to have enacted them all in February. Um...it's actually one of the things that no one like can really successfully explain. But they talk about it all the time as being really awesome. But we're all like I don't understand. Because the affinity groups also don't seem to have any like control or power over anything? (pause) They just seem to be like conceptually about an area.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're supposed to be eliminating like the silos of the different library systems...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [00:18:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...by shoving everyone into affinity groups that cross libraries. Um, (pause) and the thing that happened to Karl's group before is that he then started telling us like we don't understand like the real world and what reality is and we're just resisting change and things have to change and on and on. Which always drives you crazy because now he's saying don't change. They're mostly saying we don't (inaudible at 00:19:09) like (pause) like could we know what...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. The people are asking him like to answer my question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or asking a question like why wasn't there a plan for this or like why, like when will we know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, also like Karl doesn't know shit about technology so it's really ludicrous to have him like, trying to tell us was like you know the digital library is, um, (inaudible at 00:19:42) is in pretty bad shape which has gone bad on a couple things. His library digital people say like well, you don't understand. It's a nimble start-up world and like we need to be more like a start-up blah, blah, and I was like okay. I knew dozens of people who started startups and worked for startups. Startups are small. It's not scalable...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs). [00:20:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to, ya know, 83 libraries and like, ya know, like what you can do (inaudible at 00:20:14) you really can't do with thousands. And also like it's kind of apples and oranges and the things that might be interesting about start-up culture or like start-up ideas they won't do. Like one of the awesome things about startups is like ya know, um, kind of anyone can say like hey, we should go do this thing, and so we'll say yeah, go do that. And right now that can't happen. I mean it's just...you just can't. If you have a good idea you have to like shove it up through 40 gazillion people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it kind of like it comes back strangely telephoned.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and obviously like other things and also, um, we saw this thing from Apple and she was like yeah, you could (inaudible at 00:21:15) sign of desperation in a company that's like trying to move forward (inaudible at 00:21:20) desperation is buying Apple Service.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have three! We might get more! Yes!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs). [00:21:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's just like they said...(inaudible at 00:21:32)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So of like (inaudible at 00:21:32) chairs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm taking a guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes! It's like I'm still I'm kinda like I really want to...I would love to discuss that with someone who has like importance but like it won't go anywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like, dang, we're already learned from our like that conceptual mistake, um (pause) it's just like...I don't know, so after you get closer and like I spent some time talking to one of my union reps that I like and I was asking her like is this like seriously what's happening? Like what are they are not saying when they say they don't have a plan? And she's like I don't think they have a plan. I think they have less than a plan than you can imagine. Which was I'm kinda of like, wait...but how can there be less than a plan than I can imagine, and a correct (inaudible at 00:22:33) which I think is probably kind of valid is that basically there are committees that have spent time having meetings and discussions all deciding that they should restructure the library system and like, ya know, like six months focus group committee to decide if we should (inaudible at 00:22:52) group and then it was just yes, we also studied this and we should restructure the library, and no one's gotten to the point of actually doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the closest they got was they hired this transition team who spent the first like probably a year of their time holding meetings discussing the concept of restructuring the library and then they hired some consultants more recently (pause) but...like I think it seems like maybe they really actually don't have a structure. Like it's not like they're hiding it or trying to like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not there. [00:23:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like the main conspiracy theory is like oh, they want to hold off making a layoffs announcements till the (inaudible at 00:23:49) are gone. Cuz one of the questions that everyone asked is like okay, if this supposed to be all done by the end of the fiscal year, does that mean layoffs will happen by the end of the fiscal year? And the answer is unclear. Like they won't say yes or no. Which is...like usually you just should have asked (inaudible at 00:24:06). And that's just what you do. Like why would you even begin the fiscal year (inaudible at 00:24:15). Um, and so it seems like they aren't even far enough along to really grapple with that concept (laughs). Um, like much of the concept of you have to give 60 days' notice to union members...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:24:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: da, da, da, da, da, dot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right which would be a week and a half out or something, two weeks out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, like the one thing I kind of was pressing Karl was on was like no, like seriously...in two weeks are you going to make layoff announcements, because if you are...I'd kinda like to know. Um (pause) but (pause) the union, they haven't bridged that with the union yet and they would sort of have to have already. Like usually they tell the union like a week before the 60 days. Like however they do (inaudible at 00:25:18) we're thinking of laying some people off. Okay, here's the list. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's really fast.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and um (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hasn't happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the negotiator was kind of refusing to talk to the unions, so there is that, but (pause) I just think (pause) so there's complete lack of anything. In a weird way it made me feel a little less stress because (pause) I mean not in a specific way in that I don't feel like someone above me is like plotting how to like pull off a layoff without anyone knowing or like managing to like do the layoff and go on around like whatever, because I don't think they're competent enough to do that. Which is good! Like, I'm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [00:26:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...glad that there is not a sort of (pause)...I mean it felt like (inaudible at 00:26:48) but the way that like the head (inaudible at 00:26:52) reacts is horrible and negative but it seems like their actual like structural actions are incompetent and not malicious, which is kind of meaningless in a way but does make me feel a bit better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, one of the heads of the library who retired...he's retiring kind of over this partially, made this like amazing statement that a disastrous series of miscommunications occurred (pause) but he was like, ya know, I'm not saying that we did it. It's just that miscommunication has occurred.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs) [00:27:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Like mistakes were made...by someone. I'm not apologizing for them because ya know (pause) it's just a...it was like they did an (inaudible at 00:27:49) to date on (sigh) our library's obsolete and they did like two other recent presentations or like talks that I didn't attend cuz I didn't want to, but I mean kind of what came out of those is a lot of great things, like faculty saying we were on a six-month committee discussing what we want to do and that's not what we said we were gonna do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like I feel it would be like, yeah! Ya know...what we really want to do is this tangential thing. Like one of the heads of the library transition team is obsessed with the idea of self-checkout (pause) which is incredibly expensive, um...is unreliable...and like no one's actually interested in it. Like, like the library's aren't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...interested in it, but he's all...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's something new. Um (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It's just like (inaudible at 00:29:12) (pause) So yeah, I mean I went in and I was...I almost threw up again after the staff meeting on Tuesday? But (pause) once I kind of got over that it's was like I was gonna throw up junk. I was like, yeah, (inaudible at 00:29:36) stress any more. Like, I don't know. I feel like it was more like a real intense physical reaction than as much as like me feeling really freaked out over losing my job, but the other thing which I also thought about is that (inaudible at 00:29:58) probably is not a way...like my fantasy of getting laid off and getting severance which is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I don't...like the level of incompetency makes me think like...but he did like ask for that specifically like (inaudible at 00:30:22) which means (pause) a job hunt, which I really don't want to do. One of my friends asked if I was institutionally, um, loyal to Cambridge, because I've been working here for so long, and I was like naw, that's not like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:30:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was (inaudible 00:30:43) (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know, but after that I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and so like I'm thinking of the like do I get a job outside of Cambridge? Do I move (inaudible at 00:30:59) began? Which is my tuition benefits, like my seniority blah, blah...and (pause) I don't know. Like one of the things that remains frustrating and kind of just doesn't make sense to me is like at this point I have like there are a bunch of library, like librarians and some of the senior managers who seem to know who I am and are like you're so awesome, thank God you're here like during this AV presentation. Like you're such a valued employee. And I'm just like well, how can I be so fuckin' miserable and treated so poorly if I'm also allegedly like someone you're so happy...it's like whenever I'm there they'd be like (inaudible at 00:31:49). Like I got last minute, um, roped into attending one of the library public conversations on the concept of libraries because I guess the speaker had specifically requested that I be there at the beginning to help her because I'd helped her...I helped her...cuz I'd helped her set up her presentation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:32:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...like room set up and then once I was there other people were like oh, can you help me with this? I'm like, okay. Guess I'm going to this presentation. And so like, you know, like so these outside people are like yeah...you truly are a co-librarian, so like you're so awesome. One of the senior managers is like oh, am I glad you're here. It's so great. And I'm like okay, like thanks (pause) but (pause) in actuality in general I'm treated like crap, so (pause) I don't know. Like that's just what I've been dealing with for the last week a lot is the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [00:32:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...not like a generic vague worry like oh. all they really value is your work, but like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, when people say it they really mean it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They're being specific. And...I don't know. I just don't know what to do with it. I think it's more of a coworker, like if one of the librarians says that to me then I'm like well, yes you can say that (inaudible 00:33:24) because you have no control over like, you're a coworker. You're not like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right right right right. (long pause) I'm not really sure about this, but I'm speculating and I will throw it out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm (clears throat).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Do you have (pause) I mean there seems to me to be like (pause) a big disconnect between (pause) like the way that you're talking and some of your more intense feelings about what's going on. I know you're feeling better now and sort of relieved since this meeting and the sort of clearer sense of the incompetence rather than maliciousness of management, but (pause) on one hand you talk about things like grinding your teeth like for months to the point of needing root canals, and you're blood pressure being through the roof, and feeling like you wanted to throw up immediately after the meeting, and (pause) I don't (pause) get any of the sense of that intensity of stress - which I know is there - in how you're talking about what's going on which, (pause) um, kind of makes me feel like it's much harder to reach or try to reach you at the level at which you're really feeling very worked up and upset about this. I'm not saying it's your job to be accessible to me, I'm just saying, ya know, that seems at a considerable removed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [00:36:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean in how you're talking, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I definitely agree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Um, I don't get the sense that you're...sorry I'm like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, I don't get the sense that sometimes when this happens like a person's words are sort of empty. I don't get that, a sense of that quality to what you're saying. I mean what you're saying - though it's not I mean to me obviously reflective of the more intense level of upset and distress that you feel - seems important, meaningful in a clear, coherent more just out of, yeah, considerable remove I guess. Um (pause) yeah. [00:37:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I think that's kind of what I mean when I say I've been feeling kind of checked out. I guess it's not really checked out exactly but (pause) I don't know, it's...I think part of the reasons why stress always affects my body...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...is that, is that I'm busily like repressing or like suppressing being upset, like that goes somewhere. Actually my stomach. And (pause) so part of, you know, not crying at work is also need, like kind of, like (sighs) not divorcing myself from my emotions but really (pause) (sighs). I mean I don't think it gets (inaudible at 00:39:05) move or more feeling like (pause). Sometimes it's like it's (sighs)...that's not it too. It's not a case of like it's happening to someone else, because that's not it. Like, it's also like happening to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) I don't know, I guess I feel like it's (pause) (sighs) I feel like I'm kinda priori...for, in whatever ways, like I feel like well, I have to go to school. I have to do my homework. I have to like get to work, feed myself. You know to do all these things. And right now I kind of feel like well, if I want to do those like, kind of like getting-through-the-day things then feeling really horrible is making that really hard. Like, (pause) ya know, like part...for me part of like just...kind of really like feeling how I'm feeling is things like sitting by myself. I mean I just can't leave this house this morning. I just...I can't make myself go to work. I'm just kind of sitting there for a while. I mean like I just don't want to go. Or like last month I was having a whole thing where when I'm stressed, like I don't really like talking on the phone to strangers...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:40:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...as you know. I hate the phone. And the other thing I guess I hate, I don't really like e-mail...I don't like like the kind of cold call, cold contact of someone and Chet was trying to cold call. Like he was like to get me to like cold call all these students and train them on the (inaudible at 00:41:15) and I didn't want to, and for me it was like I just couldn't even send the e-mail. I was like trying to draft it, trying to write it, and I'm just like I can't send this damn e-mail, and frustratingly I kind of asked him if he would do it for me and he didn't. Like I wasn't, ya know, like super explicit about it but I was talking like this is really hard for me right now because I'm like under stress and I'm sorry. Um, and he was sort of blah and wouldn't do it. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have there...[ 00:41:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I don't know if this has most often been your experience that they go around you, don't help, don't really get it...uh, don't necessarily want to like look that closely or understand, let alone react in a way that would help to what you're upset about or is stressing you out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean...it's also that I don't always want to give them the chance. Like I get so worried about that. I'm reluct...like, like I feel really reluctant to (pause) like I, I had been crazy to even ask for a ride home from the dentist?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...because I go God...it's just like it's this whole like imposition would have...and also I just really didn't want to hear someone say no?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, even though I completely see why you wouldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know how you feel. I'm (inaudible at 00:43:26) that you have some struggle with that each year? Like I don't quite understand that you sort of think of me as being initially unhelpful around these things but that like today you sort of come in and it is kind of where you're at to be at something of a remove. And it's hard to sort of even (inaudible at 00:43:48) like turning that off, getting to it in a different way and then being able to transition back out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean (pause) it's difficult. Like (pause) I mean part of it's like also like how aware of that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I am. Like I mean pinpoint...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) I think like one of the things that I always find really hard is like kind of opening up the possibility of like (pause)...like the concept of asking for help is really hard and sort of like (pause), and getting over that hurl is sometimes just like I...it's...sometimes it's doable and sometimes it's really not, um (pause) and I don't know. Like this week I just feel like it's really hard, like ya know just for kind of everything, like going to the dentist Monday morning. It's an 8:10 appointment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was being completely neurotic about even asking people who I know go to work early in cars...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To take you there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I finally...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it. We're gonna stop for now, but, um, but we'll talk more. Ya know on Friday I could also if you like reschedule. I think I had a cancellation at 5:15 on Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, let me look at my...um (pause) (whispering) calendar (sighs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:46:28) you're getting slow. You're doing a really good job of making these things slow and then introducing a fancy (inaudible at 00:46:34) have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm refusing to even start the madness of that because I know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'm gonna want it. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really my only computer in here but, I haven't quite been able to rationalize that to myself well enough yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, let's see. Yeah, Tuesday at 5:15 would work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, good. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I will see you on Tuesday.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where shall we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sigh). Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:00:12] to 00:00:19)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Uh, I had an interesting conversation with a friend yesterday who I've known since before I've been coming here. She left college and... And I just - having to deal with coming out here at the same time, she was starting a mid-career program in coming into mind.</p>

<p>Anyway, I helped her move last Friday I think it was. Yeah. And, umm, she wanted to just treat me to brunch for helping her move. And I kind of got to talking about what it's like to be here now and not Maine, and how I regard, you know, the idea of going back there and people we were either close to or just familiar with. [00:01:12]</p>

<p>And anyway, we got to talking about, you know, what success is and - here at the university and what - she was talking about the school and how single-minded and focused, you know, it's - it seems everybody is and that's the way you succeed there. And...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:01:39] to 00:01:45)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I kind of thought, you know - I said it seems to me that success these days is just like whatever you can finagle, you know, and we're stumbling honestly now. And, you know, I'm still dealing with this; if I hadn't meaned (ph) to do it, it's not success. You know, it's not worthy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of pride or whatever. And - I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:02:21] to 00:02:32)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to remember how she said this, but she said, "You know, it could be that - I think you're just a curious person and a lot of things interest you." And, umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:02:45] to 00:02:50)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure where I'm going with this (chuckling). I'm kind of recapping the conversation. Anyway, so we got into the whole thing of inferiority complex and the - which was my dad. And she said, "So it sounds to me like you need to forgive yourself for something," you know. I didn't tell her about my own interactions with my sister. I didn't. I just can't. I can't tell people that. (Sigh). You know, no matter how much, you know, understanding they might have and, you know, non-judgment, but I shuddered. I (inaudible at 00:03:35) cannot do that.</p>

<p>And so when she said that, I was like, "Yeah, I guess it probably is," but I didn't want to, you know, say -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - "Well, you're exactly right and this is what it is." And so...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:03:51] to 00:03:55)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It brought me back to that, and to my sister, and...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:04:04] to 00:04:11)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What stops you from forgiving yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Habit? (Chuckling). Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:04:21] to 00:04:30)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not even sure that that's - I mean maybe it is, but I need to forgive myself for it, because clearly I can't own up to it to just anybody. I can hand over my dad as a story, you know, willy-nilly, but my own, no.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:04:43] to 00:04:49)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just - I just don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it doesn't - I don't - I guess the two things not to be included, you don't have to tell people who aren't forgivers off. I think it's clearly a sign of the great - of the shame that you feel. But forgiveness as a private internal process doesn't need to be made public.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does seem to be necessary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, yeah. Well...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:05:19] to 00:05:31)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess I mean that's all, you know, true when we get that. What struck me yesterday is just how - how sensitive and tender that wound still is, and how, when somebody asks me how many siblings I have, I have to think. Do I count this as a (inaudible at 00:05:51)? Do I not - what's the number without my sister? I'm not sure. I think about - you're talking kids, or siblings, you know? And it's just one of those -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the definition for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what's the - of siblings? I mean why do you make (crosstalk)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's without her. It's without her. Because, one, because it's easier to explain that I have no idea what that sister is doing and where she is. Maybe she's out West, I think. I haven't spoken to her since she was a teenager, and that's just a road I don't want to go down if someone should ask. "Oh, you have two sisters. I didn't know you had two sisters. Where's the other one?" And those - that...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:06:36] to 00:06:42)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That whole situation, that story, those business and details, are still something that I - I mean fear strikes in me when I think that that's going to be brought up. (Clears throat). Even though when one of my brothers or sister say - is asked by someone outside of the family, "How many siblings - you know, people are in your family?" And some of them will say the number including Brandy; others won't. And I get really, you know, on edge immediately when someone acknowledges her, you know. Umm, or I don't know if "acknowledge" is the word, but just opens it up for possible revelation, and I just - I get - I don't know what their answers are. This is for those who acknowledge it. I don't know what they would say if, you know, "We found something." And even talk about the whole event and the aftermath; it's something that, if there's even a hint of it, just kind of like when we're in a group, you know, a few of us then. It's just me and another brother; it's different. But if there's ever a hint of it, I clamp down, like. Change the subject; it's going this way now, and I just... And this drove a lot of reaction that's just anxiety, fear of change, fear. I mean it's... And it's still there as of even yesterday, when I was talking to her about (inaudible at 00:08:36).<br></p>

<p>(Pause [00:08:36] to 00:08:42)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you most afraid of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's funny, because at one time I was afraid of my dad's story getting out. I don't even care about that anymore. In fact, sometimes it's helpful to even process what I'm going through, umm, like it was yesterday, you know, to explain that. There's a reason for why I think everything's going to be pulled out from underneath me, you know. It happened before. Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:09:15] to 00:09:24)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know what it is I'm afraid of as far as my own owning up to it, my own participation.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:09:31] to 00:09:43)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't know. I mean this is not a person who we, like, "Oh, check, please," you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing like that. I think it's just habit, you know. And...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:09:55] to 00:10:03)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But another thing that I wonder about is just I've tried to reach out to her, five, six years ago, by e-mail. I'm not sure if I told you this, and I don't expect you to remember, but it's... Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:10:21] to 00:10:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So five years ago, my mom was dying, five years ago. And today is actually their - would have been their 50th wedding anniversary (clearing throat). But my brother, William, the other - the adopted child, was staying with me. He was in town from the military, from - from Iraq. And...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:10:59] to 00:11:04)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was on the phone in the guest bedroom with Brandy; going to tell them what's going on. He was in there for probably 20 minutes, comes out, and he goes, "Yeah, that was Brandy, and she says hi, Bryce." I'm thinking, "Wow, that's strange, but I like it, you know."</p>

<p>And that's the first I've heard boo out of her since, I don't know, (inaudible at 00:11:32). Twenty-five years, I guess. And, yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:11:44] to 00:11:48)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so a year, maybe a year and a half later, two years, (clears throat), I said "Charlotte (ph), this is, you know, under the guidance, I'll say, of my therapist" at the time." It wasn't - it wasn't you should do this. And it's like, "Well, if you wanted to, this is how I'd it. I mean I am hurting. I don't know if you're hurting, too. This is a process that I'm going through. I wondered if you - you know, how you feel about this," and just open it up. And I didn't even start with that. I just said, you know, "I'm blank at opening. Hi. You know, I'm talking forever, and I wonder how you are," blah-blah-blah. Nothing. Six months later, I try again. Nothing. I try to find her on Facebook because she's friends with other... No.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:12:47] to 00:12:49)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sigh). And so in many ways, I think in all of the ways, I think I've done what I can. I don't want to lay something out there like that e-mail without thinking that she's going to be receptive to it, you know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:13:02] to 00:13:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my sister-in-law, William's wife, I guess ex-wife now; she said at one time maybe a year ago - no, it's actually - yeah, it was quite a - last thanksgiving. She said, "Yeah, we were with Brandy," and, umm - because they were both out West at the time - and yeah. She said like - something like "Yeah, Corbin's (ph) totally screwed me over," and didn't say anything good about anyone's... And so from saying "Say hi to Bryce for me" to that, I don't know what happened.</p>

<p>But anyway, I don't know where I was going with all of that, but maybe it's to say that maybe I feel ashamed toward her and need - ah, need forgiveness, or want to ask her forgiveness, or to say I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know what I can do.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:14:13] to 00:14:17)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you need her to forgive you in order for you to forgive you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm not even sure I need to contact her at all for her to forgive me. I don't know how to evaluate whether I've made a - you know, a valid effort with her.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:14:38] to 00:14:43)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean if I am going through this, what could she possibly be going through, you know. I can't imagine. And...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:14:50] to 00:14:57)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you need to be in pain for the same amount of time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I guess I don't mean in pain. I guess just processing issues, problems we have, you know. But pain, I don't know that I feel I need to be in pain anymore. I don't know if I ever thought that I needed to be in pain, or maybe it was just telling (ph) someone you take on because you feel you've earned it. I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:15:27] to 00:15:33)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:15:34] to 00:15:38)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean rational needs, of course not, you know. That's 25 years ago. I was a child. All these rational things that... You know, I've been too hard on myself. I've been this and that.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:15:52] to 00:16:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But aside from the - the hope I have for the DVG (ph) skills, I don't know how I unlearned (ph) the sense that I'm a complete creep. And my attraction to you and my attraction to others is only - can only be enforced (ph) as that way.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:16:37] to 00:16:42)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you look back (ph) while you hold onto it.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:16:44] to 00:16:48)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In order to reinforce this idea that you're somehow a creep or that something's wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:16:55] to 00:17:09)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's familiar?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. In some ways maybe you want to hold onto this idea of yourself, if that's how you define yourself? Not wholly define yourself, but it's been a part of the definition for so long.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:17:22] to 00:17:29)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And seeing the way that you - kids are typically - they work (ph) by their families as the athletic one, the smart one, the creative one. And then they go out and find things to reinforce that notion because it's a familiar way of identifying themselves.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, and that's the creep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (chuckling). It's what you've done to yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:17:46] to 00:17:53)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know it's certainly possible that I'm the only one who thinks that way. You know, I don't think anybody in my family would say anything about it. They'd say I'm a shining star, whatever. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't seem like other people regard you that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:18:16] to 00:18:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't know. I know that's not an answer. It's the only way they're going to be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not one that wants to help you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't do that. No, it hasn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't let them know so that you can't have that notion dissuaded; that if they only knew, they would think the same thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean there's only so much I'm willing to share with anyone, because I'm ashamed of what I am, you know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:18:53] to 00:18:59)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of it. I don't know. I just - I don't know where I am with this, but lately in the past week I've felt really vulnerable.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:19:10] to 00:19:18)</p>

<p>CLIENT: To...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:19:18] to 00:19:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:19:27] to 00:19:35)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doing something that would affirm that doesn't - must face feelings that I have, you know. (Sigh)</p>

<p>(Pause [00:19:42] to 00:19:58)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is the timing significant? At least in this past week, have you felt really vulnerable? I know you just mentioned that seeing - you know, the anniversary of your mother's death.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no. That's just because my wife's in France, but I don't think that's the only thing. I don't know. (Clearing throat).</p>

<p>(Pause [00:20:15] to 00:20:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I don't want to ruin a pen (ph) that has something to do with my mom's death, but I don't...</p>

<p>know everyone who have had it had something to do with my mom's death, but I don't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels more connected. I mean your gut response, it feels a lot more connected that your wife is so far away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:20:29] to 00:20:33)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you guys have been separate now for a while. At first, it was a little bit of a relief to have space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wonder if it feels different two weeks later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does. I just...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:20:45] to 00:20:49)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it also has to do with how I feel about myself; two guys having (inaudible at 00:20:54).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:20:53] to 00:21:13)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sigh). And I guess I'm just (inaudible at 00:21:13) valleys where I - this feels normal, this feels - but these two (ph).... Why would I think I could ever change?</p>

<p>(Pause [00:21:31] to 00:22:06)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When do you feel like you entered into this particular mood (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:22:16] to 00:22:24)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hard to say. So much going on, two weeks ago at this time, you know, I'm so - loading (pause) a (pause) semi with 18 of our - maybe boxes of stuff. The next day, I'm going to be - had to move my wife or take my wife to the airport and go by our apartment and just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were very busy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just a crazy time. And so I don't know...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:23:00] to 00:23:08)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to know if those things were surface or latent at the time and I just - but I think it was after that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think for a lot of the past month there wasn't a lot of time for noticing how you felt, because you were spending so much time running here and there and doing - dealing with a million and four logistics.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kept you very busy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my dog made it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good. Was it a very complicated logistics?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll get into that. She left Sunday. She arrived, or she was taken home on Thursday. It was just a nightmare and we talked about it. Anyway, and so yeah, a lot of it just takes a lot of focus and attention. And I mean I went - so last week Thursday - no Wednesday - no. Tuesday - I went and got a massage, thinking I'd do something good for myself. You know, I've been talking about it since I finished my finals, you know, about doing this for myself. And...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:24:33] to 00:24:47)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it was a woman, and it was...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:24:50] to 00:24:54)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got such a charge out of it, you know. Uh...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:24:56] to 00:25:03)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, what I mean by that is I actually got aroused and my heart was - and I was in a place where I didn't know what I was going to do.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:25:14] to 00:25:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that's when I felt like it's heaven here. What am I doing?</p>

<p>(Pause [00:25:28] to 00:25:38)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you surprised by your erection?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Somewhat, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What surprised you about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What surprised me about it is that (sigh) I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:26:03] to 00:26:11)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that it made me really wonder if I can trust myself. I don't know if that's a surprise, but it's a shock. Umm, and the fact that I was - and it's not could (ph) go in there without my wedding ring on, you know. I'm there, I'm clearly married, and yet I am feeling like I'm emitting these vibes that say, you know, "I'm really digging you, you know," and I don't - whatever. I don't know what there is to that. But... Now, even if it was massaging my hand, it was like I just wanted her to hold my hand, you know, and just - that was it. I mean that wasn't, you know, the itch (ph), but that was a (inaudible at 00:27:20) wanted.</p>

<p>And I mean it's - it's this feeling of shame then that comes in, and it's like, God, I hope she doesn't like tell the staff "Watch out for this guy" or something like that, or "He's a creep." (chuckling). Uh...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:27:45] to 00:27:52)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's the same feeling I have with you. It's - ashamed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ashamed for wanting to be cared about?</p>

<p>(Pause [00:28:01] to 00:28:08)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think ashamed for being open to wherever that care comes from or where I can get it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I don't think - that was regarding that it's care. I don't think I regard this as necessarily I wanted you to care for you. Oh, maybe it is, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, just in that piece that you described, I mean wanting her to hold your hand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That, that sounds different than "Wanting her to ravage me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, there may have been that, too; I didn't hear that piece.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I had edited (ph) for you, but... Yeah. Well, I'm - I don't know if that was my fear or if that was my desire, you know, what I would do if she were to make a move (ph). It's like she's going to do it like you're going to do it. I mean this is ridiculous, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But what would actually happen in reality? I guess it doesn't change - that doesn't impact what it is that you - what it is that you're looking for in the fantasy (crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: The need is still there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What you're saying now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Irregardless of whether, you know - or this is - you know, going to proposition you or buy in (ph). It's really what your fear is or what your hope is, which I think are very close.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They are very close.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:29:50] to 00:29:54)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's what we need to unravel, unprocess, for you to feel comfortable. It doesn't matter so much what actually happens, or would happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another interesting piece is that you question whether you trust yourself, but it sounds like, in reality, you didn't proposition the masseuse. You didn't ask for something that wasn't part of the appropriate deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which seems that then you can trust yourself. Maybe not your desires, but you can trust you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can trust me, but I cannot trust myself if you've got an open wound, you know. I think that's what I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:30:41] to 00:30:51)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really hard because it's also I'm always looking for an opening, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that what you feel in contacting your sister? That there is an opening, by virtue of what your dad did or what the situation at home was?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. See, I didn't realize then that was going on with my dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:31:13] to 00:31:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not at all.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:31:20] to 00:31:25)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know, you know. Eleven or 12, or whatever, however old I was at the time, I'm not sure I knew what any of that - what an opening was, you know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:31:42] to 00:31:52)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But maybe that's what this all comes down to is that...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:31:55] to 00:32:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That first instance of not knowing the appropriate boundary that I did. What does that mean?</p>

<p>(Pause [00:32:23] to 00:32:28)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Knowing that I'm vulnerable. I was vulnerable in that situation.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:32:31] to 00:32:38)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And here I keep on thinking that this is coming back to Canada.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think we're going to [stop part one] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:32:46] to 00:32:57)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, for my sake, I hope my visa comes tomorrow, but for my sake I hope it doesn't because that seems to be a huge revelation...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:33:08] to 00:33:34)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess I wonder where does the insecurity or the shame - no, where does the insecurity come from? There's the need for touch or caring or intimacy or what have you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:33:56] to 00:34:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's a legitimate need. There is the insecurity of the - and subsequent shame. Oh, wait a minute. There's going to be three things here. There's the insecurity that I won't be able to trust myself. Then there is a shame for looking for it in places. I shouldn't, and I say "shouldn't" intentionally, because your sister is not - it's one of those "should nots," you know? Adopted her. I don't know why I said that. Does that make sense? I mean those three things seem like they're kind of in this tension.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I agree. I think this shouldn't - well, yes, it's - I kind of agree with you and disagree with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know what you're going to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Going to say that anyway. You're right in that you - social convention is do not engage in those kind of behaviors with a sibling, adopted or otherwise. But you have to be taught the social convention. And that's something that probably, I'm guessing, was not talked about explicitly or openly enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She didn't know it yet at 11 or 12. You probably had some vague ideas, but the boundary wasn't clear enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think - what with my blood sister, it's like are you kidding me? But then there's a sub (ph) and there's this new person here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who you didn't grow up with from birth, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and they're different from me and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess there is something to that then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there's a lot of - you know, there's a lot of data and research about the differences in rates of incest with biological and non-biological parents, biological and non-biological siblings. And there does seem to be some natural inclination for biological parents to have less frequent incest than the stepparents. [00:36:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's not fair that that's with intention. It's not that these creepy adults are marrying in order to have access to non-biological children.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there just doesn't seem to be the same kind of natural protection anyplace.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's true with siblings as well, but they're - you know, there is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially with siblings, because they don't have the - you know, they're young, you know, so what...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm, right. It might have well been that, you know, some unrelated girl from next door that moved in, and at 11, your hormones are full effect, and without it being an explicit lesson, you know. This is your sister like any other sister. No, we know that Mom didn't give birth to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, you know... And without that kind of openness, you don't necessarily learn the rules. [00:37:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had a sense it was - you know, growing up later, you had a sense that this was wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But for some reason, you had to test it out to know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As an adult looking back, you feel a great shame because it's something now that you understand, but I don't think you understood it that way at 11.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you were an 11-year-old, or 12 or whatever, in a vulnerable position, because you were looking for more attention and affection than you were getting from the appropriate places. Who knows what it would have been like if you hadn't felt like your parents had sort of kind of given up on parenting by then. [00:38:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think that's another piece that you're judging yourself by the standard of somebody whose needs were appropriately fulfilled.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there is a need for touch, for intimacy, for closeness, for attention. And I think that you were someone who was growing up with a deficit, and so you were looking to fill it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That was the goal every weekend, as I recall.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:38:41] to 00:38:57)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's interesting that when you're with your wife away you're kind of, in some ways, just like a recreation of that situation at home right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not getting the attention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Called a loss of attention. Intimacy, and affection are missing right now. [00:39:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's true. That's true. But and also - I mean I can also say that, to a degree, I still think the intense success of drinking was also a huge factor. She was in school down there and I was just kind of like without a rudder; just no structure and not certain -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you moved therapy because she was - she can enter this program, or Springfield Research right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, so this is the last semester here, so she was constantly working.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Again, I don't want to suggest that that is why, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It creates an opportunity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a factor, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not cause and effect, but it's certainly a [relieve it] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, and then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You weren't there, it may not have happened. If you were there with your own, you know, goal occupying you, it would have been a different situation. But you were there following her, and she was real busy. [00:40:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it set off a situation that you're vulnerable, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's interesting. And honestly, I don't know if you know this or if I shared it before, but - I thought I've got to have my dad. You know, this is when my mom was reentering the workforce as a private nurse and she'd be at overnights many times. And am I - am I fond of the same need that he was needing but - I mean without that frequency of the attention or whatever I mean. I mean I'm not - I'm certainly not making that kind of excuse for her, but I just wonder how much of a factor that is. (Sigh). Umm, anyway, that's it. [00:41:11]</p>

<p>(Pause [00:41:09] to 00:41:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:41:17] to 00:41:23)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess for me right now I - I know that if I take care of myself mentally and physically I can keep in contact with the world on the side. I don't know if I'm fine to the point where I don't fall for prey to these urges or needs or whatever. Umm... But right now I'm feeling kind of - I don't want to say hopeless, because I am hopeful, but just don't feel like I am taking care of myself. [00:42:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm. Well, so that's one of the differences between - between you and her dad is that there may be some parallels there. But what you know is that there are ways to kind of shore (ph) off your defenses.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And make it easier to avoid feeling trapped by your fantasies or your needs. When you take good care of yourself, it's a lot easier to put them in their place to exist with an unfulfilled need.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you're not taking your [care of yourself] (ph), it's a lot harder and you don't trust you, and that's what you're feeling. Feeling all this mistrust, like uh-oh, and not feeling really well. These means are there, and it's a lot harder to resist and it's a lot harder to walk around with it and just overeat when there was other ways of taking care of yourself on [your place] (ph). [00:43:11]</p>

<p>And so that's one of your jobs. One of your jobs is that, no matter what the situation, you have to work hard, be thoughtful, be proactive, about taking care of yourself in those ways, because that's one of the things that keeps you healthy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's one of the things that allows you to notice that there are things that you want or need and you're not getting, and not necessarily, you know, get them in any way possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the way you manage yourself. Some people can get away with taking care of themselves less well and still do okay; other people have to be more careful. Just like, you know - so a diabetic needs to be very careful about monitoring their sugar and activity level and blah-blah-blah. And other people can go into finals, you know, go into a finals period and not eat and not sleep and not drink and not exercise, and their bodies will be okay. Just one of the ways that you need to be careful about taking care of yourself. There's not as much leeway there. [00:44:23]</p>

<p>(Pause [00:44:23] to 00:44:30)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I've said it before and I'll say it again, but you're really smart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling). Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Better said] (ph) or works wonders. I need those more often (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling). Oh, that's not anything smart; it's just experience. I'm glad to hear it though (chuckling). Good thing about pediatrician (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Fifteen dollars a bottle and I guess -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Follow those one drop at a time (laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least that's not something you have to gargle or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, I think some of these things I know, but you've just summed it up very clearly. And knowing that there are consequences of taking care of myself, that will further bring me down, you know, because the needs aren't met. You know, it's like worry and fear and feeling guilty and shame.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It becomes a - yeah, it's a really tough cycle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and (sigh). I mean fortunately now it's not that I'm trying to load a truck and get my wife there and go out and get a dog. You know, I have a time to do it now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you're feeling badly though, it's a hard time. And we talked it before about how you lower the bar so that it's easier to actually do the things that make you feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you're not feeling blah, you know, lower the bar even more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it's harder to get that motivation to start moving in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can do it. [00:46:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckling). Thanks.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:46:15] to 00:46:28)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I also wanted to ask you about - I don't know when my visa is going to show up [in August] (ph). And I would like there to be another - you know, whenever it does show up, that I'd like there to be another appointment before I meet. I don't know. If it shows up tomorrow, I might just lay out Saturday and let you know around Friday now. If there's not an opportunity for me to meet with you again for the - what - what...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:47:04] to 00:47:08)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is there anything that we need to do in order to, you know - meaning that you're going to give me a report, like by text form, or (inaudible at 00:47:18).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For - as a treatment summary?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Usually what we - what people do for that is when you get hooked up with a therapist and you'll sign a release of information, let me know, and that I can send a summary directly to the next therapist rather than having you responsible for having to cart it around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if it turns out that your visa shows up tomorrow, we don't end up being able to have a session before you leave. We can do a phone session as a way to feel like you haven't - you know, for you to get some closure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be the best case scenario. It would be better to be able to have a session in person should (inaudible at 00:48:04) lost via the phone. But if it's not possible, that's certainly something we can do. I mean and if (inaudible at 00:48:13) it would be a Skype.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well, I mean I don't think it's so much - my schedule is - just I mean how often you're going to schedule me, so, umm, anyway...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, this - next week, no good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This week? Oh, yeah, Labor Day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The week of Labor Day is very squished.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. The week before Labor Day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>'</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. This week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This week is the week before Labor Day. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's this week so we can have a (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And then along the next week is kind of squished, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a short weekend, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. Friday and Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I get Monday, yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we'll see what happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. These are weeks I mean I could probably plead (ph). I do see myself like totally -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But whenever it shows up, let me know (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we'll try to arrange something. I can't - you can't sign a release now because you don't know who you're releasing information to. [00:49:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when you find somebody...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But is it something that I'm privy to, or something that you pass along to someone else who's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're privy to it because it's your file. You're allowed to read your entire file if you want. It's generally not recommended because the stuff, it's not usually useful to clients. And clients always feel like it's going to be really interesting to read their own charts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not, because there's nothing in there that you haven't said, so it's not like interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And a lot of times, you know, if I'm writing a summary for another therapist, I'm going to use a lot of jargon that is so easily misinterpreted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: They have the Internet (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (chuckling). Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It solves all the problems with...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So usually what people do is have us - we go right from one therapist to the next therapist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that way...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, if I know it's not intended for me to read, I don't need to read it. If it's intended for therapy, then that's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't sure if it was a progress report from me to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. That kind of stuff I'll give you verbally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Either in our last session or in a phone session, if we have it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's really just looking at... And it's processed for both you. And I'm kind of looking at, well, how did you feel when you came in? What prompted you to come in? Where do you feel like you are on your goals? What makes sense when you're going to the next person to say, "This is what I'm looking for in a therapist," that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's if we can - we can help you. Whenever we set up our last session.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm sure that you feel comfortable about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me stop there for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I started a little early, so you know why. Do you want to make a guess at a session?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but so it's either like tomorrow or, like, Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think tomorrow or the 10th?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tomorrow or next Tuesday? Is that it, or no?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Monday. Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you're - you're off that day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, Monday the 3rd is Labor Day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, oh, actually Friday. So today is the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: 27th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you're out 31st and the 3rd.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the 3rd. So we could meet, and then by 4:00 I'm here, but I'm totally</p>

<p>gone (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Friday the 7th I can meet you at 1:30. Or Monday the 10th you could sort of pick a time between 9:30 and 3:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's go with the 1:30. Let's have it at that. I've been looking at plane tickets for the 8th so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:51:37] to 00:51:46)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just didn't want to be here that long (chuckling), but I might not have a choice (inaudible at 00:51:53).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then I'll let you know. If I get a cancelation for the 4th, I'll let you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, great, all right. And if - I mean I'll let you know if the visa arrives. [00:52:14]</p>

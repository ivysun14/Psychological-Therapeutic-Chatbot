<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a really good thing that you weren't looking for consistency.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it sure was a bad day. I think trying to work hard three days in a row - it's not - I did too much work. And then, after all, I ended up just at about 8:00 or 8:30 saying that there's no way I can do any more work, going to bed, then getting up at 4:00 to study for this exam that was today. I checked my e-mail. It's 5:30, and I had gotten an e-mail six hours before that the exam's pushed off a week, so ...</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... which is - which is good because I - you know, I could've taken it and been okay, but now I can actually be prepared for it in a good way. But I just thought it was funny at 5:30 in the morning. [00:01:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that actually is - I should do that more often because I'm - I'm just much better. Once I get - once I'm awake, I'm much better in the mornings, so I - it was eas - like it was easier for me to just like sit down and kind of run through -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Get to work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Get to work. Yeah. But then I'd have to go to bed at like 8:00.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That might not be so easy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's already hard. I mean going to bed at 10:00 is already like a strain on James's and my conversation window, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Because he's an hour behind, and he stays up late and gets up late typically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. So that's sort of etched in a schedule?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And recently, they implemated - they implemented a policy in the lab that you can't work alone for safety reasons. You know, fires and explosions are always - they happen. [00:02:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, which is a good idea, but it means that he will stay in the lab as long as somebody else is there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he can't co - come back, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't want to leave somebody there by themselves.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no. No. No. I mean he - he can't come back at 2:00 in the morning to do something, so - so like he - he won't. It's hard - it's harder for him to leave at 9:00 or 9:30 to talk to me for 45 minutes because then at 10:30, there won't be anybody there, so he can't go back and finish.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, this is all like he likes to work really, really late, but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Oh, okay.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not like he's being nice to this other guy, but there's nobody else who wants to stay there that late.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Got it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I just ... [00:03:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm surprised that the chemistry labs aren't here that I've heard about. People often stay really late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, I know. But - I mean I've heard that Brown is vicious. That their - their chemistry department is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Harvard I think has good - they - I know that he's at Harvard and he seems real happy. But - and that's just James's lab happens to have people who like to get up early. An advisor, he was like, you know, humane.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What everybody's made of, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I'm kind of, you know, taking it a couple of steps back. It's getting to the end of the semester. [00:04:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, what happened yesterday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just - I - my - I couldn't make myself work for longer than about half an hour at a time. And then I'd take a break that would turn into a longer break, and I'd go back to work. And I was - I was just - you know, it was - it just kind of gradually getting lower all day. And I was - you know, if my mood had been my first priority, I would've said at about 11:00, okay, I'm not - maybe that seems selfish, maybe like 2:00, okay, I'm not getting anything else done today because it's just gonna send me spiraling downward really fast, so I'm gonna take the rest of the day off, but I couldn't afford to do that. So I tried to like manage it and push through, and in the end, I - I couldn't do that at all. [00:05:03]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it just really didn't work. And that - I got really upset and also didn't do any work. I mean it was - I didn't have classes. I had a morning breakfast and meeting - meeting with a visiting scholar, who's, you know, well-known, who - sometimes when women scholars come in, there's like a women in religion thing, and we try to get them to go out to breakfast. So we did that. It was very funny 'cause she really wanted to talk about these like grandchildren that she'd like, you know, or the kids of one of the junior faculty and really didn't want to talk about work at all. [00:05:48]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that lasted a long time. And then soon - at then I was, you know, in a good mood and had good conversation, and as soon as I sat down to work, I just kind of started like flowing out. You know, my like concentration, my like feeling okay about myself, my, you know, feeling in control of the situation at all, just kind of (makes sound to illustrate flying off/away). I - I went over to my friend Franco's in the afternoon because I still wanted to get work done, but I - I wasn't - I didn't think I was going to be able to keep it together in the library. And I thought that I wasn't going to be able to go straight home, but I ended up canceling and just not going to the church thing that I was going to go to on the way home 'cause I - I was not (inaudible at 00:06:52). Yeah, it was one of those - nothing really happened. It just - it was just the - the strain of mental effort seemed like it was the only thing that was driving it, which is really scary for me. Now I'm thinking about, you know, what am I going to do here. What am I going to - yeah - I don't - I don't - you know, I - it got to be about like 8:00 and I said okay, I see a path where I can still take this exam and pass it and just let that happen and be fine. You know, so I'm going to go to bed and get up early and study and do it. But like in the larger sense right now, like I don't see a path where I'm going to be able to keep working. (Voice shaky and sounds upset) I don't see how I'm gonna keep up in this program. [00:08:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, when you said that yesterday, it seemed to be the strain of mental effort that was propelling your mood down, is there more you can explain about that? Like - I mean I kind of get it, but I kind of don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean I think it has to be just something to do with doing work related to my program. 'Cause like I've been reading - like the book I'm reading right now, I've been reading George Eliot. I just finished the <i>Middlemarch,</i> and now I'm reading <i>Daniel Deronda.</i> And like they're not light books, and those are relaxing for me right now. So clearly I can think. And - but it's - I mean - you know, it - it - for a while, I just - all I'm kind of conscious of is procrastinating. I just, you know, don't want to focus. I want to check my e-mail again - oh, maybe somebody left it on Facebook again, you know, every five minutes or so. And - and then it - it just it's like - it's like this - this stuff that comes with the work that I'm doing is - it's so overwhelming that I can't do the work. I don't know. I like ... [00:09:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The stuff being your worries about getting through the program or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and getting through the program like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a mistake - like mistakes are made associated with doing the work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: More all of the like anxiety and, you know, hating myself and being just terrified of what's going to happen to me and all of the other emotions just kind of come along with it now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. In a way that they don't with like <i>Middlemarch</i> or something, where you can just read it not nearly so burdened by those upper criminations (ph) and worries and stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, I mean, a couple of months, a guy would not be reading George Eliot, so, you know, that's good. [00:10:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I mean I guess it's ... specifically related to this, but ... I don't know. Conversations are also really hard for me right now. Like ... yeah, it's either I can't think of anything - like any other - the next thing to say in the conversation or I stop paying - I stop kind of exercising very rigid control over what I am saying and have a real conversation. That's great. And then it's over, and I just like start picking apart everything I said and hating myself. That's - that - that actually just happened with a friend after class. We had this really good conversation about, you know, bringing up space commitments within a historical critical class and whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. We've been like studying history of the Bible, you know, people should - the way they're bringing up like the issues of space that go along with the field is a good thing in the classroom, which is a huge topic and it's interesting and really good conversation. And then as soon as I was like, "Okay, I have to go now," I was like "Fuck," ... [00:12:04]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... what were you thinking.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. What were you thinking as in what were you thinking throughout the course of the conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said that year had - yeah, just everything that I said was just so stupid. Tanya, what are you thinking, you know, and you talk too much.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tend to get enthusiastic and talk over people, and I have to kind of be very conscious about listening in conversations. But, I don't ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I guess really lash out at yourself after?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not in relationship to the feedback that I'm getting from other people though, because of my - my catching my - that I - myself - that I'm talking too much happens before the other person - often I think happens before the other person. It feels like I'm talking too much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:13:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Voice shaky and getting upset) Sorry, I'm not - I don't - I don't have a good handle on like a thread to pull right now to - it's just - I just feel really bad, and I don't have a way to - to pick it apart that is easy for me, so I'm down to doing a step ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're feeling discombobulated and at loose ends here in how you're talking about what's been going on and that lack of coherence that you feel about how you're talking is something you're very critical of yourself for? [00:14:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a sort of a performative way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That was very good.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just really impressed that you got all that.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly how I would've liked to have put it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we had the same thought that apparently you're feeling like one of us could do it.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's so dire? Do you know what's so dire about feeling like you can't do that right now? [00:15:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, this is the only time I have to talk to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so if you can't - but - so do you mean like the conversation will be less worthwhile if you're less organized?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that is what I'm thinking or what I'm not obviously, consciously thinking 'cause I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - but yeah. You know, if - if I just sit here and am miserable and can't articulate any of it, then we're not really going to get very far.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or maybe not.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's therapy, you know, like. I guess ... that means there - [00:16:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're not gonna get as far or I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that's certainly how you feel about it anyway.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean in other words, it's like - I'm not sure that it's when people are more together that it's more helpful than therapy per say. I mean I don't think those correlate necessarily, but I wonder if what's going on is - I mean the way you're presenting it is like - I - I'm gonna be like I guess a little - I don't know something that - where it's sort of the forces of like civilization versus the forces of chaos, where when you feel like you're more chaotic and can't pull it together and be, you know, clear, more coherent, get at what feels like it matters the most in a kind of a more articulate way, you feel like a mess, and you feel really mad at and down on yourself, and like the forces of chaos have won or something like that to be a little probably silly about it. [00:18:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think that's being silly. Yeah, I just - or that - it's that I - I'm not moving toward getting better at that moment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like more - like constructive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm wondering if there's a bit of an undertow, like a kind of a (inaudible at 00:18:44) there 'cause maybe you all just want to be taken care of in whatever shape you're in, and not have to work so hard and make such an effort to pull it together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but people - you know, you can't take care of me unless I know - let you know how to, you know, is the way that I tend to feel - approach being taken care of ... which is problematic. [00:19:20]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what was your (inaudible at 00:19:21)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, which is problematic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure that's true. Like if I think of, for example, a younger child, they can't let you know how to take care of them. They just fall apart, you know, or throw a fit, or ... do whatever they're going to do. [00:20:03]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it matters that you would really want it to work that way, where I really think it's up to you to let - to like to take a fair amount of the responsibility for making sure that you communicate about what you need and what you're upset about and what's going on and how things - and how things are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's more - it's been my experience that if I can't communicate it, it doesn't happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. That's bad. [00:21:04]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you have in mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean certainly - I mean certainly with therapy. Always.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With, you know, being in the hospital when - that was entirely an experience of, you know, my getting the wrong kind of treatment, making a big fuss about it, and then getting the right kind of treatment. Saying no, I need this, not this. And the only reason that - as far as I could tell, the only reason that I got what I needed was because I could say, "I need this." You know, with my relationship with James it's like - it's very much about trusting one another to say what we need. And, you know, ... yeah - which - I mean I - I - the kind of my taking care of him there I just remember the first time that he got really sick when I was with him. It was just really rough because I don't - I' m not good at taking care of people who are sick, - [00:22:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and like he really needed for me to take care of him, but he needed not to have to articulate that, and that was like, that never happened. (Laughter) I just like dropped the ball.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And - and - yeah, so, since then - but it's - and we're still working on what we do when James gets sick because he's kind of a mess. (Laughter) Like he's the person who gets sick and they can't get out of bed. I'm the person that like when I get sick, I'm miserable, but I'm still functioning, so - [00:23:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - but, yeah - well, - I don't - I have a pattern for I don't get what I need unless I can talk about it. I don't have a pattern for if I don't talk about it, it happens. I don't - I don't have - like I don't have a memory of that. That's just not how things work in my experience.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, then that's not fair to James in that - in particular in the last six months, he - I mean - yeah. He - he does - he does a whole lot to take care of me. Yeah, like he did all the dishes all week when he was staying with me. That was a big deal (laughter), for me anyway. [00:24:38]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just real - I - yeah, he was the one that went out and said, "Oh, we should have a crisis plan," and developed a crisis plan with - along with Franco and Franco's mom is a psychologist, and, you know, was like, "Oh, well, you could try this one." I said - and - you know, and said, "Like okay this is - this is how we can take care of it." Yeah. I mean - [00:25:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she in this area?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, she's in Texas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have the impression that ... when he has taken initiative like that without your asking, it's really nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I suspect it makes you really feel taken care of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I understand is not the same as not - you'll always be able to count on that happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's un - it's not expected. I don't expect it. Yeah. [00:26:08]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not surprised by it anymore from him, so, you know, that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it one of the things that you love about him that he'll do that when he can?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you ever had that before? [00:27:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine - I guess I'm saying I imagine it feels kind of novel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My - you know, actually the - the people that I really remember being that way were my - my friends in high school - were the people who really and still do, I mean, just kind of - yeah, anticipate or anticipate one another's needs. Like that was - that was a really good thing. Yeah, I mean there were three of them, and I have - they were three of my bridesmaids, so - or my three bridesmaids, so like obviously like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But that - I mean that - it's not something I associate with my parents certainly. And Amanda takes care of me more than I miss her, but - but I mean she didn't certainly when we were children in - I mean in life partly because she was raising my little brother.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like she kind of had her hands full. I - but, I mean - I certainly don't feel like I have a right to expect that, and - it - and so, you know, I don't feel like it's realistic to expect it from, you know, most people. [00:28:47]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>[00:29:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No - I mean like - where do you sort of focus most on making sure that you kind of bring to the table whatever you need to? [00:30:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which - at - the problem with that, I'm really used to seeing the big progress because I feel like I have a right to tell people what I need.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that was a long time coming.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It just seems foolish to ask for more.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, to tell you the truth, I think it's worse.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that - I think there are times when you need more, or you certainly really want it, and it's not even really your decision whether you're gonna sort of decide to or feel entitled to ask for it or not, you know? Like - you know, like if you're in here but say really upset just as an example and feeling like you ought to be more pulled together, wishing you were more pulled together, feeling like it's your responsibility to be more articulate about what you're struggling with or more understanding of it or something like that, and you're just not in the moment. You know? Like, that wasn't a decision you made to be that way. It's just where you're at. And I - I - I guess part of what you're making clear is what a vulnerable position that is for you to be in. [00:31:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, I guess vulnerable is the word.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like I just want to, but I - I - I take your point also about how big a deal it is to be able to like feel all right much of the time to be able to ask for what you want, that in fact like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wanting to ask for what I want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Go ahead. Sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I may have said I feel like I have a right to ask for what I need.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Fair enough.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Point taken.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Overtalk at 00:33:04). I don't mean to (inaudible at 00:33:11) as a like a big deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. It's okay. I was just saying it by the wayside. There's nothing you can do about it now.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: One - I mean that's what's so frustrating about this depression is I have no idea what I need. I can't figure it out. And I feel like it's incumbent on me to and not on somebody else to, you know, or at least to be the person who's constantly asking. I mean asking, "Okay, what do I need now? What do I need now?" But ... [00:34:11]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, I just feel really helpless, but ...</p>

<p>(Pause) [00:35:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it - I am embarrassed that I forgot this. I - so, last night was not good. I was talking to James. It was a good talk. But I said I am really scared that I wanted to kill myself. I am always scared that I'm going to kill myself. And then I told him that I had talked to you about that ... so ...</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you just remembered?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Uh, that kind of encapsulates my life right now.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:36:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It - it encapsulates your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean that - that story.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I got it. Be - be happy because ... how.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That combination of really, really scary and really absent minded. Yeah, it's like I'm so scared all the time that I forget about it, or I can't remember to do the - I mean I'm just, you know. I spent all day yesterday trying to get a refill on a prescription that gives me withdrawal symptoms if I don't refill it right away, and at the last minute, I left Franco's house to go to the pharmacy and then to the subway. I just went straight to the subway. I just forgot. So I just picked it up now, but, you know, I'm always kind of like that, but I'm really, really sad right now. [00:37:19]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think there's probably some pretty important stuff there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Crying) Yeah. I don't know what to do with it. I mean I don't - I don't know what to say other than what I just said.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:38:00]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, okay. So we started a little late. We've got five minutes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm glad I didn't remember it five minutes from now.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're scared all the time that you're going to kill yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All the time is an exaggeration. A whole lot of the time though. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are the kinds of thoughts you have? [00:38:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That some of the things stopping me in the past aren't stopping me anymore. That - I mean physically being helpful about the future. I don't - that - that's always been the thing stopping me. You know, I don't - I've always kind of felt like, "Well, if I can just get over this hill, then the other hills will be smaller." And I don't ever feel like that anymore. I don't feel like it's a hill. I feel like it's - it's always gonna just keep going up.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm scared because I don't want to, but I also really do want to. And, you know, this - it's kind of an analogous way to - I want to stop cutting myself, but I don't throw away the exacto knife. And, you know, I want to hold on to that. You know, I want to have that option. The - and I come with other, you know, justifications like, well, I bought it because I was using it to make - actually making crafts, and that would be a waste, but that's not - it's not the reason. Yeah, I'm - I'm scared because the very good reasons for not killing myself go out of my head for long periods of time. You know, right now, the main reason is that I'm married to James. I took a vow. Part of that vow is being with him. I take that really seriously, but I forget about it a lot. [00:41:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like there is a terribly destructive part of yourself that makes you forget about the things like that that you live for that keep you alive - that keep you alive or that forgets about other things like the medication that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't feel like - I mean if - if there were like a destructive part of myself that would be a presence. I mean it's more like an absence. I don't - I don't know if that makes any sense. [00:42:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it doesn't feel like any part of you? It feels like it's something that just kind of happens that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or like forgetting about what's good more so than a ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the - like - like the (inaudible at 00:42:30) basically. Or I feel like my mind is like two, but it can't - I just get - you know, I've - I've - I've - I live so much in my present situation, whatever that happens to be, that everything else gets pushed out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you're so absorbed with where you're at that things just kind of go away? [00:43:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if that's feeling bad, then your reason for staying alive kind of just kind of go away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But I mean - but a huge part of what is scary for me is that even when I'm not feeling particularly bad - when I'm not in distress, I - I don't remember why I'm not killing myself. I just - be like, "Well, I don't feel bad enough right now, so here we are." That's about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ... yeah, I don't like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. We can stop for now, but we'll talk more next week. Yeah, and let me know if I may need to touch base - touch base before Wednesday. [00:44:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

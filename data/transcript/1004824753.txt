<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Here. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I've never in my life seen...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're closer to the city. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow, I take it as good luck. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, before we kind of get started, I've got to ask you something kind of unrelated. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I don't know if you would have any tips, but—so my uncle—you know, the whack-job and my uncle and all that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Their oldest son—my cousin is 21, I think, or 22, and for five years, they've been having, like, really serious problems with him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, like, my poor uncle is just like—he almost can't even talk about it anymore. He gets, like, kind of teary-eyed...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So my—he's fine. My cousin is very, like, presentable. He is very sweet. He is smart. He's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But, for whatever reason—I think starting, like, in his last year of high school—like, he didn't go to college. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He says he is kind of trying to get a job, but he hasn't gotten one. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm? [00:00:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, he basically just stays at their house and just, like, plays video games and, um—[pauses] he says kind of—he—he has that kind of, like, fantasy, like, he wants—he says he's writing; he wants to be a writer or a rapper or something, which, I mean, of course, I can relate to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like, they're just at their wits' end. They don't under—so—and it is causing tension between him and his wife. Like, basically, now they're kind of not separated, but I guess she can't even be in the same house, like, she is so... [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't know what the hell. I don't know why that woman is a counselor, but, you know, she is pretty icy a little bit, and, um, very into, like, status and hard work. And, you know, there is no fucking around. You just put your mind to something, and you don't change; you just fucking do it and—you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she feels disdain for him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, she's really—she can't..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is destructive (ph)? </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...She can't even handle being around him. I mean, the one thing I can understand what she is saying, though, is that she is like—she's got to do something. Like... [00:02:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like, she said, "I gave up on school or this or that, but, I mean, not even a job or not some sense of—like, doesn't even want to make a little money for himself or have some semblance of -"—[pauses]—like other people want to move out of their house or get their own place, or, you know, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, because of that, it is causing—and my uncle is a very—you know, he and I are very similar in the sense that he's just a very—he just wants everyone to be OK, and he's very sweet, and he tries to be kind of patient with everybody and tr—[slaps hands in lap] you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just thought—because, yesterday—or the day before, he just looked—he just could not even—I don't know; it is like I could tell it has gotten to the point where—so I don't know. I was—in my mind, I was like, "Maybe she will—maybe she's dealt with something." And, of course, the thing is he's an adult. Right? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:02:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, at first, I was like, "Oh, there are those things where they come in the middle of the night, and they take him out to the West, and they do, like, a roughing it." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I—I don't know—sick of desperate thing, but then I was like, "Yeah, but he's over 18. You can't—you can't do shit like that." [Sniffles] And my uncle's like, "What am I—like—what?—I'm going to just kick this kid out of the house and not give him any mon —?" I mean, he's like, "I can't. I just can't do that, you know?" He's like, "I've already clamped down. He just has him the basics—some gas money, and there's food in the fridge, but," he's like, "I don't give him any exorbitance." You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was like, "I don't -"—and like, "What?" And the thing is, every time I've interacted with him, or any of us, he's a sweetheart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Very polite, very, like, endearing and, um, just a very sweet kid—you know?—so I—I don't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Is he seeing someone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a girl?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, a therapist. [00:03:57] </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because they can't even—I mean, they've even done that. They've been, like, "William, you know, we'll go with you, or if you want to talk"—just, like, they've—I mean, I give them credit for that. They're really—they've tried, especially my uncle, who is like anything, anything. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, and he's refusing to go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, he—I guess he said that, "I've looked online at all the things. You know, I don't think I have any -"—you know. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, what do you do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who cares if he has a diagnosis or not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! Oh, yeah. My...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe he has some things that have gone on. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. That's what my uncle is saying. He's like, "Something—we just cannot figure out," because he's so normal, like at...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So—and, like, what do you do? You can force someone to go to therapy or to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you can. I mean, you ca...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really? [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In that he is financially dependent on them. So, you know, if I were working with a family...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For example, if the parents came in to get parent guidance, you could eventually say, "If you want to live under this roof..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ..."These are the conditions for that to happen."</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe that's a strategy for him—for them to go and see someone like you? [00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Get—get a consult—exactly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Say, "This is what's going on." Like a family therapist kind of thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It—and it could even start as just a consultation to the parents about, "This is what's happening with our son. What do we do next?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, because they'd probably need some fucking help, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see what you're saying. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And—and the—so it might be that it eventually turns into family therapy, but it could also be that the therapist just helps them set up contingencies and start...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a plan, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Creating...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...[inaudible due to crosstalk at 00:05:24]...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Yeah, 'cause I think they just don't know—and it is causing—because—so they bought a condo near, kind of, like The Plow (ph). You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, basically, she—because it is right near their clinic...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So she stays there, basically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He goes back. Like, it is just not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is not a good situation. You know? [Sniffles] But, anyway, I just—I felt so bad, like he just—you know. Because, really, it would be one thing if they were being douches. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:05:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean? Like, "We—you have to go get a four (ph)—" My uncle is like, "Dude," he's like, "I was like 'I'll pay for one class—one—one class, anywhere. I don't even care where it is—school extension, whatever. Just one anything! Take anything, any class. You know, just go'." He's like, "And -"—like, my uncle is like [secretly saying] (ph), "Well, I don't understand what he's doing. Don't you want to meet girls?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like, "I don't understand. Don't you want to —?"—like, it is exciting, like this time in your life. He's like, "We're giving this kid everything. We're paying, like -"—you know, I can hear his, "We didn't have any of that, you know, 'cause we've worked so hard," and it is like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It just doesn't make sense. I don't know. Anyway... [shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is such a common reaction, more for the next generation, to lose drive...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...When the parents have been able to provide them with everything so naturally. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. They don't know what it was like. Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess their feeling is that, you know, "Our other two kids are somehow doing something." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The girl—I mean, my cousin, the youngest one—she goes to a local college; she has a part-time job; she's in all these clubs, and she's like her mom, kind of. [00:07:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the middle one is [pauses]—you know, he's like, "Whatever, man, yeah, going to school." [Chuckles] You know, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."Who cares?" You know, they're footing the bill; just go and have a good time. It is not a big—it is just an undergrad degree, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or anything—work at Starbucks. I don't know. When he says he—he goes, but he doesn't hear back from them. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, anyway—OK, so that's—that's good to know. So they have options to see somebody. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably the best way to start...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...For them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Isn't it crazy that she wouldn't think of that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: How—I—I don't understand how this woman is a counselor. I don't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although, it probably is a kind of narcissistic insult to actually have to go to talk about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but she's just—I mean, having the (ph)—now she helps people with eating disorders. Poor—these poor girls, and she is so like—I don't think she's ever had a psychological issue. I mean—I don't know. It is just there's something...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [She's not warm] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Not at all, not at all. I mean, I could see her being a psychiatrist. [00:08:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, maybe show up, "OK, you need these meds," and—yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway, [shifts in seat] yeah—but [sniffles]—so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, that's—thank you. That's good to know. Maybe that'll give them some hope. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat, drums fingers] [Sighs] Um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Taps surface] I'm just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: First, we were on me, then we were on the turkey, then we're on your cousin, and now we're on you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. [Taps surface] I'm still pretty good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still pretty good. I'm feeling a little restless, still, a little excess energy or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm—you know, I'm good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [sniffles] [clucks] I [pauses]—it has just been a weird dating thing. This other girl—remember, I told you I had some dates lined up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:08:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: This other girl that was kind of similar to Gwen, where we kind of talked online, and we just kind of, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we've been out twice. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is so awesome. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, she—way more than Gw—like, I actually [pauses]—this was the first time in a long time I feel kind of butterflies. I feel kind of nervous and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, she's really, really cool—really, really cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It felt different than Gwen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] With Gwen, it just feels nice and adult, and [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not the first date. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was awesome. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it is awesome. It is awesome with Gwen, but, yeah, there isn't that, like—you know when you really—like, the butterflies, and you can't stop thinking about someone, and you're just kind of craving them. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is pretty fucking cool. Um, yeah, we just had a great time. And she's really cool and, um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's also very honest. Like, you know—the thing is she's a little more quiet; she's not a big texter or e-mailer, so that's a little [clucks]—you know. [00:10:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But then, when she does—like yesterday, I think, or the day before, she sent me a text. It was like, you know—we had just gone out the day before, and she's like, "I really wish I could see you today." You know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's like, "You know, I haven't—it has been like a while or forever that I've met someone who has all the qualities that," like, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was very sweet, you know. She's, like, really, really cool. She has a little boy, [pauses] but I don't care, so that's cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't care. No, I really like this girl. Like, she's really, really cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it is an—obviously, if it went that far, yeah, that's an adjustment, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So what? Like, she's amazing, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, oddly, her stepmom is Assyrian-...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...-American. She doesn't really know Assyrian, but that's kind of cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] But, yeah, so I don't know. It has been weird. It has been like a weird dating period. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Good dating period. [Pauses] [Sniffles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gwen—I don't know if you remember it felt kind of magical after the first date. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was really cool. I mean, it is—I think what's happening is I sense some—like I was telling you, I sensed something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what is—I just—something is—she's not that responsive. She's not being very, kind of, flirty or—I don't know. It is just something—something is going on, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] So that's making me, like—and, also, like I said, things are different now, so I know enough to know that first date [pauses]—you can't bank everything on that, the feeling of a first or second. Even—and even with, um, Lucy. I mean, I know—I'm not getting ahead of myself; I'm just—but I do know that I—I feel way more excited and butterfly-y than with Gwen, definitely. [Sniffles] [00:12:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, [pauses] mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, with Gwen, I was just relieved that I was like, "Wow, this is awesome, and it is normal, and -"—you know, all that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. But then you became disenchanted. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The talk, the blath—talking a little too much, the—some—there seems to be a little bit of a distance. I don't know. I don't know what's going on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm not writing it off, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Whereas, with Lucy, I know what it is. She was even like that before we went on dates. Like, it takes her a while to get back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's not a huge texter. She's not that big of an e-mailer. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Things are very—even—and, in person, she's actually pretty quiet. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, in the beginning, I was like, "Ah," you know, but then it was awesome. It is like, "Oh, shoot, we just get to chill out," and [slaps hands in lap] we don't have to constantly chit-chat. Like, we can just be together, you know, and just hang out and—you know. [00:13:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, like, on our second date, it was really cool. Like, she just took my hand and she held my hand. Then she, like, put her arm through my arm, and it was just very—I don't know—it just felt really good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think I like her because I can tell she's super picky. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I can tell she's—I think she's a good mom, and she's, like, not—she doesn't really date much or whatever. And she's really focused on her work and everything, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm/ </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Ah, I kind of like that, like I—'cause I feel like that's kind of like how I am. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is like I want to date, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, I don't really like people that much, and I'm focused on stuff I'm doing, and—you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Mm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know; we'll see. [Sniffles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. I'm trying not to get too—because I can tell, with her, I definitely—I already have those feelings of, like, I really just want this to work out, and what if it doesn't, and... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:14:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like, a—you know? I haven't felt that in a long time. [Sniffles] So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is an interesting place to get into 'cause it is—you also can get there before knowing her well yet. Like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Maybe you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Maybe I won't like her. Yeah, I know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Maybe you won't like her, and she'll like you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I know that's part of the fear of [being strong] (ph) like you, but the—what—you don't know yet what's going to be a little bit disenchanting...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And that that's inevitable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] Right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm not—like, I haven't been losing sleep over it or anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when I think of her, it is all good, like I don't—and, yeah, like you said, I'm like, "Well, look, I mean, she's just a person, and I may end up not liking her, or just"—right now, it is just—it just seems great, but, you know... [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, I mean, I'm definitely trying not to get carried—I think—but it also just feels good. I haven't felt—it takes a lot for me to kind of have butterflies or be kind of, you know—so it feels nice. [00:15:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Said quietly] You just want to feel again. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, [pauses] hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] [Fidgets with object] The other cool thing that happened—last night, my friend Luke, who is around my age or maybe a little older—he's like a local music guy. He has a pretty good band and stuff, and he was here for two days, so he texted me and a bunch of people, who are all kind of like in this scene or whatever, to meet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I went to see him, and do you know what was really cool? Like, so all these kind of—they're good people; they're not—the other people aren't bad people; they're good. I don't know them as well, but they're good people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But g—I could not believe how genuine Luke was about my music. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, he—in front of, like—it was really kind of cool. I felt really shy, but it was also really cool. Like, there were kind of looking at, like—kind of like some hipster chicks, some people were standing around, and he just went off on it. He's like, "Have you heard Brian's new stuff?" [00:16:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They're like—and somebody was like, "Oh, yeah, you have a Facebook. Yeah, I checked him out on the Web." They said whatever, and he was like, "Dude," he was like, "Brian, I'm not shitting you." He's like, "I've been wanting to tell you this, like, in person." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like, "We all have a lot of friends who will have bands, but as I do, when I listen to those songs, I don't think of you. Like, I think of any band that just gives me, like, the shivers. You know? Like I just..." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: and I was just, like, "That's the greatest fucking -"—especially in that crowd, 'cause I could tell some of the people were, like, 'cause it is almost not cool to be so, you know, gushing and genuine, you know, 'cause they're all kind of artsy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hide your true feelings. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, and also because some of them are in bands, or some of—you know, they're artistic people or whatever. You know? And, uh... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was really cool, 'cause I could tell some of them were, like, "Yeah, it is good." You know, they're like, "Wow." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was awesome. Like, Luke was like, "Dude," he's like, "It is the real deal." [00:17:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like, you know, "When I listen to those songs, I just—I feel that intangible thing that I feel when I listen to any band, that I just really love." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "You know, let the song just do something to me." You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is like, "Wow, man, that's—that' s an awesome feeling." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gushing with love for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, very...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Genuine love for the music. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Very genuine, yeah, yeah. And he kind of wouldn't let me—because I felt really shy, so I kept trying to hide. When I feel that way, I just keep turning it around, usually, so I was like, "Yeah, I'm looking forward to hearing your new stuff." He's like, "Nah, nah, nah, it is whatever."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: He kept, like, turning it back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He didn't let you run away from it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, really good guy—really, really good guy. [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, it was—that was awesome. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I wondered—I think it was last week—at the end of last week, you were talking about Gwen and being disappointed that she hadn't, um, recognized enough of the achievement of your... [00:18:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Um, accomplishing—meeting your goals, exceeding your goal, and also just not—wasn't really...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Expressing enough of being excited about what—your accomplishments. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, like, or even the book. You know, she sent me one text..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That was like, "I'm reading your book now," with a smile or whatever. Well, that's great but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Yeah, it just didn't—yeah, I don't know. I don't know what that is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It made me also wonder if that wasn't something you might be feeling here, too, at some level, because I was aware when you mentioned that you sent the videos to me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, at that point, I hadn't watched them yet, and I was thinking, "Why haven't I watched them yet?" [Pauses] And I think the reason is that I sort of didn't know how to bring them in here yet, because it is so important to me that stuff gets brought into this space. Um, so I finally watched them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] But I—you know, I wonder, first, is it feeling that way here, too, like, why hadn't I said anything? [00:19:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not at all. No, no, no. No, because I—you know, I mean—you know, our relationship is so—I so trust you...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I know how awesome you are, and I—I mean, I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, I don't—nah, it is not a big deal. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I have...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, also, I know that you...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...How could you not wonder, like, what was I thinking, or did I watch it/did I not watch it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know—I don't know why I don't. I don't know why. I've just—I put a thing on that. I just [pauses]—I think maybe it is because I know how excited you are when I do well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I can tell it is very genuine, so I don't really sweat it. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>[Sound of an unidentified voice, possibly recording or background]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also think part of it is that I don't think it is my job here to be [pauses]—my judgment is not actually going to help you. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Our role, in the long run, is for you to know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. Well, maybe that's the other thing, too... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I just feel bad if] (ph)... [00:19:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't really need—I mean, I'm not looking at anybody to gush or, you know. I'm—I've kind of—I've gotten way better with that. I know that I'm good; I know this [chuckles] because we're fucking awesome. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't need to—you know, I think it is more just about—not with you, but friends or girlfriends, or whatever—it is just more about—I just know how—everything is about reciprocation [pauses] with me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that—I'm very sensitive to that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, so if I'm with you, and we're having drinks, and I'm asking things about you...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I'm listening—you know, letting you—and then there's nothing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there's no give and take...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That really annoys me. Or if you've done something, and I've—I'm, like, celebrating with you, or I'm giving you compliments, or—you know, that—that really annoys me when people aren't, like, "Dude, you just raised $5,000. Like, how did you do -?" Like, even just feigned enthusiasm—I don't know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that just annoys me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? [Shifts in seat] Um, so that's—that's more what it is. I feel confident, but now—now, it is a matter of almost, like, politeness and respect, and just reciprocity. [00:21:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, one of the things you're describing is when someone's own stuff gets in the way of their being able to—to see you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And be complimentary if that's what they feel. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, if they have to be too cool...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just genuine, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or they're too self-absorbed, or they're...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. That's what I love about Luke and Dave. Like, a couple of these friends I have, who are in this—whatever—fucking scene it is, but, you know, they're cool, I'm cool, we're all cool, but we're also just genuine. There's no—you know, if someone locally does something amazing, I'm going to say it is amazing. I don't give a shit 'cause I—I know that my stuff is amazing, too; they're just different kinds of things, and who gives a shit. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and that's—yeah, that's why Luke—like, he really took me back with that. Like—I mean, I knew he was that kind of guy...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But I just didn't expect that much, like—it was as if he had waited to just tell me this in person. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. It is almost something he wanted it to be public. [00:22:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Fidgets with object] Yeah, kind of. Yeah, 'cause his thing was, "Have you guys heard?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, "Have you heard this guy's fucking songs?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They're like, "Yeah," you know. [Chuckles] They're just like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses]—and—but then we event talked about that. We were, like, "Yeah, you know, the local scene is like -"—I was like, "There's a lot of this [probably makes a gesture]."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I was like, "It is very rare that people like you or certain other people—it is not all that; they step up and they support, and they care, and they spread the word, and they just genuinely embrace." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like, "No." He's like, "Yeah, absolutely." He's like, "There's just a lot of [pauses] [slaps hands in lap] posing and a lot of mimicking, and a lot of just people—you know, people just want to be seen and be—they want attention, and they, you know, didn't want to share that with anybody." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So [sniffles]—or Luke was like, "Or it is just like they're not that good." He said, "That's what I was saying. We know a lot of people in bands—right?—but—and, of course we go see them in shows, and we support them, and we say, 'Hey, good job,' but, let's face it, it is not—it doesn't move us. It is not like that's what we think of when we want to listen to music." [00:23:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's like saying, "I have your shit on regular playlists on my, you know, iPad or whatever." He's like—and he said even the recent record—I still have that—I listen to it all the time." You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then that made me think of—my friend, who always plays that record. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, he is a musician—he's a good musician. Like, these are good people. He doesn't have to do that. So [clucks] that's just really cool. [Fidgeting with object, possibly lighter]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>[Silence for 11 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] So—so that was cool. And one of the cool things was one of the chicks that was there is—has been on Skype, and we're Facebook friends but we don't really know—like, I don't even know how we became friends. I think it is because we have so many mutual friends that we kind of friended each other, I think; I don't know what happened. [Shifts in seat] That was kind of cool because I was—I kind of had a virtual crush on her. [00:24:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it is kind of cool for her to just be standing. And when I—I was like, "So [slaps hand in lap] are you Tricia?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Her name is Tricia. [Slaps hands in lap]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So we met officially and everything, so it was just awesome to just have her [chuckles] stand there while Luke's [slaps hands in lap]—and she loves Luke. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That was really cool. I was like, "Yep, I'm all right with this." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: All right with this. [Fidgets] [Sniffles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, he brags about you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, he brags about you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but—but just very genuine, like, you know—yeah, just a really good guy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>[Silence for eight seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had so little of that as a kid. [00:24:56] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah, [mumbles] I know. And it is funny because, now, it feels good when my mom is so cool now about—but, yeah, it is, you know, [clucks]—it is what it is. You know? It doesn't necessarily make up for anything, you know. [Pauses] [Sniffles]</p>

<p>[Silence for five seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I—I'm—my memory, right now, of her just—I think I'd forgotten for a little bit that she was a writer herself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she's a writer. She actually was engaged to a violinist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: My aunt's an opera singer. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it is part—it is part of her, too. I'm just reminds me of that community of—in competitiveness. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're just like other people who are artists, and there are so many levels of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are a lot of levels. Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How she...</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't me to be heard or be e-mailed (ph). She—because she—and I—from her perspective, it is a thankless—you're going to go nowhere. Nobody cares. You're not going to make it in...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I think that, now, what is happening is she's like—first of all, I think my stubbornness is just worn her down. [00:26:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I think, also, she's like, "Jesus, this—I mean, he's really..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I might not get it, but this is real. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, yesterday, an interview with me just came out in a UK website. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...A really good website. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's really good. It is like a really in-depth interview. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my goodness!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I brought, you know, the videos, even the songs—she's like a...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that was for music? Not writing (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, for the record. [Shifts in seat] Yeah, my—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ahhh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he was great. He talked about the poetry and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...He was very thoughtful, you know. But—yeah, but my mom is—"Yeah, it is cool." Like, she'll listen to the songs, and she'll be like, "Ah." She's, like, very genuine. It is like, "I just wish I understood the lyric." You know, she can't make out the lyrics, you know, because her English is good but, in songs, it is kind of hard. Just like with me in Assyrian; I can kind of make out what they're saying, but if they're not really being clear and using...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, it is so hard. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmmm. [00:26:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she's very—yeah—no, it is cool. Like, she's been pretty awesome about it, but [pauses] [clears throat]—yeah, that's one of those things where it is like it doesn't make up for all those years of stuff. You know, so you've just got to take it in the gesture that it is given. Yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She may not have wanted you to feel the pain of it not working out. She—she may also have not wanted you to feel, or not wanted herself to feel what if it did. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, like overshot, like so much she'd lose me. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She'd lose you if she had?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is—her own thwarted artistic efforts. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I—you know, I'm not saying that's been in her conscious mind, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although, even—the funny thing about that is I'm—I've always encouraged her—always, always. I mean, I bought her a freaking laptop to get—and she hasn't done it. You know, I think she just feels kind of done. You know? And that's cool if she is, but... [00:28:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you have encouraged her, but she—she's the go. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, there's a...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah. No, I'm sure she has some kind of—yeah, I have no doubt. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it is like the way you would feel years ago in looking at someone who was pushing hard and making it work in some way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. And, actually, you're right because I still kind of feel that way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, if I go to, like—you know, when I see these, like, indie-whatever acts that are, like, doing well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Oh, especially the ones that come out of nowhere, that really—I've got to say that really annoys me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "This band formed in 2011." It is like, "Are you fucking kidding me? Now, they're, like, on the moon. What?!" Like, that kind of shit does really annoy me, where there's somebody that is the flavor of the month, and—for some rea—I don't even know how that—I don't know. That really [chuckles] annoys me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, now I—at least I know that I'm [slaps hands in lap] doing my thing, and I'm sure it is going to be—I'm very confident in it. You know? [00:29:01]</p>

<p>And I also know enough now to know those kinds of bands come and go, and they're just little flavor-of-the-month things for two year or a year, or whatever. Um, [pauses] [clucks] but—yeah, so I see what you're saying. Yeah, like, if...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She may have felt a competitive ending for you, too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right, right. Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, not that that's only it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Fidgets with an object]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But another layer of not—a reason not to encourage. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. </p>

<p>[Silence for seven seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean—which is why I give her, I guess, more credit now, 'cause she somehow dealt with the—I don't know what she's doing, but she's somehow—she is very excited and very—you know, she's—when I told her, like—she's like, [fidgets with an object] "So what will happen now?" Like, she still kind of doesn't understand what is this money for—you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And which I don't blame her; it is a very new—well, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm-hmm. [00:29:57] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but when I said that, "Well, you know, we'd have to go on a little tour, maybe like two weeks in Europe or—you know, we've got to get out there," you know, she was a little bit like, "[Warily] Mmm." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She didn't say anything, but she was like—[chuckles] I can sense her, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: 'Cause that—you know, she still thinks that clubs like these nefarious...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I think she doesn't quite get that it is not like 1968 or whatever. Like, maybe there are drugs, but I—I don't see it, and I don't care even if there are. Like, people are very different now, and they're not... [drums fingers on surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] But, yeah, I think—also, part of it, I think, is, you know, "He is going to break away, and -"—like, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] [Heavily drums fingers on surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The last man of the family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Clucks] But, although, I mean, maybe what also is happening is maybe she's feeling more reassured. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:30:58] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I'm here. I've no intention of going anywhere. You know, I've even said a couple of times, even if any kind of opportunity, you know, I've said that my ideal thing is—you know, "This is home." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And if—you know, if I could be somewhere else for a month, two months, like—you know, that's—I do like that. I think it is important for me, but this is home. You know, like—so maybe that has given her a sense of, like, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>[Silence for 44 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:32:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] But, yeah, it is weird. Like, I definitely [pauses]—I feel really good, but I have, like, definitely excess. And I think maybe just, after the Kickstarter thing, like, I feel...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know how I was, like, constantly social networking and...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And there was, like, kind of an addictive thing about that—you know, getting some attention, and people are writing, and they're giving me money; they're talking about you; they're—so now it is like—and Luke and I talked about it. He's like, "Dude," so he's like, "Now, it is the real deal." He's like, "That—that part, you know." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like, "Now, you've got to actually do shit and, [fidgets] you know, it is a lot of the grunt work and [pauses] it is a lot of the quiet work." You know, there's no—just talking to booking people and [pauses] logistical stuff.[00:32:59] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also wonder if you could be feeling that kind of antsiness here, too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There—you know, it is easy when there is a big story to come in and tell. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And once that story is over...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Then what? Like, what is...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I've noticed, when I'm here—I mean, although I was like that before, too, but I think it was for a different reason. But, yeah, when I'm here, I can't sit on the chairs and just kind of sit there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't. Like, I wander around and, [slaps hands in lap] um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feeling anxious, do you think? Or is it—does it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, these days, it is just because I'm, like, happy. I'm kind of excited. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm excited to be here. You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, before, yeah—before, it was just that I was just topsy-turvy. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] [clucks]—now, yeah—now, it is like this kind of good, nervous ener...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like I just want to get to wherever the next—I just want to get going, you know, like... [clears throat] [00:34:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know what that looks like in here, exactly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It can also make it anxious. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] Yeah, yeah. It is that thing of, like, well, I'm not sure what to talk about if everything seems pretty good...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...This week or whatever. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>[Silence for 32 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been seeing crazy dreams, though. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not bad, but really [pauses]—like, last night, I saw a dream where [pauses]—I don't remember all the details, but, at one point, [pauses] I was, like, with some friends, and I was, like, way ahead of them. [00:35:08] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: We were walking or running; I don't know what we were doing, but—and it was maybe London. I don't where we were, but I kind of went through—into this, like, maybe alleyway and then through, like, this wooden gate, and the next thing I know, I'm behind just, like, this rickety thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm suddenly in this open space where there are, like, huge fucking tigers and [chuckles] lions. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, like, they saw me. They looked at me, they—you know, but I didn't—they didn't attack me, but, for a while, I was yelling really loudly for help. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, somehow, then I just kind of got out of there. I was like, "Well -"—I didn't [slaps hands in lap]—in a way, it was cool, I guess? Like, I didn't really lose my shit...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And they didn't attack me, um, but it was just odd. It was odd. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Were you scared in the dream? [00:35:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I woke up, I was like, "Was that because, like, Cecelia maybe was, like, licking my face or some —?" [Chuckles] I don't know. Like, what's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, not Cecelia. That's what I thought. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's magical, but she's not that magical. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nuh-uh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, was I scared?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was weird. Even when I was yelling for any (ph)—I guess I was, initially, but then I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It wasn't terror. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, it wasn't terror. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: In some ways, it was almost like off. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Holy shit, those fucking animals are huge."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it was—just yeah. [Clucks] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then there was something where we're in the same gym, where, like, then I'm in the White House? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, in, like, the back rooms. Me and—again, a couple of friends—I couldn't place who these friends were, but we were trying to figure out which rooms to go to or—we were like, "Oh, no, this is, like, off limits," or, "We've got to take these stairs," or—I don't know [chuckles] what the fuck that was, but... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Yeah, it was a ver—I've been seeing very vivid dreams with a lot of details. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Uh... [00:36:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The White House—the feeling is that you're trying to find your way through something when things were awesome (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it was beautiful. It was all beautiful. Remember that show The West Wing? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was kind of like—you know the lighting in that show?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was kind of like that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, but, like, beauty—that was beautiful—you know, like nice staircase and beautiful, like, um, [clucks] antique rugs or whatever. But—and I look at here, stuff—people, and it wasn't bad or anything. We checked, "Oh, no, we should probably go this way; they're doing something over -"...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...The President's—I don't know what we were saying, but [pauses] it was fucking weird. Yeah, strange. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I—I don't even know how I knew it was the White House. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There was no...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder why the White House. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No idea. [Pauses for four seconds] But very strange. Yeah, huh, but see—[inhales]—yeah, and do you ever—what's—what's it called when, in dreams, you have déjà vu? Do you know what I'm talking about? [00:38:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know that it has a name, but [inaudible at 00:38:07]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But that happens—right?—because I've been starting to feel like, in dreams, like, there are certain things. Like, in my waking life, like I'm starting to get confused about—"Wait a minute. Do I —?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I'll suddenly think of some image or something, and, "Wait. What? That seems so familiar."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, [pauses] yeah. Like what? Have you dreamed it before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dreamed it or—yeah, or like I feel like, clearly, I dreamed this, right? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, somehow, it seems like it is—maybe it is a recurring thing or—I don't fucking know. But [pauses] there's been some of that going on, too. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Pauses] Your mind is opening up some. There's more access, like, to even remember an image that was dreamed, that was otherwise forbidden in sleep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is your just opening channels of communication. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I—both of these dreams remind me of metaphors for starting this process. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That—you know, walking down an alleyway, and there are tigers, and what hap—you know, [claps a hand] what happens, and will you be safe? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what will the tigers be? What's at the end of the alley in the White House? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, how do you meander through this, and which ways are not allowed, and where are the barricades? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, [claps a hand] where do you end up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it is kind of what I thought. Like, for—about here and also. Yeah, just that inhales as a shiver] things are really good...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But that also means that, wow, there's all this potential and possibility, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know? That's also nerve-wracking, kind of. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Pauses] Well, even again, a dream you're in the White House. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is like you've arrived. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [00:40:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yet you're having to find your way alone. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and even with my friends, like, I'm leading, like I'm somehow ahead of them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're in front and, still, there are things ahead of you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...That are—you know, it almost doesn't mean that it is easier. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>[Silence for ten seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You pointed out I'm running a few minutes late today. You know, you're in front of me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's like your dream, too. Like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you're in front. You're the getting it right and doing it right. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, I guess. [Pauses] I think all of this is like I think I'm unnerved and, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...By—like, I'm—it is finally hitting me on a gut level—not just like an intellectual level—that, wow, I'm really able to manifest things that I want to do. [00:41:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really unusual. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, when I look around me, like, that's [pauses]—that's unnerving a little bit, to me, especially with my background. You know what I mean? I should not be able to manifest things that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's really—like, now, I'm getting it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm like, "What the fuck? I could publish the book with an easy (ph) publisher, and [pauses]—"—I don't know. Like, I wanted to be a musician, and I am. Both of them—when I was little, I said, "This is what I'm going to be." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And [sound of snapping] not only am I those things, but, like, you know, on my way to being pretty successful at those things... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Having already accomplished. You know, so that's—I think that, now, it is feeling a little unner—and the same with women. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, now, it is feeling like, wow, like I guess, you know, I'm likeable and [chuckles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...They'll think I'm desirable and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And, you know, I'm not faking it. Like, [claps hand] these chicks really like me. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think it is, um—I think that is making me feel a little bit edgy and kind of—not jittery but... [00:42:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm? [Pauses] Well... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because—because, now, there's nothing saying, "No, you suck, dude." There's not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean—or even if there is, it is a faint echo; like it is not making any dif—if I hear it, I'm like, "Yeah, whatever, " and I just go back to what I'm doing. So that's [pauses]—that's weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is a really different, as one small example, to walk in here and not be in a place of, "Oh, shit, I'm late."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I feel bad about myself."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I'm the asshole."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever—you're used to that self-critical barrage. To walk in here and have me be running...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh—wait, that's a different role (ph). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, I mean, you really weren't. It is not a big thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I—I -I get it. I get it. I get it!</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just—it was fun to just—yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, it is subtle... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But it—it is still a moment of there being, like, a whole different experience...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Even with something like being here, to be on time... [00:42:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, not only on time; it was awesome. I, like, walked. It was beautiful. I walked around. I went to [inaudible] and just sat around. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Saw a turkey. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Saw a turkey. I pet a fucking dog. Who pets a dog? Come on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah—no, something is very different. You know? So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Last night, when I saw Dave's dog—I went to pick up a snare drum—I couldn't bel—I was kind of, like, overwhelmed with loving that dog. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was, like, "Wow, I really -"—like, I wanted to, like, hug him and pick him up and shit. I was like, "What the fuck?" Really weird. I was letting him eat shit out of my hand with his fucking tongue and stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, crazy. Really, really weird. That's not—I mean, just a year ago, I would never do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tomorrow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, wait. Don't say anything—12:50, 3:10. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Got it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sweet. See you tomorrow. [Sound of keys]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>[00:44:00]</p>

<p>[Door opens and closes]</p>

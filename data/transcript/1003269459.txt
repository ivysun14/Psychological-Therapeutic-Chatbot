<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Come in. Hi, George?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice to meet you. I am Christy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nice to meet you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have a seat. I have all the paperwork to fill out and essay (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I did not get all the way through it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is okay. Which ones did you have time to get through?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is the pile I finished.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, there is so much, so much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I did not get to the essay ones.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. That one, you can bring it home if you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other one you have to complete while you are here, so if you want you can stay a little after extra at the end, or you can just come a little earlier the next time or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can stay after the second to finish that, depending on how long it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That one is pretty long. That one will take a good 30 minutes. You might want to save it for another time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Leave that, okay, for the next time, yeah. [0:01:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So how are you doing? Did you get here all right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I am doing well. Actually, I am going to Chicago State College this semester, so it is right next door.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very cool, okay. So have you been to therapy before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I have. I was actually seeing a different REBT therapist in Indiana.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is where I live. And I did not really like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The REBT?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just did not like her. It was not I did not like REBT at all or else why would I be here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just - something about the way she approached it did not rub me the right way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you let me know so then I can try to avoid that or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: She sort of focused on meditating a lot. And I am like a lot of things I thought were interesting and worth pursuing, but were not really related to why I was actually there. And it felt like she was going about it from this very indirect way that did not make sense because I am only - I am here for this semester, basically, and then I am not really sure what I am doing after that exactly, but I will get more into that in a second. [0:02:21]</p>

<p>Basically, I have been seeing her, the therapist that I saw before, for like three months or so. And I saw another therapist when I was in high school for, like, a year, but they were not an REBT therapist. And it was - I think it was cognitive; I am not really sure. I did not know anything about it then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it was not like you were lying on a couch and saying everything that happened to you from birth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. it was not like dream interpretation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter) I just want to make sure that your expectations...And since you are familiar with REBT, as far as it goes from - I am training to my personal style, is that I tend to be very active.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is what I am looking for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I am the kind of person who will interrupt you (laughter). You know, I hope it would be an enjoyable process, but it is also difficult. It is going to be challenging. [0:03:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I also want to make sure that we hit the same goals. You know, I would never be working for something that was not your goal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think it is really important that we have an alliance there, so really this is just to help you. And sometimes I may offer a hypothesis about what is going on, but I want - hopefully we will have a good enough rapport that you can tell me, "No, you are way off base."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, because I think that is important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I think so, too, to have a real dialog.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And, you know, we can discuss it. If it is something that you disagree and I feel strongly about, I will tell you, you know, more why I think that, or we can reinterpret the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So why are you here (laughter)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there is sort of bigger picture things that have been true throughout my life that I sort of want to work on and get better. And then there is a more acute issue which is why I am here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the more acute issue is that I should be a senior in college right now. I have been through three years at Oberlin College. I do not know if you know about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have heard of it. Where is that? [0:04:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is in Ohio. And I had like a mixed time there. I had some years where I did really well and some years where I did not do as well and I was very academic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Academically?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, academically. In other respects, too, but academically is what I am talking about, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I had already been on academic probation when I was a - freshman year, and then I was on it again this past spring semester, because I messed up in the fall. And basically I messed up in that I did not really - someone used this metaphor once - that getting through a semester of college is an endurance running. You need to keep all of your energy until the end.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I did really badly at that. I sort of petered out like [you get thin] (ph), and then I was like flailing around, and at the end I just had a catastrophic failure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was on academic probation. And then the same thing happened the next semester, basically, and it is basically the issues that I was having with school that led that to happen that I want to really address.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that is why I am at Chicago State College now, because Oberlin said you have to go somewhere else and take 12 credits before you can come back, which is what I am doing right now. [0:05:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, and take 12 before you can come back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then you will be going back to Oberlin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. They did not kick me out, but they said you need to like go get your shit together and then come back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is so funny. I never heard that before. (inaudible at 0:05:25).</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is a really novel approach, but I sort of like it. At least they are not making you leave forever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. How was that? Was that hard, like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really hard, because I knew that I was not doing well, but I did not know that that was really what was coming. And I found out like the end of June. I just signed a lease and moved into this, like - my dream, like, summer college house, like with my girlfriend and all my close friends, and I had to leave because I had all this conflict with my parents about that. And they obviously did not want to be paying for me to enjoy this, like, luxury that I did not rightly deserve, and it got really complicated and that is why I have been...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is all right. And all your friends are going, and your girlfriend is out there, all going to their senior year as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So yeah, it is hard. I mean your senior year is what you have been looking forward to. And I mean obviously for you, you probably were not hopefully planning on relaxing too much academically but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That was not what I was looking for. But it was hard because, for a while, when I was at Oberlin, I knew that I sort of did not really have everything figured out and that I was sort of drifting around. And I wanted to take a semester off for a while and sort of travel and like try something totally radical and different. I had a few different ideas, one of which was like doing this thing called WOOF, which is the Worldwide Organization of Organic Farmers, and they like let you stay at different farms and work and, like, travel around and not spend very much. [0:06:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I thought of doing that or traveling or doing some sort of like community service thing in New Orleans or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I also thought of a few other things, but I could not really get my parents behind it ever. And it was daunting to sort of launch into it on my own, because I did not really have any financial resources to do that, and so I never did it, even though I knew that I probably should. And then I basically said, "Well, I am just going to soldier through and sort of brush through the rest of college and just get it over with." So it was hard to think, God, I defeated my goal and I made myself add a whole other year I have to deal with. [0:07:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On top of all of the other (ph) ones.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that kind of your goal, to get out of that situation, you know, provided, like, some of the downfall of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It definitely did not help at all because it made me have a weird mindset where I was not thinking of actually doing well at anything. I was just thinking of the bare minimum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And are you declared - what was your major?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is sort of related to why I messed up in the past semester. Like I was doing all right and I would have been fine, but then I had this, like, 20-page paper due in the class. And part is this weird thing where you have to, like, declare your major in front of a board of teachers and they say, like, "Oh, we think you are ready," or "Oh, you are not ready."</p>

<p>And I had the board the same day as the last class where the paper was due and the teacher of the class was also on my board. And I missed the board because my girlfriend was supposed to wake me up and I did not, because I would stay up until like five A.M. trying to finish the paper, but I did not finish the paper. And then I was so embarrassed and petrified that I would miss my board that I did not know how to be like "Ah, I did not finish your paper either," and so I did not really talk to him about it. And then I made it even worse when I did not hand in the 20-page final paper after class. [0:08:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you did not show up for your thing because you missed up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then did not hand in the paper.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I came later and I was like, "Oh, God, I am so sorry." And then I spent all my time worrying about whether I could moderate, which is what they call getting into your department, instead of finishing the paper.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [What did there] (ph) say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because I did not talk about the paper, they were like, "Well, you can moderate next semester," and they were like really understanding and helpful, actually, which only made it worse when then everything sort of went to shit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what was your history academically in high school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, really mixed. I went to Wheaton Academy for high school, which was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you are from Chicago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am from Indiana, but I just commuted in because I could have gone to a school in Indiana, I could have gone to a few universities in Indiana, but Wheaton Academy sort of looked better to me. But I made the choice in, like, fifth grade so I did not really know what all the criteria were, and then it was sort of too late to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel like - is Wheaton Academy the one in that movie? Or is it - it is like an imitation of Wheaton Academy, or is it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sort of is, yeah. [0:09:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I feel like it might be called Wheaton Academy, like, but I do not know how they could have gotten away with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: but it feels a lot like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, yes. That is what I imagined. (inaudible at 0:09:35) public school. But I -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, or sort of like Gossip Girl.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. So -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, wait, not Gossip Girl. What is the second (inaudible at 0:09:42).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Chicago. I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it would not really have been what I had chosen if I had been 15 and making that decision, but I was not; I started in middle school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So you started and went all the way up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And it was a like - it is supposed to be like one of the top ten private schools in the country or whatever. And I did pretty well there some of the time, but then other times I was not really sure whether I wanted to do well or I felt that I did not want to do well, and so I did not want to do that well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let me ask you, I guess. Do you think the problems at school comes down to things like motivation, or is it the difficultness, organization, and that kind of stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is sort of a combination of a few different things and this is one thing that I do know a lot about, because I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the problem was with the therapist that I just saw. And the problem is definitely a lot of motivation, because I had all this rebellious time in high school, where I said I do not want to do well at high school. And part of that was because both of my parents like super-emphasized education for me and they are like "We are going to sacrifice, like, to send you to the best schools, like Wheaton," and they do - it is just sort of what they place at the forefront, and so, of course, I decided that was not what I wanted to place at the forefront.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then, that is not really how I feel now, but I am still sort of thinking about it in some of the same ways, because I then thought about a different way to think about it. But then also underneath that I am really poorly organized and I think that I do not need to do things like that sometimes, which also makes it harder for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is procrastinating a big issue?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, procrastinating is a big issue, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I mean that is something maybe that I can be helpful with and the kind of thoughts that you are having, you know, about why, when we put things off, and things like that, so that is something we can definitely work on.</p>

<p>Do you know kind of what you want to do after college? I know the job market (inaudible at 0:11:32).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it is sort of dismal. I have an idea, which is that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You never told me what your major was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. It was going to be literature, and I think it is going to be literature, but I have time to sort of think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I did not really - like I thought about being an artist or being a writer when I was in high school and that was sort of - the path that appealed to me as doing something creative, and then I thought that I am probably not really disciplined or good enough to be good at that. It is really hard. [0:12:00]</p>

<p>Something that I discovered a big passion for over like the past year and a half or so is cooking, actually. And I thought of going into that world in some way, and I sort of had this little dream of having like a food cart and selling like a Middle Eastern food.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At a food cart (laughter). That is how I imagined a chef always, but yes, that could be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought about, like, working at a restaurant and so might be becoming a chef, but I figured you have to sort of work up to that and a nice, like, way to sort of test it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you have thought at all about culinary school, things like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have and then I actually -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you watch Top Chef?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do watch Top Chef, yes. I have thought about going for real, and I almost decided not to go to college and do that. But I realize that I am not sure if that is what I want to do for the rest of my life and I do not want to sort of shortchange myself later. And so what I am doing now I think is I am going to Chicago State this fall semester. And then next spring I found like a few different like four-month cooking schools that I can do like an abbreviated thing there and sort of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And just to see...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And see if I like it or not, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before you dedicate. [0:13:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Because it might just be that I like to cook for myself and I do not want to make it my career.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yes, I am going to check that out this spring and sort of see how that works.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And something good, too, just to know, kind of where you want to head, but it sounds like, in the meantime, finishing academics is important. Is it important to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is important to me if only because having messed everything up so abysmally when I was about to start my senior year really reinforced in me that I did not get over some of the problems I had with school and high school. And I do not want to have just sort of walked away from that and moved onto something else because I feel like if I do not address that it is going to affect me in some other way later on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So you feel like the problems have like progressed and the issue of motivation are going to come along and bite you, and not even if it is in cooking or wherever it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Because in going to school I have sort of - because it was weird. When I was much younger, I was like a really like nerdy kid and I was really enthusiastic about like reading, like, history books and like reading all sorts of things that like your average middle schooler, like, is not really interested in, from what I can tell. [0:14:09]</p>

<p>And then at some point, like, end of middle school, high school, I said "School is not really about all this learning stuff. It is really like this game and it seems very - so it is like constructed and not related to all of the idealistic reasons that my parents wanted me to get into it in order (ph) in the first place. And I kept on trying to say, "Well, I am going to create this little, like, safe zone. That is where I can be curious and academically interested. And it is not going to be related to school, it is going to be different from school and school is just going to be this thing I have to get through, a game. And I kept on -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You kind of remind me of some other - I can feel like I know some people with similar attitudes about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I feel it is pretty common, yes. But I keep on not really giving enough attention to my little safe zone of whatever interest I was currently involved in. And I have sort of cycled through a ton of different things that I thought I was really enthusiastic about and I started to pursue and then I sort of lost my enthusiasm and gave up really easily and then did not stick with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. It is Oberlin, O-B-E-R-L-I-N?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, O-B-E-R-L-I-N.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is what I thought. When you said Oberlin, I was like I have not heard that. Oberlin; it is like a small...[0:15:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It is only 2,000 kids or something. It is really small.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I went to a Connecticut college, so I do not know. It is like similar sized.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:15:19).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it is one of those other ones. No, (inaudible at 0:15:21). But okay. So what problem specifically would you like to work on today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly I would like to - well, today makes it - the word "today" is like totally (inaudible at 0:15:35). I do not know how to work on today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, let us look at the overall goals. Let us...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Overall goals; I want to look into more and really try to figure out what sort of like switch gets flipped in my brain when I say I do not really care about this assignment and I would rather procrastinate on the Internet for like five hours and then fuck myself over the next day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Try to figure out where that motivation comes from. Because I have had a few different theories that have been supported by other therapists that I have seen, but none of them really like holds up. Or maybe they do hold up and I have not really acted on them. I am not really sure. But I am looking to find as consistent as possible answers to some of those problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you, in your old therapy, did you have homework assignments? [0:16:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I did not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. That is something that we are kind of big on here. I mean sometimes it depends on what the problem is, but that is another thing that I might ask you to do assignments and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. The reason I heard about REBT was that my girlfriend actually went here and saw a different student therapist and she always told me about the homework assignment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:16:39) (laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was surprised when the woman that I saw in Indiana did not seem very REBT, honestly. She seemed like she was sort of removed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She trained here or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I found her on the web site. She was like the only person in Indiana that I could (inaudible at 0:16:56).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter), okay. So yes, I think I will probably fit more maybe with - especially if she was trained here, you know - yes, your girlfriend's therapist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And the homework, you know, I told them it was coming.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay (laughter). I mean sometimes it is not as relevant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I always think that the real work you do between sessions is what is going to really make a factor change, because that is what I am here to do is not just to understand quite a few things, but to hopefully help give you the tools to change the way you think. [0:17:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that you can make the change in your life that you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And that seems really important because probably the biggest failure I had in other therapists that I saw was that I would come to some great realization about why everything had gone wrong and not do anything with it at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, um-hmm, okay. (Laughter). That is another time, but yes. I mean, you know, that is hard to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we can try, right? Okay, so some part of that is definitely collecting, you know, like all of the information about you and filling out the weekly - they call it the OQD (ph) Outcome Questionnaire so I can track and realize if we are making change, if it is going, you know, along the way that I hoped it would. And then reviewing those scores and stuff, and I can say, "All right, this is not working, let us switch it off, let's change it around," or "This is this working." Maybe does not even need to be hearing anymore (inaudible at 0:18:15) (laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do not know if I will get there. In a few months (inaudible at 0:18:18).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, hopefully. Hopefully. You know, it is supposed to be a short-term therapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the idea is that you should come to session each week with a specific problem that you would like to work on, and that would be to get to the underlying kind of emotions that are connected to the problem. In your past therapy, did you talk about the ABC model? [0:18:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:18:44) always have it on me, and I did not have it on me today. Sometimes we have one over here, and of course probably not today (laughter). No, okay. I can explain it. I can explain it. So the ABC model is that A is the activating event, so we will take the problem, which could be I went to do my assignment today, and then like basically I could not do it or something else came up and I just said "I will do it later." [0:19:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that would be activating event. And then you need emotion to go along with that. So maybe it is more the feeling that you have afterwards. I do not know, do you beat yourself up afterwards?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you have procrastinated?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So why don't you give me a problem and then we will work through the model together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you think of the last time this happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. The last time this happened was like yesterday, when I had my homework to do for my classes today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said "Well, I have a test in psychology that is coming up, so I am taking Intro to Psych because I always wanted to do that, on next Tuesday, and I have not done all the readings that the test is covering and I have not done the reading that is covered tomorrow, lesson before the test, but maybe I will just do it before the test on Tuesday and not today. It is not really such a big deal that I will do it now although maybe I won't be prepared for class tomorrow and that I did not do the reading." [0:20:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And the test is this Tuesday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it is this - yes, next Tuesday, the one coming up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next week, then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I am having some trouble with that concept; I want to say "Next this, yes."</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And you have not done any of the readings for the class yet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have done some of them, but I did not do the one for this class today, and I have not been, because it is not working at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have class a few times a week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, two days a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, forgot about that, grad school and you have class once a week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so you have class a few times, so you did not do before this class. What do you do in psych?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically I chatted on Facebook chat with some friends who are still at Oberlin and looked at the news on the Internet because some crazy stuff was going on. And I watched Rome on TV, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Watched what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Rome on TV.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, BBC?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it is on HBO, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, oh, yeah. I think it is an old - it is a BBC program that they are now re-broadcasting on HBO, I believe. We have to check about the BBC program. Anyhow, that is irrelevant. Okay. So what happened? Did you ever take out the stuff itself, or...You know, you take it out and you are like, "Oh, I will do it later"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you never even get that far? [0:21:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like looked to my computer on the syllabus and I said, "Oh, what do I have to do today?" And it is "Oh, I have to read Chapter Three or whatever," and then I said, "Well, maybe I will do it later" and I just did not get around to it, basically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So you just - and instead you are like "Let me check Facebook first," and then it was like (crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And at some point in the night I was like, "Well, I can justify this to myself and it is not really that bad and I will read it over the weekend instead."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And the problem you want to work on is it does not sound like - well, I do not know. Is the issue more that you have kind of are angry with yourself the next day, or is the issue more that you would really just like to get this done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Like it was sort of a bad example because it is not really that much of a problem, because for a lot of things like this it is sort of subjective when you do the reading as long as you do it at a certain point in time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yes, but you should...[0:22:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But really I was using this as an example because I have the same reaction when I have like a paper due and something needs to be handed in, in a certain time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So would you say there is an emotion - this is hard, because there is an emotion that you feel when you are thinking about doing the homework?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there an emotion that comes up? It is a hard one to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, this is hard because I have had other people like tell me what I might be thinking in other therapies that I have been to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you talk about depressing issues.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what have they said?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Not to cheat like that at all but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you got that already.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It has been some combination of I get a certain rebellious power in not doing what I think that my parents or other authority figures would want me to do. That is like sort of, you know, (inaudible at 0:23:00).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what do you think the emotion is that you are feeling when you say, you know, "The work is right in front of me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [0:23:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you are like "But I could watch TV." What is the emotion that you feel when you are confronted with this dilemma; that the work you have to do, but you really do not want to do it? What is the emotion?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is sort of - I do not know how to describe this as an emotion, but I sort of feel like I am above it in some way and that I do not really need to do it and it is sort of this thing that has been imposed that is not really true and that I can sort of do it in my own half-ass way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it kind of maybe like - not an anger, but maybe like "I should not have to do this"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, sort of. It is like a petulant anger or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And instead of - maybe it is more of - it is like this frustration as a feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And frustration can be a healthy feeling. But I do think that we are talking about the healthy feelings versus the unhealthy feelings, and healthy feelings are not going to have you change because, you know, if you are feeling sad instead of depressed, sad is a healthy emotion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, and they say that there is healthy anger and then there is unhealthy anger. You know, you can be angry at racism, but how much it affects your life...I think that there might be an unhealthy level of frustration. Does it turn to anxiety, do you think? Is it like, "Oh, God, like I really do not want to stay and do all this," and you get nervous, or...[0:24:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does not turn into anxiety right away. It turns into anxiety later, after I think to myself, "Oh, shit, I should have done all those things. Why was I so dumb and nearsighted and I ignored all this?" But then I sort of take all that anxiety and turn it straight into guilt and do not do anything with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it something that leads the anxiety to catch up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you would rather just beat yourself up over it instead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And like sometimes catch up, but more often than not I will sort of panic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And we can work on the secondary emotions later if you think that they are, you know, causing you problems in your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I get a pressure from either direction really and either sort of remove the whole cycle or fix it in the second step or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that for right now on what seems to be more problematic to you is to really like "Why can't I just do it in that moment," right? [0:25:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So it sounds like it is like a high level of frustration.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you are feeling that you really do not want to do it. Do you think there is like a visceral reaction?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you get really nervous, or it is just you push it aside and you said you feel above it, you should not have to do it right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So tell me, what are your thoughts when you are feeling this frustration.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I usually do not like to think about it for very much, actually. It is sort of an instinctive reaction, almost.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that is the problem, I think, because a lot of people think that, oh, you know, it was just my instinct to not do it. But we are really telling ourselves things all the time. It might be so automatic that it can happen very quickly now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you are so practiced at procrastinating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that is (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you said some thought before that "I feel above." That is a thought, not an emotion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So one of the thing is "I am above this. I should not have to do this work"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You say that. Are there any other things? So that is a demand that you are saying. [0:26:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And beyond that is sort of I think to myself like I do not really need to - more that I do not have to do it. I think that I do not have to do it in the way that is sort of expected of me and I can sort of cheat and like use some, like, strange knowledge that I have gotten from Wheaton about how to skim through things to like skip through this or this and not (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe I should not have to work as hard as everybody else in that class?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I am smart enough to get by without doing the work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. I mean not to be a dick and say (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter) But those are your thoughts, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So those are a lot of demands. Is there any "I cannot take doing this right now, like I just cannot stand to do this work"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not right now, but I felt like that before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. In the moment, particularly when I was at Oberlin, I felt like that. In high school, I never felt like I can do this; I felt like I do not want to do this. But at Oberlin I think because I was sort of like isolated in the middle of Ohio without too much else to do with my score sort of infirming me, then I would feel more overwhelmed by the things I was asked to do sometimes. [0:27:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, when I said "I cannot stand it," it was not the "I cannot do it" because there could be that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But "This is too hard," "This is too much for me." But just the frustration, like, "I cannot stand to do this right now. I cannot stand to watch when they are sucking on the TV. I cannot stand to do this right now."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is definitely -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not "I cannot do it," but the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I do not - like I'd even imagine doing that. Not as much right now. Like I could imagine myself doing it right now, but in the past (inaudible at 0:27:51) happen it wasn't (inaudible at 0:27:53).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it is more of the "I should not - I am swearing not to do this half-ass and get by."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, basically. [0:28:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I should be able to do this my way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Why should you be able to do it your way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it is hard to really justify that, but I justified it to myself by saying that in the same way that all those kids I saw at Wheaton who, like, did not really know about the things they were studying, but like had great tutors that their parents paid for them to have and managed to, like, find some doctor who would say that they have ADHD so they can spend like four hours taking every test and like still did great and went on to Yale.</p>

<p>(Ringing phone)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, they do not know why they are calling? (Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Honestly, like a lot of the reason that I feel like this happened for me was that I was at such a weird place like Wheaton, where there is like so much privilege.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you kind of feel like, in the past, I have gotten done, knew (ph) before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I did it in the past because I am pretty smart and I can sort of get away with going into, like my English classes, in particular. The things that I am interested in, I can go into them, having done very little work, and because I am interested in it and I know other sort of relevant things, that I can still participate in and talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You should be able to - so there is kind of this thought that "I am smart enough that I should not have to do the same amount of work other people do."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically, yes. [0:29:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there ever going to be a point, you think, where...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am not smart enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that. That you might have to put the same amount of work, or even more work than an average person?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There totally is not, and like I know that there is. But even in situations where I am taking a subject that is hard for me and, like, I am not good at it, I still do not think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, in this situation I would have to say, you know, you are saying I should not have to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why shouldn't you have to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly it is because I do not really want to, I think. That is also sort of tied into it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But do things always...It sounds like, in an intellectual way, you are very capable and, you know, obviously you are a smart guy and that is something that is important to you. Is that a big part of your identity? [0:30:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is a big part of my identity and it is something that I have, like, struggled with in the past, too, also, and I am a little bit - all right, was very conflicted about it and I am still a little bit conflicted about it now. [0:30:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds like there is some demands on some irrational beliefs underneath, you know. There is different types of irrational beliefs. Ellis - Albert Ellis says that there is four, you know. Under all of them are mostly demands. There is catastrophic thinking; you know, that "If I do not do this now, it is going to get out of control." That relates more to anxiety. There is the frustrations, low frustration tolerance; the "I cannot stand it, that I just do not believe I can stand to do this right now." And then there is doubting, other doubting, self-doubting; "If I cannot do it, that means I am an idiot." Is there any sense that if you did put in effort, you would still fail? [0:31:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have thought about that a lot because that has been something that every other therapist I have seen has been like "Is that basically what is going on"?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean [I gotcha] cycle (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I do not want to say that it is not, but I really do not feel like that is the main issue for me, because I have done well at some things and I have not been like anxious about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So everything that you have really put in full effort for, you have done okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I think that it is more - I think, and what I had said when other people said this (ph), I think it is more that I am not afraid of failure, but sometimes I am afraid of success, and I do not know what that would really mean or what it would be like to, like, do my best and to do, like, really astronomically well at something that I really wanted to do well that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why haven't you tried?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is a good question. I mean it is because I have been really quick and easy to dismiss whatever it is I thought might be worth trying out before I really give it a shot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is maybe part of your identity this kind of cocky element that "I can always get by putting in the minimum"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of, yes, but it is really weird because I hated the kids who did that, that I saw at Wheaton. Like the people who were way more privileged than I am who, like, had all of these opportunities to like do well without really actually wanting to do well or, like, trying to do all that was certainly given to them, and I resented that.[0:32:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you do not have these opportunities. This is all intellectual, I guess, since it was God-given, you know, privilege.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some people might hate you, in fact.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. And like I think that sometimes -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have people with intellectual disabilities or mental retardation and things like that. They would say "Look at all the privilege that you are...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wasting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...you are wasting."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you thought that before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have thought that before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Absolutely. And not only because that is something that my parents and my family remind me of all the time. Like "We would not care about this if you were not so smart and you couldn't be doing anything you wanted." Something that I hear a lot from them. [0:33:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, my thing is the thought that you keep having, and we can work on this thought, is that "I should not have to work as hard as other people," right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To succeed. That is kind of your main or irrational belief. "I should not have to work as hard as other people to succeed."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That is definitely something you can say "How true."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But the question remains: Why shouldn't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you hadn't really been able to give any answer. You have been able to say, "Oh, in the past I have done so," but there is no logical reason that you should not have to work as hard as other people to succeed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. And I cannot support that to myself ever, really. I do not even try to; I just sort of ignore the issue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And empirically you know that this is not really working (laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely know it is (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That it is even filling (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what we would say is an empirical dispute really does not work because you know it already, but it is not really doing much dispute (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I have known it really for a while and it has not really helped me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And a logical dispute, I think it would make a little more sense that, you know, just because - I understand that just because you want it to be so, just because you want to not to have to work as hard as other people to succeed, does not in reality make it so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [0:34:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you know that, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is not insightful for you. So you have been aware of the logic behind this; "Just because I want it to be so..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does not mean that it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't make it so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the last thing that I would say, which usually hopefully will work, is how is this working for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not very well at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not very well (laughter). So I think that it comes down to that this is not a functional way to think. Are you willing to give this thought up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I won't try yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of attached to it, though, is the problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Because I think it is a part of who you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, you have - obviously have been financially privileged the way some people around you are, but you still managed to do well. [0:35:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have not really worked as hard, but you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do not want to make it sound like I have not been not financially privileged.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. To go to Wheaton (inaudible at 0:35:13).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I would say my parents were fortunate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But perhaps the people around you are, more disgustingly, privileged or, you know, to a different level, right? So basically this thought is not working for you and it is making you feel - it is almost kind of like an injustice. It is like I do not know what would be the emotion that goes with, like, injustice? You know, like what emotion would go? So I am trying to find the emotion. You feel like you should not have to do it. I am struggling with emotion and I am supposed to be the one who can identify them, so I am a little embarrassed myself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I am really hard-pressed to describe like what emotion (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is a difficult emotion and to say, but there is kind of this, like - trying to think of what would be a healthy alternative to feeling...You know, you are kind of justified, if that was a feeling. [0:36:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it is not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel something, but it is not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is like morally or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I feel somehow like the way that other people want me to think is wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But in some way I think it is a kind of an anger.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is some anger to it, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? Like "I just should not have to be this. I should be able to do the minimum and be able to do well," right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you are kind of angry at almost society, that they are pushing you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that I have to do all the things they expect me to do, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. So I would say instead of feeling - because we basically - we want to change the emotion, and the only way to change the emotion is to change the thoughts. So in the moment that you are not feeling that justified anger that "I should not have to do this, why should I, why should I have to do...Why should I have to stoop to that level," okay? Doesn't it sound funny when I am saying it like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that is what you are thinking. [0:37:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It totally is, and that is why it is funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. But I think that when people laugh and can recognize it is hopefully a step closer to maybe giving it up, you know, to realizing that you are a bit ridiculous?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is always worse when you cannot laugh at yourself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes (laughter). So what thoughts would help you move from feeling just kind of angry with society to feeling just frustrated that this is what you have to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that part of it goes back to something with my parents that I have not really resolved, because my mom is like sort of a perfectionist and has always had this message that she has tried to instill in me; that everything that is worth doing, it is worth doing exactly as well as you could and you have to try your best at everything. And like that has always fundamentally struck me as wrong, because there is no way that every task that we have to do can be as valuable and important and instructive for everyone. And not that we should not try it; everything else is what I have learned. I used to think, "Oh, you can just pick and choose and do things you want to do and ignore the things you do not want to do."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you are still kind of doing that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. No, that is kind of what I am doing. But now, intellectually, I realize that obviously that you cannot argue that. But what you can argue is that some things are worth doing more and some things you can prioritize and say I do not need to spend as much time doing this, but I still need to meet certain expectations and...[0:38:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even though you say that that is what you are doing, it does not seem like you are doing it well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I am not saying that is what I am doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, right, but what you have - ideally would be going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And just in terms of trying to think about that issue of is everything worth doing worth doing well on an intellectual level.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that is another problem for me. I am great at coming to this abstract realization of, "Oh, this is what I have been doing, it is really wrong," but then I do not know how to incorporate that into my daily life, really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we are running short on time, so I am trying to help you find maybe something else you could think instead of that "I am smart enough that I should not have to work as hard to do as well." [0:39:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What could you think instead that would maybe help you feel just frustrated instead of superiorly angry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I have to sort of be aware that everyone else who has gone through like the American education system has felt something similar and that they had also had to confront that, but that (inaudible at 0:39:30).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what if you changed - because it sounds like a demand, like "I should not have to do this," you know. "I should be able to work the way I want and still succeed," right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Basically I should do what I want and still succeed, at least intellectually." I do not know about any other aspects of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you change the demand to preference, what would that sound like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would sound like I would rather spend more time on the things that I enjoy and find meaningful and spend less time on the things that I do not. [0:40:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, maybe something like this. It is close, but I think it might sound more believable and positive spin. Say, you know, "I would really prefer to not have to work on this since I do not find it super-important. But I know that it is necessary to do in order to get what I want."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To get your long-term goals. You know, you are looking at the short-term goals, so, "Well, I should not have to do this right now because it is not important to me." But you are not looking at the goal that is important to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in fact, you are defeating yourself by - you are rebelling against yourself. Do you see that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is like you say, "Fuck society. I am not going to do your..." You know, "I am going to do what I want," but in the end you are rooking what you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you realized that before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I have, I mean particularly when having done all the shitty things I did over the past year at Oberlin made me lose, like, sort of my dream summer of, like, living on my own and, like, having a job and living with my friends. [0:41:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Well, I think - I mean we can work on this in the future. I do not know what it is going to do to just beat yourself up about that all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I do not think that that is going to help you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I have done that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Move forward, yes. I am sure you spent all summer doing that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is not going to help you in the future. But what you can say is, you know, "I really wish I would have done things differently, but that is how I chose to do it and, you know, I am going to learn from it and not make those mistakes again, or at least try," right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe if you could change your preference. So imagine your - do you have work to do? Today is Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can still do that reading like you are supposed to do the other night, right? So imagine you go home. What will be the first thing you are going to do when you get home, like, realistically? You'd have dinner?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I am going to have dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then would that be the point when you would kind of take out your work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be the point when you would think about taking out your work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably like an hour or two after I have dinner, when I have had time to sort of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Decompress?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Decompress, exactly. [0:42:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now what I am thinking, and since you are a person who likes to rebel, I do not think you are going to want to do it if I say this is what you have to do. So I need your commitment that this is your goal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because this is not going to get me anywhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, you do not have to say "Fuck it, I am not going to do what she says to reach my goal. I know how to reach my goal better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that happen realistically?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really in the moment? Okay. Because I want to know what kind of level of rebel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do not think it is that bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is not that bad. But you know, it could happen to you a bit that, you know, "Even though I know Christy said that I should do this, right when I get home, I will do it in a few hours because that makes more sense to me." You need to find the time and commit to it. And then you are going to say the rational thought, and so it would be a rational thought when the time comes. So what time are you going to go do it tonight? It is quarter to six right now. [0:43:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Quarter to six, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you are living in Chicago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I am living in Indiana.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so you are living at home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So it is going to take me like an hour to get home (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So tonight is going to be a rough night to get it done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I don't know. Let us say like 8:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Eight thirty.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you will have dinner. What time do you normally go to bed? Late?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like midnight, one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so you have plenty of time (laughter). So what time realistically? Let's say you have dinner around 10 o'clock? Is that a realistic time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wait, to have dinner?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To go to start thinking about work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Ten o'clock would be - but I could do it earlier than that even, because, I don't know. I get home around seven, and dinner is going to be like less than an hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So you - okay. So what time will work for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think 8:30 or nine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So let us say nine. Not 8:30 or nine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Nine, definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Have you ever done this before in the past?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that this is going to be helpful for you at nine o'clock.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [0:44:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you going to do at nine? Which assignments are you going to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At nine o'clock I am going to - well, first, I should probably do my assignments for tomorrow so I can get those out of the way first. And then I will -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many assign - do you think it is something that you can do in one night?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. It is not that hard?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean it is like writing like two paragraphs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So you can do that. I mean this is how, you know, eventually see, you want to be. But I want you to realize that the short term, the frustratingness..."And I think there must be a little "I can't stand it," because that really usually goes along with the low frustration tolerance and that "I should not have to do this."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Because I should not have to be frustrated. I should want to be enlightened to the - inspired to do all the work that I want to do," right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That should be fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely have low frustration tolerance about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean a lot of the work that we do is boring, crap work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But unfortunately, you have to play the game to get to the goal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To the things you want to get.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? And so you can say that, you know, imagine every assignment that you are doing, you are ticking off, "These are the things I have to do to get back to where I want to be, to get back to Oberlin with my friends and my girlfriend and get that degree that I have been working for for all these years." So this stupid little two-paragraph assignment, you know, you are ticking off the boxes for your goals. [0:45:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These are steps towards your goal. You are moving up. So you are going to sit down with that assignment and you are going to be thinking, "I should not have to do this. This is so stupid," right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you know what? There is some other doubting in this as well, and that is maybe your professors. Do you feel like maybe they are not...Or is it the syllabus as a whole is kind of not worthwhile?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably broader than that, even. I do not think I am being that nitpicky with individual teachers, but more that I am thinking that taking classes in college and the whole idea of like getting an education is sort of blown out of proportion and you do not really get as much (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Like society doing - not (inaudible at 0:46:03) but in some ways expects you to do this even though it might not really be related to what you are going to do in the end and it does not cultivate your mind the way that you could have done it, you know, if you could have picked out your course work and everything else yourself. [0:46:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I think we will still go back to the original statement, you know. Instead of saying "I should not have to do this, this is stupid," what you are going to say, "I prefer, you know, I really wish I did not have to do this, but I realize this is the work I have to do to reach my ultimate goal." Can you [practice sending] (ph) it to me, with connection?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. With the first part, repeat it for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like "I prefer," "I wish"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I prefer. "I would prefer not to have to do this, but I realize that it is important for my long-term goals."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And do you know what I also think that every time you say "This is stupid," the other doubting does not always help, because it is just going to get your mindset in a negative place. "Seems I really should not have to do this," you know. This is the most interesting thing. When you call it stupid, I think it makes it easier to throw aside or go out instead and, you know, do that kind of stuff, or watch TV or go on Facebook. [0:47:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I really think, you know, you see - change the demand to a preference and then hopefully we can change that kind of anger. I mean think about it, and try and think for a great emotion for that if it is not anger. I mean turn that more into just a healthy frustration that most people feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because do you think you are the only one who feels this way about work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I realize that I am not the only one at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Do you think that this is going to help at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Do you think that every day you could set a schedule? I mean actually that is what I would like to say. So you are going to have this assignment tonight and I would like to see you try to carry this through. But maybe you could make -</p>

<p>CLIENT: A scheduled job (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For when you are going to do your work every night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is probably a good idea, because I have not done anything remotely like that at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you ever do - I do not know how subsets satisfy (ph) is. I mean I come from a school psychology background of sticker charts and things like that. Like I have friends that use sticker charts, so "Yes, I did a good job. Now I get manager (ph)" or "Now I can eat some ice cream." But would holding something from you be helpful to...[0:48:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably, yes, like having a reward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, having a reward. If you are able to do that tonight, is there something you could reward yourself with tonight or tomorrow on the way to school that maybe you would say, "Oh, I do not want to spend the money on that" or do you really like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do not know. I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A Jamba Juice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jamba's is a good reward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I mean I do not know if there is one close. Oh, there is one -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, there is one of those.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I know. I reward myself with their apple juice and then I have a good day. But things like that, I do not know if you deserve it for one assignment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if that is a biggie -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Maybe it is a big one, but not just the (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. But maybe you could even think of a longer term reward, too, because I think you need to have the idea of working towards - you know, it is not always going to be immediate gratification.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And you need something to get you by sometime.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. So I would like to see you write up a schedule for when you are going to do your work. Oh, but you have your test on Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we need this - what I would think is going to be helpful for you is to set up a schedule for the chapters that you are going to review each night of the weekend. [0:49:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And do not save it until Sunday or Monday night, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sunday or Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are living at home right now, right? You are not planning on going into Oberlin this weekend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. And do you have a lot of friends at home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really that many, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So really there is no distractions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is not going to be any distractions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we are faced with like the Chicago Tribune, that kind of - or whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you know, set up that schedule for yourself, chapters that you are going to...Do you ever cross things off on lists?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I make lists a lot, but I am bad about going back to them and crossing things out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Crossing out. So, you know, set a time frame you are going to do it. And just because suppose, God forbid, 8:30 comes and you have not started your work, just because you have missed 8:30 does not mean you are not starting at 8:40 or 8:45.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because some people say, "Oh, I will start it - the diet starts tomorrow," right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, but that does not work out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That does not work out. There is no time like the present. [0:50:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doing your goals as they come is going to help you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: To get into the groove with that, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, if you can see those stupid little assignments - sorry I am such an easel (ph) about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I feel the same way, you know, about certain things. What do you think of...How do I do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean you must just say, "Well, I do not really want to do this, but I am going to power through it because I want to be a psychiatrist or do whatever."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My preference. I prefer a lot and not do a lot of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At first until ten every day. But it is not realistic for what you want to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? So practice. Basically every time you have that irrational belief, you need to change it, because your rational beliefs are not going to go away. That is the real truth of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They are going to be there. But every time you say it you need to replace it with a new one. You can say it all day long. Everybody prefer - I wish I did not have to go to Chicago State this semester, but that is what I have to do to get back to Oberlin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is something I have been repeating to myself a lot, actually. [0:51:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it is probably getting you to class every day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you know you have to make it stronger for the homework, because I know that that is what you do, and hopefully the things that you learn here are going to - you need to carry through, hopefully.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For Oberlin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully for at least like the next year. [0:51:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. So how familiar is the things that I said today? Is this - any of it new, or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some of it is new, particularly what you just talked about at the end, because when I was seeing the other REBT therapist that I saw, we talked about some of the things you just mentioned about replacing negative beliefs and thoughts with some positive ones. But it was not really systematic to sue that word as (crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And next time I am going to bring you the forms. I think you might find it helpful since you - you know, a person obviously can understand this. So basically what I was talking about, the (inaudible at 0:52:00) because I know mine is going to do it. Thankfully (ph) I do not have somebody next. The ABC is that AB activating event. And normally people saw all these different examples, because yours is a bit difficult -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - to conceptualize, I think. So most people say, "Okay, I got in a fight with my mom. She made me mad."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? "My mom made me so mad." Is that a thing that you hear all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they go into A to the C, the consequence. They are missing the B, the beliefs. So we say, "Oh, she made me so mad." Some people might not get mad when their mom says something. What is the difference? They have different beliefs in the middle. So the thoughts that I am having, "Oh, she should not have talked to me like that, who does she think she is," those are my beliefs and in making demands, right? Okay? Am I making any sense or am I going too fast?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or moving too confusing? So I have these beliefs. By changing my beliefs, I will hopefully change the consequence, the emotions, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe by changing, by thinking, "You know, I really wish my mom did not talk to me like that, but, you know, I can stand it. It is not going to ruin my day. [0:53:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in the end, you know, I can - it does not affect who I am, right? Hopefully after saying that over and over and over again and replacing that belief that I have already; that "Who is she to talk to me like that, I guess she is my mother, she has the right to say whatever she wants. It is a free country." I do not have to internalize it, right? But by saying it over and over again, I can change my anger to just maybe frustration. I am never going to say that you are going to love doing boring grub (ph) work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I do not expect that, which I used to and that made it so much more possible to effect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, because you just give up right away and say "I am never going to believe this." That is not the goal. The goal is it is just to change it to something that is more functional for you, something that you can live with. Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let me know how it goes and I really hope your test goes well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope to hear that you have gotten all your studying in, okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, me, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it was nice to meet you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it was nice to meet you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will see you actually - oh, yes, next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, next Thursday at five.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, great. Have a good week, and good luck on your test.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. [0:54:12]</p>

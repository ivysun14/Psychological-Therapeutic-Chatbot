<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I cleared my phone so...it shouldn't be a problem; it had to do with the memory of my phone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I accidently had me (ph?). So we talked last Thursday right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you have a good week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it was funny I had to talk to my dad on Thursday night about this whole money thing. I left here and I talked to him and I was pretty surprised he wasn't actually able to come up with any money, actually. It's really surprising, wow, and I ended up having to go to my mom who was able to float me some money. I guess my dad's pay cycle or something goes a certain way and he gets a large payment at the beginning of every month or something, I don't know when, like the first week so...I think on Thursday this week he seemed to put in a good bit of money into my account but it was really bizarre to have to call mom and hear him say that, you know? [00:01:28] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's what they call "the plot thickens?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I suppose, yeah. It didn't even really seem questionable to me that if I just pressed him on it he'd be able to, you know? Yeah, yeah...which was a little weird cause on the one hand I was like "Oh damn, I really wish that didn't happen," and on the other hand it kind of left me in that scenario that I was on some strange level telling you I was kind of hoping would happen, you know, that he actually wouldn't be able to help me through with it, you know? This happened to me after I left here, I called him right when I (inaudible)...wow. And it was weird, you know, it was just strange actually, it's some kind of lid in this idea that you know, (pause) if things ever got bad enough I could just lean on my dad or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'd hope that. [00:02:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just take care of everything. You know what I mean? It was just really interesting to have that conversation with him and just hear him be like "No I don't actually, I can't do that right now," which really surprised me I guess I just never thought there was like a limit to, you know, his ability to just fix something if he had to, you know what I mean? It was weird in that sense. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well and just saying it also it goes beyond that to not paying what he owed you. How he agreed to...Not to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not a criticism but it's more like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah...but no I hear the element of, not to, there's an element there that you had this, "My dad will always be able to come through, what's..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I imagined that scenario of him not coming through, I only ever kind of thought of it as like a willful, kind of refusal to see the importance of (inaudible), he never...he literally wouldn't actually have to means to do so which was odd in itself but (pause) it meant then that if I didn't get off the phone with my dad then I'd have to try and figure out what I would do until my dad could get me this money. [00:04:21] I had to call my...really the only other person I could call was my mother, you know, which I did and initially I broached the topic with her, I just said "Dad's going to be paying me all this money but he can't pay me right now, can you float me just like a little bit of money, just to get me through rent, then I'll pay it all back to you." She kind of like reacted with a really kind of...I knew this would happen which is why I didn't want to even have to call her, she sort of reacted with a very (pause), like catastrophasizing (ph?) sort of reaction, you know what I mean? Really she kind of started to (pause) say these "Oh, maybe you should be talking to dad, you should be doing this together and stuff..." and I was just like "Mom, I don't want to like get into a conversation with you about my relationship with dad, just like I don't want to get in a conversation with you about your relationship...(laughs), like I just need a little thingy, I just need to get me through something and lets not try to bring in every single (inaudible) related topic to do with our family." You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I don't want to be calling you right now, I'm sure you don't want to be hearing this conversation so let's...hopefully we can just do the minimum that we have to do," and live another day type thing. [00:06:01] She ended up just going off about this stuff and she just kept saying "You need to get on top of your money," and this and that and blah, blah, blah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? To you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I ended up just hanging up on her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just not something I had room for, you know what I mean, I was just trying to figure out my own way just to try and get through this and sort this out by tomorrow, you know and my mother was just trying to make it about so many things that I just had no ability to engage with, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay...</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I hung up with her, or on her, and (pause) you know I kind of went home and sort of relaxed for a little bit, but I ended up talking with her and she ended up, a little bit later I spoke with her, she called a couple of times and I just didn't answer and eventually we got on the phone and she was a lot more calm. [00:07:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Laney and I ended up driving down to Cheshire and she gave me a check and I gave her a check and told her when she could cash it and (pause) we had a really interesting conversation where I spoke with my mom alone for a little bit and she...I could tell she was really like flustered by this whole thing and she basically was saying to me and sort of subtlety and sort of indirectly that what she was really concerned about was the fact that apparently she had had a really bad history with like relying on my dad for money when she needed to, this is what she was alluding to and she had never really alluded to before. She was basically saying though that I had called her, I explained to her what happened with my dad that she...it just invoked in her mind her own experience with how unreliable he had been with her. Look at how many times she had found herself between a rock and a hard place because he didn't come through when he was supposed to or something. [00:08:45] Which...(pause) surprised me to hear her saying (pause) but it was helpful to hear on some level because it took her sort of crazed reaction to this thing and took it away from what I had initially understood it to be, which was like a condemnation of me for some reason, which is what I hung up with her, on her on the phone and redirected her concern and craze or whatever towards my dad, you know what I mean, which was a lot easier for me to have a conversation about and (pause) it was funny because you kind of had, like I was sitting here last week and I was talking with you and I was saying like "Oh, I kind of want to like call my mom and like talk to my mom about this and like bond with my mom..." and in a weird, odd way that's kind of like what happened. She shared something with me that she never really had before (pause) and sort of supported some of these things that I had going on in my head and (pause)... [00:10:20] Yeah, it kind of felt, I don't know, it kind of felt good just I guess because we were just sort of talking, calling a spade a spade or something, you know what I mean? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It felt very kind of taboo we even as my mom and I were saying it, we were talking about something that shouldn't be spoken about or something but it was in very kind of concealed language but she was basically just saying "Your dad has not been good with money with me and I'm really concerned to see that maybe that is happening with you." She was basically saying "I would not want you finding yourself in the place I found myself in with your dad," (pause) which I didn't have any trouble hearing, a lot of times I had a really hard time talking with my mom about this stuff, you know what I mean? I just don't like getting into...any time my mother tries to discuss anything to do with this kind of realm of thought it's...often time I find myself getting very kind of guarded and I want to push it away or whatever, but I was very comfortable taking that for some reason, I don't know why. [00:11:45] I guess because there is a lot of upset feelings but it just seemed very honestly directed towards something that made a lot of sense to me at the moment, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) You didn't feel imposed upon and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you felt like it was more you get (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Feeling vindicated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) Yeah it was very weird in that sense and I haven't spoken to my dad since we had that conversation Thursday night and I left it with him like "Oh, I'm going to have to try and figure this out," and he asked me "How are you going to figure it out?" I was like "I don't know." I didn't know at the time and I haven't called him since Thursday night and he hasn't called me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which in a way I'm glad cause I'm not really in the mood to talk to him but (pause) it's just interesting when I put that next to my mom who has no real culpability in this situation for where I'm at but has been kind of e-mailing me and calling me off the hook to try to see if everything worked out, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Did the check clear in time, did everything work out fine?" which it did. [00:13:34] It's just interesting that my dad...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is involved?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did he say he was going to put the money in your...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said could put it in when he gets his pay on Thursday or Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thursday or Friday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah I don't really know what to make of him not calling either but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. What did it mean to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was glad that he didn't call, if he did call I probably wouldn't have picked up, you know what I mean, because I wasn't really in a mood to chat with him but... (pause) I don't know, either it literally just gone completely over his head, you know he's just completely na�ve to what the effects of his actions are or he's just super aware of it and feels bad and doesn't want to talk about it. Either one of those is unfortunate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Neither of those are particularly desirable but (pause)...I spent Friday, most of the day, going out and looking for somewhere to work cause I'm probably going to do that. I'm probably going to try to find something else, I don't know if I'm going to keep doing this with my dad. [00:15:43] (pause) Which is too bad in a way because I just would have stayed at the restaurant, I'd have been a lot better off I had stayed there, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah you might have been able to wait tables?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah if I don't (inaudible) to doing that, that would have been pretty good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's weird cause that kind of pisses me off but... (pause) there is something so strangely gratifying about having, like even that, to kind of just look at and say like "Yeah that really...you know, good opportunity that you really kind of got." I messed up there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's almost like it substantiates kind of these (over talking) or something, it just substantiates your feelings about your dad...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! It adds something negative in the immediate but there's some strange like...there's some...easier to fall asleep with or something, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean? [00:17:11] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Easier to fall asleep with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the only way I can put it, it's something that's not as (pause) teeth grinding or something, not as like pride engulfing or destroying, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something that I can (pause) yeah it doesn't turn my stomach in knots or something, it's just...it's vindicating, I don't know. It's much easier.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) yeah I don't know, it's (pause) just interesting to see how it ended up playing out because when I was in here last Thursday I had had that conversation with my dad in the morning and he seemed to give me a brush like "oh we'll sort it out," he was kind of at work when I spoke with him. I kind of figured he was going to just pay me what I needed and this is just going to disappear but it turned into a bit more of a thing and the conversation with my mom made it a bit more of a...yeah a lot more of a thing, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um... (pause) [00:19:05] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yeah I mean, it's I guess when I say "the plot thickens" I guess I really...it's just really sort of true in terms of this, you know it's like an "everything's cool" narrative that gets kind of...it's the first draft and he has to call back later or wait, you called him? You had to phone him? And then the plot starts to shift as you called him "What's going on?" and then the alert from your mom "Wait this money thing is not...everything's not cool with the money." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also in this way in which I think that this story in a way kind of transforms for you from like...from your standpoint "I have this impression of my dad, is totally able to manage it, that I can count on him to bail me out if I need to, everything's kind of cool, might have just slipped his mind" to something very, very different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:20:22] Yeah. I mean one of the big different things with my mom, without going into any details, basically saying that my dad was not reliable, like she didn't say this but the fact of what she was communicating was he constantly didn't follow through with certain agreements about money in the past. Many, many times which it was odd how much I was happy to hear that, which felt really weird to me because I'd never kind of had a snag around like sitting there, face to face with my mom talking to her about anything to do with our family, I didn't just want to walk away from, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) that felt really good to hear cause it seemed like, I was thinking to myself like "Yeah, why..." and mom even put it as like "These are things I've never shared with you, I would never want to share with you..." and in my mind I was like "Why wouldn't you want to share that? I feel like you should." I feel like that's...those are the things that have been sort of not communicated to me, such that, or that I knew were there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the absence of those or without my access to them, left me like having to act in this way that is completely different than what I understand is...you know what I mean? [00:22:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like those are the things that created this massive disconnect, like once I actually had a minimal awareness of them I was just like this is a lot easier for me now. I don't feel so, like my legs are cut off or something, you know what I mean? I just remember thinking that I actually would appreciate more of that. I can actually engage in this stuff on my own terms a little bit more, you know what I mean? Maybe I can understand while like at the time, we were all living together or something but (pause) yeah, I don't know, it seemed helpful at the moment. If I had known that stuff maybe I wouldn't have had this grandiose illusion that would've led me into this situation right now. That would have been really helpful. (laughs) That being one of a million ways that it would probably benefit, you know, but yeah I kind of want to say that to him, like really want to talk about some of this stuff with me sometimes, let's talk about this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. You think she does want to talk to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She wants to...she doesn't want to talk to me about those things but she wants to (pause) wants to talk to me about family, every single time I talk to her, we spoke about this stuff for about ten minutes the other night and then for about twenty minutes she talked to me about our family up in New Hampshire, how they're getting old and how I should call them every Sunday and how I should be staying in touch with them and calling my grandpa and just on the phone with them, they're always asking about me, this and that and this...[00:24:16] I can see where she's coming from, like I need to be thinking more about family and stuff, I kind of want to say to her "It's funny because this last week I've been enjoying my life and done nothing but think about every step I take, my family, you and my dad, literally every single thing I do, I'm glad I'm able to do it in a way you don't realize, my goals not to put that on you but..." It's not like I'm not thinking about this stuff, do you know what I mean? (pause) Just when she was saying this I was like "This actually seems really productive for me right now." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah. (pause) I got to say even some way to see that, have your dad reveal that side to you...for your dad to reveal "I can't pay," is, you know, a pretty big...at least to them owning it, acknowledging it. I guess he was forced into it but still it emits a certain kind of conversation about something really happening. [00:25:56] (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah my mom fixed it, mom fixed it and that wasn't her thing to fix. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah your dad said "I can't fix this."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah my mom followed enough, you know? (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (over talking) "I'll fix it later..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah he didn't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's the element of...and the calling and also like "hey, I'm brainstorming, wonder if I can get the money from a partner or something like that..." (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I was doing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what you were doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I left him with...I almost want to just not, I almost just want to wait and talk to him to see, you know what I mean? Like if he ends up getting that money to me, you know, I just want to leave the ball in his court and just see what happens. See if it's even on his mind, you know what I mean? [00:27:22] It's sort of determining everything that I had to go through. I would really like to see if that's front and center in his mind as it is...see if the week comes to an end and he forgets about it or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What does he do with (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. (pause) Yeah. I've been looking for somewhere to work, a while ago I told my dad I was going to...Laney and I would go up in March, you know what I'm probably going to say to him like... "I don't know that, I might have to be down here looking for work, I may not be able to come up and just sit around with you for a week." (pause) Like this is consequences, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which would feel kind of good. (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking some way you feel like yeah it's a way that you can kind of more clearly feel and see it and that he's done something to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's a fact he's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can put it back on him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can put it back on him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I remember right after we got off the phone the other night he's been...we were going to Scotland this summer...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh right, yeah. [00:29:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was having me research some plane tickets.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your half-sisters wedding?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and Laney's going to, Laney was invited. I told my dad "Dad Laney and I would love to go but we can't afford it. If you want us to go..." If Laney and I could afford a trip to Scotland we would have done it already, you know what I mean? "I'd love to go but we can't, it's not something we can consider doing ourselves, if you want us to go you're going to have to pay for that." Which he kind of took (pause) over the last week or two I was sending him some information on some flights that would work for us based on when Laney and I want to leave, we are going to extend our trip a little bit and visit a friend of mine in Scotland. Right after we got off the phone Thursday night he sent me a text like "Oh I think I found a better deal on these flights, you sent me...I googled this," or something, right after we got off the phone, I was like "I need to try to figure out and do this." He just kind of shot me this text that was just about something, he just kind of moved right on to the next thing and that was technically our last interaction which I just didn't even respond to, not out of indignation at the moment I just couldn't. I had to figure out the money thing... (over talking) but even sense I've had to, since I got it figured out over the weekend part of me was like "Oh maybe I should follow up on that stuff," but I just talked to myself like "No, I'm not going to do that," I spent a lot of time last week looking at the flights. [00:31:29] "This is his thing to figure out. I'm not going to..." Like I don't want to go to the wedding, I don't want to be there. I'm going out of a courtesy for my dad and a courtesy for my sister, you know what I mean? I just...I don't even want to bring myself to the computer to spend any more time researching that. I just don't even want to do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't even want to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did it mean to you that he said that...he followed up with that text message about the flights?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was completely (pause) off his mind, I don't know, he had no awareness of the fact that I was going to have to get on the phone and try to find some other idea...like he was telling me "Why don't you go and Google this and I just googled it and found some awesome..." (over talking). It's like "No I'm not going to do that...I'm trying to clean up your mess. I'm not going to then go and put work into..." (pause) It's not my fault he has to go to Edinburgh for this wedding, it's yours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He wanted you to...it was the implication that he wanted you to check into again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah he's like "Oh I think I found something better, why don't you look at these?" And it's like "Why don't you look at them?" I found some flights on some website that would work and he said "I think I found some better ones, why don't you look on these things, you know, on this website?" [00:33:25] It was right after we got off the phone. It was just kind of insulting in that sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah. I'm very removed from that conversation that you just had as if it...and again as you said it was as if he wanted it to...wanted to make those if it didn't happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or as if he was thinking it didn't happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or that he wasn't aware that I was...that night I was out in the car until like 12:30 to get that money, getting home and the next day trying to make sure all the money was in the account until like noon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That just seemed totally lost upon him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even when we were on the phone and he said he couldn't put the money in I didn't get mad at him when we were talking. He was saying "Oh I'm sorry; I'm not going to be able to do it until next week. I feel so bad." I was like "Don't worry about it, don't worry about it." Like I had him right at that point where I could have been like "Yeah dad, you really messed up here this time." I had him like very vulnerable and I definitely could have jumped on just in a way that I was, the hour beforehand I was saying I wanted to do but I didn't do it. [00:35:09] (pause) I felt bad for him. I really felt bad for him and even when I was talking with my mom (pause) she kept qualifying like everything she was not even really saying but alluding to with "Don't share with your dad that I'm telling you this because your Dad's very proud. He's a very proud man so don't share with him that I'm telling you these things about him." She was kind of almost concerned for him when she was telling me that stuff in the same way that I was when I was talking with him, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like you picked up on that too. [00:36:24] His kind of feeling, last night he felt ashamed, he came across as feeling ashamed that he couldn't pay it. I mean, I don't know, maybe...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...kind of. But it wasn't even that, like it wasn't that form of shame it just seemed (pause) like ignorant, just seemed...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, okay...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Na�ve.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Na�ve.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I felt like in a place like...I'm the stupid one for actually thinking that this, for not being aware of this. That's what I left with, I should've known better, almost. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? I shouldn't have even relied on my dad that much and it seems...I don't know. I would've felt bad if I really made him feel bad about this and I think it probably will moving forward on some level which concerns me to some extent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think you'll feel...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still not getting just the unrestrained, able to just say to him like "This was a really unfortunate thing that happened to me because of you." I don't think he thought about this enough. "I think you're irresponsible and I think that your irresponsibility really had some bad effects on me and Laney and mom had to come in and pick up the slack for you." I think all those things are completely true and objective I just wouldn't say, I couldn't say that to him for some reason. [00:38:31] I really think it would crush him. It confuses me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Precious pride?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why I still have that concern...in my actions, you know what I mean? (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Almost like "Why can't I just say it?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) It doesn't surprise me that I don't want to like really hurt my dad's feelings, you know, that's not something I typically like to do to people. [00:39:43] I suppose I just, sometimes you'd like to see someone feel as guilty as like I do sometimes, you know? Because I feel guilty a lot about a lot of stuff. I feel horribly guilty that I even went to my mom about a money thing with my dad, I felt like I had broken the cardinal rule governing that way that I deal with my parents growing up, I trained, I went to...I brought my parents into the same money thing, like I had to say to my mom over and over again "Please just don't share with dad that I came to you for this money. Don't tell dad that I told you that dad couldn't pay me." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what was that...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because then my mom would go to my dad and say "Oh you couldn't pay Geoffrey?" My dad would say "What? No that's not..." It would be...it's not, that's what you don't do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't...okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I did then I become the middle man for some kind of proxy argument between them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've created a fight between my parents about something. [00:41:12] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, okay. Yeah, okay. And you felt that was kind of a way you had to navigate...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it always has been. You don't create those kinds of links such that they can become problems, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt horrible for doing that. It wasn't just the money it was that he had to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was much more about you telling her about a problem with your dad, it could...</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I need you to come in and compensate" or something. That's like precisely what two people who are at odds with each other need to...(over talking) Yeah. That's just not what you do, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt horrible for doing that but I had to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, okay, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So unlike (laughs) him, it made me feel a little...you know what I mean? I feel somewhat justified being like "You should share in this a little bit," or something. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's an important facet I think that I hadn't understood about it for you, both during their I imagine separation and divorce and everything but also still this kind of almost a feeling as if you kind of...you kept what was going on between you and your dad between you and your dad and what's going on between you and your mom between you and your mom and not crossing...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. [00:43:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the feeling "If I do that that's going to really upset the apple cart," so to speak?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, absolutely it's going to introduce some kind of tension.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some kind of tension...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Upsets the whole system. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, okay. I realize we're running short on time but I wanted to kind of just ask you what you felt about...one thing was that I realized that you said that the call with your dad happened right after here and it kind of left me wondering how did that...how did our talk, especially what happened at the end, kind of impact you, what did you notice? It's not to say that we can't talk about it down the road we surely can but I was just curious...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I felt...after the conversation with my dad I just felt very like, maybe even a little like disassociated from it. I felt very kind of (pause) like numb in terms of feeling like angry or confused, I felt very, just kind of floating along. I didn't...I don't know, it was a really weird feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With me, when you were...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No you didn't...I left here and I went and called my dad. I didn't really even think much. I was pretty calm leaving here. [00:44:51] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Well I thought there was this important kind of awareness of "Yeah where's my enthusiasm," and kind of interest in what you were experiencing and then we started to talk about it and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean how do I feel that that carried in to?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No not even necessarily that you carried in, I don't even...I guess I kind of wondered how that left you feeling? I ended up feeling that was a...at least what I felt like was I guess a pretty important aspect of it all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was really glad that we spoke about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah and I was really glad that you shared with me the things that seemed to resonate or really stick out to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt like it was a good...it left me feeling like I'd like to discuss that kind of stuff more often.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think probably to the extent which I (inaudible from it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Interesting, okay. I thought it was very important, we were just starting to get into it and then we stopped and obviously then right after, the phone call...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And your dad and then it kind of switched...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's kind of what I had gotten in to, yeah. Next time then?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no. I guess I just kind of wondered how and in what way it fit in, if it didn't, just to not even have to answer today but just "Wow, that was a..." [00:46:40] (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: To be completely honest with you it didn't come into my mind so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll think about it though. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And at the same time I mean what went on with you and your dad, you know, just continues to unfold from last week to some pretty important revelations. I got to say just to share that I was wondering if your dad was going to...was having trouble with money or something? Not trouble but just not being able to pay you? It's kind of...let's see he's kind of acting a little cagey about it, you know, prior to you saying "Hey where's my money?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm. It never occurred to me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see that. And obviously you know your father much better and have a sense...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think that's all for today, that sucks (laughter), that's what I'm reacting to here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah that's a long ways. But in terms for practical, I imagine there's never any kind of issue around money between the two of you before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We've never been in this kind of relationship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? [00:48:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see what you're saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nor do I want to be...we're taking up too much time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well there's a lot there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is a lot there. I'm sorry I don't mean to sound like I'm trying to rush out; I just...didn't want to clog up the pipes so much. Thursday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thursday, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See how the plot thickens...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I have so many things that — some of which I was thinking about this weekend and sort of put down in my mind as something I wanted to talk about when I came today, that, and then things today, I don't really know where to start.  But I was just thinking now when I was trying to decide what to start on, that I hadn't done that for a long time, in putting things down in my mind and then feeling sort of eager to come and talk about them.  Almost, this time when I was doing it, it was almost with a feeling of, well, I would think to myself, well, if I realize this then there's probably no need to talk about it.  But then I would think, well, I realize this much but so often when I do talk about things here I see things differently.  And I suppose this was, I was thinking in this way because of the question at the end of Friday that I was wondering how much I have been disappointed in what I expected or how different things have been. (Pause)</p>

<p>The things I was thinking about this weekend, I don't know, somehow or other (analyst coughs) they all connected back to my mother and ah, reactions I've had to her.  It's, I started out by, we went up to my parents' home because my brother had an engagement party.  And on the way up, uhm, I was talking about something with MSCZ and he didn't answer me.  But I knew he was listening and even if I know he's listening, I can never stand it if he won't answer.  Bu—, and I suppose part of that reason is that I want him to say something.  I have something in my mind that I want him to say or I want to be reassured or I want to be told the right answer or something.  And when he didn't answer me I just felt very angry.  And then sometimes when I feel that way, I make some comments so he knows but this time I just wanted to get back at him by not answering him when he spoke to me, which, while I was doing it, made me feel absolutely ridiculous and childish.  And I was sort of laughing at myself but on the other hand, I still was doing it.  And it was, it took a lot to not do it or to stop doing it.  And then later it just was making me wonder, well, why did I feel so angry at that.  And later on, when I was home, uhm, the, something else entirely happened but it made me connect it somehow.</p>

<p>My, uhm, brother had had a friend who was staying overnight.  And he had come in late and my mother hadn't expected him.  And she didn't say very much about it but she was very upset that he had come and stayed overnight when she hadn't expected him.  And then that day, Saturday, when the party was, my brother asked if the girlfriend of this fellow could also stay overnight.  And then we were staying there.  And it would, would have been possible but my mother just said, no, there wasn't room.  And her justification to, when she told me was that she just didn't have time to set everybody up.  But she had to tell me in a way that made me feel that she wasn't really certain about it.  And, I don't know, I felt very upset when she told me that because, somehow, it just seemed to me she should have been able to do it and that, I don't know, if I were my brother I would have been upset.  And that started me thinking about her priorities, that I've always felt outside things came before the family or different jobs that she set for herself had to come first and that, anyway, she could only handle so much.  She couldn't take things that were spur of the moment.  And that this was bothering me because it, I could see myself reacting in exactly the same way, just for one example taking school as something much more important than MSCZ.</p>

<p>And (clears throat) I just realized, just now in the past week when I've been feeling so very upset about things, all my thinking has gone to school.  And I'm not thinking about MSCZ or our marriage or anything that's, I concentrate everything on what I'm doing at school and my responsibilities there.  And then I just wondered how much of this feeling of my mother setting up these priorities had to do with feeling that she was never home and never there when I thought she should be when I was young.  Because, sometimes when I think about it, I realize she really was home an awful lot and it wasn't that often she wasn't.  But the overall impression I have is that these other things came first.  And then I realized how angry I always felt at her.  And it just seemed to tie in with my feeling so angry at MSCZ, too, when he didn't give me something that I wanted.  And it left me feeling that I'd been sort of unreasonable.  But I s—, and I just couldn't understand why I felt such strong anger in both cases because the way I was feeling toward MSCZ and having to be nasty to him and everything was just the way I was with my mother all those years when I was having such a hard time with her.</p>

<p>And I do have this reaction to, with everybody, I think, although I'll keep, keep it repressed an awful lot when I am not very familiar with the person I'm angry toward.  But still, if I want a certain reaction from somebody and I don't get it, I think I just act, react by feeling angry.  And this makes me wonder about today too.  Because all, I just can't seem to get over this depression about school and the feeling that, I don't know, I, I feel I'm not a good teacher right now and I'm doubting I ever was and ever can be.  And I just feel paralyzed while I am at school.  And, I don't know, it j—, if anything it's getting worse because each day I think, well, maybe when I wake up tomorrow, I won't feel quite this strongly.  And then I go to school the next day and it's just as bad and I, I just feel my mind's paralyzed, everything is paralyzed.  And at one point I was talking to MSCZ about how I was feeling this w—, well, I talk about it all the time, I think about it all the time.  And anyway at one point we were talking about it and I had had the feeling I shouldn't talk to my supervisor right now because if I did it would be for the wrong reason.  And he, he was of, in agreement with me.  And, because I could just see how I'd go to her and say, I don't know how to do things but my reason for doing it would be to let her know that I realized it, sort of, well, MSCZ used the term, to disarm her.  And it is my intention.  It's what I did with the reports when I turned them in, in saying I was bothered by them that I had, I felt I was being too negative.  And really I was just trying to disarm her there too so in case she didn't like them she would know ahead I didn't.  And I decided not to go to her, talk to her, while I was feeling this way because I didn't feel I could ask her the questions that she could respond to in a helpful way.  And then today she wanted to see me because she wanted a definite answer, yes or no, that I'd be coming back next year.  And —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah!  You didn't mention that you were asked!  Last you mentioned something about it was that, ah —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I hadn't heard.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You hadn't heard.  And —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You hadn't said anything since then.  When were you asked?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I think probably (laughs) the next day.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Oh!  But you didn't mention that.  I wonder why not.  I, you know ask especially since it seems to me it indicates some kind of way that the people who run the school feel about you.  I mean, if they really thought you weren't doing the job they want done they wouldn't ask you back.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I tell myself that sometimes but I don't really believe it.  And I argue that I'm doing it alright.  And there are teachers there that I think are worse than me and they've been asked back so (sniffle) — I, I just don't seem to have any confidence and, unless I'm told directly all the time, "You're doing a wonderful job, you're a great teacher."  Somehow I can discount being asked back as something very unimportant.  And the way I'm working at it now is that the program that the headmaster wants is something I have learned how to handle but what my supervisor wants is something somewhat different within the framework of what he wants.  And that's where I can't measure up now, is what I'm thinking.  But she doesn't know it yet because she hasn't really seen me in action.  In fact, in talking to her today, this is what disturbed me about the way I talked to her because I was trying to, I can see now and I think I was aware of it then, because I was trying not to say anything.  But if I said anything, I seemed to be, it was compulsive that I would ask these questions I didn't want to ask, of making her, trying to force her into a position to tell me I was doing alright after all by saying "I'm not sure how to do this and I'm not sure how to do that and can you give me advice?"  And I asked about a play we have to give later almost to tell her, "I don't how to do it so if it's bad, don't blame me."  And I also was feeling while I was doing all this, that she could see right through me and that bothered me too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: So in this, you give a great deal of weight to your own feelings and fantasies about it and practically none to the fact of their asking you to return.  I wonder why.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  When you were saying that, it, I immediately thought of, uhm, really a parallel reaction when I used to, I don't know, it wasn't really talking about things like this with my mother but anyway she knew I had questions about whether or not I was wanted or loved or anything.  And she was trying to rationally explain to me that, even if people weren't demonstrative all the time, it didn't mean they weren't loved and everybody in our family was loved and so forth.  It's sort of like I was asked to remain in my family and I still couldn't put any weight on that.  And it's almost like, now, just like I wanted my parents to be demonstrative to me to prove to me that they loved me, now I want my superiors to be constantly telling me I'm doing alright and I'm meeting their expectations and so forth, in order for me to have any confidence in it.</p>

<p>Because I was, when we were talking about things that could be done to make the program better, which I am sincerely concerned about, however much it's mixed up with other things, I, uhm, she was just making some suggestions.  And, and then she referred to my assistant who had had the children painting in her room today and had done something very clever or just very good for, for activity with the children.  And, ah, my supervisor mentioned that as a type of thing, too, that could be done.  And my reaction was not simply that she's just pointing out another type of thing and, and reinforcing what we're doing by saying, "Here's where you're doing it."  But my reaction was simply that she was saying, "Well, she's doing it but you're not and maybe you could take a few clues from your assistant."  And I've been fighting this ever since but I think what I immediately began to think was that I, it's practically like our rev—, roles are being reversed and that she's the one who's more competent and able and so forth and can handle the situation and I am the one who is in the position to be the assistant, given less responsibility.  And it's the way I've been feeling all week, all last week too.  Because she's just going along, very confidently and it doesn't bother her when things don't work out and she can handle it.  And this reminded me of another thing that I was, became particularly aware of this weekend, that keeps getting mixed up in my thinking and, and, or my emotions, and I know is part of what bothers me while I'm trying to work this out and I see my assistant being so competent and cap—, and confident.  Uhm, and that's my attitude about age and the fact that I'm older than she is so I should be the one making more decisions and knowing more about things and being able to do it better, just simply because I'm older.  Even if she had more experience, I think I'd feel this way if I were older.  And I caught myself feeling that way toward the other girl in the other room, whose, uhm, experience is the same as mine, just about, in, in terms of years but I think I'm maybe a year or 2 older than she is.  And it just seems sort of ludicrous to feel this way but I know I do.  I almost feel as if I'm running, running around with my age written all over me and everybody looking at me and saying, "Well, why aren't you doing better at that age?"</p>

<p>And I became particularly aware of this when we were with some friends this weekend.  Uhm, Friday night we went out to dinner for MSCZ's birthday.  And he's practically a year younger than me.  And I think this bothered me when we were first married or before we were married but I just repressed it.  And I think it's bothered him, or used to.  But at some point we were just talking about how old MSCZ was on Friday night.  And then it, and the other couple that we were with are both our age and in between MSCZ's age and my age.  So it made me the oldest there, the oldest by a month but still, I — at some point somebody said, "Oh, FAJ is the oldest."  And it just, again I was aware of, of this reaction I had all through high school too, when I was one of the older ones in the class, that, "And look at me I'm so awkward and I don't know, just not as good as they are in everything.  And here I am the oldest and they're probably all looking at me, thinking, "What, what's the matter with her?"  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, when I was thinking about his weekend, I thought of FYC, who used to really keep everything in, at least, from me.  And she'd never talk to me about anything.  Well, she never talked to me practically at all when she was growing up at home.  But, uhm, it wasn't until she went away to college that she would even let on that certain things would bother her at all.  And even then she would only do it very superficially.  And there're only 1 or 2 times in our whole life when we have talked in a way that there's been an even exchange and it hasn't been me going to her with problems but she has admitted in return that things bothered her deeply.  And I, I was just wondering if this is why I have this sort of stupid attitude about age.  Because I know I felt with my assistant I can't let down my guard and let her know that I'm insecure.  I have, but I always feel awful afterwards that I've lost my position somehow by doing so. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was, MSCZ was asking me something this weekend about, well, I was saying I just almost feel I can't be there in front of the children right now.  Because I feel as if, when they are looking at me, they're just seeing right through me and thinking to themselves that I'm just awful as a teacher or sort of "There she goes again in that stupid way."  Or somehow mocking me and reacting negatively to me, in any case.  And again it seems, well, partly that I am an adult so I'm supposed to have this wonderful lead on them and I have a certain role I have to keep in terms of them.  And then, feeling this way, I don't know why I feel this way, when I'm doing something with them and just looking at them, but again I just, my mind would just suddenly go blank and I pani—, I just feel panicked.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So what you seem to be saying reminds me of a phrase that one often hears, that would be something like, eh, "You're older and you should know better."  It's what you are saying to yourself.  But it's often applied in other situations.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) You mean, in just a mother saying to a child, "You're too old to do that."  Or —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Or, "You're older than — "</p>

<p>PATIENT:  So and so and you should —</p>

<p>ANALYST: "And you should know better."  Because that's really what you've been saying to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well, I know I'm saying that to myself but I don't, I c—, at least, I have no memory of that being said to me.  And the only thing I can think of is the example FYC put to me that might have made me feel that way.  (Pause) Of course, then I just thought of the fact that, when children start school they're all very conscious of each other's ages.  And I don't recall anything happening when I first started school but perhaps then, when everybody was so aware of whether somebody was 5 or 6 and then if you're 6, everybody expects a lot from you, uhm, just your peers do, at least, from what I've seen with the boys, it's true.  Uhm, maybe something happened to me there where I got the feeling that I had to do something more because I was older.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What did happen when you were 6?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, my brother was born.  (Pause) And then I went to first grade.  (Sounds of body shifting, silence) I don't know, when I, I just — nothing seems to fit in when I think about it.  Or (pause) and the only other thing I can recall — I don't know, — well, it was when I was in first grade, is the time when I wet my pants.  I was, just felt so humiliated.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mean, that you were too old for that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  (Silence) Well, my thinking just goes back to my being so worried about school and myself again.  (Pause) And I've gotten to the point where I just feel that there's, I'm not doing any good thinking about it anymore like I am because there's not much I can seem to do about things right now.  In fact, I could probably do better things if I stopped thinking so much about it.  But then I just keep, then I'll think to myself, well, if I just think about it a little more, maybe then I'll get some answer.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>And in a way, when I was asked if I'd come back today, finally, for a yes or no answer, uhm, I, in a way, wanted to say no.  Because I just have been feeling so awful and if this is going to continue I really just couldn't stand going into school next year.  But then I would sort of whip myself and say, "Well, you can't run out when you're at your weakest or, somehow you have to fight back or not run away from something that's hard."</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you answer?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  Well, I said yes because I'd already decided that if I were going to be asked before.  But I don't know how much of my saying yes is because I'm afraid of what I would do with myself if I said no.  And sometimes I've thought I should say no just because I am so afraid of it.  (Pause) I suppose I'm afraid of saying no partly because then it, I would be telling myself I really do believe I'm not a good teacher and that I've failed and by coming back I'm telling myself that, maybe with practice and more experience, there's hope.  And then I think I'm afraid of, well, if I didn't work, of, uhm, what would happen to me.  And somehow I don't, I can't really think in terms of not being at LKC but going someplace else, I don't know quite why, except that, except for this last week or 2, when I've felt so very strongly, I, I generally think in terms of feeling fairly comfortable at LKC.  And I know, at least I used to feel I knew, what was expected, I suppose that's it.  And I knew in what ways I could meet the expectations.  And I suppose I'm afraid of starting out someplace else.  I s—, imagine that's partly what's so very disturbing, now, that the expectations have shifted and I'm not sure (analyst coughs) where they are.  And I've had no practice in doing some of them so I don't know whether I can or not.</p>

<p>And it just seems so awful.  There're some changes which theoretically, I th—, in, in expectations which I think are good but instead of going at it with sort of the feeling of, "Well, this is wonderful that I'm having a chance to experiment here."  I'm just scared to death and I'm getting all tight and tense about it and unable to have any thoughts at all when if I were just reading a book on this, I would probably think, well, I'd love to try that and I'd get new ideas.  And it just always seems so strange to me that I can get so many idea that I think are wonderful ones when I'm just thinking about a thing but then when I have to put things in practice, or actually get ideas on the spot, they never seem to be there or they don't seem to be ones that would work.  And it makes me wonder if my ideas are very good after all.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, I have the impression today that, uhm, that you were, uhm, talking rather freely and, and readily.  And ah, you hadn't been quiet very much until I started to say some things and since then it seems much harder for you to talk, you've had less to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, it's the same reaction that, when you ask a question and I don't have any thoughts in reaction to it, then somehow I'm not meeting your expectations.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you feel that at the time?  I mean, a while ago?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, when you asked, uhm, z____</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, whatever it was I asked, did you, were you aware of feeling you were?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  With one, not with all of them,</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you didn't feel you could say it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I was sort of passing aware of it and then I was concentrating on what is there more to see here.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm!</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I mean, it wasn't even something I decided not to say, that I'm — I just accepted it and assumed it and — (sighs, pause) well, actually I had 2 different reactions.  And when you commented on the fact I hadn't mentioned that I had been asked back, I think I was sort of annoyed because it was putting a different direction on what I was talking about and I had something else I wanted to talk about.  And I think I was, continued to for a while but I didn't really, I'd sort of felt after a while, well, you hadn't put the same importance on that direction so somehow it wasn't right.  And then when I was talking about my attitude toward age, that was when I tried to think of things and I couldn't.  And that's what I felt I had to say, that sort of telling you I'm trying to answer your question but I can't.  (Pause) It's almost, I suppose in all my dealings with my supervisor this year, while I don't know exactly how she's going to treat me and react to me, all my ways of talking to her have been to say, "I'm trying to do my best and to do things the way you want.  And if I'm not, it's because I can't."</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

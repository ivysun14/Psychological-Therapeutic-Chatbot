<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hot in here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it warm? It's warming up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's only your girl patients. They can't handle it. (both chuckle) So we're up to a little over $2,600. I was going to ask my uncle. My mom just called me and she was like, "You know. I feel bad. Your uncle's son was really, really stressed yesterday. I just feel bad." She's so sad, but kind of sweet. This is what families do, I guess. She was like, "Your grandma has money in her account. You're just going to put it right back, so I'll just put it in my account, use my card and we'll just pay grandma back. She's not doing anything with the money." [00:01:11] It's very sweet on the one hand. On the other hand I hate that we have to do this shit. The thing is I don't know how we'll do it because Kickstarter only takes credit card. I know you can always call the bank and say, "I have to use my card for something," but I don't know how that would work because it's not deducted until the end of the campaign. Oh, no—I guess I could just say that we need the limit raised through Tuesday because there's something that's going to go through. I'm going to be so happy when this fucking thing is over. Right now I can't even be excited. First of all, $2,600 (laughs)—I know I wanted $4,500, but I am psyched that it's almost $3,000. [00:02:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a chunk of money.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's cutting it a little close for the things that need to get done, but I can make it work. I can make it work. I know enough people that will give me some good advice to consolidate and do it the right way and all that stuff. This dude from Seattle wants to help us do a tour. Blogs are picking up the videos. Some really awesome singer/songwriter chick from Nashville who seems pretty big kicked in $50. I'm pretty psyched. I don't think I've ever worked this hard or as focused on something as I did on this thing. It feels pretty fucking good. [00:03:13] Plus I think it's good for the band's morale. These guys are—yeah, it's their band, too—but really it's a glorified solo project. They're really into it, but it would be a bummer if I was like, "Yeah, I didn't [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:33)." It gives them a sense of wow, man. Shit's happening. I kind of couldn't believe it yesterday. This guy, Bradley, a really great guy who's been in the business since '84, he's a real do-it-yourself, into rock, knows his shit, and I couldn't believe we were having a real conversation. He was like, "Yeah, next summer if you guys want to do two or three weeks in Europe I could totally hook that up. You'd probably at least break even. If not, come back with something in your pockets." I was like, "Wow. We're having this conversation." (chuckles) It was awesome. [00:04:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does sound like there are some real successes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When you see people re-Tweeting your stuff on Twitter or people are loving those fucking videos. They love the videos. They love the songs, but I just did a great, fucking job. I love the videos. I keep watching them. I'm like, "I fucking made this thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I actually haven't watched them yet. I want to watch them, but I just want to check with you first what it feels like to send them to me or are hoping I would see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Absolutely. We don't have to talk about them, but I do think they say something about me—the images. I do think they say something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About you as a person, you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think just what we've talked about. I think there might be stuff there that will, obviously, resonate with you differently, very differently. [00:05:19] So I'm psyched. I feel good. All my friends kicked in. They all kicked in. People sent me cash and checks. People that are paranoid, like older people who are paranoid about online stuff, sent me checks for like $100-$200. All the stuff I was feeling before, people really stepped up. Some people raised their pledge amount. Some people, who have already given before to my band-camp thing, gave again. At first when I was just going to voice it digitally, those people gave again. Our website has like 5,000 views. I made that all nice and I have the videos on there and all that shit. [00:06:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really exciting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm psyched. I'm not fucking around. I'm not fucking around. This is a long time coming. The one disappointing thing, but it's going to feel good, though, is the scene. On Facebook, people know who you're sending to. If I send to you, you're all going to know you're on that list, so I broke it into parts, like Assyrians community, friends—like actual friends. And then I did one of those city music people. Some are friends, some are music acquaintances. It's so funny. Pretty much none of them stepped up. There were a couple that did, but overall, they're a bunch of jealous losers. When they see me they can't wait to hear the record. They love my stuff. They're like, "Man, you're so good. I still have that first record. It's so fucking good," and I believe that; but I also believe that they're either jealous or, on the one hand, they love my stuff but I'm a hipster but not in that circle. That's like fuck you man. It's going to feel so good to do things that have nothing to do with this place. That kind of annoyed me a little bit. Then again, I can also understand maybe some of them also feel like, "Well, if I promote his Kickstarter thing then other people are going to be pissed if I choose not to promote theirs," so I can understand that. [00:08:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who are you actually referring to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: People all the way from Juliana Hatfield—have you heard of her? I kind of know her.. Some people are out in L.A. now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're thinking of people who are bigger names already themselves?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some are big, some are not. They're basically just music people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Musicians, but not groupies or the hipster like or that kind of thing. You mean musicians?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not them. Not like, "Hey, remember you wanted to do me after the show?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean music lovers or musicians? [00:08:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Musicians, DJ's, writers, people in the industry. Bands . . . And I was selective—people that kind of know me or I feel like we have an affinity. We've met, we've crossed paths, and we've played shows together—something like that. For example, Juliana Hatfield says, "Give to this guy's Kickstarter thing." Either they don't want to do it because it's kind of douchy; there is something weird about giving money to it even if you like it. There's something odd about that and I understand that. Or she's like, "A million people want me to help them and if I help him, even though I like his stuff, then how can I say no to the others." I think that might be a lot of what's going on. I do feel like some of them, which is not surprising because it's the arts. That's part and parcel. It was like that with poetry, too, in London. There were lots of people who loved my stuff, but I could tell they were . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They were also competitive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Obvious, competitive, like "who does this guy think he is?" or whatever. But, anyway, it feels great that it doesn't matter. It also felt good that I did it. I was like, "You know what? I feel kind of douchy sending this, but fuck this. I care about this." I was very nice. I told them, "I hate doing shit like this. I hate reaching out in this way. Pardon the intrusion, but this just means a lot to me and I figure you guys can relate." Anyway, whatever, it doesn't matter. The thing is we still have until Saturday. If I can get the thing done with my mom today, everything else will just be icing on the cake and whatever else people give. [00:10:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will be done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Fuck. The thing is I just want to move on. I've been working on this shit since 2006. I just want to put it to bed, get it up there. There's a whole new record waiting, which I kind of think is going to be better because there's an actual band. The energy is different. It's not just me playing everything. I mean, that's fine, but I think we're in a whole different energy now. I think the songs are actually getting better and better. Meanwhile, yesterday I was at Gwen's house. She cooked me dinner and that was really nice. There was only one thing, which really surprised me a little bit, but she just wouldn't stop fucking talking. She was going on and on about her job. She's kind of miserable about her job. I really, really like her, but that's always been a turn-off for me, when people don't just take a breath. Once in a while she was kind of like, "I'm sorry. I'm kind of going on and on," but then she kept going. That was kind of a turn-off; and then I just got sleepy. We were drinking wine, which I don't really like but she does, so I was having some wine with her. [00:12:29] It was fine, but I was just kind of like . . . that wasn't even the important thing. The better thing was she canceled on me earlier in the day and she suddenly was like, out of the blue, "I really don't feel well. I feel really lousy. I'm really sorry." I was like, "Okay. That's a bummer, but I understand." She was like, "Can I call you?" She called me and we had this awesome, honest conversation. She was like, "I just feel nervous. I do feel kind of drained from work and everything; but also I'm just kind of scared because I've had really shitty relationships where I was kind of consumed by the relationship and I didn't have space to do my thing. I really, really like you and I just don't know." I was like, "I'm not in a rush. I would be bummed if you got all consumed. I'm a busy person and I have a lot of things I'm doing right now that are super-important to me and I'm very focused, so I have no intention . . . I don't know if that's what you're telling me." She was like, "I don't know if you feel like I was—you're sick now? I just really, really like you and my apartment is a fucking mess. I just feel like I don't have my shit together. In the past people have judged me or made me feel bad." Then she was like, "All right. Cool. Will you still come over?" (laughs) So it was really nice. When I got there we had a really nice talk about past relationships. She's great. We just hang out with her cat. She made an amazing dinner. It was very adult and normal. We didn't even have sex. We made out and then by the end we were really tired eventually. I had my arm around her and we went to sleep. [00:14:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you almost don't know what to do with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And when we made out, once in a while we'd get into this bear-hug make out, like she suddenly . . . and last night we were both kind of saying, but didn't want to say it, that we kind of missed each other since the last time we saw each other. She was like, "I just want to squeeze the life out of you." It was just very sweet. Yeah, she's awesome. She was also like, "I just wanted to tell you that my ex stopped by yesterday. We just had a few drinks and vented." They actually work together. She was just like, "I just wanted to tell you because there's absolutely nothing. He's like 50 years old. He was just a friend to me after my real relationship before that and it kind of turned into a dating thing, but it was never really that. We were just meant to be friends. I just want you to know you can totally trust me. I just want to be honest." I was like—wow. I played it kind of cool because I was like, "I don't trust him as far as I can throw him." (chuckles) But I was like, "For whatever reason, I trust you. I totally understand. I don't keep in touch with that. I'm not like that." She was like, "But with him it was never really even like we were really dating. We kind of were, but he was just kind of there for me and he was very nice and kind of cared for me and wanted the best for me, so we just have that friendship connection. If I had any sense that he was still pining after me—that's done." She didn't have to tell me that. [00:16:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You and she are being open. There's nothing she's hiding. You'd be far more suspicious if she didn't tell you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's very, very honest. I felt good and I felt good with how I was dealing with it. I was just very mellow. I just listened to her. I've so changed with every chick I've been dating recently. I just listen. If they say something that seems like—in the past—you know what I mean? Not that I did that in the past, but . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what? That's bullshit. I'm making it like it's my fault. It's not my fault. It's because they were causing me—like if Samantha or Michelle—like if someone was just honest about something—if Samantha had said, "Listen. I was dating this guy. This is who he is. This was the situation. I'm kind of not sure," I would have handled that very differently; but when she was acting very weird on the one hand, but acting like my girlfriend on the other, that can make you crazy. Whereas if someone just says, "Look. This is what's going on . . . " I handled things well. It's not like back when I was seeing Samantha. I was like 14. If she was just honest and mature, I would be like, "All right. It's a bummer. I'm in love with you." So I want to do that because we actually talked about that last night. We have a very similar—she was saying how in these past relationships she felt like everything was kind of her fault, although it really sounds like she was with some really douchy—I was with some people that had issue, but these sound like some really manipulative, douchy guys. She said she always ended up feeling shitty and like everything is her fault. She was like, "I've worked hard. I don't want that to happen again. I know now that it wasn't my fault." I was like, "We're kind of similar that way. I was made to feel like certain things were my fault. They totally weren't. People were just projecting their shit on me. I'm fucked up, too. Everybody's fucked up, but I really don't project. Or if I do, I immediately catch it and I acknowledge it and I tell them I'm sorry. Whatever it is, 'I have anxiety attacks sometimes, so I'm sorry right now.' Some people, as smart as they are, they don't get that and then they get defensive and they don't want to deal with that shit so they just make you feel like shit." [00:19:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In their own stuff, wrapped up in their own stuff inside, they end up sending very mixed messages. I think that's what you're describing with Samantha—on the one hand she's here, and then on the other hand she's here. You're saying that, in some ways you both now, you and Gwen, are aware you're sending a mixed message what comes from inside you? She could have just canceled, and then you think, "Oh, it's a game," and then it snowballs in that direction, which it might have with someone else. It sounds like there's health enough in her that she calls back up and says, "Actually, it's coming from this in me. It's not really you." [00:20:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. And I told her I really appreciate it. That was such an awesome conversation. Even on the phone (chuckles) I was kind of like, "Look. I just really like you. I haven't liked someone like this in a long time. Things like that, being honest, doesn't mean anything in the sense that I expect A, B and C, or we have to be together all the time. I'm just letting you know; and what do I know? Maybe you're a nut-job. Maybe I'm not going to like you." I kind of poked her a little bit and made her laugh. I was like, "Right now I feel like we have kind of like a rare thing. It's really nice and I'd like to see what happens. I would be really bummed if you didn't do the things you want to do—if you didn't pursue the things that make you happy in school or work. That would really bum me out. I want to help you do those things if I can, or at least just cheer you on." So it was cool. [00:20:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting. She's both worried about being smothered and taken up too much by somebody else, and about being judged herself and not enough for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't get the thing about smothered. I don't know if it was smothered. I think what she was saying is it was from her. I think what she was saying was . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She gets wrapped up in it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She moves kind of quickly and she gets really, really . . . but, yeah, when I told her there's no need either way for anything like that—things are going great. Let them keep going great. I was like, "Do your thing and there's no formula." There was no expectation. The only thing we would probably both expect we're already doing, which is just being honest and being cool with each other. She was kind of crying on the phone. It was really very sweet. She's a very heart-felt person. She's what I wish these other douche-bags would have been. She's so strikingly beautiful, but she's worked it out. These other chicks are strikingly beautiful, but they've retreated into this cool façade. It's just a fucking cluster fuck. This girl is very honest. She's like, "Yeah. I have a pattern. I have a certain kind of dude that I thought was very smart and this and that, and that's the person . . . but I never took the time to really understand if there's a real connection or if they're fucking assholes." [00:23:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds very familiar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I told her I had the exact same thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even her description of feeling like she could get ahead of herself in being swallowed up by the relationship and losing sight of her life—that hasn't been you for a while, but I think for you there may be some resonance also. You kind of know what that feels like—rushing into something. You've had times -</p>

<p>not recently—but times where you feel like you've made decisions even about your professional pursuits that you might have otherwise not made had it not been for the relationship. [00:23:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Absolutely. Which will never happen again. It doesn't matter how in love. That was a huge lesson. That one particular thing with Michelle was huge. I do regret that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're both in a place of wanting to hold onto yourself while pursuing a relationship. She's saying that to you, too. "I don't want to lose myself. I want to be me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And what she's saying is, "I'm self-aware now. As things are happening I'm aware now." I was like, "That's awesome." It was really cool. We were just sitting on her porch having some cigarettes, drinking. It just felt really good. It was hot and cool—whatever—chemistry and all that shit; but it's also just awesome and normal and adult. It was really cool. That being said, I've got some other dates lined up because I'm not doing that again. I clearly, clearly like her, but something in me is just, "No. Unlike other times I just want to . . . " [00:25:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have these other dates planned. I'm going to go on them. I'm not going to start an exclusive—we've been on three dates. They're awesome and, clearly, there's something going on. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that's you not wanting to get ahead of yourself, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, almost like I'd rather go out with other people. Nope. That's why I like Gwen. I'd rather get this other stuff out of the way. (pause) [00:26:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It still sounds like there's this little data point about her talking too much that you don't know how to pull that in to be part of her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As you said it, it literally just popped into my head, my guitar player, Philip, is the 44-year-old. We're close in age, but he just seems older. He's a dad. He seems like our uncle somehow. Stu is 29, 28, something like that. Stu is with his girlfriend. They're definitely getting married. They live together and all this shit. Philip has two kids. One night we were talking and Stu said something—it was so simple, but it resonated—maybe just because of where I am. He was like, "Dude, it really is a choice. It's a decision." I don't mean to be crass, but he was like, "You know. I just want to fuck some girl. If I can tell she's into me, like you come to a bar or after a show or at work, you can tell with some girls if I made a couple of moves, this girl is all mine. Sometimes I want to do that; or if she is annoying the shit out of me. But that really is a decision. I've just decided that with all of that, being with her outweighs not being with her." I think that's maybe, yeah. Like last night I was getting tired and having trouble even focusing after she was just going on and on about her job. I think part of me was also like, "Look how beautiful she is. Look how cute these cats are. We had a great dinner and we're just hanging out. What do I expect?" (chuckles) I also thought it was kind of hot that she felt so comfortable. I think that's how I took it. I think part of me was just being a dude. I really just wanted to have sex with her that moment and I could tell that she was just wound up from work, so I had to kind of just get over that hump. (chuckles) Then I literally didn't want to have sex. I was like, "All right. Now I just want to sleep." [00:28:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting. As you describe it now, there's this moment where you want different things from each other. What you're wanting from her and what she's wanting from you, in that moment, are discrepant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think what's happened is she's divulged more to me than I have to her. She still kind of doesn't know things about me, but she's told me a lot about her, her family and all of this stuff. I think that's just me. I'm really enjoying just being mellow. I really like this girl. Talk, man. I'll listen. I don't fucking care. [00:29:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you saying there's something about it feeling imbalanced, like you know her at this point better than she knows you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. If it continues and I feel like she's not asking more about me, then it would bother me a little bit. I like people to ask questions. I like to go back and forth. I think right now it's that I'm being understanding in the sense that she fucking hates her job. I think she doesn't like to come home to a messy apartment. I think when that happens, you can get a little—she admits that she's drinking more. For her, three or four glasses of wine is drinking a lot. She is acknowledging it. I just feel good overall. I'm just like, "Chill. Whatever. I'm playing with her cats. I just like her." I don't have that much that I really need to get off my chest, but I think she does. She's kind of in a bind at work. Her hours kind of suck. She's tired. [00:31:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's also sounding like it's something you're noticing, but you almost don't know what to make of it quite yet. If it's something that gets worse and continues and deepens and she's never asking about you, that's one thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think that will happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like you think it will.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even last night, she was so sincere after she told me about the ex coming over. She was so cute about that, too. She was like, "And I don't like calling him my ex because it was really nothing to begin with for him to actually be an ex. That's giving too much validation to what it actually was." I like that. But then after that she was like, "So, since we're talking about this stuff, what about you? When was your last . . . " And that was the only time I kind of did talk a little bit about Julia and then just about how I've been spending the last few years trying to deal with these patterns and not wanting to repeat patterns. That was the one thing I kind of threw out there. (pause) [00:32:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What Stu was saying sounds like a piece of what you're incorporating into this. The first-stage rush of what you're wanting from each other is almost identical as the date goes on in a 24-hour period. Then you get into a phase where you start to feel like there are little moments of different things you might want, and that's part of normal relationships. There might be moments you'd rather not be there listening to her talk. There might be moments she'd rather not be able to . . . and how that gets navigated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. Nothing's perfect. Absolutely. I'll tell you, even the way she dresses is awesome, but it's not on that check-list kind of awesome. I like it, but I was like, "You know. Look at her. She's fucking beautiful." Like this would be douchy and if I complain about this . . . I'm sure the other stuff was douchy, too. (chuckles) If I ask any of my guy friends they'd be like, "You are an idiot," but in this case it would be blatantly insane. She's beautiful. She dresses really nice, but that's the thing. On my check-list is that very artificial—I just want her to be that hot little hipster chick, and she's not. She's just a beautiful girl. She has this style, but it's not always like a uniform. [00:34:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even the language you just used a minute ago, "it can't be perfect", then you get into this phase where you sometimes want different things—whatever. Given a four-hour date, those differences will come up. I wonder if there is still though a fantasy that what perfect would be is wanting the same things all the time from each other, and that that is perfection—perfectly meeting each other's needs. Do you know what I mean? [00:34:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you talk about the mirror, for example, wanting your own mirror. Is that what perfect is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Usually for me perfect is more superficial than that; that's why I'm saying it's bullshit. It's neither here nor there. Perfect, as in really cool apartment and the way she dresses, I just know now that not only does that not exist, I don't want it to exist. What is that? That doesn't make any sense. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're even talking about it in a realm that has nothing to do with her appearance when you're talking about it. She's talking, you're listening, you'd really rather have sex at that moment, but she's going on about her work. It's not perfect moment, but there's something, I actually think, because you never had, particularly a mother who responded in a good enough way to who you were and what you needed—in your appearance, in your personality, in your intelligence, in your interests, in your artistry—that you never got to know "good-enough" responding. And when there's hardly anything in responding to what you need from the other person, the alternative becomes this fantasy of perfect responsiveness. That somehow there would be this one-to-one correspondence. I need this, she provides this. I need this, she provides this. </p>

<p>CLIENT: In the past, that's why I would read into things. Sometimes a girl would say something very innocently and I would read into it. Yeah. It's true. [00:36:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be great if 75 percent of the time she were responding to what worked for you, and sometimes she won't. And sometimes you won't for her, either. That's actually kind of how healthy relationships work—navigating difference. There's going to be differences in every person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And making choices. It was amazing that when Stu said that, in my mind I was like, "Mother fucker. That's so basic. This is a 28-year-old. That hurts me. Wow. You're kidding me. I'm 40 and I never really got that concept?" Actually, with Gwen we talked about that. I said, "What it is, it sounds like with both of us what happens is if you have that kind of check-list that you're looking for and if you bring to it the idea that, generally, things are your fault, that's a recipe that you're immediately at a disadvantage. You have no power. You don't even know if you want to be in the relationship, did you choose to be in the relationship? Things are just happening because you think—and then when you're in it they, of course, have more power than you because this is a check-list." And that's part of it. There's never a sense that this is a decision. Do I want to be with this person and all of their imperfections or do I not? I don't have to be with this person. It's not going to be the end of the world. What the fuck. One day I'll tell Stu that. I was like, "Wow, dude." [00:38:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds wise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wise, but also that's what's so painful to me. How is it that people get that at that age? That's some fucked-up shit that I have not been able to understand that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were surrounded by fantasies of perfection your whole family life. That's all people had of what was good. Good is perfect fantasies that aren't real. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's insane, man. (whistles) (pause) [00:39:07] I've got kind of an ethical problem. Do we have a few minutes? At Mike's wedding, his niece, who is turning 18—at first I was kind of buddy-buddy with her. I'm kind of like that. I have a way of people that I meet initially, if I get a good sense of them, especially if it's that kind of context—we're all in a wedding together—I immediately will kind of break the ice or I draw people in pretty fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Make people feel at ease.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very much at ease, yeah. I didn't think much of anything. I didn't even talk to her that much throughout the wedding, but she friended me on Facebook. Okay, that's fine. She's been totally chatting with me and stuff. It's very sweet. I think maybe she has a crush; nothing weird. She hasn't been saying anything weird. I don't know what to do, kind of. It's kind of hot. She's really beautiful. She's almost 18. Whatever. But, yeah. It's a lackey. [00:40:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There was no contact?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hell, no. Physical contact? No. Are you insane? No. No, no, no, no. There was almost no contact-contact.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of any kind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think it was just I was the best man. I'm pretty awesome. (chuckles) She's really into music. I don't know. We were having a great time. Not just because I was the best man but because I just tend to be like that, I was definitely kind of adding color and definitely keeping the festivities energized. I don't know what the hell it was. I joked around with her a little bit, but nothing. (chuckles) It was innocent kind of stuff. She had to stand in for one of the ushers during the rehearsal, this guy, so for a while I was just calling her a guy's name; but there was no . . . I don't know. [00:41:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's the ethical problem?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess I feel bad that I'm flattered and it's kind of a turn-on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your feelings you feel like you almost shouldn't be having.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, though I know if I told any of my guy friends they'd be like, "Dude. She lives in a different state. Nothing's going to happen. Clearly you're not . . ." Whatever. They'd also be like, "Dude. She's not innocent." I think I have some feeling like she's innocent, like she's not. (laughs) She's fucking not innocent. I think that's where I have some old-school—like she's a girl. She kind of is, I guess; but she's not. She's almost 18. She drinks and she does stuff. I don't know. Is there anything? Is that . . ? [00:42:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's unclear. You're not actually saying there's an actual, ethical problem like statutory rape or something. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well fuck no. No. Of course not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there's something that feels complicated in your own feelings, like is there a problem with being attracted to her or being turned on? Flirtation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have been kind of flirting—innocent flirting, but flirting. I'm not doing anything wrong. Yeah, I'm not doing anything wrong, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's your question. You're not sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but . . . (both laugh) I've got to talk to my guy friends about this. (chuckles) [00:43:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want reassurance that there's no problem whatsoever, but there's something that you're worried about inside you, that I actually don't think the point is for me to reassure out of it. Do you know what I mean? Your feelings are actually what's important about it—what the consequence is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you know what it is? Maybe it's not her. Maybe what's worrying me goes back to Gwen. I worry, I think, about the monogamy thing. I think that's what worries me. And it does worry me, even with someone beautiful. Do you know what I mean? I kind of do feel like—do you remember what I was saying recently? I don't care that I date a lot. I've kind of grown into it now. I like to date. I'm not married. I like women. I like to date. I treat them really well. I'm not doing anything wrong. I think because I'm enjoying that now, even with this situation, I kind of feel like this is so awesome. I didn't even do anything and this chick has some kind of crush on me. I worry that if I got really, really serious with Gwen, for example, the monogamy thing really worries me. I feel like I'm weak when it comes to that, you know? [00:45:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It brings you back to Stu's comment. On the one hand, it feels wise and mature and a relief; but on the other hand, you're also worried about, "Could I make that choice? What would that actually be like? What does it mean if I'm flirting with someone else while I'm seriously dating someone?" [And I want more to unpack or come back to.] (ph at 00:45:32)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Tomorrow, 11:20? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tomorrow is Friday, right? 3:15.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Son of a bitch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) So we're set now for Mondays at 3:10; Thursday, this time, 12:50; Friday is 3:15.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tomorrow, 3:15. Okay. Awesome. Thanks. See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, how are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good, I was going to tell you that I was like really excited.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know, I haven't seen you in a while.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I've been really busy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> March.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it's been that long?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so what have you been doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> School, school, and school.  I'm taking six classes this summer.  Since I was last year, that time I just started taking my medicine by itself, then everything is like, I've been really good, like I was going to tell you this because I was telling my mom this, that it's been like years since I felt this normal, since like young and everything, so I took six classes for the summer and that's a lot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm taking seven classes next semester, to have my A A, and then go to [DEIDENTIFIED], so I'm just, you know, getting everything done while I feel this good because like I've been really scared that it's going to wear off and it hasn't yet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I thought it wouldn't last this long but I've been doing really really good, the best I've done in years and haven't been depressed and just felt normal like a normal person.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I got a report that it's not completely normal.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Why, what did my dad say?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That you're very irritable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh that, see that's another -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That could be significant, I mean that's why I'm bringing it up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The irritableness, I have my movements, I think he's saying that I'm irritable with him ain't I?  Is it with him that he's saying specifically because the thing -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I think he means at times in general, you know, I mean -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not all the time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Here's the deal, I quit smoking two weeks ago, I've been a little bit irritable.  I have my moments, I quit smoking, the only other thing is I do say I am, I have my moments like a normal person I think but the only thing is with the not smoking, I have my movements but with my dad has been the only problem, there's like this thing between me and my dad and I get irritated with him because he's not acting like he was before, he's like completely different.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I feel bad because I know that but sometimes I'm mean and I get irritable with him, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you want him to be?  I mean what do you get irritable about?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just like, he does think, talk, nothing the same and it just, he's always like, I don't know, he's always telling me the same stuff over and over.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that feels, you know, I shouldn't be</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> His memory is screwed up, you realize that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know, his memory is screwed up and I get irritated with that or he treats me different than my sister, like he'll nag me about stuff but not my sister about anything and that makes me feel crappy, like he's always had his face in something about me getting that ECT, he's always been different towards me.  Me and him used to be like this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It affects his memory.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and so the first time he got ECT, I told my mom, I said, because I think, I feel that I know his moods better than anyone, that you know it was something different ever since he got ECT and went to the hospital and visited him.  He like looked at me weird like he disliked me.   All he remember was, you know -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He doesn't dislike you, I guarantee you that</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He hated me in the beginning for a long time and so we had our issues, like he hated me [PHYSICIAN NAME], he really did after he got ECT, then things got a little bit more normal where he's not the same but I think his memory started coming back more, the past, like raising me and he realized that me and him were closer than any of them but for a long time he didn't realize that because he had lost all his memory that me and him were the close ones, despite my big mouth, I'm just like him, I'm not scared of him, me and him will clash because he sees I'm not scared of him, you know, we're both the crazy ones, like the -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but he doesn't have the energy and ability to clash, I mean.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He doesn't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To get out of them, I mean, yeah, he's -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's gotten -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's kind of aged him faster I guess -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It has and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nothing I can do about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know that he thinks different too, you know, his way of thinking, like saying things or thinking, his whole thought process like he could say something should be done this way, it's completely different than what he would have said before, like it's changed him that much, did you know that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it could be.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like maybe he would have done something in front of us that he had done before, said something or maybe he would have like, just something, I'm trying to think of something stupid to say for example like, I don't know, just his whole way of thinking of things is completely different, I don't know, it's weird so me and him clash.  I think I am angry because, about a lot of things in the past like a few years ago when he really lost it and he left, you know, and took all the money, that was a lot of stress on me, it was my first year in school and I was trying to go to school and I had to get a job and try and work full time and I had a lot of anger when he lost it and remember a lot of things that he said to my mom and to me, you know, and stuff and I realize he can't help it because he's bipolar but still I know it's the fact that, and that's why I left, when I  moved out of my apartment it was a lot to do  because of him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you've got to get -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Get past it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Get over that.  You know what the trouble with that is, you took it personally and he would have done it to anybody wherever he lived.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I felt like he picked out of everyone, the worst.  Like my sister he don't mess with as much, you know, and sometimes I try and irk him to get on my sister.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know him well and there's no way he picks out you.   He going to be mad at everybody and what makes him the maddest, the place is a mess or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it's not even a mess though [PHYSICIAN NAME], he has that OCD thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, to him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and like you wash dishes and you clean the thing but you have to like scrub everything down, you have to clean the sink out exactly right and dry it and if I do the dishes and leave them out to go wait till they dry and then put them up, then it drives him crazy, you can't do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You can't, you can't take off my flip flops right here.  I wake up and he'll have my flip flops in my bedroom.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Get your mother to buy a bunch of paper plates and bowls, then just throw them all out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I told her what we should do, we should take everything out of the kitchen, there'd be nothing and just go out to eat because my dad wants a house that is not lived in, you don't do nothing in the house, you know, you just come in the house and sit there like this, you know, do not take off your shoes, do not do nothing, we should just even go get a hotel and sleep in it, you know, just have the house to sit there during the day because he is ridiculous about it.  He's gotten a little bit better, he just has his moments but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well anyway, see the things you're angry about, you're old enough now to look back and go, like he couldn't help that, I mean, don't take it personally, really.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know and I feel bad because I know I'm starting to realize it because I feel guilty when I get like that with him and stuff.  I mean, I've gotten a lot closer with my mother and I do get hurt with stuff, you know, I see how he is to my mom and stuff but he is doing a lot better, he's just different, that kind of bothers me and I know I need to work on that but yeah, I quit smoking so that's the other thing I've been a little bit irritable about but I've been a lot happier.  You see, my dad doesn't know like my mom does a lot with me, you know, and everything and we have our things where we don't really talk that much, you know, and everything but, yeah, I've been doing like, my mom was so excited because remember I've always been struggling in school and stuff since all of this and everything and now I'm doing really good in school.  The only thing I can say and I don't know if I'm doing this like kind of on purpose which I think at first because I'm scared to go out, but I really don't go out with friends or do anything or even talk to any of my friends really anymore, because remember I was telling you I was getting a little bit anxious sometimes but a lot of them drink and I'm just so happy that I won't even drink alcohol because I'm scared I'll go back into depression and everyone goes always out drinking, it's always go here and have some drinks and go to this bar and I just know if it's right there in front of me, I'm going to want to drink like everyone else so I don't really talk to anyone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just don't drink like everyone else.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If everyone's drinking and I'm sitting there sober.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just remember this, remember I put these numbers here, that's what a DUI costs, to get out of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you get out of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, oh yeah, I don't have that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that's a damn good incentive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I don't want a DUI or getting in a wreck or hurting anyone, I really really don't but I think that I can't even believe, I think I'm doing a lot better.  I'm really really happy, like I was like really really excited, you don't understand, because I didn't realize until I sat down and I thought about it and I started feeling good.  You know, maybe lately I've been more irritable but for the last two months before, because it's been about three months, for two months I have been doing awesome.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm still doing awesome but I mean I can't even explain to you how I can't believe how young I can remember feeling depressed and I was trying to think of how back, it's been, I'm only [AGE] and it has been years [PHYSICIAN NAME], since I have felt normal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, here's what we have to consider.  Now you've got the Lexapro 20 is it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, do you take the Xanax much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh, that's emergency only.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I haven't used it, almost one time that I took it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Here's the thing, we don't need to do this now but there's definitely at least two bipolar people in your family.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh don't tell me I'm going to be bipolar.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But the trick is that if bipolar people get depressed, sometimes they need an extra different kind of medicine so I'll see that now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not bipolar though yet, right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How do you know really if I'm bipolar, what if I'm, like the reason I don't leave the house too sometimes, I felt like I was behaving like my dad but if I got away from it, I wouldn't act so much like this craziness that I do with my flipping out, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I know but -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How do you really know, how do I figure out if I'm bipolar?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well by symptoms and by the fact that, well I'll show you kind of what the symptoms are, I've got a thing here about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to be bipolar, I will die if I'm bipolar. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, what you really ought to think is if I am I damn well need to know it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I need to know it but I don't want to end up like my dad, man, I mean I couldn't do what he is doing, I think I would have already done killed myself or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean he's been through a lot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What you have to understand is he's a pretty bad case, an unusual case, he's worse than most people with it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really, okay, because that's pretty scary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you can just take this and look at it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because that would be the thing, the things we would kind of look for and those things only come on a day or a couple days.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Can't some of these be kind of anxiety too, like when I get excited, like when I first seen you and I came in, I get all hyper and stuff, I have my hyper moments.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it could be but it's a pattern over time, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not, just keep it around, I'm just telling you, if we're to do this right which we're going to do, then we're going to watch for those things, you know, over time, but right now you're doing good and we want you to get through school.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, isn't it, but some of these are different things too, they're not just bipolar right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, they're not purely bipolar.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  How many of these should I say yes too to be bipolar?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does it tell you on there, I think it's -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Does it tell me?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not magic anyway.  I think the number is six or something like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Anyway.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, this is kind of an embarrassing question but I've got a question, because I know that bipolar people, in sex, where they go, is that symptomatic of anything else?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wanting to have a lot of sex, is that just a bipolar thing?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, it could be other things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But suppose somebody is, I'll give you an example.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They've been depressed four months and all the sudden they're out interested in getting laid and sex and thinking about sex for two days, then they're normal a while, they don't have that, then they get depressed again, it comes and it's not like the person.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, it's their problem, it's not the person.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll bet you there's a lot of bipolar girls out there who got pregnant when they were manic, on the manic side, you know, because they were much sexier, you know, but you could be on the manic side and sex is not one of your, you know, symptoms, so irritable and anger is one though.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was really happy that you didn't like put me as bipolar when you first seen me and I was losing it kind of, you know, because most people want to say -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mostly seen you depressed, you know, there's no doubt about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so that kind of scares me</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's why this is so hard for a psychiatrist to diagnose, this is what we call bipolar 2, your father, he's bipolar 1, he's the big time bipolar.  Bipolar 2, they just get these little episodes of these things for hours or days and then they go back, they're out of it and that's very hard.  I might see somebody for ten years and never see that, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because you're not in their every day life seeing it, you see like -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're not going to tell me it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Sometimes I don't know, like if I was bipolar would I really recognize it so much, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, there you go.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm scared, you don't understand, this is like scary for me because I know that I get irritable and start arguments and stuff.  I get the hyper thing is the thing that scaring me right now but I always thought that was my anxiety that I get on this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe it wasn't.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it was.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But a big percentage of bipolar people have anxiety anyway, so more than the general population.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I'll look over the -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But if we ever wonder, the thing to do is add the other medication and then see what happens because sometimes that's the only thing that makes a diagnosis, I give the medicine, they get better and I say oh that means you have that, you know.  My idea is figure it out and control it, you know, there's no moral judgements or anything else about this, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah because, I don't know, if I did get it or if I do have it, I would want to, I would want to know so I can try and handle it and stuff and not lose it one day and do something crazy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's exactly right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I'm just so scared of being bipolar.  I mean, you said, I mean there's a good chance that I could not ever be bipolar.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's a good chance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean there's more of a chance that you're not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, there's more of a chance that I'm not?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Meaning the chance you are, I just have to, this may not be right, when a couple of people in the family have it, the chances of anybody else in the family are somewhere like six to ten percent, something like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh so that's not bad because dad, he's kind of out there.  I think a few of them are kind of out there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In his family, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I think -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A slightly dysfunctional family, you know, for sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he does and my aunt [NAME OTHER] on my mom's side with something maybe, I think I've got a good, I think I've got a good chance, a good chance of being bipolar with the -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've got me to help you so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I never really did tell you thank you so much because I was really thinking how much, like I was losing it and, you know, you call a psychiatrist when you're losing it and never been to one, they'll tell you make an appointment and two or three months to see you and you're like what is that, I'm losing it right now and you're talking about two or three months, what's the deal, I can't even get through the day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I called and you helped me and doctor, the other guy I don't like, this other doctor wouldn't see me and you all really helped me a lot so thank you very much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Who was the other doctor, you mean in my call group?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My dad's doctor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I don't like him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nice guy but, you know, a little strange guy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't like him.  I don't like him at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you got insurance now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, Aetna, changed, Aetna again but I always change plans with a different company it's always frigging Aetna and it's, they're the PPO so I don't know which, I think it changed to which mental health group.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not mine?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have no idea.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you got the card, [NAME OTHER] can find out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Lexapro 20, 20 mg.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they shorted me two pills at the pharmacy.  I'm going to start counting my pills because it's too expensive.  They shorted me like two pills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, what's it cost you with the copay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fifty dollars.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll give you some samples.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't that those pills cost nearly that much to make.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh they don't but they can, if you just went out and bought them they're probably two eighty, three dollars a piece.  I agree, it's crazy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's still better but the thing is, I'm going to try [DEIDENTIFIED], I heard [DEIDENTIFIED] has got some of them cheaper.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm going to try [DEIDENTIFIED] now.  Try a different one, maybe I'll get lucky.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well since you're going to take it, some of them will be cheaper to get a ninety day supply at the same time.  Let me write you one for ninety days too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I think, it's three fillings.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, sometimes the deal is, you only have to pay two copays for three months worth.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, I can try that and see what they say when I try to hand in that prescription, see what they say.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

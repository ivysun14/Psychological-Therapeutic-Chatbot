<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... -110, Therapist Dayton. The date is November 5, 1970. Interview Number 1, Client 1429-110, Therapist Dayton, November 5, 1970. </p>

<p>You want some coffee?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, might as well. I've been drinking it all day long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be right back. </p>

<p>Here you go. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You take it black?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible at 0:01:17.0) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I say it's a little cindy (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, too hot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was really a wild day. I was just - I've been a teacher, and three minutes before I left the office I really was in a calm frame of mind when I left the office. Just we have this - we just moved offices and our whole office is really kind of a - there was a lot of tension between various units, you know, and we had one kid we had to place out at a psychiatric institute. When we moved, it's only been three days we've been in the new office, and we don't have a large staff so... 0:02:14.8</p>

<p>This one kid we've got to get some clothes for, and since we've got to get some clothes for him there's a procedure that you have to type up, it's a very simple procedure. And this old woman, a supervisor at the old office, we had everything scheduled, There were three different agencies working with us and we had the kid all ready to go. All we needed to do was pack up the clothing and have people to get the clothing, and she got so petty she just refused, on the basis that we're a new office and we should have new staff already developed so I mean I just couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That she could be that petty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And inane-ish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you got her all upset I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, yeah, I did at the time, and, well, I couldn't get upset at her because I was talking to the worker I had been volunteering with who I know, and I'm out of that office, let's say, I won't (ph) do it any more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you don't give a shit about them, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I give a shit about the workers, but not about the...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not about her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not about her as supervisor. This damn tape recorder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bother you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I have a friend that came here before and she said they use the tapes. I'm not sure about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it you're not sure about? Maybe I can help clear it up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, how will the tapes be used?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's not my - maybe I can't clear it up for you. I think what's going to happen is that the researcher is going to choose kind of a random fashioned responses that either you or I make, and I don't know which one he's going to focus on, whether it's going to be you or me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The researcher, now; who does that mean? The guy who would be your supervisor? 0:04:10.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, I'm not going to be supervised on therapy at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What are your qualifications? I guess that's what I want to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. Well, maybe you should ask that out straight, just like you do...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, okay, I've been here at the center, I've been on staff at the center for about six years now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess I'm considered a senior staff person here. (Inaudible at 0:04:37.9), you know, the student level, on the internship level and stuff like that, so I'm one of the regular staff members here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you like written for a degree in...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Therapy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, in psychology. There is no therapy department. The university doesn't have a therapy department that awards a degree.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess I - well, I heard they did, that they did...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, there's clinical. See, the area of clinical psychology within psychology, but the departments which would offer degrees would be things like psychology or human development or education and educational psychology.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess I just heard a rumor that they had a degree here now in the specific field of psychotherapy, that there was a new program starting up because I was fairly interested in that, but I didn't look into it. I thought maybe...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...maybe you had something...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, that's just a rumor. Okay, but are you also saying that you want to make sure that you're seeing somebody who is confident in seeing you, is that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know, I don't know. I've got a few contacts with this place; most recent was a friend of mine was coming here, you know, for more than therapy. She started a - I don't know (inaudible at 0:06:09.4). She's been in it about nine months. You know, she's had a lot of (inaudible at 0:06:17.3), that she was finding out some things. And then two years ago I was in a class where there was a professor that had graduated from here, and a lot of the experiences he related had to do directly with the counseling center. 0:06:34.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So my knowledge of the counseling center, I don't know. I think perhaps the sort of things I want to do, you know, I'm not sure yet. You know, I really don't know. I've never been in therapy. I've been in (inaudible at 0:06:52.8) groups and stuff like that.</p>

<p> My point when I decided to go into therapy was in an AA, so it's six months since I really felt at that point that I wanted to - I think I still do, because it has lasted for the six months, so maybe it was good that I didn't get into it right away.</p>

<p>Rather, an option that I had, I have a clinical psychologist friend in Fairmont who has been in psychoanalysis for about three years, and I talked to him about it. And so it would either have been here - like during the summer, I guess I just either chickened out or I just didn't bother, because I didn't go to him at his referral, and all of a sudden, you know, I was confronted here because of - my (inaudible at 0:07:55.1) referral was still standing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so then I was trying to figure out do I want to do it or not, and the adminstrator - is it Philips, Ted Philips.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Called me and said, "Are you still interested," and so I hemmed and hawed around and said "Give me the weekend," because it was out of the blue and I didn't know if I wanted to go into it any more. And then I says, "Well, you know I don't think - if I don't I'll never know and so..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So might as well try and find out, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you're aware that this has been set up, like, for 20 sessions, right? 0:08:29.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's time limited, I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The sessions are 45 minutes, are they?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, today will have to be that, because I have to leave at 6:00.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ordinarily we'll have it like around 50 minutes, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, okay. At the end of, like, the 20 sessions, are there any actions to continue, or is it terminal?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, right now let's consider it as terminated at that point. Maybe when we get closer to it we can consider if there can be any other options, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, yeah, because my friend was in a similar program and she's continued, but I don't know if she's in the program or not. She's continued in some program. And is there an option along the way of getting into group, or is that only at certain times?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll have to check that out. I don't think that there's any problem about joining a group while being one of the people in this research project, but just in case there is I'd better check that out. Certainly after the 20 sessions are over there will be no problem with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because originally on the referral thing... How much do you know about me? Do you know anything about...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very little.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very little? Just on the referral or did you get...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I saw that referral sheet, but that was like a couple weeks ago and I don't remember even what was on it. 0:10:14.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't remember what I said on it either. In other words, the testing that I went through, I asked the tester, too, if I would get any results on that, and they said possibly after the whole thing is completed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, I'm sure that that's the case. I mean that's the way research projects always go. That's why I really don't know what he's going to do with it so that I won't be biased in any way either. That's why I don't know whether he's going to be listening to me or to you or what. I do know that there will be some other tests similar to the ones that you took at the end of the 20 sessions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, that's what I thought it would probably be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so, well, I guess I also heard you saying, though, through that was that, in general, you have good feelings via other people about the counseling center, but specifically for you you're not sure how you feel yet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. When I came in here I asked - see, I was talking with a good friend of mine last night, too.</p>

<p>(Telephone ringing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Excuse me. (Answering call): Hello. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Can it hold until tomorrow? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he's been in psychiatric groups since like - well, it was psychoanalysis on psychoanalysis in groups, and so we were kind of talking it over, and he was quite adamant (ph) while we were together. First of all, I asked Allan about it, are there guarantees, you know. I knew already there is no guarantee that, you know - anything significant or any more of I'll be able to understand myself any more or not, you know, but I hope I will. 0:12:36.5</p>

<p>The thing I talked about last night is like I usually have a thing, which I'm not sure if it's all one way or the other, but I have a thing about - well, I've got to be 90th percentile, see, so if I go into therapy I've got to be in the 90th percentile in therapy and wanting it to succeed. And yet, I kind of have the feeling you're not going to achieve what you're looking for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like if you push yourself too hard and don't stay with where you really are...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and (inaudible at 0:13:14.3) too, very good. See, this one guy, this one guy we had in this one class was like, you know, like a Rogerian is, and he's so... The way I understand, like that kind of therapy, even if it is a kind of therapy, is that it's - it's not so much to be like what Carl Rogers said you should be, it is kind of to be whatever you are. I don't know what you are as a person but... I don't know, I'm all text (ph). Maybe I can pick up a fake Rogerian thing but (inaudible at 0:13:59.60). I don't know. I was in a group once where one of the group leaders was real, you know, wasn't trying to do something, but the other group leader was what I call a fake Rogerian.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay, and it sounds like you're saying that that's not what you want in a therapist, you know. If I turn out to be a fake, you're going to be pissed off. 0:14:15.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, if you turn out to be a fake Rogerian that's a... I don't know anything about it, but I've got that in the back of my head, you know, so I get that on, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you want to be honest and put your cards on the table before you start.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then I think...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Like when I was driving up here I could think about it. I was thinking like really what I might - what I'm out to accomplish, you know, why spend the money. And, well, I have a mythical word for it, you know, like in most of the groups I've been in, and I think there have been three, I would characterize myself by at least, you know, the feelings, emotions and feelings for people. It's really like a cloud code (ph) thing that I don't really know a lot of times what I feel until after it's - I don't feel it spontaneously; that's one of the things I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to think about it afterwards.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. A friend of mine had an expression for that, too. He said it's like if somebody insults you, you know, a girl insults you or a guy, anybody insults you, well, say, he was referring to a girl, and say, ten minutes later you look around and you're your balls on the floor and then you realize, you know, what's happened to you. And a lot of times my ways of reacting are delayed, delayed reaction; you know, I don't know why. See, I don't know why, and I don't even know, if I know why, if that would help. 0:16:41.7</p>

<p>Yeah, after I - I figured, and I figured, okay, we'll try the Freudian routine, only I didn't go into that, like, a lie. [I read Karen Hornie] (ph) (inaudible at 0:16:54.8) you would say, and self-analysis, I read that thing, so I tried that out, you know. That scared me, because I only did it once, you know; it's a pre-association thing, and it kind of focused on my earliest memories up until my senior year of high school, and I knew that - the association, I guess, but that was the area where I wanted to let things come, because I never could remember my early stuff, you know. </p>

<p>So I tried it and I just wrote things down on a page, one-word things to symbolize events, and I never went back to it. I've read it a couple of times, but when I read it I put it away, because it brings back a lot of things, a lot of ways of reacting to people that I still - I think I still feel, but not about my life. You know, I'm unable to make the connection.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying that you still feel but don't like, or somehow concerned about, is that right? 0:18:04.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because, while most of the things I thought about were - I don't know, it's funny. I don't know how those things usually go, but mine was mostly negative things; things like pain, the running away. Not running away from home, but running to my grandmother's house. Things that at the time were not - you know, a little kid. Like I remember wanting to - a little kid, 11 years old, could not think that these things were happening, but he could feel them happening and he could understand that something bad was happening, you know, the personality thing, and could feel that but he couldn't say that. </p>

<p>You know, and later - I never realized before that, you know, this always - this sort of thing was going on, that I did have early memories, and all of a sudden that one time we all pushed back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Early memories which are very difficult to deal with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, because I really wonder how they're influencing my behavior now. But the first time I came here, I had been dating a girl, who is a very strong, you know, in my opinion, relationship to me; it's a very strong girl. And I didn't know it until after about a month, but was doing nothing but confronting me, confronting me why I haven't faced this, why I haven't faced that, why I did something such-and-such, you know, all the time confronting me, and I never realized that and I took it, you know, all the time. 0:20:03.9</p>

<p>And then finally, well, we broke up, you know, and then I said, you know, she's right in a lot of ways. I haven't done this and I haven't really taken a look, and so that's why at that point I decided it was time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you also felt then that it was time you took a look at what you were doing and why you were doing what you were doing, huh? 0:20:27.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or why I wasn't feeling what - why my feelings weren't coming at least to the surface, why I couldn't, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they weren't even coming to the surface about how you felt about her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, there were a couple of good things I had with her. I mean I didn't (ph) manage to get angry at her, you know, which was a good thing. That initiated it. I think it's a combination, like. Prior to January of this year I was a teacher for a public school at the West End office; for a year and a half I was there, from '67, yeah, from '67 until January of '70, and that, I don't know if you're familiar - that's the kind of job where a lot of people go that are either in-between or need a job that, you know, will subsidize you pretty well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there you work with money, you know. The virtue you have there is if you can get things out, that that makes - good thing is no policy, know how to get around things. </p>

<p>And then I came to children's division, because I felt, God, I've got to get out of here, because I promised myself only a year would I be there. And then I came - right now I volunteer with foster children, which I think is - maybe it's because I'm ready, but maybe it's because of the uncertainties I have when I deal with the kids. Because when I stepped into that office, they said "We now have a man working on the floor," and at the time there were 30 women, only one man. They says, "Give him all that the teenage boys, the problematic in each one. So they gave me a wrath of - you know, even you'd have trouble with it. I mean, God... 0:22:29.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, the wrath of the problem, not 18...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, shit, you know, they're all - well, they're not. They're likeable, but I can't understand them. I cannot understand what the hell is going on, and I think the reason I can't understand is there's too many things blocking myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, like there are too many things about yourself you don't understand so how can you understand about somebody else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, and then just given the circumstances of the conditions under which you work and it's just - there's no way to describe that former office. I had a motto on my desk and was quite serious about it, you know, and the super problems were handled superficially, it was the way things went, and that was constantly on me all the time, all the time, all the time. And it wasn't just the job thing, it was the very fact that like either I've got to do it reasonably well, and I wasn't doing it reasonably well... Everybody thought I was, but I knew I wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you didn't feel as though you were.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That brings back to what you were saying before about being a 90th percentile. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, right, right. You know, now that may be real and that may be fake. Ain't (ph) sure all about that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What it says, I think, is what you want to do you want to be able to do well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, okay, and I think there are other things that I need that done, yeah, might the converse might be so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What...</p>

<p>PATIENT: The converse would be what I want to do, I want to do well, because the alternatives are really bad. Like this friend of mine, you know, last night was getting on me. He said, "If you ever admit to yourself that you're average, you know, then you might have a chance. I said, "I'll never do that, you know, I'm not going to admit that," and anyway... That's kind of why - you know, that I think contributed to it. 0:24:39.0</p>

<p>And then like I've been doing the bar scene for about two years, and the bar scene being that the stand-up bar and the [pack 'em in] (ph) bar, so that thing was - I don't know. I mean like you get into a pattern where you rarely stay home, you usually go out. You find no demands made, but no satisfaction as well. And I say, okay, (inaudible at 0:25:13.5) enjoys that, but I wonder why. I wonder why that's so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean why you weren't getting that satisfaction, or why you were continuing to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, why I was doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...(Cross talk) huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I say, okay, why do I do this? Well, it's the course of least resistance, because any other way is - you know, I get all these big things like things I want to do; I should read, I should do a lot of things, but, you know, I'll just, (inaudible at 0:25:46.8) go out every night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, just find yourself making the bar scene instead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and not much goes on there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not much that you feel gratification about anyhow. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, if you're horny once in a while, you can... That's about it. You know, some nights you talk to somebody that - you know, you feel like, you know, you can't tell, like if you need the booze to just talk or to... 0:26:23.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:26:30.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so what are - you're confused about why you do it, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what the hell impels you to the bar scene, except that it seems like, somehow, a better alternative than sitting at home and reading, although you're not sure why that is except...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...except for those rare occasions, or if not rare, those few occasions when you feel you're horny.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, when I arranged the cards - you know, you have this little card game that you play, where you arrange the 94 cards or 98 or whatever - well, when I arranged the cards I said the thing I would most like to be, characterizing myself with the thing I am now is confused, that would be on the one stack, the one card. On the other stack it was the thing I most want to be - no - the thing I least am would be contented, and then when you reverse them... Let's see, the thing I'd least want to be would be confused, and the thing I most want to be would be to understand myself a little better, you know, to reverse the words, you know. And I have the uncomfortable feeling I'm going to have to be the one to give direction to things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're going to have to do the work in it, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, because I'm really used to places where - like in groups. What happens in groups? People - there's a lot of hit and run, you know, and a lot of times you don't have to really follow through with it. 0:28:26.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, and it feels maybe a little bit uncomfortable, knowing that the spotlight is really on you now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because, you know, you can just climb up all of a sudden. And eventually then I'll have to, you know, get down to it, but, see, I don't really know where it's at. I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know where to start looking for it, anything, to get someplace.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have ideas, but I don't - I'm to the point now where I don't even know when I'm taking evasive action, even with the ideas like, yeah, I can - yeah, I don't know. It's really hard for me to say. I can't - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're not going to tell... You usually operate that way; in other words, where you don't establish the direction. Or do you usually operate anyway? You're not going to tell me, are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I guess we're - the only way I can respond to that is that you're really looking for me to try to tell you were to go, and my response to that is that I can't do that. You know, like I don't know where things are for you and I don't think that anybody else can ever know where things really are for you as well as you can, and even understanding that you may not be sure. That doesn't mean that I'm not going to try to help in some way. 0:30:36.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's difficult for me even to know where to begin, because I don't  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that's true, although I can hear you saying that it's somehow easier and more comfortable for you when other people help out in that way, and you mentioned several instances, I guess, where that happens, like in groups. You talked about your friends pointing things out to you and this gal you were going out with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a lot of times like I do - I do really put a lot of stock in what somebody else says, you know, like they say it seriously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you think they all have better ideas than you do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Usually when somebody says something and it's quite contrary to what I say, you know - well, it depends a lot on who says it. My opinion of the person (inaudible at 0:32:18.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if your opinion is high you'll tend to believe that person more than yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. Or else I'll go the other way and find out who I reasonably believe in my position, but not being really open to just talk about it. 0:32:36.0 </p>

<p>Well, I always call him "He," and I've got this - it's like an elusive little thing way inside of me and it's like you're chasing him, you know, you want to catch him, and you never can, because he just - you know, you've got to keep bouncing away. It's a kind of a - it's like my decision maker, and usually I can rely on it, you know. But it's a very small, tiny thing and I wish it was a big thing, and never can really catch him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wish you knew him better, had more confidence in him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, if he's really there, and I never can catch him, never can spot him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so how can you be sure about him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm having trouble getting down to - I don't really think - I think I'm just talking. You know, the thing I always think is most people say, or many people I've heard say it, you know, they all say, "My problem is not so much that - or my problem is that, you know, I know the inner things that I've never shared, but I've never shared them," and I don't think that that's - you know, for myself, I don't think that's so. I think the opposite is true; I don't know very much the inner secrets that I've never shared, and therefore, how can I share them? 0:34:47.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you haven't been able to get a hold of them; there was very little you could talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think what I'm looking for, I don't know if I'm looking for you or someone else or a method in some way whereby, you know, I can break through whatever it is that is keeping those things away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Break through that barrier, to get to know yourself better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because there is something - because I can feel it now. I can feel all kinds of things, I'm keeping it right up here, and they're just numerous, I don't know. It's kind of a - the scary thing is maybe there's nothing there to see; that maybe really I am whatever I am, and, you know, I'm not very satisfied with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it would be scary to find that out. 0:36:02.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I'm not all that comfortable with that, you know. I don't know. Like some people at work will look at somebody, you know, or they'll look at a pattern of behavior, or they'll look at something I do, and they'll say, you know, "This is what you're doing," and I usually can't tell that. You know, I usually can't tell exactly what people are doing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't figure people out the way they can.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can make guesses, but I can't really think it through now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can't think it through, or feel confident on the hypotheses, which reads the way they do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I have real doubts about whether it's so or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that must make you feel inferior to them, at least in the way they work those things out, huh? I think I'm through.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe that's part of it, yeah. </p>

<p>I'd like to hear what that thing sounds, coming back. I think I'd go to sleep.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because (inaudible at 0:37:45.9) boring?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really, yeah. I know why. You know, I kind of know why. But not boring, you know. I guess there are all kinds of levels, but I don't know. I feel kind of foolish, you know. I felt foolish walking in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why? Do you ever call anybody up, you know, and saying, "Do you think you should go for therapy?" I tell people and people get mad at me for saying that, you know. They say - well, I told my one friend, you know, and he says, "Why," you know. "Why do you want to do that," you know? Why do you want to go into therapy"? I told another person, and she - what did she say? Something like I'm always counseling (inaudible at 0:38:54.7) going into therapy," so I figured, God, what the hell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everybody responds to you as being weak, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I mean I feel like an ass if you called somebody up. And I was thinking if I feel that way, supposedly I have some kind of insight into personality or something like that and how you can come to whatever, and what about some poor jackass who has nothing in the way of understanding that and he's got to call up a place like this, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you called up some of the jackasses to ask them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, these people were all - who I thought supposedly would understand why the hell anybody would want to go into therapy and I wouldn't ever understand that. I guess I was a little pissed about it. I told a lot of people; I told about six or seven people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Got to take pride in the therapy, you know. That's really it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that must have been nice, to tell them that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Taking pride in my therapy? 0:40:02.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. You know, like things that I shouldn't probably say anything about, I probably do a lot of times, and - I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just don't know where you stand on that, yourself and trying to understand yourself and be you, whether you should be in therapy or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it might not be the answer, you know. It's kind of - honestly, somehow I have the idea that - you know, the way I feel about myself right now, you know, the kind of confused cloudiness, all that sort of thing, not necessarily the greatest thing for me, you know, but perhaps, you know, I don't have any alternatives, although to keep on going like this is not, you know - maybe I'm not hurting bad enough. You know, maybe you've really got to be hurting to go to therapy. Maybe that's when, more likely, people call. Maybe they're hurting a hell of a lot more than I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like are you worthy...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...of being in therapy? Is that what you're asking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Am I hurting enough. You know, like it's an alcoholic; if you're not down in the gutter, you can't benefit. Yeah, you know, maybe I'll hit the bottom (ph). 0:42:23.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've got to stop where I'm at, Johnny.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd like to suggest, you know, if you want to continue, that we meet twice a week. Is that okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be for ten weeks, then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, or whenever the 20 sessions would be done. And like Monday and Thursday? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, wait. No, wait. We can make it Monday from 5:00 to 6:00.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, okay, this Monday I can't do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in future Mondays, yes, I could do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thursday is always okay with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thursday is always okay. And if we met twice next week how would Tuesday be for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's see. Tuesday next week is the only week I have problems with, because I have to give a talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's make it next Thursday, and then we'll go twice a week after that, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-L-E-C-T-O-R?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Five o'clock?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, probably about 5 after 3:00.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't quite make it that quick.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I might not be able to, either. There's a little toolbox out at the receptionist desk; why don't you stick that in there, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Now how does this - the pay thing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can either pay them when you come in or else they'll send you a bill once a month.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I'd rather take that.</p>

<p>I've got something going on at 12:00; what is it? Something sad. It's a kid I've got to place. All right, thanks a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good to see you today. See you next week. 0:44:35.9 </p>

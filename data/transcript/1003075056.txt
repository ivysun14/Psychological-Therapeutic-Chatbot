<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guess I just want to make sure that, uh, you, you learn something before they got to send you out with the diploma.  I know I, now where did you get your diploma at?  You know, you don't know anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then we've been looking at graduate schools.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wasn't going to ask.  [LAUGHING].  Who's we?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well I mean, it's kind of a must, you know, which I've know for a while, but now it's to the point where my dad's excited about it.  My mom's really excited about it.  We're all excited about it.  I just wish I could figure out what area I want to go in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are the choices?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well there, um, a school that's in Georgia, they have like a masters in like research methodology.  They have a masters in like a clinical area with like, uh, more, um, of a focus of nervous site, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] and at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You taken the GRE yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I bought the books though, haven't opened it, but I got those.  [LAUGHING].  That was my next, um, task, after summer school let's out, then I'm going get started with that, and the testing isn't until October, I believe so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's the next time they offer it?  I thought they offered it all the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did too, but, um, everything I looked up, like, it's certain, you know, testing centers or whatever, and the one is for, I mean I don't mind driving down here and taking it at [DEIDENTIFIED], but the one in [DEIDENTIFIED] it's like there's just certain things on top of certain dates, so you see when they fill up in the spring and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do they offer it down here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] has a GRE test in the summer, and, um, I can't remember the name of those, of the like, the companies, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think [DEIDENTIFIED] does some of them don't they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  There's nothing else in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're going to take, uh, like Kaplan or something?  Prep class?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think yeah, probably.  When they offer it, um, I don't see it though.  I don't remember if I took a prep class for like the SAT or anything like that.  I just like they don't really come into help or if it would help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably would.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I'm not going to say I'm not going to take it or anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably would, most people take it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What you might want to do, is you can go online on the GRE site, on the website, take a practice test.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See how you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, uh, go from there.  Statistical methods, graduate, are you thinking that?  You really liked that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't, not the first time around.  I mean I had to take that class twice because —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of the whole paper counting, um, 45% of your grade —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was it for me, you know, paper, I, I didn't do well on the first one, failed the first one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With the formulas and the math, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It wasn't so much, um, I mean you took the site statistic before that, but I mean that caused me to remain focused more towards the, just the research, I go and do the research and blah, blah, blah, so, I don't know.  I need to decide, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm glad you're finding things that, uh, you're excited about though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm doing really good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your health been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.  I mean I've been under like this stress, you know, but other than that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which means?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean I told you I had the one breakdown —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I mean that was to my mom, and so I mean, it wasn't no [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then at least they got word from the school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh yeah.  I mean was having it three times a week, and having to read, you know, books on [INAUDIBLE] a person, you know, is grading papers and, it was, it was a lot to do, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's kind of what graduate school would be like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you did it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But maybe not as like, just condensed, you know, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, it's a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, it's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thinking of —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thirty chapters in four weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that might be, uh, but you did it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's the main thing, and you did it with age.  You did it awesome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I start crying when I talk to you, and I didn't even, I didn't know what it would be and I go to the other one, it was between the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's awesome.  Your parents must be extremely proud.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it came right before my birthday too, so that was a lot.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What did you do on your birthday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah it's not until next week, but, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  What you'll be at the, what are you going to do on your birthday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not sure, probably nothing.  I mean I'll do something, but I don't even want go somewhere.  I mean I cut my work schedule down to, you know, three days a week during summer school and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You work too?  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um,  [DEIDENTIFIED] Thursday night, Friday night I work, Saturday lunch.  At least I hope to.  I started doing, I started giving up, you know Saturday night's probably like the worst night to give up, but if they're not too kind about, you know, giving up shifts without you having documented reasons, uh, I told them I get tutored on Saturday nights, so I can't work them anymore, and I don't know how much longer that'll last but I know it's [INAUDIBLE], so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The deli girls probably want it anyway, don't they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, until we're understaffed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And when I'm [INAUDIBLE] not for like the servers who —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Think that there are plenty of people there on a Saturday night [INAUDIBLE].  It's just because I'm —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You going to work the, or fall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Am I going to work?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, same place this fall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't have the energy to look for another job.  I don't like living on minimum, but I don't care that much so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you going to do the rest of the summer then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I mean I'm going to work, and then, um, I did want to go up to like career search, and just take like everything besides what they have, you know, on their website, but maybe offered there.  As far as like possibly an internship or, um, what, whatever else I do so, just help me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long you going to stay in [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Wait, how long ago is your lease up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just signed a six—month lease yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, so you're leaving then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, I mean I'm not, I'm not going to say I'm leaving directly after, but I mean I didn't want to sign a year lease, and if we have to do like month to month after that then, you know, it'll be hard, but hopefully not for long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just don't know where you're going to go.  You're not going home are you?  [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My whole family's back here, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your sister?  Didn't work out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I mean she live, I don't even know where she lives really, but she lives with a whole bunch of people.  She was, uh, mentally sick though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, she does?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She doing better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't talk to her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, no I saw her last night.  I mean I know she, um, I know she took one summer school class, but I mean she took music appreciation, I don't know.  I mean as far as I know she did all right with it, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your folks doing okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  I have an older sister's pregnant, so my dad appears okay, but he doesn't talk about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Boyfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's he doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He still works at the same —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Same.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How you guys doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long's it been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Eight years already, except I have to call him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you celebrate on your anniversary?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, because we don't, neither one of us had a date, it's like when are we ever dating.  We need to just go ahead and make one I guess.  I mean he, he met me, like he's, um, he's from here too, so and his mom lives right down the street.  She lives in, um, [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't know, but she lives five minutes down the street from me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He met me here last night, and we went up and saw [NAME OTHER], and that's the only time when [NAME OTHER] was free.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you spending a lot of time together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, actually no yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do your parents think of him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well I haven't introduced him to dad yet, just because I'm not trying to handle this stuff right now, so it's wrong, but I mean she plays him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What would your dad have against him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My dad, my dad's going to have something against anybody that we bring home, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Both of you?  [NAME OTHER] too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, all four of us.  I mean, when like, I mean I grew up watching my dad and my old, my oldest sister has been married for now almost 15 years, and it was only until she finally got pregnant, yeah, after them trying for 10 years or 8 years or whatever it was, that he finally started warming up to [NAME OTHER], so it's just, it was always just so awkward and so tense.  I mean like, when they would come down, and family dinners to see what they were doing and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mean like nobody is good enough for my daughters.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, meaning I'm going to find anything to have against you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because he's so worried about his daughter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, well, I, I, I don't know, I mean [NAME OTHER]'s a good guy, but he, I mean he didn't ever go to college, so that was what he had against him, but I mean seriously to have that, to hold that against somebody for as long as he did because [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER], you know were together since high school, and they're both [AGE] now, so I mean, it just, it took him way too long to start, I mean just being more friendly to him, you know, I don't to have [NAME OTHER] deal with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you've warned him I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't said a word to him.  I mean, I'm sure my mom has.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no your boyfriend, you've warned him about your dad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, he knows.  I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So is he coming down to the beach?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he had to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does your dad ever ask you about him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he never asks, he, no, um—hum.  He don't ask me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's like they don't exist, huh?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He asks about [NAME OTHER], which I mean I don't think he wants to know about [NAME OTHER], but you know and asks about [NAME OTHER].  As far as I know when he met, because [NAME OTHER]'s the one who is pregnant now, which you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When a [AGE] woman's pregnant usually it's not that big of a deal, but so from what I understand like the whole meeting of her boyfriend went okay, but I haven't see that for myself so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where's [NAME OTHER] live, here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, she lives in like, um, like [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I mean she's a, me and her both were likely black sheep, her more than me though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's kind of nice for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean it's annoying.  I mean she, she [INAUDIBLE], because of her age, and she needs to grow up a little bit, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is she working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, from what I hear yeah, she, um, works.  She's keeping a job at least, but I mean when she found out she was pregnant, she was six months pregnant, so I mean it's not, she didn't find out at the beginning.  She found out at six months, so I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We all found out [INAUDIBLE].  I mean we had a lot of say in it, you know.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She didn't like notice something after six months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  You seem in real good spirits, are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mean it's been more even than this, uh, the one episode huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I mean everyone thought that was normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that was like the first time in a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I mean it wasn't like a, I mean it was like a, I had to be like hospitalized or anything —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It just felt like a, I went on about how pampered [NAME OTHER] or something like that over me or, because [NAME OTHER] gets her way all the time, and all she has to do is give them an ultimatum, and they bend over.  I mean I don't know, whatever.  It was just something about the fact.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that the baby thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I mean, it really wasn't even that true, so and to an extent it is, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're much more independent, too though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know about that, not like usually.  Definitely not that.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not totally.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not totally, but you're more so than she is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I mean, and this is something like, I mean I've had to sit here and spend a lot of money.  I can't, I mean [NAME OTHER] makes more money than me, but [NAME OTHER] also, not only does she work more than me, but if she has a job that stays open until 2:00 in the morning, which I'm not willing to do, you know what I mean, not with school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She may be able to do it.  She may be, she may be able to get away with like throwing out her stuff in one place and stuff like that, and I'm just, I'm not willing [INAUDIBLE].  As long as I don't like my job, I do like the fact that we close at 10:00 and I can come home and get my stuff done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take care of business.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your medicines okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You worried about anything besides school?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's automatically behind graduate school more than anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, is it, I mean is it normal like, I feel the, I think I tend to like hurt more from stress than med school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like physically hurt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like what headaches?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, like right here, like I'll, I'll literally, I'll get like little baby [INAUDIBLE] that come out of my leg from stress, and I know you, know that you're always going to get like knots in your leg, but mine's huge, and I just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have them now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, they're not too bad today, but they get bad, they get really, really painful.  Shoot up all and down my back and my neck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Doesn't give you headaches though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum, usually does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It'll give like, it'll make, give me a sore neck but headaches, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it really hurts to move your neck, move your head.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, at first I thought I was allergic to something like that I work with, they just started acting up over and over and over again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum, what do you do for it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll ask somebody at work rub my back or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That helps?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean yeah, but I, I mean it can't happen too often.  I've had, actually the first time like they were really, really, visible and I was looking like a hunch back like I went to the doctor and they gave me, I don't remember the name of them or anything.  They gave me some kind of medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like what's real or, make you tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it was, they said it was a really, really mild, mild muscle relaxer, which, you know, I said was fine, because I couldn't take anything else that would make me drowsy or anything like that, but I didn't know, I didn't know it was like massage was, you know, something I should look into or what.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It would probably help.  Relaxation therapy.  They have, um, at the bookstores you can get tapes on progressive relaxation —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of go though the things where they teach you how to tighten your muscles, you, you ever listen to those kinds tapes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Might want to pick those up, and buy those.  The progressive relaxation kind of go through muscle groups and teach you how to relax, and it can help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like in your shoulder area?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh, yeah.  That helps.  Yoga helps some people.  You exercise at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got somebody to walk with up there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You looking forward to the beach?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yes and no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The no is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, my grandmother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sorry.  You dieting still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you?  How's that working out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can be one determined young woman, can't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's awesome, you put your mind to something —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Using Xanax to sleep still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 4:00 PM.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Works?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't feel tired the next day, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I'm always, but I'm not the nicest person you want to wake up whatsoever, but I'm fine within an hour 30 minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Whether or not you get a good night's sleep you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've been healthy otherwise though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're doing your checkups every year and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You on the pill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get your Paps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Oh, can I ask you about one thing, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was going to the health center —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED] or whatever, and they had like all my medical files, well not my medical files, but you know I was getting like the pill through them —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So they had, you know, records on me, so I went there, I was going to get, um, the usual for me meant like a 10 month supply at a time, and so I was out earlier, so I went and, you know, asked about it, about, um, you know scheduling an appointment whatever, and they told me that I, um, they had sent all my records over to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they sent everyone's records over to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  That's why I wanted to ask you, like if, never, apparently never even, I didn't know about it until I walked in that day.  That was a long eight—hour process of me trying to get one pack of birth control pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they give them to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no, like, um, I went, went over to, whatever [DEIDENTIFIED] or whatever it's called.  Went over there, and they told me I had to wait a few days to schedule an appointment, and I was like, okay, like I don't mind scheduling an appointment that's fine, but I need them today because I'm out, you know, and I cant' wait three days before I start taking them again, it's, you know, doesn't work like that.  They wouldn't give them to me, so I finally found the, like I've been through the doctors care up there a couple times, and so I went there and for, you know, three hours in line, and basically begged her, and not that I do not mind, I need to schedule an appointment, you know, so you can have my, you know files or whatever, you know, just have something on me that's fine, but I need it today, so, um, yeah after, after that eight hour process I finally got them, but I was just wondering why they, or are they even allowed to do that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, is the clinic still open?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know.  I mean they should tell you why they did that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They didn't tell me anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you ask them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not at the time because I was really mad then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would go by and ask them why they did that.  Unless they had a problem with, I would think that's a problem with the clinic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that's kind of what I was worried about, and I mean I personally don't have anything like bad in my files.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean according to like their statistics or whatever at [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'm sure there are a lot of people there who don't want their files received by [DEIDENTIFIED], you know.  Is I, I just, I can't imagine like why —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know.  I mean it's a state, um, agency with the university, and [DEIDENTIFIED] is too.  Maybe there's, I don't know, that's why I was wondering if they shut it down or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I swear, I think they're still open.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'd find out.  Maybe it's on their website or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean I've been going back to, um, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I've just been getting a prescription through her, and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So are you heading out tonight, the beach?  Is that where you're going now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: November 16 - AK - Therapist ~Betty Johnson.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There you go. (chuckling) Actually, I'm now kind of seeing a different doctor because, the guy I was seeing before, I guess he was more like an body dermatologist... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...person. He does like, for some reason you then referred me to him and he's of more like a facial dermatologist type guy... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...for like skin and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So he referred me to this new woman whose like a dermal disease specialist and she's also a dry skin specialist, so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...they kind of have me on a different track... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [audio blip at 0:00:37.9]...thinking I might have something going on with the oil glands in my skin... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that could be from being on Accutane for my acne like six years ago... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...which is causing like some dysfunction, so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I'm like on an anti - it's just like a different approach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm on like an antibiotic now and it's okay, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And so is this time of - the last time we talked about it you were concerned there was going to be something that couldn't be fixed or...long-term, have they given you any prognosis?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's probably chronic. It's hard to say though. Like some doctors were saying it was brought on by my oral contraceptive... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...the birth control I was on. And then if it's because of my time on Accutane, it probably is something that I have to deal with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But hopefully it will get to a point where it's manageable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just kind of like getting it under control right now and then... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm doing all the steps I can. So I mean really, you get to a point where you're like, 'What else can I do?'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then you always talk to somebody who is relatively worse off than you are and you realize it's not that bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Has that happened with someone here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, my good friend of mine in California, she had Dermabrasion three weeks ago, and then she's one of like the .06 percent whose body rejects the surgery.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, my.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Her skin cells are producing these rejectory (ph) cells, which are like causing her a lot of flacky skin and could really seriously lead to permanent rashes pretty soon if the doctors aren't able to get it under control, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you found this out in a way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just talking to her the other day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow!</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, my like skin is not affected or anything, so right there you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So like you can't just skip, you're now trying to keep something in perspective?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And also, I got off my birth control pills. I feel a lot better without - it's really bizarre. I got off, like last Tuesday I stopped, and like this, it was like a few rough days after, with like the hormones adjusting, and I'm sure I will have more because it takes about a month but compared to how - I felt really bad Monday and Tuesday. I was like totally like just down but I, just because it was getting out, but I think it's getting better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it - I think my body just started to not like being on that certain one. After being on it for so long...it changes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Any particular reason why you got off the birth control or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because they want to test it and see if it's contributing to my dry skin. [0:03:01.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because there's other things I can do, and I just am sick of taking a pill and having chemicals affecting my make-up of my - just I mean your hormones basically determine most things and I just would rather just be myself without any like outside influences.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I'm trying that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well...it will be interesting to see how that works out and especially if it is contributive, I'm sure that would bring you some peace of mind to - in order to get a handle on this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well good. Well that's good. It sounds like some things have occurred over the last couple of weeks which have helped you out [pretty much.] (ph) [0:03:45.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've also just been like, after looking at your sheet, I've just been trying to do different things, like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...not - I've just been talking to my aunt and talking to my mom, and they just have been saying that, I'm just like - I am really hard on myself and that I do - I don't like let myself just have a break. And I was thinking that the other day, like Monday and Tuesday when like my hormones were all over the place, I was like just like freaking out about my eye condition, like freaking out about it. And then like, at the end of the day I just like sat on the couch for a minute and I like found myself like watching TV and not like remember, thinking about it. And I'm thinking - and I told myself, 'You don't have to think about this all the time, like you don't have to like fret about this all the time. This isn't like - this is something that's kind of - you're controlling what you can and just give yourself a break. And it doesn't have to be on your mind all the time like. So just like let yourself forget about it, instead of like...' Because I was doing the obsessive, like scouring the Internet for information.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, I remember you telling me that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just stopped. And like I've learned everything I know, like what are these people, who are these people on the Internet? They're probably - it's not going to be the people who are like, "Wow, this works for me." That are going to go on there and be like, "I need to tell people how well this works." It's the people who are like freaking out like me and are desperate for answers or the people who want to like post their like horror stories. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so totally unbalanced.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I'm, then I'm... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how credible or valid is whatever they're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah! And, exactly. And so it's kind of like and sort of like poisoning my mind with like just negativity about things. It's like things aren't going to get better if you're just negative and you think they're not going to get better. So I'm just trying to like turn it around and think...it's going to get better and if it is something I have to deal with forever, I mean, it's not that big of a deal. If I have red skin sometimes, big deal. I mean most of the time people are like, "It's not that red."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) And so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I just kind of, I'm starting just to feel like, just understand like what I am manifesting in my own mind and what I'm not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and the mind can be very powerful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, my gosh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it is the think tank and...why the brain is so important because it does direct or it...direct how we feel and then how we respond and react to certain things in our behaviors. It's the powerhouse. (chuckling) It controls us. [0:06:06.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because Monday I was like, I was driving home from work crying. Like crying really hard, talking to my mom, freaking out about it and, which was funny because like, when I left the doctor's office like the week before, I was like feeling positive that I had like talked to somebody new and maybe they were the right person and finally I got the right person to talk to. And then I like did all the research and found out - I was researching this medication that they put me on and all these people saying it didn't work for them, and in my mind I'm ignoring the few things I read where it worked for people and I'm focusing on the negative. And then I just start freaking about, 'Oh, it's only going to get worse as I get older, as I produce less cells.' And I just, I just was working myself up and I'm - and my mom's just like, "Why are you freaking out about things that aren't happening yet and why are you worrying about the future when you really need to just take things a day at a time?" And I'm like, "You're right." And like why could I - I could do that with everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how then did you find your mom's comments? So how did you experience it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's funny because I find myself being able to - I never used to go to my mom for like support, but I find myself being able to now. It's weird. We just, I don't know. It's just like I think with her I've let go of a lot of things and, I just - it's just bizarre going to her for like comfort and then like taking comfort in what she says to me and it's nice, and I think she likes it, too, because she feels like she's helping me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So in a way, it's almost like bringing us closer in a way, like me having issues and needing help, because she's offered, like go to the doctor's appointments with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, really? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So she's really like trying to reach out and trying to be there for me and e-mailing me. I think I really scared her on Monday. She was being a little, I think, over worried, but my hormones were out of control, like they were totally bizarre. It was like Monday, pretty much Friday through Tuesday. Yesterday I started feeling a little more myself. And it makes sense, I mean, stopping just like a pill you've been on for ten years and it's like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...regulated your hormones. So, yeah, basically that's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And so what has shifted, do you think? Not only your mom's response to your reaching out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry, my phone... [inaudible at 0:08:28.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's your phone? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [It should stop.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About what has changed about what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say that your mom has begun to reach out more...what do you think has caused that to happen that she would (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think because she has been struggling with different antidepressants and anti anxiety pills for like the last (making blowing sound) six years or something. And I think she was with this family practitioner guy and he just had suddenly had seen all these advertisements for bipolar disorder. Wait, what is the one that they're really advertising heavily now? You see it in magazines. There's like a woman with all these pictures of her like being angry and like spending money? [0:09:16.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not quite sure. You mean the medication or the... </p>

<p>PATIENT: The disorder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's probably bipolar.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:09:21.8]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's been in the media and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...more advertised. So this guy was like, well maybe that's my mom. And he finally put her on this bipolar medication. And despite having like side effects that she doesn't enjoy, like weight gain and everything like that, she just seems way more balanced. I mean she's - she did - it's funny, because as a kid I always thought, 'Wow, mom does really weird things.' And I always thought that. Like she would - I would go in her closet and she'd have - like what they say about the obsessive spending, she would like go buy all these clothes for herself and then like five years later they'd all be in her closet with all these tags on them. Just buying like at Christmas, even when we didn't have a lot of money, she bought us lots of stuff. Like Christmases were probably like thousands of dollars worth of gifts. Just like constant, like spend, spend, spend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She'd get like spikes of like rage. She would do like really weird things. Like a couple of years ago, three years ago maybe, she stopped - she saw a dead - like she had - she saw a guy hit a buck, a deer. And my mom like decided that she was going to stop and pick it up and put it in her car. Like weird stuff where you're like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...'Wow, does she know this is weird?'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And only in like the last year she's started to say things like, "You know I know some of the things I've done have been strange." Or that - so it's just like - and she has actually been kind of mourning this mis-diagnosis, because she's like, "Wow, all this time maybe this could have just been manageable." And it's like really sad. And I'm like, "Well mom, I mean like to be totally honest, I did think that some of the things you did were really weird and that you were, not crazy, but I definitely have always..." - that's why I've - despite my teenage years and my angst (ph) with her, that's why I have always approached her with kid gloves as a child, was because I always knew she was - I always thought she was troubled. So I think now that she's more balanced herself, is able to like - she's able to like - I thought also, I always kind of felt like my mom didn't feel like she could help me. And like I think she just didn't have the bearings to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But now it's something, because now she's figuring some things out for herself, she's more available?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just not as many highs and lows.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's really nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so how are you experiencing this differently now than when you were growing up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well growing up there just was like - she just - I think my mom's always been this way. I think my mom - my mom remembers being a child and being really, really depressed. And my mom has just always - as a child...you don't know what is wrong, you just know something's wrong, so you just - I mean at the same time though my mom was really supportive in other ways, like she tried to make me feel good about myself. And she wasn't like - she wouldn't call me like names or anything like that. She wouldn't - she just was always crying or angry or just like really up and down. But she was never like, made me feel I was a bad person or anything or like that. She just was kind of like emotionally unavailable a lot of the times. [0:12:31.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. And as a child, I'm wondering as a little girl Emma, how did you think (ph) as a kid, not knowing and not understanding what's going on with mom, with seeing her having crying spells, seeing her angry all the time, I'm wondering if you at all internalized that, if at all?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I might have. I worried about her a lot. I would like, when I'd go to my dad's to visit him, I would worry about leaving my mom, and if like my dad would like say something bad about my mom I would just defend her and like worry about her and just like always - I just always felt in a really strong sense of worry. She would talk to me about money problems and we'd go grocery shopping when I was like seven. I'd be like, "I don't know if we can afford that mom." And I just remember just being constantly, and it was like, I was like a very worried child.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so that must - I mean that was, that's a great responsibility...for a child. And I'm wondering, not just worrying about like money issues, but how often...would you find yourself worrying about your mom's emotional state and did you at all feel as though you were to blame, as you were somehow responsible for her feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The funny thing is I never felt like I was to blame. I just felt responsible for her being happy. I didn't feel like it was my fault. I never felt like that, 'Wow, I messed up, mom's sad.' I never felt like that. I was always more like, 'Mom's always sad and this worries me. Why is she always sad? And mom's never been happy and I wish mom was happy.' But I never felt like, 'I'm a bad kid so my mom's mad at me.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or it just was always like a mysterious thing like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's almost like kind of you wanted, you wished that maybe there was something you could do to make her happier.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Because my step-dad would do things like fight with her on her birthday, so. But my step-dad always like didn't want my mom to like have like - if the something was like about my mom, my step-dad always seemed like he wanted to like ruin it somehow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he was like very possessive of her, so I think he would get really jealous of us kids. Like if it was like a Valentine's Day thing, he would fight with her and not get her anything. So we would like walk to the store and like put our - pile our money together and like buy her like a Valentine's box of candy. And if - and it seems like she was always crying on her birthdays because he was fighting with her, so we would like - and then since then he would be - generally he was fighting with her about us for some reason, so then he would punish us too, by not giving us money to get her a birthday present.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well can you explain that a little bit more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My step-dad had it in his mind that we were like spoiled-rotten kids and that we were bad, which I don't understand because we never talked back to him. I don't know how we could have been spoiled because we didn't have any money to be spoiled. And he just - he just - I don't know. I think - what I think when I realize - when I look back on it now, I just think it's like possession of my mother. Like he wanted to like have a rift between us and her. [0:15:38.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like if I didn't go to bed - like what I said before, like if he thought I - mom had cereal and he thought it was me, so when I got back from school the cereal was dumped all over my bed. Like he just was constantly like looking for like a way to punish us and teach us a lesson. Like if you run down the stairs, you're going to walk up and down them 20 times. Or we'd be out back, because they had so many freaking animals, we'd be out back like pooper-scooping the backyard and Tim would be like standing in the upstairs window like spying on us and like regulating. He just wanted to like control us all the time. And if like - and you didn't - he wanted like - he wanted like my mom to himself, so he was always going to her complaining about us. She would defend us sometimes and they would fight. And so if my mom ever had anything - like if we were like going together as a family to like my grandparents' house for Christmas, you'd - always there was a fight with my step-dad on the way there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like any time anything was about my mom, he just like would just start something. So then of course as a kid you feel even more responsible for like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...like, 'Tim's being mean to her again it's her birthday. Why can't he be nice to her on her birthday? We got to go do something for her because she's crying all day on her birthday.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or like mom's crying at Christmas or mom's crying at Valentine's Day or whatever, he just controlled her in that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That must have been difficult to experience and witness that as a child?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's difficult because you're getting in trouble for something that you don't understand why you're getting in trouble for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like not putting dishes away before you go to bed. It would be like we'd wake up to like an angry, frantic letter and then a grounding. So in one instance, like you're getting in trouble for things still because my mom would fight with him, but we would still get the punishments. So you're really getting punished and then your mom's fighting, so you were - it was like a no win.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, like a lose/lose situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now is your mom still with Tim now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Is there anything different about their relationship or dynamics or is it pretty much similar to what it was before?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's hard to say because mom was like - like I say, the house was combative. Like my step-dad has three sons and a daughter and they all went through different cycles of living with us, too. And my mom was probably, almost equally as abusive to them as Tim was to us. It was like a - between Tim and my mom, it was like a get - not like a get even type of thing, but my mom was - my stepsister, Joan, was really a troubled child. I understand why she was, but my mom didn't help. My mom was quite abusive to her as well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what ways? [0:18:21.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Verbally, like as Tim was to us. I think my mom - Tim would hit my brother but he wouldn't hit the girls, but I think my mom would hit Joan sometimes. But it was almost like a, 'Fine, if you're going to treat my kids like crap, I'm going to treat your kids like crap and then there's just going to be chaos.' And then, so yeah, now that there's no kids involved, like Tim has my mom all to himself. And he - well basically what happened was, Dorothy well, went to college and then my brother had moved in with my dad when he was like eight. I moved in with my dad starting with the first summer I got back from college and just stayed with him anytime I came home. And then Alan moved in with my dad when he was 16 and finished high school at my dad's house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So like Tim like slowly got all the kids out</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it was because of him that you all did that... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah! </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...moved out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then like five Christmases ago or something, my mom - my sister went to - my mom was living in Waynesboro at the time and my sister was there, and my mom was talking to her about Timj, because mom has gone through ups and downs. My mom pretty much just seems like she stays with him for financial reason. She's on all these anxiety drugs. She thinks she's too anxious to work, which I probably could kind of agree with. So she feels kind of stuck with him. It's just very convoluted, but this - the breaker was that, my step-dad for the first time like choked my older sister. There was a fight because he was spying on them. What they were saying, he walked in the kitchen, was like, "You're talking crap about me, la, la, la." Dorothy, out of probably like 15 years of not saying anything to him, was kind of like, "I am talking to my mother." And got kind of close to him and said it. Well he like freaked out and like grabbed her and choked her against the stairwell and then ripped the phone out of the wall when she was trying to call 911.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my mom like was scared that he was going to kill her daughter, so she like got a gun out. It was really, really dramatic. Anyway, the next day, my grandpa, who was the only person able to convince her to do like anything, we all went to her house and got all her valuables out because we were like, 'This is the breaker. This is going to show my mom that she needs to not be with this man, la, la, la.' We got her away from him for like a couple of months. She tried to kill herself in that time, was hospitalized for a little while and then so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean she tried to shoot herself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean it wasn't a very - I don't really know how it all played out. We haven't really talked with her about it. All I know - I got a call saying my mom was like at a mental hospital because she had tried to hurt herself and that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who called you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think Dorothy. I think like my aunt, my aunt called me. And so then, ever since then, they moved back - mom went back with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now they live in Silver City, like isolated from everybody. It's almost like also, again, I said that's like isolating her from people. So, he doesn't want to talk to his kids. She's slowly starting to talk to her kids more. But I don't know if my mom would've made these decisions had she been a more balanced person chemically. I don't think my mom would've done a lot of the things she's done, had she been more balanced chemically. [0:21:43.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there was a form of bipolar or whatever the - or just whatever?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean now those things are real aren't they? I've always struggled with like, 'Are these things even real?'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, very real.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I wonder and I think she wonders that, too, and I think that's part of her like mourning process. It's like, 'Wow, I maybe would have not made those decisions.' Because she - this is the first time in my life where she has said to me that, "I know some of the things I've done are weird and I know some of the things I've done were wrong."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she's never really like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well how did it feel hearing her say that, 'I know some of the things I may have done were wrong.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just was - she's kind of like she's a - I don't know. I know she hasn't said that before. Well I think she always kind of knew that. What was weirder was her saying, "I know some of the things I've done are strange or weird." Because she - I just thought - that was, to me, was like amazing because I was like, "Yes!" Like just, "Okay, like thinking almost like, 'Okay, that's like validation'. Like it's just not me interpreting that some of the things you've done are weird, because I have like a subjective opinion." But it's like, "Wow, you're aware that you've done really bizarre things."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so for that part, her acknowledging that, was validation to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about her identifying that maybe some of the things that she's done was wrong, how did you experience that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's kind of said that in the past but never did anything about it. She would just - she'd be like in one of her crying moods and wondering why her son wasn't talking to her and realize that she probably messed up somewhere along the lines. But I mean, it was always just more of like a sob story at the time, and then I would say, "Well mom, it's not too late you can, you know, try to salvage the relationship. I mean Dave's only 17 at the time you know, you have a lot of life left, you can have a second life with your children. You can do what you want."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "This isn't over." And she just wouldn't do anything about it. And now she's like, she stopped by his work the other day to see if he wanted to go to lunch. They actually came to see me together at work to go to lunch, like a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your mother and brother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I couldn't even believe he got in the car with her for three hours.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was shocked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so what did you make of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought it was great because, it just shows growth on my brother's part, too. Because I had a long conversation - I always thought my brother was like, "Whatever. Mom sucks. I don't even want to deal with her." Then he came and stayed with me like a few weeks ago and I'm like, "Well what is your take on mom?" He's like, "I think mom is not even. I think mom has a mental illness and I don't think everything she has done has been within her control." And I was like a bit - I was amazed that he saw it that way, so maturely. And so I think he's actually applying that to how he deals with her now and is like seeing that. Because I would always like try to like be the go-between.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like try to make people hang out... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or like, "Dave, you got to come to this." I used to demand that you had to come to this thing with mom or you have to do that. And I told him like three years ago, I'm like, "I'm done, like trying to make you do anything. I can't make you have a relationship." [0:24:46.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I've been like really kind of like blown away, like he's been coming - I think he sees a change in her too, because he's been coming to more family functions and he's been making more of an effort, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how then does it feel for you to not have to be the one to demand connection, demand a relationship or to orchestrate something in order for it to happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels a relief because I start - I kind of would start to resent it a little bit. It's kind of like, "I like spend all this time and energy worrying about you people and how you get along with each other and all I meet is like defiance. Or saying you're going to come and then you don't come. Or listening to mom like whine and cry about it and making..." - I feel horrible because my mom's upset about this but I know why my brother's not doing it. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's kind of like it's just nice to not have to worry about that and like it makes me feel good that people in my family are trying to work it out or - because my brother was going to leave for the Marines and I don't want him to be gone for six years and then...I want - I would - it's nice to see something trying to happen before he goes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Sure. You know this - and it seems like that will be less of a burden that you would feel... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...not being in that position, in that role?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because that can become pretty overwhelming I'm sure. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sounds good. [silence from 0:26:11.3 to 0:26:18.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So where is it that you see you and your moms' relationship going?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I feel like it's going more towards like a parental relationship. (chuckling) It's really weird. Like, just more, there's just not as much stress involved in it. It's just more relaxed and more natural and not - like I'm not angry at her from being with Tim anymore. It's like, "I know - I know - I don't know why you're with him, but I do know why you're with him." And quite frankly, I am glad my mom has somebody to take care of her financially, because I can't do it and, I'm glad my mom has somebody to do stuff with. I don't want her to be lonely. I don't know...it's kind of like, yes, he did a lot of rotten things but, at the same time, I don't what my mom to be alone and I don't want my mom to be poor and not able to take care of herself. So it's kind of like I just think I have maybe a more mature look on it. I do - I mean, do I wish my mom could find a nicer person for her? Yes. But I don't know the dynamic. I don't know like really the dynamics of their relationship. I mean...I think Tim's kind of a troubled person. I mean he had a very abusive childhood, so I'm sure he has a lot of baggage and I try to understand. I actually, when I even - I used to think of him with like hatred, and I don't - not at all anymore. I like think of him with more like sadness that, 'Wow, he's probably never been a happy person.' [0:27:53.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what does that do for you to be able to look at it that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm kind of sensitive, so sometimes it really makes me sad. Like it makes me sad when I think that other people have never like been happy or that, I don't feel like guilt because - I mean at the time when I was dealing with it - that's not going to be what I'm thinking of. Like when I'm being abused by somebody, I'm not going to take time to be like, "Wow, they're probably abusing me because of 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd'."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's for sure, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm going to be like angry and like frustrated and not like them. But now that I am older and I'm not in the situation anymore, I just kind of feel like, just like bummed out, like, 'Wow...maybe Tim never had help.' Obviously he's never had help and maybe if he had, had help, maybe he wouldn't be this way. But he had a really bad life as a child and obviously those things carry over to adulthood and...it just makes me sad for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you and he ever talk at all or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm actually one of the only kids that will even like go there if he's like there. He doesn't really bother me being around anymore. Like we're so - he's very polite to me on the phone. I don't have to see him very often, so when I do it's like not a very big deal. We say hello to each other. We don't chitchat really or anything. But, I think the difference between me and the other kids though is I've had like my - I've had - I've pretty much said my piece to him, so I don't really have anything else to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say you've said your piece?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I kind of like - when I was 18 and leaving for college, he had like - I think - we had moved to Nokesville, so I was like driving like 40 minutes to school. And I had to leave - I had to get up like at like 5:30 to go to school and I didn't make my bed before I left. So - and I had all my stuff packed for UVA. So when I got home from school he had dumped all of my belongings down the stairs and like broke all my stuff and all my - tore off all like the covers on my bed and everything was like trashed in my room. So I kind of... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you didn't make your bed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like that was like his style. So I just kind of like lost it and I wrote this like really angry letter, for like seven pages, and just like told him what I thought of him, and then I like locked my door because I knew - he was - he's a police officer, and that night he was working the night shift and I'm like, "He's going to go nuts when he reads this but I don't really care." And I just put it on his night stand, and then in the morning he tried to like beat down my door. But well really, after that moment, I never talked to him again... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...until like - like two years ago... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...at my grandpa's funeral.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: After that, nothing. We didn't say anything to each other. And I went to college, too. I like left like a week later and then I never moved back, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kinds of things did you write in that letter?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just called him a lot of names... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and told him I hated him, and that I hated how he was to my siblings and that I hated how he was to my mom. And that basically that I thought I was a bigger person than he was and that he was never going to be happy. I just said like really angry things, really, really angry things. But I understand why I did it. I mean I never was allowed to even like look at the man the wrong way without getting threatened or... [0:31:11.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know I never said anything. So... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well and so it wasn't safe, so that it wasn't like it was safe to express yourself or your feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not at all. You definitely would get threatened or grounded or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you'd think you would get hit. You didn't get hit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Oh, all right.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well my brother did, but you were definitely scared that you were going to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. So that was a big risk that you took it sounds like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'd just had enough. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Okay. Yeah.] (ph) How did your mom respond to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She didn't really - I think since I was moving away and everything like that, she just didn't really - I don't recall her doing anything. I was angry with her. That was kind of like, when I first got to college in like my freshman year, I didn't talk to her for almost a year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like when I got to college I was like finally away and I reflected on everything and I got really sad for like that freshman year. Like living with my roommates, who had these like nuclear families and everybody got along, and like it was bizarre. Because I always knew as a child, I'm like, "No family is like perfect." And I know that the nuclear family is very rare. And like we were like the first of our friends to get - parents to get divorced... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and then it just seemed like a chain reaction, like every year a new friend's parents were getting divorced. But when I got to college I was meeting all these people from like really like functional families and there was - we'd have like these deep talks about things and I would tell them what was going on or what had happened. And they were like - and I just like - it was almost like a weird type of therapy then, because I just started like thinking, 'Wow, you know, this is sad.' And I just got like really, really sad about it. And I kind of just got angrier with my mom and - yeah, I just - just really... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you do during that time when you were sad? Can you describe that sad period?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My freshman year I was kind of like - I was not really a loner but I wasn't - I wasn't very social on my floor. I would like hang out with my roommates.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd see in the dorm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I didn't - yeah, I didn't - I was also kind of awkward. I had like my retainer and I had like the really bad skin still, so I was going through like a weird like - I wasn't secure about, with that either. So I just was really insecure and I really just kind of kept to myself a lot. I didn't party a lot at all. I didn't make a lot of friends on my floor. I'd hang out with my friend Jeffrey a lot, but other than that, I was kind of like closed off and I didn't really like my freshman year at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now was Jeffrey a boyfriend or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just a friend from high school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Did you typically have male friends?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, always.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there any particular reason why you think that is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I always had girlfriends, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. Okay, I don't know why I was under the impression I was that you had more male friends than girlfriends.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It there was always a kind of balance in high school, but now it's more like I have more girlfriends. [0:34:11.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So freshman year wasn't particularly a good year for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'no'] It was like a very transitional year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What - so you're not talking to your mom, you're not doing a lot of the typical freshman activities, I guess, with the partying and those sorts of things. How were your grades?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, four points.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So you were able still to maintain?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] I've always been able to maintain like a work, like school life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. But there was a social life that was [impaired then] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't feel like I fit in. I felt just like very like a fish out of water and at the time I was kind of like, "Drinking's not very cool and like this is stupid. Like why are these people doing...?" I like became judgmental.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just kind of like looked down on everybody in a way. Like look at everybody just like getting trashed all the time, and like not taking any time to talk to anybody, just like - just being like stupid. So I kind of like would just do things alone a lot or really did immerse myself in school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were - and were you verbal about these things or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'no']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things you thought to yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now what kind of friends did you have? They - I mean were your friends or your roommates involved in those sorts of activities or were they single (ph) to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They were a little bit. They were just really down-to-earth people. They were - I went in blind and then - yeah, I just made good friends with my suite mate and my roommate, and we were like - we did almost everything together, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Are you still friends with them now or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. They got - I lived with them in an apartment - oh, freshman I was in the dorms. Sophomore year I was in the dorms with them again for a half a semester and then I studied abroad the second semester.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Well where did you go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Scotland.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I got an apartment with them my junior year. And they started like - I got a boyfriend, Matt, and I started to like hang out with new people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, I was just feeling better about myself. I didn't have a ton of zits and I didn't have my retainer anymore, and I just was feeling like more comfortable with who I was. So I started like venturing out more, outside of their little safety zone. And they like started getting really regret - like angry with me and just started kind of being mean to me when I was living with them. And then... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what do you mean? In what sense? Like why were they angry with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just snapping at me about things. I didn't understand at the time. I was kind of like, "Why is everybody like..." They're just like not talking to me when I was home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then one time they had a friend over and I was using the blender when they were watching TV, and their friend like snapped at me and the other two like giggled, and I'm like, "That's bizarre." So I - when I was leaving I was like, "See you later guys." And I left, and then I like stood and listened by the door. And they're like, "That's so awesome how you told Emma off. Man she deserves it." And they were just like talking all this crap. So I just walked in. I was like, "Hey! Like you guys are mad at me?" And then, they basically just said, they said that I thought I was like too good for them anymore and like la, la, la. And I'm like, "I'm just hanging out with you people. I'm not going to ask you..." I would invite them to come places and basically, we just had a falling out and I'm like - and I just felt really uncomfortable living there anymore. I felt like it was like this really negative thing, with these three girls, like being angry with me all the time and not talking to me about it and just being like very like passive aggressive, so I just moved out. [0:37:39.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that would've been difficult. I mean if you have friends that you've been friends with, [some things went negative] (ph) to...kind of shun you or treat you differently?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was hard. I had a really hard time with it. I was really sad about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you at all take a look into their concerns or what they were bothered by?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I tried to talk to them about it. I actually - because I kind of had a feeling all along like, 'Well it's probably different now that Emma's not hanging out as much and she's with her boyfriend more.' But Ashley at the time had a new boyfriend that she was always with and like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I would invite them to do things. I would still do things with them. They just wanted me like around all the time or something, like it used to be. But I mean, when you get older and stuff, it's not going to be like that all the time, like we're not in the dorms anymore. We're not freshmen. Like I work a lot. And Ashley was always playing - Ashley was on the basketball team, so Ashley was never around. And Charlotte...I don't know. They just - it just was really immature if anything. And I probably handled it immaturely by just being like, 'Fine, I'm moving out.' I gave them rent money and just left. But, at the time I didn't really see how I could stay there, so, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it seems like that's different, you weren't necessarily just thinking about what you're talking about for being responsible or feeling responsible for your mom's being... [inaudible at 0:39:08.6] ...so I have a situation - you didn't take on that responsibility for how they felt or whatever the case was. You were able to...allow them to have their own feelings but you still maintained...who you were without feeling burnt and bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's only really with my family that I get that like - it's the weird, like that weird - yeah, it's like a different like emotional bond. Generally I mean - I don't know. Generally I mean, I don't - I'm like a very fair person but I don't think it's selfish but, I will take in other peoples' concerns only so much and then if it just seems like, if people are just being unreasonable, I will like not be involved in the situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give me an example of when the concerns have been reasonable and you've taken on with the two of them, [with your parents and things?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: [silence from 0:40:09.7 to 0:40:21.3] I don't know. Because not a lot of people have like come to me with like anger or like - I don't - I don't usually fight with my friends. That's like really been the only like blowup I've had with like a group of people, like where it's just like come to a point where it's like, 'This just isn't working.' I've never had that other type of like thing with friends or work. I've never had any like - nobody's ever tried to like talk to me about work about how I'm performing or how I'm acting, that's never happened. [0:40:47.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean family stuff, obviously, but - yeah, I mean, but outside of my family, no. I mean I've never had like a blowout, like an end of friendship type, weird thing like that happen before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Generally, sometimes you just don't talk to somebody as much and things like fizzle out. It's never been like a cut and dry type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay. Okay. [silence from 0:41:17.7 to 0:41:29.1] So when you look back over your college experience, your total college experience, how would you describe it overall?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fifty/fifty. I'd say freshman and sophomore year were kind of like, mmm. Studying abroad, being alone in Scotland without anybody I knew was like a really kind of like a transformational thing, because I was there for like four months and really like just relied on myself, and I was actually like introspective when I was over there and that was really interesting. I think that was a good growing period.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just was with a bunch of strangers all the time and just traveling like a foreign country that I didn't know, and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was this your sophomore year or junior year?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Junior year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Junior year.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I just was like just dealing with strangers like in a foreign place, and it was really like really interesting. And...some days I'd get really lonely and homesick but what could you do about it? And I just kind of really learned how to be alone almost.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so was this - whose idea was it for you to go abroad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was? Okay. Why Scotland?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I needed to find an English program so I could get credits, and so - and I always had wanted to go there. We have family - my family's - a bunch of my family is from Scotland and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...yeah, I just always wanted to go there and it worked with my school curriculum, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was this before retainer or after you got your retainer removed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: With retainer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With retainer. Okay. And so how did that play, for I've heard you talk about that time - the time when you do really venture out and kind of kept to yourself, but here you are in this new country or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At that time like I had been on Accutane and my skin was better, and I kept - I was actually taking Accutane when I was there. Yeah, so I mean I was feeling better in that regard. So that kind of like broke the shadow of the retainer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So although you say you had grown to learn how to be alone, you do a lot of traveling with - in groups and things, forming relationships like with the [group that you've shown?] (ph) [0:43:41.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had like - there's probably like 25 or 30 of us and we all seemed like, [slow move] (ph), like factions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I had - I was one of the fortunate people. Like most people had to share like a condo with three people. I only had myself and Stacy, Alice and I were pretty tight and we'd hang out with our friend Stephanie. So it was always like Stacy, Stephanie and I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And everybody was kind of like that. I mean when we were in class we'd all interact well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But generally, outside of being in school, you were up to your own devices, so we would just travel or hit the town or just hang out at home or...you pretty much did whatever you wanted. Most of the time you had free time, so. Yeah, I mean everybody got along. We just all didn't hang out all the time. Everybody didn't - nobody like lived in a central area. You know what I mean? We all had like condos around the area.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So...but I definitely got along with her. I can generally get along with most people, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so what was you, Stephanie and Stacy's relationship like? I mean tell me how much you hung out? [What kind of thing did you ask to do or?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: We just would joke around a lot and just goof off mostly. And, yeah, I mean since I've lived with Stacy, her and I will just talk about everything and just friend stuff, you know. We've gotten to be pretty close and, yeah, I wish I still had Stephanie's contact information but I don't. I've tried to find her but I still talk Stacy, so, yeah, it's just like your normal girlfriend type stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Did you have any contact with your family while you were in Scotland or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not very much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would talk to them every once in a while. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even Dorothy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, I talked to Dorothy the most.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, yeah. I would just kind like - I would just like mostly let Dorothy like diffuse information to other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Any sad periods in Scotland or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really. I mean I would just get like this - occasionally like isolated feeling, but I actually kind of liked it. I almost kind of liked being like cut off from everything I knew and like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...just - I knew - but I knew it was temporary and I don't think I would always like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just was kind of different for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was good about it for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just kind of like being able to be whoever I wanted. Like I could - I didn't have like anybody expecting anything of me or like of my personality, like nobody knew me, not that I was like being a different person... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but it was kind of nice to like not have people's like assumptions about you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And so when you think about that, when my eyes aren't on you or...you aren't with assumptions, you're able to be whoever, what was that Emma like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I was any different. I think I just felt more comfortable. Just like being myself, because... [audio blip at 0:46:33.9 to 0:46:43.9 - sound has lots of white noise now] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So...you were pretty much still doing a... [0:46:47.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It just was nice to not have like assumptions, like just people's opinion all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And how - did you handle that differently, not having those opinions or [assumptions from anybody?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just seemed like I was just able to like enjoy an experience as it came. Like there wasn't any like - I didn't really have an expectation for over there or what I was going to do. It just was like more go with the flow, just do what you want whenever you want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean you don't have to like check in with anybody or - yeah, you just can - I don't know. Kind of [feeling isolated.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're supposed to be able to have that type of mind set with a type (ph) like that. You can't take (ph) on problems you - or was it because these people weren't expecting [anything from you?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it probably came from me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just didn't really feel like I had to - I just didn't feel like I had to do anything particular. I didn't feel like I had to say anything in particular. I just had to like see a country and occasionally do some homework and other than that, do whatever I wanted. I mean it was also like, it's the first time I never worked in that long. You know what I mean? Like I didn't have a job to worry about...just worrying about school and school's really easy over there, and like not worrying about family, not worrying about friends' expectations, just like me. I went there by myself. I could make friends there if I wanted to but I didn't have to... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and just do whatever I wanted. (chuckling) There are not a lot of times in life like that. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean well it sounds like you created that for yourself in a sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now I'm wondering when you look at your life now, when you talk about one of the things you wanted to work toward, is just to be able to just be you, without being self-conscious (ph) all the time, overloaded, rectified (ph)...how people are going to view you or your characteristics or whatever the case is. And it sounds like for whatever reason, when you were over in Scotland, you were able to suspend that, to be able to just be you and do you and do whatever...without the self-consciousness or the ratification (ph). And I'm wondering what would be [different now.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe because those people's opinions didn't matter as much. I didn't have like a previous connection with them. I mean getting over there obviously, I would want Stacy to like me but Stacy did like me. And I don't know why I always think people - I don't know why I would always think people didn't like me. It's not [a game as the] (ph), again, like it comes from me, totally. It's not like I've had a long history of people not liking me. You know? And so it's totally an internal thing. And it's easy to get frustrated with me because I'd always bitch, "Does he like - does that person like me?" Or, "Does this person like me?" He's like, "Why wouldn't they like you?" I'm like, "I don't know." [0:49:57.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you find yourself asking Jerry similar questions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not as often, and like I've asked him like if a certain member of his family liked me, because I care, I want them to like me. He he'll always say, "Of course they like you. What's not to like?" And then I'll like, and maybe like you've suggested I'll think about it and then I go, "What isn't there to like me? Am I rude? No. Am I - do I act - am I friendly? Do I show interest in what they're doing? Yeah." I'm pretty good like - I've been trying not to like - I've just been like really trying to focus on... [inaudible at 0:50:29.2] I was trying to like let it go and not let it matter and just...just concentrate on I do have a lot of - like I have a lot of good internal attributes. You know, just trying to like - like I find like I'm always nice to people, but I find I'm like - if I just take time to be extra nice to people, I feel good. I feel like a good person in just being nice to people. Which I'm always nice to people, but it's like amazing that - it's like, 'Why do I concentrate on that?' Like you can tell yourself a million times, 'Looks don't matter, like physicality is meaningless.' And I'm just trying to like internalize that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. And when you're... [inaudible at 0:51:08.7] ...and it seems like that will be challenging to do, especially in this society in which... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...where your physical attributes are everything, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like the issue with my eyes, I'll like look at magazines, I'll like look at these bright, perky-lidded (ph) eyes and I'm thinking, 'I know that, that's airbrushed. I know this is not - I know it's not real.' But, and in my mind I'm still like, 'Well I want that.' I'm like, 'You can't want something that doesn't exist.' But society just like - it's like this, just like underlying current.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so funny, because like you can be... [inaudible at 0:51:43.7] ...so that it still affects you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Definitely. But it seems like it's going to make sense to you to think about the significant people in your life and how they view something as significant people in your life, who love you, who accept you, for like who you are, the way you look, [love it or leave it, so.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's how it has to be... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:52:04.0]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: ...doesn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so! I mean or I think it should be, and like sometimes I'm believing that it is that way. But I mean I think about the people that I love and I wouldn't like - I can't think of anything that would make me not love them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's like well you have to believe. You have to like have some faith in other people and let it be, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I just don't have a lot of faith in a lot of people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like my sister was like, "Emma, do you really think people are looking at you and thinking, 'That girl has red skin, or whatever or her skin look a little weird.'?" She's like, "People are looking at you thinking, 'Emma has nice teeth.' Or 'Emma has nice hair.'" And I'm thinking, 'I guess I just don't really believe that people are like that. But maybe they are, maybe I do need to give people more credit.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well lets handle that. Do you remember a time when you ever had - [called something] (ph) who were like that or [let a face] (ph) that you were like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably not, because I mean like when I had acne people were pointing it out to me or like the people at school were pointing it out or my dad was pointing it out or - it just seems like whenever there was something wrong with me, like it was always pointed out to me. So that makes me think, 'People are looking at those things and I know they are because they tell me.' Like we were talking about that obsessive streak with me? [0:53:21.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I apparently am, I mean...of something that I forgot. Like, for some reason like sixth grade I went through a stage where I wore my hair the same way all the time. Like to the point - I wore it like pulled back in this weird little hairdo to the point where I lost all of my hair right there from being constantly in a rubber band. And that's kind of neurotic, obviously. But again, people just pointed that out to me like, "You have a bald spot."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like, "I know."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As if you didn't know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like, "No kidding, I do?" And why did I have that? Because I was a neurotic and wore my hair the same way every day. Why did I do that? I know probably now why I did, because my life was totally crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was totally absurd (ph). Like my life (ph) was totally out of control and I like - maybe that's why I would like knit-pick my appearance because that's something I had control over. So I wanted my hair to be this one way all the time, and I could do it that way every day and I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You also... [inaudible at 0:54:18.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...one thing that was true or that was you could depend on or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Something, but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: ...something's wrong with Emma! "You have a bald spot Emma." "I know." "You have zits Emma." "I know." Like, "You're bigger than those other girls on your soccer team." "Yeah, I know." I'm like, 'People just look at your faults.' That's what it felt like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't have anybody, [I mean that had something before all of this was said? You ever tell people like, 'I can't those things, so look at - look how nice when you have so many attributes? Take care of yourself.'] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really like physical things, personality things. People told me I was funny or things like that. But I mean, I think that's where I get a lot of my - focus on my physicality is. Like, I think it goes both - I think it goes both ways. If you're constantly getting praised for something that's important, you probably will make that - people say that's an important thing. But also, if you're just - if there's a certain part of you, who you are, getting picked at all the time, it's going to make you like really sensitive about that. And then like why wouldn't I think that people look at negative things about - like I've probably heard more negative things about the way I look than good. So of course I like freaked out when my skin was slightly red or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...when I had zits. And it's like funny, it's like, okay, I'm obsessing about my hair, so I give myself a bald spot. I obsess about my acne, so I got on this drug, this hard-core drug, to take care of it, and now maybe it's causing something else in my life, like another like problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you find yourself obsessed about anything now, other than your skin?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's funny because, I mean, many, many years I like would worry about my weight all the time, and it's really bizarre that I like - I know myself well enough... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...where I like - it's kind of like - like anything else. Like I'll let myself eat, take whatever I want sometimes, 'But just don't do it all the time Emma, like you don't have to go to extremes.' Or like as long as I keep things in balance, I'm balanced. It's only like been - it's the only thing in a long time that I've been like with this about has been my skin lately, but I mean again, they're my skin. [0:56:27.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, but other than that, like for a long time I didn't really like worry about things... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...about that and not to that extent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was actually like starting to feel like good about it, and then feel like my thing with the skin, it's kind of like just bringing it all back to past ways I've felt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. I get that guessing in that whole area (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's why I like always say, "I feel like I have like acne again." It's like I want people to offend me again so it's the same feeling. But I have gone without that feeling for many years, so now that it's back I like hate it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That sounds like your world's [kind of raised that up] (ph) for once and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[and well you can use it when it comes up it's like, "Well."] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does Jerry deal with this guy (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's funny because, he just always says he never noticed. He's like, "I don't notice." I have a feeling - I have a feeling my eyes have probably been like this for longer than I think they have. I just - they just started irritating me more, so now I'm like really focused on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because they've probably always kind of - they probably have been like this longer than I've been aware of it. And now that I'm aware of it I'm like hyper aware of it. So I think he's just - my guess the reason that he doesn't it, is because it's probably been that way longer than I thought and he just doesn't care. I'll be like, "Is my skin red?" He's like, "No!" Or like Monday they were a little bit but - no, Tuesday they were, but I'd been crying earlier because I was like going through my weird hormone withdraw, so of course it's going to be a little red. And he gets so mad (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what would he do with the comments (ph) going over?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He was in Texas. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) [Around that.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I understand. That's good. Was a man at all a part of your plan or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I honestly think it was totally hormonal, to be honest I totally do. I have not - I don't think I've ever felt like - I don't think I've ever felt like that, just like crazed. I felt like, not like I was having an out-of-body experience, but I'm like, 'I am not like this and what is wrong with me? I'm feeling like...'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you miss him? And I mean wasn't his... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or just was this characteristic of him to take off without explaining or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Pretty much since we've met, we've never really gone more than like two days without seeing each other. Like he was only gone - and like I took him to the airport on Saturday morning and then I picked him up on Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, this is really early Saturday morning and I'm running late on Tuesday, so for us that was like a long time. And I miss him... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and I talk to him like all - every day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm actually kind of glad because I was going to like - I knew, I knew getting off the pill in like this next week is going to be really weird and I know it is. My doctor told me it would be. My friends, my nearest friends, said, "Yeah, your body is going to be like going through a weird period." And I'm actually kind of glad that he wasn't here for that, because it's kind of like - I don't want to like - I don't want people to see me when I'm - when I - if I can't control my emotions and there's not a reason for it, it's like a chemical reaction, like I don't want people to see it. (chuckling) [0:59:35.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really do think like that alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. How do you think he would've responded, other than?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think he would've realized it was hormonal but I don't think he would've known what to do. Because he'll say things like - because I actually started to notice a weirdness with my skin. I feel like I've grown less tolerable with my pill for the last year. Because I would notice like the first two days that I was on it, my emotions would just get bizarre, like I would just feel kind of like down and like weepy. And that's how I felt just now. And I would feel really, really weepy. And I just kind of started noticing with Jerry around it was like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You must use a... [inaudible at 1:00:11.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like when you'd start like the first two... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...the week that has like the most hormones. And like the first two, I think, probably have the most because it's like a cycle. And he would just go - I'd say, "Gosh, I'm feeling really weird today. It's weird. It's got to be my pill. It has to be my pill. I don't know what else it can possibly be." Because it was such a steam (ph). And then he'd be like, "Well, we're all chemicals." I'm like, "You're right."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He'd say, "We're all chemicals."?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. He's like, "We're totally composed of chemicals, so if a chemical changes it's going to like alter how you feel." I'm like, "Yeah." So he just kind of looks at it like that. He doesn't think I - like while I'm feeling like that, he's just very balanced. He's not like ever as crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:00:48.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: He just tries - I think he knows I'm a normal person. He just - so he'll look for like a reasonable answer. He's just like a very reasonable person, which I appreciate. Because other guys would be like, "She's crazy!" Or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And that seems like that's probably what you fear?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At some point you did fear it at some point, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if he would see you and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was kind of scared about what he would think about me coming here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean a lot of people just really are judgmental and they're really not very - they're very close minded about things like this. And they think, "Well gosh, the only people that would come to you are crazy." Or it could be the other way. "Well I don't see why you need to talk to somebody?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, yeah, so it was kind of weird, just starting to date - well not dating for somebody very long and, "Well by the way, I'm going to go start talking to - me go to therapy."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what was his response again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He thought it was good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So when we kind of had like a - we kind of like had like a weird argument, like our first really, and it wasn't very big but it was really bizarre. Like because his band's like starting up again and he always talks about going on tour and stuff. And to be quite honest, like I don't want to be the girlfriend of a guy whose in a band that's gone all the time. Like I don't want that. It's not like the lifestyle I want. And I - we're - because like his band's like playing gigs now again and la, la, la. And... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that where he went in Texas?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'no'] He went to see his uncle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are we going to go - I don't want to go like over time here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I don't want to go over time for you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So you can finish your story and then we'll... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...wrap. [1:02:20.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, he - oh, I'm like, "Are you going to like - are you guys planning a..." Just, I was asking him, "Are you guys going to tour a lot and stuff?" And he's like, "You don't like the fact that I'm in a band do you?" And I'm like, "Well..." I'm like, "I didn't say that." And like I'm like, "It's just different. It's going to be hard. It's going to be a different relationship if you are planning on having a lifestyle that's different than it is now. I mean I'm just wondering, are you planning on going, trying to make a career of this or making it like a lifestyle for you?" And he's like, "Well, I doubt that's going to happen." And, "I don't know." And, "Maybe it would be fun. It would be really cool to be able to live off music and la, la, la." And I just was honest. I'm like, "You know what? I don't want to like lie to you." I'm like, "I do have judge - I do have like a thing in my mind about people in bands." I'm like, "Most guys I know in bands cheat on their girlfriends. Or it's just like this dishonest thing, where you're like in a different city all the time." And I'm like, "Obviously, I have trust issues." And... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But we got to our friend's house so the conversation ended. And then we got back in the car to go home and I'm like, "I am sorry Jerry." I'm like, "I want you to do what you want to do and I don't want to like hold you back from anything. And I don't want you to think I'm not supportive of what you want to do." And he's just - he's just like...he just started getting mad at me, because he's just like, "You don't trust me." He's like, "And I don't think it's fair." And he's like, "I haven't done anything to not deserve your trust and it's just really - it's really unfair. And I feel like - it really like offends me that you can't trust me." And I'm like, "You need to understand that I don't know you that..." I'm like, "I know you well, but I don't know you that well. And like I just, trust for me is something that is earned between two people. I don't just start off trusting somebody."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like - I'm like, "I'm growing to trust you. That's all I can tell you." And then he just got like really mad at me and kind of like closed himself off and like got out of the car. I'm like, "Hey, I don't fight like this. I don't fight with like walking away from each other. I don't like doing this."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like, "You need - I need to talk to you. This is going to like drive me crazy if I have to go home with this fight." So we talked for a little while and I'm like, "I hope you understand, like a big part of the reason why I'm going to talk to somebody and try to deal with these issues is because I do love you and I don't want my abandonment issues or trust issues to interfere with us."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like, "You have to understand it. I could've gone to counseling anytime I wanted. Why am I going now?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he seemed to like understand it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it seemed to like make him understand it better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so where are things now with him though?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Current - they're fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This happened when?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like two weeks ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, they're fine. I just need to look at things like - like you said. Like, well you can't like - what if he does meet another girl? What if he does? I have to be like confident enough in myself where it's like, "If that's what you want, that's what you want and I can't change that. And, oh, well." Like I can't worry about people leaving me or I can't worry about, 'Well what if he does go on tour and cheat on me? Well, then I guess the relationship's over and I can't control that.' I can't control what other people are going to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and what if he doesn't? Like if he goes on tour and doesn't cheat on you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What if he does meet a girl and realizes that, 'No, she isn't the one I want. I love Emma and I want to be with Emma.'? [1:05:25.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Again, like why not focus on the positive things that could happen? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you and Jerry meet?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's embarrassing. (both chuckling) No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it's not too embarrassing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's stupid. Do you know Facebook?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is really dumb. When my friends are on there we just do this joke. We like read each other's stupid comments.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like a joke type thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I have - like we have a lot of friends in common, which I found out from this dumb thing. I saw him like leaving comments. Like people my age just treat it as a joke.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, so he would leave like funny things on my friends' pages and I was like, "This guy is kind of cool. This guy is funny." Like I read his profile. He seemed totally normal. But a good thing I'm not that - I was like you can totally like scope people out. If like people are leaving like sleazy comments and stuff, they're probably kind of sleazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it was like a good filtering system.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then like - so like for like two weeks I like thought about him for some reason. And then like one night I had a dream about him, where he was like hanging out with me and my friends. So like the next day I just e-mailed him. I'm like, "Hi." I'm like, "Uh, this might seem weird and bizarre..." I'm like, "...but, I see you like all over my friends' pages and you seem like a nice guy, and I live in Willow Ridge, too." I'm like, "So, anyway, feel free to delete this, I would." I just kept it - it was like a joke. And he didn't! And then, yeah, and then we just like started e-mailing like crazy and then we hung out and, ever since then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, kind of weird, but. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wouldn't say it's weird. [overlapping voices at 1:06:46.7]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not weird. People meet all types of ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's the day of computer dating... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you know that, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was curious how you all met.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's okay. It's like okay. I'm going to have to end now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Next week is Thanksgiving, so I'm not sure how we want to do this. If you wanted to meet next week the only two days I would have available... - (clearing throat) Excuse me. - ...would be Monday and Tuesday. Or if you just wanted to wait and hold off til the next week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think I'm going to try to like go home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So probably, yeah, the next week if that's okay with you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So we'll meet, resume on that Saturday then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, that's perfect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And if you could Emma, we've talked - I talked to you before about the measures?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm aware you did a part of them on the computer but there is some instruments and things, some question that will probably take an hour to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You started them and you finished like the back (ph) with the demographic information.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, all those little separate ones?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but there's some other ones on there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Not the ones that are optional?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I don't know if they're optional or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He like told me to do these ones, just sort of ones, and then there were like all these other ones that he said I could do if I wanted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And I'm not sure about those. I'll have to check but Whit Gage has been asking me... (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...about them. So... [1:08:28.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I could just stay next - that time and do it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would that be okay?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because - well if you wanted to you can come - you can come anytime... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...to do them. I don't - I don't even have to be here for you to do them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I come here will they know what I'm talking about?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Just let them...let them know who you are. I'll tell them you have to finish the computer measures and they'll pull up where you left off or whatever the case is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So you can come anytime, even...if I'm not here... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...to take care of that. And it shouldn't take more than an hour to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I was wondering why it wasn't - it didn't seem as long as they said it was going to take.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling) Yeah, so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, no need to be sorry. This is just your statement.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll have to give you that. And then if you - this is just your financial agreement. We agreed to $40.00.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you could - if you want to just read over that and then sign it... (continuous paper rustling to end)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [...the back of it, that would be good.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Then I can feel like I'd be assured the case with that.] (ph) [1:09:27.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's basic stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [Yeah, so I will see it's like motion] (ph) rules and insurance...those sorts of things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There you go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want me to sign that for you or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that's okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. Well it sounds good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you have a wonderful holiday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're going to your mom's house or your dad's house?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably my dad's house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your dad's house? Okay. Okay, I look forward to hearing how that went.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And... </p>

<p>PATIENT: What are you going to do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now I'm not quite sure (chuckling) what I'm going to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you from here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm actually from Missouri.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All my family is in Missouri.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I may go home, I may not, it depends. And I mean I have...Miles has family and here... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and so... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...we'll see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Happy Thanksgiving. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [This is weird if you want to look at that.] (ph) (chuckling) [It's really pretty wild.] (ph) [inaudible at 1:10:48.8]... [silence to end]</p>

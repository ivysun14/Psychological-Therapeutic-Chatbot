<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And again this is blind.  So they don't know who you are or who I am.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, were you supposed to be here later?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was going to come at [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, I got it.  I got it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I, I remember [NAME OTHER] saying that you had an opening at 2:30.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, okay.  So I let, how are things in general?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any more drama?  You, you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't, I am not, I swear to you -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't seek it, but it, it, it finds you.  All right.  Uh, I saw you [DATE].  You had one, I'm, I'm waiting for a time you come in and say -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Please.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  No, no, no events happened at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you know all, and I really thought about this.  All of my life I've never seeked drama and that kind of thing.  Everytime I turn around, it's something.  It's weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you know your family, you know, your parents are active and [INAUDIBLE] and your brother and his daughter and your, your -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kids and, you know, I mean there's, uh, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think you're going to like what I have to tell you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's, uh, well, we'll see.  On [DATE] you had one week.  You were leaden; extremely leaden, you know, aah, comparatively.  Uh, better with the higher dose of thyroid and you had the hyperglycemia, the low potassium.  When it was low, you weren't saying you were extra irritable; you're not saying it was good; no change in your weight.  You were not suicidal; not hopeless or helpless; poor concentration; intolerance of boredom, don't know why I wrote that, but, uh, we thought that in general given that despite all this stuff and the medical issues, you're doing reasonably well on your -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Usual cocktail of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Effexor 600, Wellbutrin 400, Depakote 500, as needed Provigil, uh, thyroid both T3 and T4 at reasonably high doses, and Valium 10 to 20 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So in this month and actually, uh, I was supposed to see you in 2 months.  So did something happen that you're, here sooner?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, and I, I think, uh, that, yes, yes, because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what has happened?  Tell me -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, all right.  Let's start with anxiety due to the reduce in medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay?  We went to [DEIDENTIFIED].  Remember I told you that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  And I did see my ex boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  Now I'm back to where we were.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  And it was something that was almost like a fairytale.  He hadn't changed one bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, first how did you slip away from [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just mere, merely said I was, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Going for a walk?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said, I think I said I was going to [DEIDENTIFIED] or something, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We met and we talked, you know?  He, he got into IRS problems I don't know a year or so ago.  He was very high up at [DEIDENTIFIED]; he graduated from [DEIDENTIFIED]; he was a [DEIDENTIFIED] football player.  He has, he's very, very bright and very, very handsome, and he's a very, he's, he's, he's, whatever he did, he made a terrible mistake.  He really did because he's not that way.  It's a, he's a very moral, nice -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  So he got into bad trouble that he can't go, come back to the States?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he can come back; he did come back.  That's the next thing.  So I saw him and it was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he going to go to jail?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it was civil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Civil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the pe, it's over now.  I don't know what the penalty that he had to pay was, but I think it was a very high penalty and I know that he had to leave [DEIDENTIFIED] and I know that he works at home, but he's a very private guy in everything [INAUDIBLE], but it was like falling in love all over again and if you took [NAME OTHER] out of the picture because we were getting along at, during that week in [DEIDENTIFIED], it was like I fell in love all over again.  Usually that doesn't happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've been in love with him -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For many years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In the past.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before, yes, before my first marriage.  So you go back 35 years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  May, maybe it charged up some, you know, early connection.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we still talk every sing, almost every day and I think there's a part of me that probably is in love with him and part of, and him in love with me and to tell you the truth, I, I'm very, I'm confused and I'm, but I'm, I can't, I'm not, I'm not doing anything now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Having a bit of an affair?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, but I'm going to tell you something else, okay, and I, I don't know where this is coming from 'cause I really think of myself as a good person.  I really do.  I had no moral questioning, guilt, or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> People, uh, you know, I think you feel entitled to it given what you've been through in your marriage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I, I guess you have to hear this.  I think this will sum, this will do a sum up.  He then came to New York and I was in the [DEIDENTIFIED], he was in the [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, hold on, let me, let me backtrack.  You went to [DEIDENTIFIED], you spent, uh, one afternoon with him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two afternoons together.  It was wonderful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two afternoons for how many hours each?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> An hour and a half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And then you went back to do [DEIDENTIFIED]  stuff and then you came back to New York?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Came back to New York and then he came to the [DEIDENTIFIED] actually two weeks later and we spent about two or three hours together for a couple, for, in the afternoon and it was just, the right word is lovely.  That's all it was.  It was just a very lovely -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now when, when you with him in [DEIDENTIFIED], did you touch?  Kiss?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.  That's why I mentioned morality, okay?  Okay.  Here goes.  [NAME OTHER] has done something that I've been biting my tongue about and I have been very careful to not bust out of a, a shell.  We're in a recession headed for depression or maybe not.  I don't, I don't know, but the economy is horrible and people are suffering.  I know I, what's happening is happening and I've always known this.  Um, this is the example and this is how it's been.  Friday afternoon I went with my parents to [DEIDENTIFIED], he's a [DEIDENTIFIED].  My parents are aging.  I mean they're [AGE].  My father had gone out to have his neck lifted, okay?  You know, they, they are what they are, but there was something very sentimental about that for me because I took my kids all the time and here I was with my parents who took me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the age thing.  That's why we went, okay?  I went.  And then we went to dinner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just you and them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  And he said to my father, so, has your lifestyle monetarily changed from the last year to this year?  So I looked at my dad sort of like don't answer a question and my dad said, well, let me, a little bit.  He said I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm very worried about the future.  So, uh, then he said to me, [PATIENT NAME], where, where'd you get that coat?  I said my dad bought it for me.  He said it's okay.  It was putdown after putdown after putdown.  That -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's rude to your father.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can be.  He then got up to go to the men's room and my mother said, [PATIENT NAME]?  Yes; you're being putdown; ignore it; don't say anything; just ignore it; say whatever you said.  Fine.  The next morning he said, oh, here's that tuition your father owes for [NAME OTHER]'s college.  I have a hard time with taking that and giving it to my parents.  I just have a hard time with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said, okay.  I gave it to my mom and I said I, I, I don't even know how to thank you guys and whatever.  So we were with them the next day and my mother says, who, who should I give this to?  He said, I'll take it, not, just like that.  I said, thank you so much.  It means a lot and I know how much it means to [NAME OTHER].  You guys have been so generous.  Not a word from him.  And then he said, yeah, thanks; and put it in his pocket.  Then he went to a store that my father shops in and is going out of business, business, [DEIDENTIFIED].  My father's thinking of putting an outlet in one of the shopping centers.  My father gets 70% off now.  Everybody gets 70% off everywhere now, right?  My, my mother was buying clothes for my father [INAUDIBLE] I want you to come, it's 70% off and they bought me a, a couple of things and, uh, my dad was being nice.  He said you should tell [NAME OTHER] because they have sports jackets his size.  [NAME OTHER] goes in, picks out a few sports jackets, goes up to my father and says whose credit card do I put it on?  Yours?  I said, no, [NAME OTHER], you put it on yours.  And my father didn't say a word.  I just saw him sort of back up.  He didn't say a word.  And then I get the icing on the cake probably to get back at me or my parents.  My brother had some urological problems.  Right now he's in the hospital because he has chest pain, he had horrible chest pains this morning -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's in the hospital; he's an alcoholic; they still don't know what's wrong, and my brother said to my parents, oh, you know, [NAME OTHER]'s an alcoholic; he's got some severe problems.  And I looked at him, my mother said is that true, [PATIENT NAME]?  I said I can't [INAUDIBLE]; I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] told your father this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my mother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you, and your parents didn't know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think they know he drinks, but I don't think that they would ever say the word -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, you know, at [AGE], nobody wants to hear that, with all the problems with all his children and everything that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And grandchild.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Their grandchild, all their grandchildren that that was a statement that should never have come from [NAME OTHER]'s mouth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So this is kind of an ongoing tension.  Are, is, what, is one of the things you're saying that you're retaliating against -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just don't feel so bad and, and this stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Let me tell you, you know what, [PHYSICIAN NAME], I know, I, I, I should have, I should have such a bad moral feeling and so I should be tough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, how, how far did it go?  Be explicit with me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think, it went to the point where, oh, there was a stop, but it was, it was more being able to rest on someone's shoulder who I could talk to and they could talk back and I could have a real conversation with without somebody jumping down my throat and I, there are two sides to every story if not 14.  When I first came to you, I know [NAME OTHER] had come before.  I know how I was portrayed.  I really do and I know how people, how people that he's spoken to when we were separated portrayed me and it's okay.  I did not do that and I can swear to you I did not do that to him, but I did a lot of things that were wrong and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some of what drove that was a mania I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mania.  Weren't you manic?  High energy?  Racing thoughts?  Talking too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it was that, that was my nerves doing that, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I would just retreat into myself.  Yeah, probably, yeah.  'Cause then I would retreat into my -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I mean some of the bad judgment you showed back then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Because you know what, you're right.  Because, absolutely.  Because when those days came about, I felt so beaten down that I didn't, I wouldn't think three times before I would run off and do something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay?  I don't want to ever lose my family, of course, and I don't intend to lose my family.  I don't know what the future is for me; I don't know anybody's future, but I do know one thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, we're not going -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no.  Tell me the one thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that I'm fighting being worn down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, what does that mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It means yesterday he's talking about a Christmas vacation.  Oh, excuse me, Sunday night he said to me, [PATIENT NAME], what's wrong?  What, what happened this weekend that was wrong?  I said, [NAME OTHER], if I talked to you about it, you'll use it against me; I can't talk to you because I know you'll yell at me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said no, I won't.  I said, [NAME OTHER], will you swear to me?  He said, yes.  And I said, you know, I just thought like some of the things you did with my family you could have just said thank you.  I said I would have certainly done that with yours and I was so calm and nice, okay?  So I said it, and whatever I said, I, I just remember saying it very calmly and nicely.  He said, uh-huh; okay.  Yesterday, he, I got an email saying when I pay for something, I expect to go where I want to go.  That is why you're parents should have picked a place I wanted to go.  I got this email.  And I said, what are you talking about?  I don't understand what, what you're saying.  And he said maybe you should think about what I'm saying with a exclamation point.  And I'm, I was walking down the street and I saw this text message and I said, I said, oh, God, no, please don't do this to me today.  Please, please, please don't do this to me.  And I called my best friend and she said I want you to bite your tongue; you've got to bite your tongue; it's not worth it; it's not worth it; I bit my tongue.  It's like I'm living with somebody who's almost jealous of, of, of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, this is, but this tension had been there for a long time, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It has been, [PHYSICIAN NAME], but you know what, I need, you know, look, I, all I know now is that [NAME OTHER] and I, I think we're very, very good friends.  I would tell him -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How available is he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he lives in [DEIDENTIFIED], so not that available.  I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And his marital status?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think, I, I think, I don't think his martial status is a good one; no, I don't.  I know he's got wonderful children 'cause one goes to school, you know, did go to school with [NAME OTHER], now with [NAME OTHER] and I know he's a great father.  He adores his kids.  I don't think that his wife and he have a good marriage, although he's very protective, he loves his wife, and he's very, I like that.  I like a man that says I love my wife; I'm not in love with my wife, but I really love my wife.  Maybe I feel that way about [NAME OTHER].  I don't know how I, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It makes it a little safer though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Both of you that he's not running so fast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To hock you to leave your husband and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no, no, no, no, and I wouldn't, and I'm not hocking him.  I would never hock him.  That's why it's a, it's sort of like this treasure package.  Hocking, never.  Look, I'd like my marriage to get better.  I'm trying to do everything I can to bite my tongue; to be silent; to try to be understanding; to try, you know, everything and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, clearly your husband resents -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's so stupid, [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think he resents if he doesn't make the money that he thinks he should.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And how about when he says to me, where's my money?  Where's my money?  And I say, what do you mean?  Well, when your parents die, where's my money?  No that is, that is a terrible thing to say and look, I'm looking you straight in the eye and he says that and swore on my life, I have never thought of myself as a wealthy girl, I have never thought of myself as a princess, anchored myself as a normal person whose father and mother did well and I hope they spend every dime that they have until the day they are gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay?  And that is how I feel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But he doesn't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I find that those comments to be outlandish, hurtful -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does he say it to provoke you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What else?  You know what, even if you say that to provoke someone, it's a pretty blow -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's mean.  No, no, it's really mean.  Um, all right, I don't know where that's coming from.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what, I'm just telling you that that God, the medicine was not reduced because I had a rough month and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, but you, it sounds like you had some really nice things in [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what, yeah, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], you know, listen I, I'm not a moralist so I don't, I don't judge in any way whatsoever and what I do is collect data and what I like is that it shows a drive in you for pleasure -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For connection, for attachment.  I mean to me it's not negative.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I'm saying, I didn't think of it as negative, but maybe I should have thought of it as negative, but I did not because in all honesty as I said when I sat down, I don't know what the future holds.  I don't know if I can bite my tongue for years to come.  I don't know what happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you mean there may be a time then that you and [NAME OTHER] are no longer together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hate to think that, I really would hate to think that, but if it ever came to it where I said, God, you know, blink my eyes and think can I spend 20 more years and get, you know, attacked like this, I think I'm, I've come to, you know, I don't know.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's so nice to feel attractive to a man, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, and a man to feel that, that he's attractive to another woman, of course, it is and if there's a history that in two seconds you walk in a room like and 35 years ago nothing changed.  You start talking like you talked yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Why'd you break up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had another boyfriend too.  It was college, you know?  I think I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and if you ask me why I broke up, to tell you the truth, I'm not sure what -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you remember.  You ought to ask him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said he remembers -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, he said something about having another boyfriend, but I don't really remember that.  It was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He remembers.  I'm sure he remembers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, how's your mood right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm tired.  I'm tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So your mood's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not sad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your energy's low?  Are you, have you been dragging lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but what they found out was, uh, with my blood work, I, well, now I'm on potassium pills because prednisone apparently can attack your, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thyroid and can lower your potassium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So now I'm on potassium pills and they have to go up with that 'cause I'm [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much prednisone you on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went down to 5.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're on 5, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really did.  Uh, I'm tired.  Maybe a lot of stress is, you know, coming now just hitting me now.  My brother, you know, and everything and, but I think, you know, under the circumstances, I'm hard.  That's all I can say to you is that I'm trying very, very hard.  Uh, maybe [NAME OTHER] is really trying hard too; maybe, you know, I'm not a great wife; maybe I'm, you know, who knows what he thinks.  He has a life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, listen, you've got to, uh, promise me one thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you know what, when I told you that first time that I felt that I should say I'm going to me, you know what, I listened to you and then I walked home and my best friend called me and she said, [PATIENT NAME], you're entitled to a private life.  You've been entitled to a private life.  You've got to understand it's okay to have a private life.  If you ever, you may never tell him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  So don't get, if you tell him, it will be from a sadistic impulse -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I will -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To hurt him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I will, I can, I can tell you that, no way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Good.  Now he may find out because he's so snoopy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I delete all my e-mails.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Permanently.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  [LAUGHING].  Um, how's your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sleeping okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Self esteem is decent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's okay.  Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not terribly.  You don't feel like you're no good, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any suicidal thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You hopeless or helpless?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're pretty forward looking, aren't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Forward looking.  You know looking towards the future in a positive way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Concentration okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A little better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you read?  Can you stick with something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Better.  Better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Better meaning how much can you read?  Can you read a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can start reading -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Chapter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I can read a chapter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can read a chapter.  Can you read some magazines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The whole article, you can get through it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Three quarters of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  You lose your interest.  Um, you're getting pleasure?  You're enjoying things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get belly laughs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, not with [NAME OTHER], but I do [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].  I do get -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're a little obsessed with your relationship with [NAME OTHER] as I guess is normal, but separate from that, it sounds like, except for that island of challenge -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your life's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might have a new relationship, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A new old relationship; you have, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, no, I, it's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And your doc says that the auto immune problems are in -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're, he, no.  Actually, when my blood work came back it was all up, down, all over the place.  The problem is is that it's like, as I, as it, they described it's like a big stew and they have to figure out is it the thyroid that caused this; is it the lupus that caused this; is it the this that caused this; and so they try and you know what, to tell you the truth, [PHYSICIAN NAME], I don't even listen.  I just do what they tell me to do -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  [LAUGHING].  That's a good answer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And deny it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Listen, hey, that's great.  That is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really do.  I can -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Act as if you don't have any of it; just move forward.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When it's going to give you trouble, it'll give you trouble whether you get obsessed on it or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And yesterday the doctor said, you know, are you listening?  And I said, truthfully?  He said, yeah, aren't you listening to everything I say?  I said, not really.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, don't listen to any of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't listen to any of us.  Your best friend also.  You don't need any of our advice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yes, [PHYSICIAN NAME], I, uh, that's wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You think you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know what, I don't think you do.  I, I think you, you have all the answers inside of you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I didn't have the ability to, to come here and to have medication and to be able to talk about the fact that I needed medication because if I didn't have it, it would not be the same me.  I know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Listen, what, what I like to see, you know, life happens, right?  Affairs, what have you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Life happens.  Well you know, people who have mood disorders, when life happens to them, they unravel because the systems are not regulated or not stable.  So I like drama 'cause drama probes the system.  Prob, drama shows us, it's like getting a push -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know?  Like when someone has Parkinson's disease, you know, sometimes we push them a little bit because they have instability -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's one of the things we test.  We push to see if they fall over.  I mean we catch them, but the same thing with this.  The drama of your life's kind of pushing your system to see if you can adapt and what you're showing us is that you're adapting fine.  You're doing beautifully.  You really are.  You're adapting fine.  It's not always great.  You have a troubled marriage; you have, you know, you have to referee this, this underground conflict between your husband and your parents and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE], I mean, God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], you know, but that's life, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's a lot worse things.  I mean it's better than cancer, right?  I mean, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Let me tell you something.  I don't, I don't us, I really don't, I, I, I, uh, I guess I've taken the, uh, the stand now that what will be will be -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I can't force it and I'm not going to force it and what will be will be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, listen, I'm looking forward to more good stories especially around this.  If you, because I do know your husband, if you want to bring him in and us have some of this conversation together, that's fine also or you can just let this go and dissipate which I think it will, but, you know, there's, there's always the option of bringing him in here -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.  Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we can, does he know that there's a problem or he's kind of clueless?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he hates my mother and father and I think he hates their lifestyle and I think he hates everything that their lifestyle represents.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe at some point you should put a limit on his interaction because it's so stressful for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can just say, I'm not getting in between you guys anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll, we'll have to do this separately.  I'll be with them without you or something like that and that's kind of the last resort -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But these, these kind of things can't, you know, it's just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It'd be tough on anybody -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  And then what happens is when your parents die and everybody has that's ever been through it or any book I've ever read, you really resent the person who wasn't nice to them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you were especially attached to your parents.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In more, you know, I go back and forth, but now that I see how they're aging, I want to make sure that I do everything I can because I want to know that in my life that I was really there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.  I don't think anyone -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Would doubt that, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would doubt that, that you're, you're their rock.  I hope things go okay with your brother.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, [PHYSICIAN NAME].  It's, that, that house is such a mess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One's at [DEIDENTIFIED], the one that cut herself up.  I don't know how she's getting through that.  You know, the second one jumped off a terrace.  The third one doesn't talk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  The third one, the little one doesn't talk and the only stable one is the guy, is, is the son and they're putting all these boundaries on him.  He can't go to college in California; he can't go here; he can't there; it's horrible.  And I think it's very selfish to tell, to put it all on my mother and father.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, yes, it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's why, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm going to see you anyway right after the new year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me -</p>

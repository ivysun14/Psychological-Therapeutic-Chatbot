<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well how are you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m doing pretty good, I mean, it’s getting quite stressful for [NAME OTHER] and I but we’re doing well. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I know.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s just been, it’s been stressful, he’s been offered another, I mean he’s gone to interview for another job but at the same time, I think he thinks well I’m, I don’t know if I want to leave because I only have two more years. So, he, he’s, he’s doing much better, I think than I am -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I told him, I said you know you must not have been as depressed as I am because he’s doing great. I think he’s doing great, but I do listen to him, so I’m his wife so I feel all the uh, the tensions that he feels, you know? We have booked a cruise, we’re going to go [DATE] for a week. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wonderful.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, we’re going to go on another cruise that’s already booked. Which his mother will be down here [DATE] that means for seven weeks every one of my Saturdays are very busy. We shop ‘til we drop and she buys twenty four outfits and we take twenty two back. Don’t say anything about that. We take them, she’ll buy them and then she’ll be I didn’t quite like its fit, when you come home from work, do you mind, dropping it off?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do I mind? Of course.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I mind but you know, your [AGE] years old and you’re still hopping so we’ll do it for you, you know? She cooks dinner while she’s there and she keeps the dog company and usually, she’s kind of uh, hesitant about coming and then this year I just said to her last week, I said, you coming this year? Oh yes I am, I, tell [NAME OTHER] to go ahead and make my reservations because I’m ready to come, I’m going - I don’t know if I’m ready for you. Okay, let’s breathe real fast, you know? But, you know, it’s just a miracle that she can do so well. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It is. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Eighty nine years old, as active as she is.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, and mentally competent and, and then my poor mother’s the other way, the, the two bedsores have gone together in tunnels and they’re tunneling back up again. And her whole buttocks is nothing but one big bandage now. I don’t know how she’s living. I just don’t. she’s got a good heart I guess that’s, what’s doing it, its sad for me to see her and that’s my mother you know, that’s - mother and I were best friends for a lot of years until we got into all that mess, you know? And mother is, that woman lying in that bed is not mom. That’s, that’s not mom you know? Of course I ask God all the time while they’re, why are you keeping her here with such pain, but you know, I guess sometimes we just have to let it go. And I’ve been working full time again, I mean uh [NAME OTHER] have been the only ones in the office. [NAME OTHER]’s husband uh, a week ago, on a Monday, a Monday or was it Saturday? She woke up and she heard these growling sounds and it was him and his face was in the bed and she had got, well she had been in the bathroom about twenty minutes and he died twice on the way to the hospital. Found out, he had a massive sinus infection and he was addicted to Afrin nose spray. He had used it, he was fifty two most of his life, and he was a smoker too, they called it sudden heart arrest. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yep, so they gave her no hope, they said there is no hope. And um, they took him to another hospital and he’s been on a respirator and um, he’s been bad, bad, bad and two days ago he started coming around last night they took the respirator on and he remembered his cell phone number and called his wife this morning. We don’t know how much damage there is but he’s doing wonderful but oh, she was just devastated because they said there was no hope. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Fifty two?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Fifty two. He had such a bad sinus infection they said that they were afraid that it damaged some of his brain. But we won’t know that for a while. You know? You’re not going to know that right away. But he, he’s a heavy smoker and, and [NAME OTHER] had never mentioned it of course that’s part of our life we don’t talk about but she said he had Afrin in every corner of the house. And he would spray it up his nose and then you know his nose would get clogged up, you get used to that stuff, and she said they had stated dating at fifteen and he was doing it then. Well, they told, they told - the doctors told her that the sinus cavity were completely destroyed. But it had to be an answer to prayer because all of a sudden now, they say it’s better. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Can you -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And they were picking out junk, she said black and all kinds of junk out of his head and they thought it was all the way up here and they couldn’t get it and it’s started clearing up but we don’t know if there’s any brain damage yet, how much. You know? But that in itself is a miracle, so I don’t know, we’ve been, we told [NAME OTHER], now you just got to get your life together first your hip and now him, now, poor thing. So, they, its awful you know? Fifty two? That is awful.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Cause that is dreadful, I mean just plain dreadful.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but she said that it was [NAME OTHER] and I that was keeping her going. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, isn’t she sweet?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, and [NAME OTHER] has, she’s been off maybe four months out of this year and [NAME OTHER] has paid her the whole time she’s been off. But she deserves to be paid.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She’s a good worker?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She’s a good worker, she’s a good friend, she, she’s very company-minded and we just all laugh about [NAME OTHER] you know, she’s nuts. Uh, [NAME OTHER] might tell you some of the things going on but he you know, the man that um, did that big thing from [DEIDENTIFIED] that said [NAME OTHER] was a rock star? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, [NAME OTHER] yesterday said you’re not going to believe it. He said I got this thing on my voice mail and my e-mail and he says I didn’t know who it was so I called them back and it was [NAME OTHER]. Now he came in October and she was cussing him out yesterday or the day before that, that report wasn’t supposed to be, be a report that said that [NAME OTHER] was good at all. She said he finally said to her, you know, woman, you’re nuts. So, I mean, [NAME OTHER] says one day I really like my job, and he says there are times that I want out but he says, I say do I really want to make that big of a career change if I’m going to, going to retire? I said that is going to have to be something that you’ve got to - but he seems to be - which makes it easier on me. You know, when he seems to be dealing with it a little better.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The medication, whatever you gave him is helping him a lot.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that’s great. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know? So, and he’s the one that asked to come. Now, that’s not [NAME OTHER]. So, he must have really felt bad. You know? He says that I’m doing good. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wonderful, wonderful. Well, I uh, told [NAME OTHER] and I’m telling you as his wife, it’s very important for [NAME OTHER] to look at this job in a different way. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And that means that if his toenail is bothering him, he may have to take the day off. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay? And you will be able to look at him, and if he doesn’t look good to you, then he may have to take the morning off. And he may have to take you out for breakfast and I know you’re working full time, but wait a moment. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We, I leave at three o’clock. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No matter what -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No matter - </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No matter what’s done, I’m not done -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And there may be sometimes when he’s going to have to come home with you at three o’clock. Because it’s more important that he take care of himself -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hmm</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Than anything else at this point. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Cause this is how I feel. If I can’t get it done by three o’clock, except they’ve made us now you know, you can enter your month, at any time, well, for the last thirty five years, we have ended the month the last Saturday of the month. And that’s what [DEIDENTIFIED] do. Well, the accountant and the lawyer and [NAME OTHER] have decided we don’t know anything. Don’t know what we’re doing, so now we’re ending the month on the thirty-first, which is a lot more work, that means I end the month on the last Saturday and I end up having to end the month again on the thirty-first. But you know what? They’re not going to get their reports as fast because at three o’clock, or quarter to three, I go home. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] goes home. I say, well, that means you’re not going to get your report as fast, oh well. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh well.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s how I feel.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And that’s the way it has to be. There’s going to be a lot more oh well’s. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And he’s doing better at it, he’s been home now at four-thirty uh, couple times he was home a little later ‘cause it, we put in our new store. And the boss now, oh the boss, the lawyer now says that the board, whoever the board is, wants him to open more stores down in [DEIDENTIFIED] and [NAME OTHER] said that’s fine. You go to get the real estate, you find the building, but I’m not putting in the rails and stuff for a new store, if you want it in there, and then you go find somebody to man it. And you deal with the manager down there and see if he wants to take on another store. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They said well we can’t have that attitude. [NAME OTHER] said, well that’s what you get. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What have they done for him? I mean?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s right. Well, you do it, you’re telling me that I’ll have to work harder? I don’t think so. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then they said to [NAME OTHER] he said, you owe this company, you owe this company so you should stay here and I’m going to get somebody when you’re around [AGE], to take your place. Well, we’re sitting there laughing, because he needs to find somebody now. This is a big operation, you’ve got environmental to look for, you’ve got uh, the base so you have to know how the government works, all these things, I mean there is, just like in your practice that even more the [DEIDENTIFIED] practice, we have so many rules. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I know you do.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And they’re going to teach him that in six months? We just sit there going okay. When I’m [AGE], and you find somebody new, I’m going to give you six months, and I’m gone. If you’re nasty to me -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I would just walk out too -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ll walk out. So you’ve got such a bitter attitude. Hallelujah, you know? It’s hard to deal with someone like that when you’re working with him. And you say, you don’t like it? Get out. Get out, get out, get out. And now he says, you know? I just have to learn to deal with it. If I don’t like it, I mean people want him, but he doesn’t know if he wants, this guy that’s probably going to want him, I think he’s going to have to go back into the [DEIDENTIFIED] itself and what he needs is somebody to organize a whole store and start all over. [NAME OTHER] doesn’t know if he wants to do that again.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That might be a little bit more than what he wants to take on. But I just sit back and I tell him you said this guy was working fourteen hours a day at this cleaners. You make sure if you’re going with him, you’re not the fourteen hours a day. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You did that for years. You know? So, I, I feel a lot better about it. So I think I’m doing well.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you’re doing great. And that’s the whole thing. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We owe this store nothing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Nothing. That’s what I said to [NAME OTHER], we owe it nothing, he left us nothing, even though he said he was going to, I don’t care whether he was sick at the time, I think people were trying to tell us, I don’t care what, we were with him thirty five years. In that thirty five years, he could have made arrangements. He didn’t, we owe him nothing for that business. If when we leave, it falls to the floor.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It falls to the floor. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh well.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh well, that’s exactly what we say, oh well. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve used that more for the last week, I look at [NAME OTHER] and I go, oh well. You know? So, do you have anything for me or do you have any medicine?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um, I don’t have too much. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, then don’t give me any, I’ve got enough at home.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We’ll I’m going to look. I’m going to write a prescription for some Effexor.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because uh, do that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Our weather just don’t know what to do doctor. I’ve brought my plants in, now my I’m going to take my plant, I’m going to plant -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I know it; the weather does not know what to do.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I brought them in the other night brought them out. [NAME OTHER] says your orchids are driving me nuts. All you have to do is help me bring them in. But yet if we go somewhere, and see an orchid, he’ll say, that’s beautiful, you want that one? So, he’s got where he gets out there and he says I’m ending up doing all the fertilization of these orchids. And I said, I think it’s good for us to do it together. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s good. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Did you ever put in a, a solar on your, your pool?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I didn’t actually. I didn’t uh, I thought of it, actually my mom gave me some money and she said you ought to do that but I never did. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it’s nice if you like to swim all year. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Are you a swimmer all year, you think?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I don’t know that I like, I don’t know that I want to go out when it’s cold.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, I just, I don’t know that I want to do that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Do you still use it as much as you always did?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Use the pool quite a bit. There are four three hundreds in each -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s great.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> One of these.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> If I have these, this is great. That’s all I need.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, because here we have six times four, is twenty four which is good for -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Like seventeen, you know?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s good.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, I have that. I want to go finish reading my book, I must have left it out there, and it’s not [DEIDENTIFIED] this week. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Not?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s somebody else. I decided to give her a rest. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, so that’s good, alright. We will see you next month. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And that’s great.</P>

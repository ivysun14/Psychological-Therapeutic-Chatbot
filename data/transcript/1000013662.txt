<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 15th Interview. April 12th.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd like to come home where it's real warm and really dusting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also the dust came along and I though I did a good job cleaning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think it's probably (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't have a (inaudible) or anything. I've got to leave kind of promptly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like a couple of minutes early. That'll work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I'm sorry about this change. What happened was that I was supposed to speak this afternoon at this class and - and I'd forgotten to write it down. And I didn't realize. I mean it's - it turns out that now that I think I have an appointment book I never store anything about what I'm supposed to do in my mind. I just didn't know. The appointment book and it wasn't down there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just made this appointment with you. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well this is - I think we'll come at 3:00 o'clock next Monday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. It was just a -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's 2:45 p.m. on Wednesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's 3:00 o'clock on </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I think you had offered to write it down for me. I said no, I'll remember it. I said is it 2:45 p.m. on Monday and 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was lucky that you called me anyway I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I might have shown up at 2:45 p.m. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well - I don't know. It's still weird trying to come up and start talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). Just to come in here and like (inaudible) and get into something. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean all of the sudden you're supposed to be into something serious?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once you come here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead what - where are you so (inaudible). What was really happening that you had to shift from (inaudible) shift from?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I was just running around doing visits. You know not having time to sit down or not having time to be introspective or anything like that and ...you know (inaudible) come in here and sit down and you have to be introspective. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So sometimes you need to ease your way into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That works. I can't be able to expect to sit down and jump right into something. I should want - to start to gradually (inaudible) into it but. (0:02:58.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But? And what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just - it ...actually it doesn't feel like (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even to gradually work your way in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It seems kind of artificial sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which - what (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like just deliberately setting out to try to talk without something meaningful. I don't really like talking about what I want to or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what would you want to talk about? Is that a sensible question to ask?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It just feels like you're full of bullshit. Not - not really talking about anything that's ... really particularly relevant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Relevant to what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to talk about the weather and I don't want to talk about my hand (ph). You know I'm feeling real good about this. This is exactly (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you're (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: My asthma's getting worse and all this and I think I'm allergic to something too because I don't know. Ever since I came back from my vacation I've been sneezing and my eyes are watering and I ... between the two things. Oh yeah, I'm just feeling better about that. That's something else I wanted to keep (inaudible) about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you want to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh that was about it. I was - I was thinking (inaudible) yesterday I was trying to think about what we talked about - Friday? And I really couldn't remember much of it. I just found that disturbing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did it make you think when you couldn't remember it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ... you know like ... I sort of become aware of some (inaudible) things. I thought I'd learned some things and it seems like I've forgotten it. (Inaudible). And ...it was a disappointment because I thought they were neat. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was a shame to lose them? (0:06:02.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean that kind of. Was it a kind of thing were it makes sense to try to think back to them and figure them out or is it kind of the fact that having lost it is more of an issue now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's hard to say. When it was first in my mind, it was just being ... (inaudible) but then I - I can actually like sort of change my orientation and I figured it was lost (inaudible). That you did not sense (inaudible). And you know it didn't mean anything to ...and if it would have just ... some sort of superficial fascination with it. That you can just (inaudible) so fast.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So sometimes if they slip away, you can make yourself believe that you didn't care about them very much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I know. Not me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you said you can make yourself have that orientation. What does that mean? You can put them but it's not - not really.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That wasn't - that wasn't - that wasn't what was really bothering me. It was just poor responding and it was sort of like ...just having something neat that you fight and having lost it to - somebody took it from you. Lost it I guess it was (inaudible) and even though like it - it does not - it doesn't necessarily have some sort of functions having you liked it anyhow. I mean like I sort of - I like I said one of the things that I couldn't - I couldn't change my own life kind of thing. But it's just sort of nice to be able to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were pleased with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well given that does it make sense to try to recover it? I mean just off hand I can't but I'm sure that we could kind of get back into it ... and go back over it. But I can't tell whether that's what - what really speak to you ... concerning. (0:08:40.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think that probably ... a good time would be just (inaudible) one reason why I could go on (inaudible) try to be (inaudible). Like I said I don't know. I don't know. I'm actually thinking it might even be interesting to be (inaudible) because ... (inaudible) real reading a book (inaudible) read. You know what I mean? I mean it could have value. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you think? That would (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm sort of thinking in my mind that if - if I can get like a little (inaudible) which isn't until what ... we were talking about Friday. I go and actually look at I can't get anything at all. (Inaudible) You know pass the time. You know in some ways I think it would be harder to talk about ... that again than it is to turn to something else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that mean you want to do it less then or that you think it's more important then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tends to (inaudible). Tends to make me want to ... it's more challenging and I might (inaudible) challenge so I can -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean if you started thinking about that you might not even get a quick hold. You know or if you do want to - did get a compliment (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. (Inaudible) lost me and tending to - it's like (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like talking - like talking about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I won't have it. I'll tell you it's strange how it - like my mind has gone completely blank from like the time that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like there's nothing there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As if it were resisting me. Like I'm really trying to think what we were talking about and if you asked me to write it down on paper I couldn't. (0:11:41.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a vague sense that (inaudible) writing it down on paper or is it like as if that session never happened? The fact that you have no idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's closer to the second thing you said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know you agreed to come but you can not (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm talking about what we were talking about just then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This talking about - talking about this. And when I said a certain (inaudible) not only have I sort of forgotten your questions or forget what it's about and I truly (inaudible). Like totally I mean I couldn't write it down if I had to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what you do think? Do you think that's a matter of like when you - when you repeat a word too many times, you can't tell what it means anymore or is it - you know what I'm really asking is do you think that's in the nature of the situation and keeping on and on - it's that - on that point you think it's more some kind of problem that you're having?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I don't see what you're (inaudible) to. The person that said (inaudible) over and over and over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. That's like to say well we talked about it and we talked about it and we talked about it and maybe after a while, it just (inaudible) from keeping on being talked about it and that's a fact.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not even (inaudible). It's - it's as if my mind absolutely refuses to cooperate and keep up. Try to think about it. Trying to think about talking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your mind won't cooperate. It just stays there and won't - no more thoughts come or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's so no more thoughts come in. I mean like I'm consciously saying (inaudible) you asked me and what were we talking about and keeping me like ... asking myself and keep on getting nothing for an answer. And there's just no way to resolve it. It's - if I really do want to talk about it or talk about whatever it is, I have ... and just wish that in some ways that - that I had to not doing nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your mind really is just refusing to do it ... cause it doesn't want to and it's going to (inaudible). (0:14:35.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well as if ... yeah, that's it. it's - it's sort of like I don't know just ... when I always ask (inaudible) and ... what I'm even frustrated with because (inaudible) I don't think I'll get (inaudible) like a (inaudible) but ... like when I have to make some sort of a decision or choose between a couple of things ... I say I should do this but this is what I want to do and this is what I want to do but it's actually what I should do. I don't know if you really understand this or (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I understand you're (inaudible) but I don't understand the analogy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what I'm doing is knowing what I should do and let's talk about it and then what I want to do and let's not talk about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that true or is that just how your mind goes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's just what we're talking about and I guess I didn't want to but ...by assisting (inaudible) in keeping the (inaudible). And so -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then your mind makes the decision.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My mind takes off where ...it does what I normally would have done. I normally would have done what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just say let's stop talking about this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. But there's some sort of obligation to talk coherently and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the obligation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't even know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't know you were going to ask me that. I just took the obligation instead of (inaudible) the obligation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then what happened? There's nothing in your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. I just decided well maybe there isn't one. I was going to say that I can't say two sentences and then talking about something entirely unrelated to it and then over on the other side. (0:17:28.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well - you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think that would be constructive but then I start to think that well maybe there's absolute - what I really wanted to talk about and maybe it is constructive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what are you saying? Between those two.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If that's what I really wanted to do I guess then that's constructive even though it ... it's not I don't want to say not normal but it's ... it would be more or less ... actually you'd get something out of it because it's sort of a reflection of the source of the experience more than the person who (inaudible). It's </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean then you'd be letting the terms of the conversation in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I would. I was just thinking I'd be ... I guess I was sort of operating like essential to this conception about (inaudible). Though I realize it's a misconception I still (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's - I feel it's important to ... to across maybe some sort of accurate picture or image or something of - of me to (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I decided to maybe try. You know maybe this actually will stop this (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But in a way you still worry about what impression you're examining. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much the impression but just the picture of being (inaudible). You know a true picture of - as if like that was significant in - in this counseling situation but actually -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I - I don't really get what you mean. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it - I think if you went to - to somebody like that. I don't know. I don't know what's ... you know psycho therapy, (inaudible) which I don't know a lot of distinctions but you know if you want to ... to (inaudible) he wants to know everything like what your conclusions about you in terms of what you do. And so you have to ... so he has to like to come to like a real clear picture of you and he has to (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean put all the data about you (inaudible)? (0:20:22.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: More or less. Yeah. He has to ... I don't know. Have just like a better, complete picture of ... of this patient and I think it will say I'm starting to look at this more and more and it's sort of a self discovery thing and so it's heading back to telling me what you know this is your problem and then don't let it bother you or something. So it's ... or maybe it's just that ... the (inaudible). You know maybe the picture that you get of me is not all that important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess there's still a tension that you aren't so sure about that and there's still a tension in you in - in one aspect or one thing that you're saying to yourself that you're wondering is I'm telling her the stuff she needs to know to form that picture. Am I saying the right things? Am I giving her the data?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In some ways that's what I do. I think even though I realize that's kind of - unnecessarily there may not be but that's the thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's still a pressure that you feel to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Too natural.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I'm saying is that's what I thought it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is that one of the things that come - turn into what you decide to talk about. Not that you care about it but you think I might or you think it's an important thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In some ways - in some ways. You know like I - I really hate to keep on talking about schools (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just keep saying the same thing. It's like becoming more like complaining. (Inaudible). I don't know. Shut up. I don't think I get too much out of that. It might give you a more accurate picture of me if I did but ... I think it would be better to cover a sort of more broad (inaudible) territory. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how (inaudible) to think about that issue? And that's from my point of view. It's important for you to talk about the things that concern you most but the point of the problems is in your finding that and like you put forth two different definitions of it. You want to talk in a way. It's just in your being. You want to talk about as many things and it's a range of things or do you want to talk as - like all of the different things that you were concerned about or do you want to talk about them like in kind of weighed averages? (Inaudible) Like you think about school a lot I gather. You don't want to talk about it that much. But I don't know what it is (inaudible). (0:24:20.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I keep on saying the same thing (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I (inaudible) I'd say shut up and read my books.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Get down to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Get it out of the way. You don't have to spend so much time trying to start (inaudible) with your training and everything like that. The more time you spend doing that the more time I'm going to have to spend in school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that seem like a valid solution?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's ... probably would - probably would be the best one for me. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that (inaudible) school before I decided to come back and it wouldn't be good for me to spend another year here because the thing to do is ... I've decided I must have school. You want to (inaudible) or whatever. The thing to do is just to get it over with as soon as possible ... especially since it's nothing (inaudible) is coming out of all of this bitching that I do about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you tired of listening to yourself complain about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I imagine other people are too. Like not only you but there's people my own age that I try to deal with too. I don't (inaudible) stupid allergy. I don't know about - in our first year but I mean it's starting to sink into me and stuff like that. I think I complained about it an awful lot and started to - and probably ... I've had ... I think it has a great effect on how people relate to me. I probably like always - I didn't realize the degree to which everything that's coming out of my mouth is a - like a whine or a complaint and it turns people off. And then they don't want to - smoke dope with you or (inaudible). It's -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: True.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. They know how bad school is but they're doing it. Why shouldn't just (inaudible) keep on fighting just maybe it works for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just (inaudible) I haven't heard you complain about school that much. I mean ... I've heard you say a lot of times, I complain about school and we have talked about school a couple of times but my - my overall impression isn't that a huge bunch of your conversation with me is about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe not with you but then I just - I just ...</p>

<p>
COUNSELOR: I don't think. I don't know if that really matters to - to the point you're making but I just wanted to put it in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think to in some ways, it's almost reassuring (inaudible) but ... with the total of all of my communications with other people -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (0:27:42.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's about school a lot (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're kind of appalled at how much of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Pretty much. I don't - I sort of blame the ... my - treat it either like failure to it or ... to get along well with people. Not getting along but just try to be interesting and - to the (inaudible) people like I want to talk to. I don't know. They don't want to be around you anymore. There's just interesting things to say in (inaudible). Actually people just don't want to be around somebody who's constantly saying the same thing over and over or different variations of the same thing. And I think without realizing it, especially second year that I was still around a lot of people that don't but I think I did spend off and on by talking (inaudible) and really feeling sorry for myself and it turned other people off to me and they sort of just (inaudible). Which probably continued last year and continued this year for a little while. I don't know how we got into that. I don't know where it came from but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were talking about - do you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I totally don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where it came from?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We were talking about what should you talk about here and how different pressures determine what you talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can see how we got there but I don't remember saying look -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I said - and I said something about trying to figure out what I thought you said talk about and saying that it seemed to me that you were talking about a kind of tension between choosing to present this wide range of things and presenting things in your relate weight for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you started talking about well what relate weight did school have for you and - and the kind of precision you've been taking that you shouldn't talk about it as much. That that was a better way of solving the problem. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know exactly this (inaudible) but (inaudible) we could talk about school and stuff but I had nothing to say about it. (Inaudible). I don't know. There's nothing interesting there that's sensitive or something or I don't know. Change or something even if I hate it. What more can I say and (inaudible) I hate that that's happening at all? (0:31:23.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would you think though? What's (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't (inaudible) or sound happy. I suppose. You know when it all starts and the fact that I'm not ... obviously joyful or something. (Inaudible) feeling bad about my entire situation and then every individual situation that I (inaudible). It just doesn't seem good. I don't know. I think that to ... you know like a great (inaudible) ... yeah, it's - it's also like they're interrelated I would assume but it's hard to start somewhere. It doesn't really have to be (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I have to say oh, I hate school because I'm a little lazy and ... and I'm a little lazy because I am ... feeling guilty about not doing well in school. I'm not doing well in school ... you know too worried about ... what I was without - it was just too much to do and ... and (inaudible) being kicked out of your parents' home is like (inaudible) pretty much for (inaudible). Just getting the chance to do it all for a while and ... and I really want to do things (inaudible). I don't know. I'll start there with them. I don't think I did (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you understand it? (0:34:02.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. In a way ... if my folks seen I was - I don't know. They probably would but I had (inaudible). But I'm trying - what I'm trying to do is put in perspective ... alright I really say I hate New York. I hate being in school ... and I'm trying to decide how much of that hate is really due ... to ... like an aversion to (inaudible) or something like that. How much of it is due to the fact that I feel very isolated and alone - in respect to my peers. And how much the two things relate to each other and how my - what (inaudible) it should be to my father. But it just seems kind of like ... I don't remember much (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's a problem because you're also saying well it's wrong - it's a big thing altogether. You can't just take them part and sort them out and then you're going to have to deal with one of them and then the next one and the next one and the next one. That they seem much more tied together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's too big for me and it's too big to tackle. If I could get it apart I would be able to but they're so interwoven so tightly. You know (inaudible) in one direction and everything else is - tends to push you down and it's not until you -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't get everything else tends to push you down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I - if I were to really make an effort to - to do well in school ... you know like (inaudible) and standoffishness and everything like that, it would depress me and push me right back down. It would just ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd be unhappy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you (inaudible) one of those things you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because if I started to solve one of them the other ones would just seem that much worse. I suppose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd stop worrying about school and devote my entire mind to worrying about the other things. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) I guess the assumption that you're (inaudible). This is giving quantity of wording that you have to put in. (0:36:56.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Well that's what I'm saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's not - I mean I really don't think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's why I said depending on the impression. I could - I don't know. If I started studying long in school, I'd ...you know that's one thing that I don't and I talk about situations more (inaudible) getting any better. And I start to picture myself as ... I tend to sometimes (inaudible). You know it's only decides to spread. You know all day (inaudible) all day long and (inaudible) and it's like everything seems take (inaudible) practically. (Inaudible). You know a technological vegetable and I say a lot of it is I really don't want to be like those people because if I don't have any friends and I'm getting (inaudible) school with. This can't be the solution.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't like that picture of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I tell myself that can't be the solution anymore and then I say wow. I don't have any friends. I can worry (inaudible) start to look at it for other answers and ... in doing so; I divert my energy into school work. I don't (inaudible) and as it starts to fall off I say to myself ... you just can't make it. All you see is you're (inaudible). You don't feel that and ...and that (inaudible) to keep me unhappy and keep from ... somehow worrying to better associate me (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once you started trying to change one thing (inaudible) then all the other kind of ways you are would be open to question to - I hope I'm following along here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. In a way. Yeah. Well if I start to go out of my way to be very sociable and try to learn how to - deal with people and be (inaudible) and ... you know just how to make social ties work and develop friendships and stuff. If - if I were trying to do that without a course increase in my school work I'd say to myself that ... I'm not doing what I should be doing. (0:39:57.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't just go ahead and take that decision for (inaudible) you'd keep on saying it doesn't stick.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't be satisfied with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No matter what I do I say - you know like if I were ... I were making friends, I'd tell myself you shouldn't be doing this. You should be studying and preparing for your future.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what do you think of that when you keep on telling yourself you you're doing the wrong thing? Do you think you're right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm in either one of the situations it definitely looks right from that situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Definitely always seems like you're making mistakes by doing the thing you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If I sit back now I say neither one of those things - self (inaudible) or something. I don't know but ... as soon as I would get in a situation like I think that - the same thing. I don't know and then I'm talking a little about -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's just say that when you're in either one of the situations either studying or doing something social, it seems like you're - you haven't made the right choice. You're losing out ... on that other - the other thing. Okay. Because this is about -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not as simple as that. It's more or less like saying (inaudible). It's only as bad as it looks. (Inaudible) doing what I like is having a little bit of time ... spending time with people. (Inaudible) failure or something like that ... but failure I don't like to use but I just - I won't be able to get a job or (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it's not that - that whatever thing you're experiencing isn't - isn't satisfying like (inaudible). It's more like you don't check in terms of that. You're checking in terms of ... the future (inaudible) of your life or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in terms in that it seems like you - the thing you're in moving you towards something you don't want. (0:42:37.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I sort of get is mostly at the same time (inaudible) and ... I don't know. I really fear ... that when I try to be ... when I try to be less guilty about not spending and going out and going places with people, I really count on (inaudible). You should be studying or something like this. You should be - bringing up your grades and this sort of thing because ... well it's - like I said failure before - gonna end up in those words because it's just the way the world is structured that if you don't have a degree, if you're (inaudible) recommendation and stuff from past teachers that ... you just can't get a job and so forth. When you go to get a job a lot of what they look at is your past. It's not ... you know it's just not that ... not that you're willing to work and they want to see ... (inaudible) and ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you go to that instead of studying, you think ... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just tips the scales in the wrong direction or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I think I've gotten past that. I think I did that for a while. That's a - sooner or later we go (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ... it's just - just so sort of a trait. At one time I felt bad about going to the movies. I should study. But now I just tell myself there's no point in trying to study if you're unhappy and you've got to and you really don't want to study and you really want to see this movie. You won't get anything done anyhow (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't have so much problem with the flexibility thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's - well more than what we should (inaudible) something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because (inaudible). (0:45:35.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just that all I do is go to the movies which ... I ... try and turn into - interact with other people. And it's - that's not really ... interacting with people going to the movies because there's other people (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's more like (inaudible). Just taking the time to talk to people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a thing you started building and doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I still have doubts and I don't know how to do it either. I mean I tend to think ... think that I'm sending a lot of signals sometimes puts people off. You know like even though there was no harm intended by me and ...you know even - even if I was like - after saying something realized like I said (inaudible) like I didn't - like I didn't mean it like that. And if it feels good, you're not quite convinced. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If they don't believe you, you messed up (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I mean I say that (inaudible) meant that (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stumbling over yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess we probably have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to ask you how about this conversation, do you think there's anything in it that you want to hold onto that you worried about using and what - what was it like to be in it? Was it (inaudible) in any way? (0:47:42.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was really confused.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To whom? </p>

<p>PATIENT: To me. I don't think I was making a lot of sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible). You couldn't figure out what you were talking to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I kept on making little scratches all over the place. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I mean is did it not make sense to me or is it - your communication aspect (inaudible) for both?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ... neither.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It didn't make sense to me that you had to (inaudible) thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A subject kind of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is so (inaudible) but it's more or less like (inaudible) and ... you know if I keep on trying I might be able to make more sense to myself but if I made more sense to myself then I'd probably make more sense you know on your end. But.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But as it was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As it was - I don't know. I just don't think it was that coherent that ... I don't - I think it would be unreasonable maybe to express your perfect understanding ... well at least I'm satisfied with it but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it didn't - I didn't - I don't know if it would become a good theme or something like that but I thought was (inaudible) maybe one thing to - it would be good if when you think that maybe I don't understand you ask or and I'll make a (inaudible) to that with a check off of what I'm not sure I understand and that might -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something (inaudible). I think I generally do that too when I don't understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) and that's just sort of the problem of and I'm more interested in - in your understanding than my under -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. How much (inaudible) you even want to put on this claim.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I always thought my train of thought was - I feel like I should.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But (inaudible) when you have a - have a - when you want to (inaudible). Sometimes you might not want to stop if you can say that and say just going ahead. That would be cool too. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll see you Wednesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great. Bye.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye.</p>

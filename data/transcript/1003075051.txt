<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, sorry.  So, uh, now that we turned it on you were saying, you're [AGE] —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, if, I've always, my mom always thought I've had it since I was young.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  I, that is what I understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is why he sent you, but, I, but, I was wondering if you had seen [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] prior to being on probation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no, no, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I thought, I thought you were saying, I thought you said something else altogether.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So, right now you are on probation, and, what was that for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it was for larceny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, with, what, you were a bank teller, is that it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many years ago was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was, like, five years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and when did you first see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just saw him —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, I got you, so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was wait, I, I waited a long time.  They had me in, uh, I'd waited a long time before I even went to court, and all that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It has been a long gap.  I waited, and, I mean, I cooperated with them all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I didn't leave the city, or anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just had to wait.  I waited and waited.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For them to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I got you.  Are you on any meds right now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, and, you're on no medications —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And, um, uh, in terms of Attention Deficit Disorder, some of your kids have it, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I know one, okay, wait.  I think my other one might have it, my little one, but he is so young I can't tell, but, but, my [AGE] has it.  And, I think his has gotten severe through the years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Does he have medication?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he is on Adderall, and I've been through, I've been through doctors with him, trying to get it, like, every time we, we get the dose right —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It seems to, I don't, if he just, growth, or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes, how old is, I mean, how much, uh, Adderall is he on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He is on, four, 35, or, wait, is it 40?  I think it is 40 right now, 40.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Once a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is with the XR.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  The, do you notice it, helpful?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me, like, when he is off of it, what is he, what is he like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, he doesn't listen.  Um, I find myself having to tell him over and over again, he, he, he is mouthy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about in school, is he —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I mean, his teachers, they can't do anything with him if he doesn't, if we don't send him medicated, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And, and when he is on meds, what is he like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He, he is, he is, slows him down.  He, like if he is watching something on TV, I mean, he will actually, you know, he will really get into it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or, I mean, homework will get done better.  I mean, it is like, he doesn't, he is just very naughty when he is not —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  And, um, any of, you mentioned the very youngest, or the [AGE], or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, my daughter was, um, he said he thought, because of my young, like, my young, my first one that has it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He notices, in the middle of the night, he will get up, move, get up, move, I mean he is constantly moving in his sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, my other child does, is starting to do the same stuff he did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum, well, we will just have to see over time.  What about, um, do you have brothers and sisters?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have, um, one, I have two brothers, one whole brother, and one half.  I mean, they don't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They don't have it.  But, a lot of my cousins, like my dad's family.  And, we have autism in our family, a couple people ADHD, I mean, there is a variety of —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But your brothers don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, my brothers don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, how about when you were in school, what was, what was it like growing up with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I know I struggled.  I could never really pay attention long enough and my grades weren't as good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, my mom said, she said, now she wishes, uh, she would have had me, um, would have seen a doctor when, we need, you know, some medication.  My dad was against it and my grandparents —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Didn't agree with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Were you able, what sort of grades did you get?  I mean, how much schooling did you get?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I completed school, diploma.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> High school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Did you go to college at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I went to [DEIDENTIFIED] for a nursing assistant program for a couple  months, but, uh, I kind, now, looking back, I wish I would have take college, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Okay, um, I mean, what sort of grades did you get at, in nurse school and stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, Cs, Ds.  I mean, my brother, on the other hand, he had As and Bs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That must have been kind of frustrating.  Do you think you had trouble concentrating and focusing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I, I did.  I know I did because there was times, like, I would start reading a book —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I would just, it would just, I couldn't do it anymore.  I just couldn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But were you able to sit and complete tasks, I mean, well, how about —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel, I feel like I, like I, every time I try to do something, I feel distracted and start another thing.  And, I know I'm, I'm, my mind, like I'll do something here and then I'll have to, I won't finish here and I'll start something else and I'll do that and not complete it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Um, okay.  Had you, um, okay, and then, but you were able to have a job as a bank teller.  How many years did you have that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, about three and a half years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And how were you [INAUDIBLE] getting in trouble?  I mean, were you able to do the job?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think I, I think I was.  I mean, it was a very small, small branch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, real small.  I mean, sometimes it was dead there, so, I mean, you would find things to do around there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and then what happened, you started to, how did you end up taking money from them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I got myself into a gambling problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, I just, I, I don't know, and I, I wasn't going to go, you know, I just get —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Too consumed with [DEIDENTIFIED].  That is why I just don't go there at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I have seen, um, seen people from the post office, I've seen people from all over referred through probation because they got in trouble with gambling and they started embezzling —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> From companies, uh, you know, that had no history.  I take it you didn't have a legal history —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Beforehand.  So, you're staying away from the gambling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm surprised they let that place stay here, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it, it really is, um, it causes a lot of problems.  All right, um, well, and now you still find yourself not being able to kind of complete tasks, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.  I, uh, like, at home, I'll start cleaning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll try to vacuum, and then do something else.  I just, I, I wish I could just complete something before I do something else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Is your house in disarray?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Now it, I mean, every time I try to clean up, I mean, I have kids, too, though so, I mean, that is not healthy there —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because every time I do try to clean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They make a mess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Man, they make a mess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I can understand that.  Um, have, answer me honestly, I mean, have you ever tried your kids' Adderall, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I actually have, I'm scared, I'm scared to because it is not —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Diagnosed in, I mean, what if, what if something happened, you know?  I did, I wondered if I did —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wanted to, and plus, his dose isn't probably —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, he has got, he has got a fair dose.  I mean, sometimes adults often don't need, you know, I mean, you can't compare the two, but —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, they said if you don't, I heard if you don't have ADHD —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That it will speed you up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Other than help you slow down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, right, it will have sort of a different effect, exactly.  Well, let me ask, uh, your history of, like, uh, do you drink alcohol?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And drugs in your past?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you've never taken cocaine or things like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I, I tried marijuana when I was in high school, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, okay.  Um, and you've never seen a psychiatrist or therapist before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, and you've never taken this, because a lot of times I have people who say, yeah, well, when I took it, I, you know, it felt different.  Um, does alcoholism run in the family at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I'm trying to think.  I mean, I'm not alcoholic because I don't even like it, but, like, my mom and dad, they don't drink.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying to think.  I think my mom's dad, in the past, maybe when, like, he was, like, in his 40s, maybe he got into an alcoholic, alcohol problem, but, I, I, I could be mistaken too, but, I think I heard that he did get into drinking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Do you have any medical problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, being overweight, that is about all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.  Has that been for a long time, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> After, well, I've never been this overweight until after I had, started on, like, when I had my first child.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It seemed like it just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> After, you know, I can never get it off.  And, that, you know, I do try to sometimes diet, but it seems like it doesn't work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, what do you use for birth control now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I don't.  I'm, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tubes tied?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My tubes are tied, I mean, tubal ligation, whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you don't need another kid —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What does your boyfriend do for a living?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, he doesn't do anything.  He is, um, he is schizophrenic and, uh, he is paranoid schizophrenic and it affects him in the head so he can't work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He is on disability.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you on disability too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, all your income comes through him, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, right now, I got, see, I got laid off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was working, like, um, 51 hours a week —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For, like, a while, and then, um, when I got back from my maternity leave, they gave me the bad news that, see, they cut, like, 55 people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was one of the people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where were you working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what were you doing there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I was doing wax injection, and then I was assembling, at the time right before I was assembling, I was assembling wax product pieces together and stuff, molds —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how long did you have that job for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, six months.  And, I mean, the pay was really good.  I loved, I mean, I really loved working there, and it just was unfortunate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Was it the same, doing the same thing constantly, like, over and over, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is, like, work, but it was repetitive —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, they give you different things to do.  Like, my dad, he is in the offices there, I mean, he is, he is the cost accountant there.  So, he got me, he got me in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, he is still there.  He, he is, if —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He, he won't be laid off, but, like, a lot of the, a lot of the [INAUDIBLE] were, and I was happy to be one of them, type as what I had, six months in on it?  But, it was actually a good paying job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  And, um, but, you were able to focus and do that sort of job?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah.  It got frustrating repeating stuff, but then they gave you new patterns, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I found myself, like, slouching and stuck in positions like, ah —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let us go back, with your child, like, in school, when you were, did you have trouble waiting your turn in line?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying to think.  Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Were you in trouble a lot with the teachers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Trouble, no, I wasn't in trouble.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Were you able to complete the tasks, though, as a little kid, you know, in school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or, do you recall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know I, I know rushed through things.  I know that part.  Um, I'm trying to think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you know what the teachers would say about you to your parents?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know what they said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  But, I know, like, I found myself, like, impatient a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, I get really frustrated, like, if I have to wait too long, even in, in a car.  I mean, like waiting, um, at a light, if it is taking too long I find myself wanting to pull my hair out because it is just, it is just how, like sitting.  Well, maybe that is, is that everybody?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it depends.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It gets frustrating, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, how has your sleep been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it has been okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it has been okay too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Too good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Too good, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Energy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I think, yeah, I do have enough energy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do have enough energy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, depressed feelings, crying spells?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Easily angered?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I do get angry easy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I don't, I know how to control, like, um, if I get mad, I, know, like, not to go blowing out, because you go to jail for it or, you know, get yourself into trouble, but I do get angry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you know, what is your weight right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, two, it was, like 250.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You think that is what it is right now?  Have you weighed yourself recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, when I got, I was 240 when I left the house, when I know I gained weight, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> From that pregnancy, you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean, I actually lost weight, now I gained a lot back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, sure.  How tall are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, 5'2".</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, well, and, you were saying your mother was also suggesting that you might have Attention Deficit Disorder?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that what you said?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, my, my mom, well, my mom said in school she thought I had the ADHD.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, um, when did she say that to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, recent, well, in the last couple years she said, you know, she said, "I, I always thought you had ADHD when you were in school, and I, and I wanted to take you and get you checked for it but your dad didn't think we should put you on meds."  And, my dad was like, if he can, if he expressed his self when I tried putting my son on meds, like, no.  But, I mean, my dad saw the effect of the meds and he totally agrees with it now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, uh, we don't have like a definitive test for Attention Deficit.  It is, you know, more a cancellation of, uh, symptoms.  Uh, but, I've certainly seen a lot of people who, uh, seem to do very well when you treat it.  And that they are able to focus a lot better or achieve things, their mood, I mean, they interact better, just everything gets more organized, and, uh, the stimulant medications like Adderall, so, they are sort of like the first dose is like the 50th dose so that, I mean, you probably, I don't know, do you, do you give your son any drug holidays or just take it every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I try being, well, I try being nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that, and he is, we get complaints, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Around the neighborhood, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it is, I'm just saying that, that when you take it, it is there, and when you don't take it, it is not, and it is not like you have build up a level that kind of works right away, so, we could actually, my thought would be to try Adderall with you, and, get started, and try it for short period of time and then reassess how it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, unfortunately, I'm going to be out of town for, after the weekend, for two weeks.  Um, but we could try it for two weeks.  Um, let me get you my computer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you do the extended release?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, I know that when I try doing my son, I mean, we had to break it down into, uh, morning, afternoon.  That was frustrating —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, um, school, we would have to give pills to school.  I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is for me, but, it was just frustrating having to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, I do give the extended release.  That is a good thing, so, all right, new patient.  Uh, release, and it is [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, what is your date of birth?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, [DATE].  Do you have, like, openings for patients, new patients?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'm really not taking new —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> People.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is your zip code?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now, I'm, I'm, I sort of do this, I do a lot of inpatients, and I do some geriatric work but I'm really not taking new people right now.  Um, I know it is tough to find a —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, uh, my, uh, fiancee, he was seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For the longest.  And then, um, he had, he got sick and we called, and he happened to have one more no show, or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not a no show, like, call in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, they dropped him.  So, I got to find a psychiatrist, help him find one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could try Healthcare for the Homeless, they see people.  It is right on [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, I'll call over there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They have some good doctors there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do they take United Healthcare, or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I'm sure they do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He, he hasn't had any healthcare through an HMO, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, through State SSI.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'm sure they do.  Now, Adderall, um, XR, I mean, does your son take more than 1 tablet a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he just takes, oh, actually, he does.  He, they broke it into 2 tablets.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Like a 20 and 20, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They give him a 10 and a 30 —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because the, something with, um, the company that, I think it has to do with, uh, United Health Care.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it doesn't come in a 40, the 30 —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is the highest dose.  My thought would be to start with you with the 20 mg, and maybe we could try it for a little bit, like, um, for a week, and, and you can then even increase it to 2 tabs, if you, I mean, if it works great at 20, fine, but if not, you could try 2 tabs and see how it goes.  And if 2 tabs seems strong, um, so, I'm going to say, um, it will say 1 tab, you know, first thing in the morning, but, um, what I'd like you to do is try it, Adderall XR, 20 mg, 1 tablet in a.m., you know, for one week, then try 2 tablets in the morning, um, you know, to see if it works better.  And, if you would like 1, you can stick with the 1.  But, I will give you a 30 of them —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, that will keep you until I see you again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I know, um, through United Health Care —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They always have a pre—authorization —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think probation will pay for this.  Do you have insurance through United Health Care?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know how that works.  How do I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're being referred through probation, so, it is, I think they are going to cover it for right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where do I get that covered, where do I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Through the pharmacy here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get, oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I might give you the, it comes in a generic, so, is that what your son takes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm, he was always taking the right one and I think they just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Switched him to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They just, yeah, they just started doing generic —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> On that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you noticed a difference with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No, there is no difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Sometimes people complain about it.  I'm not sure what to say about that.  Okay.  And, I mean, if you really hate it, I mean from, like, the first dose, "Ah, it makes me feel horrible," just stop it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but why don't we meet when I come back and, um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Going on a trip?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Going to be, yeah, out of, actually, in Europe for two weeks, so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That is cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  And, you're at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Is that a home number?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, cell phone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, I'm going to be back the week of the [DATE].  What if we met at, um, Monday [DATE] at 1:00, 12:45?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, give you a card.  [DATE], I'll just write that down here too.  Where did you park?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I parked on the street.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that is okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, then, uh, where I wasn't supposed to park, because I think you pay for it there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It costs a dollar if you park in the parking structure here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, let me give you this for a follow up.  So, again, take it for a week, here is my directions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and then try increasing it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you prefer the one, or if you prefer none —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, let me show you where the pharmacy is.  It is, um, did you park right over here, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no, like, when you go out, it is way down the street.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay, well —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where do I have to go?</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not too bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have an interview tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. So I'll be interviewing with the flagship store downtown, so that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just been, like I said, just...I really want to make this move. All of my management seems to think that I'm perfectly, ya know...they, they think that I'm extremely good candidate, etcetera, etcetera, ya know. They're talking like I am moving, but last time they did the same thing and so I'm like uhh, so we'll see. I hope so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really...first of all I am insanely broke and so I need the money from full time even if it's trading my ability to move around...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but also just (sighs) just need to, ya know, stop the long commute, so (pause) but (pause) oh gosh (sighs) (pause). One of the things that I wanted to talk about is that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um, a few times back when I was talking about feeling very, um, vulnerable in certain situations and like ya know when getting feedback sort of taking it in and sort of, um, taking what they say as being truth. That kind of thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I'm gonna do it. Okay. When you mentioned that you seemed concerned about that, that made me never want to say to you ever again. (deep breath, laughs) It's really hard for me to say that that way, but yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I appreciate your saying that. [00:01:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't necessarily know if that means...like specifically I don't...I'm trying to force that to make sure I don't do that, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow. Let me make sure that I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, the sort of what you were talking about was (pause) um, getting feedback from people at work or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm, someone made a playful comment that I took a lot more than it needed to be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, about you being narcissistic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? And I seemed concerned about the effect of people making those kind...the effects of your taking in those kind of comments as though they were true...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and my concern about it made you never want to talk about it again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not so much about it, but not want to put myself in a situation where I could (pause)...yeah, more or less.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, and then you have now bravely told me...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. You can understand that I'm doing a lot of bravery in most of what I do here. [00:03:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I, uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually I'd be like okay, so that's where the borderline of our relationship or whatever if it was like a friend or something like that, they said that. But I'm not gonna say anything any more about it, cuz it's obviously, ya know...and in general that is a habit of mine and therefore I just felt like I needed to bring attention to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's a gutsy thing to do on top of a gutsy thing you did before, so...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...um, and not just gutsy but not how you'd usually be. I don't mean you're not usually brave, I just mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's...this is not my comfort zone. I'm usually brave about...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...the things that most people are not...I'm normally the opposite of most people. The things that would make somebody nervous doesn't bother me at all and vice versa.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, okay, I guess one thing that would probably be difficult for me to understand is sort of the way in which I expressed concern...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and how that put you off talking about what we were talking about. Am I making sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's nothing to do with you. It's all me. It's just whenever I feel as I have disappointed somebody or done something to make somebody think possibly negatively about me, I tend to want to be like okay, not going to go there any more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So your impression was...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was all instinct. It really was not a whole lot of...I mean and I'm a person that spends a lot of time on rational thought. That's the reason why I'm immediately doubting myself on this because it's...yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow, boy I think I screwed something up by talking about this and ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it, uh, I'm aware that you're saying it was not me but I guess I'm interested to know (pause)...I don't remember real clearly how I expressed concern. [00:05:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't really even...I don't remember a whole lot myself either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it...was there a particular comment or was it more like just how I seemed or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know to be honest. I don't remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The only thing I remember is boy oh boy I didn't want to...I didn't want to...okay so (chuckles)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I should probably explain this to you, so I'll explain it to you. I have a friend who's really loopy and, um, she would say something along the lines of...she makes jokes about the voices in her head a lot. She doesn't really have voices in her head, but she calls it, um, vaccinating people so that when she actually talks about her real problems that she seems so much more normal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she'd be like, so like, so basically she would be like...and she would talk about like the equivalent of problems like, like problems like as in like I can't figure out where to put the sofa or is it voices in my head problems. And like, like she would make jokes about that kind of thing. Like where you...the things you cannot undo. And I thought to myself this is a lot of like what Penny would say for this kind of stuff. Like you can't undo saying these kinds of things about like feeling this way, about feeling like this, um, vulnerable...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and so it made me think of her cuz she would talk about that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, not really...it would be like, like things you can't unsay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right (chuckles), but we...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You'll never be embarrassed about saying I can't figure out which way I want to sit the sofa in the house, but yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. It's like a bell you can't unring. [00:07:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, exactly. And so, um, it is something where I'm really uncomfortable about it but I decided that I'm just going to talk about it. Um, I do not know if the fact that I'm going kind of rational on it is good, bad, indifferent, ya know. Um, I sort of unfortunately occasionally get...more with my husband but occasionally get jerky with people when I am overwhelmed by the emotion of what I'm hearing and I start immediately saying okay, so I need to break this down. Why are you calling me? Or, ya know, that, that kind of thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I'm worried that I may be taking this a little bit too, ya know, rationally. I don't know. But I have just decided that if it feels that bad and it was that ridiculous I should probably talk about it, so...I don't really remember much about the conversation. All I remember is that I came away going boy, I shouldn't talk about like my, ya know, my fears that are completely unfounded any more, ya know. And ya know what I mean? Like my fears...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...of what other people think about me and maybe it's true kind of true kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's a little like touching a hot stove, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...oww! Yeah, I'm not touching that again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I don't remember the actual touching, but I do remember the pain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um (pause) I guess I'm um, I'm sort of inclined to go back and say some things I remember about what I said and what we were talking about sort of for the purposes of understanding more clearly...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I do. I think that, like I said, it's a, it's a clash between fear and knowledge. I think I understand exactly...or not exactly...but I think I've got a good idea of when you were saying you're more concerned that I'm giving over my, ya know, my entire like belief of who I am to others. Like, ya know, or but I have to come back and say am I really a narcissist? I mean I'm not trusting my own instincts I think a little bit, but I don't really believe that. I mean time passes that. It's just I just don't (sighs)...I'm such a people pleaser in certain situations that I don't even want to disappoint my therapist, which is kind of embarrassing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It wouldn't make any sense except for the fact that we all do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, uh, (pause) that's um (pause)...I'm not sure how clear this is already or how much of this you know about, but one of the ways that uh one of the sort of points of leverage in therapy involves precisely that sort of thing. The thing that feels like it doesn't make it sense to feel towards one's therapist for X, Y or Z reason, but one does feel anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:10:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We all have a lot of that stuff, and an image, though a tricky one about therapy in my opinion, is that that stuff sort of stands out more...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...in what can be a kind of excruciating way. Um (pause)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I usually am actually better at having these hard conversations and taking things well with people I don't know that well, ya know, than I do with people I do, and so this is sort of this weird hybrid...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and it's all one-sided. Like I can talk to people that I only see once a week and give them very hard news. Um, or give them things that may be very hard for me to say even like, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that this is not something I can do. That's something it's really in my comfort zone. Usually it's people that I know well that I can't do that to, and so um like I said it's sort of a weird overlap because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's, it's a different relationship, so (pause) I don't know, but we'll see. Cuz I'm trying really hard. At least I think that the most important thing is at least I noticed it this time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As opposed to like (chuckles) I have had situations where someone made me feel like an idiot and therefore I never went back there again for something or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, okay...there are like (pause) a couple of points that I'm...I don't have the impression I'm quite as clear about the pain point there...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...as you, although I know that it, there was one in a pretty big way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it when I had said that (pause)...I think I said something about you like seeming to want some reassurance from me on this point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I was sort of on one hand happy to provide but on the other hand interested to point out given the consistency.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's part of when it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And I guess I could imagine some of what was painful about that was that you were already really putting yourself out there to tell me what had happened in the first place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I was pointing at it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Snorts).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and saying well I'm kinda going to help you, but I'm kinda just going to talk about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't see it as poignant as that, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay (chuckles).</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...maybe a little bit, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just making it obvious that it was hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um (pause) this is really hard and um (pause) uh (pause)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not necessarily trying to make a big deal about this. I just felt like I should say it. [00:15:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I appreciate it. I imagine you'd rather make a smaller deal about this (chuckles) as possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (continues chuckling) I can understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm also like I'm making it seem like it was a lot more...not just as big of a deal but also making it seem like it was a lot more important than it really was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just felt like it was something that I felt and I just wanted to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, put it back out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cuz I, ya know...I (pause) I don't run from vulnerability that often but occasionally I do, and um I don't want to do that any more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well as I say I appreciate that you brought it up and um (pause) uh (pause)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's humbling for me to know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Though I know it's not easy to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, it's hard for me to admit that I have wants, needs, feelings, that kind of thing. Even sometimes positive ones because I've gotten over the years saying that you're a little bit high strung and this I'm like oh, fuck! So how in the world am I supposed to be now, ya know? I want to, by the way, point out that I actually swore maybe once every few months before I came in here, and now this is the most swearing I've ever done ever is in this room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's kind of weird (snorts)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (chuckles).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not like it's a bad thing. It's not like it's a Puritan thing. It's just, I was raised like ya know find better words. Ya know there are a lot more words that are much more interesting that you could say. But, no, I just, yeah. Um, but it's just...sometimes it's really hard for me in certain situations and I...it's usually things that don't really matter. It's never anything big. I've never really, like I said it's the, it's the small things, ya know. It's the, ya know, getting treated poorly in like a store and decide to cut and run and decide never to go in there again kind of thing, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:17:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, that, that was, ya know, something that ya know. It's only happened once or twice in my life but because of the fact that it did, it's memorable, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, ya know. For the most part, though, it's, it's...I, I...it's all of the things...to me I feel like it's mapped weird. Like the things that people would be normally very nervous about doing are the things that I have no fear of whatsoever and vice versa...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and it's kind of weird, ya know? So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like whereas somebody else might have trouble, ya know, sort of approaching somebody out of nowhere about a job or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or just, just...I mean jobs, ideas, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, ya know things that involve very high profile. Things where people would feel more nervous, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the kind of stuff that doesn't bother me at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've known that for a long time because I've been sort of...every so often someone reminds me that that's normal for an only child, but like, I'm like thanks, so I already thought I was unique, thanks. But, ya know, like being able to have relationships out of the blue with people who are in like a superior like organizations or randomly just talking to people. That kind of thing. Um, I don't know. I don't...whether or not that's true, I don't care. It's just who I am, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I just...yeah (sighs), so it's weird though because um as much as I am introverted I don't fear like social interaction at all, ya know? That doesn't really bother me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) which is probably for the best since I work with the public, ya know? But, but speaking of things like that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...kind of...my husband and I had a conversation yesterday because of this. Um, long story short, I ended up not wearing my wedding rings for a couple of days because of the fact that we were painting something and I got like primer all over me, all over things. I put them down somewhere and couldn't find them. Just didn't wear them. And at work...I don't understand because the last time when my dad came in to visit where I worked like last year and he wasn't wearing a wedding ring they all noticed that too. They are obsessed with who is wearing a wedding ring. The minute I, like I got this phrase and I didn't know that this actually...this was like the most immature phrase I've ever heard...did you break up with your husband? Break up? Like...like break up? What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like no, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible 00:20:41) yeah over text.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, over text. Like do I have to get my records back. I don't know. Um, ya know, and I like at the time like I had people like asking me do, like doing things. Like other people, like immediately like the 2, 3 days that this happened, people were asking oh, do you want to go do this? Do you want to do that? Both male and female. Like, ya know, one of the guys where who is not interested in women in general, though, made a joke about like asking me if I was back on the market, ya know, this and that so he could go down and I'm like no, no I'm not interested in that. That kind of thing. But, um, I had mentioned it to him just because I thought it was funny and, um, weird. Cuz like the weird thing was is that specifically I was asked to go out even with a mixed group of people to go drinking and apparently he likes bowling. Bowling is big up here. Like I can't lift things. I don't know. In (inaudible at 00:21:36) apparently bowling's big. That's in Salem and (inaudible at 00:21:45) are next to each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. To go drinking and bowling or something like that with a bunch of people. I'm like this is kind of weird. Like, I've been asked to go do things but I have never been asked to do so many things as I have in the 3 days of not wearing my wedding ring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not all the same people mentioned the same things together, but I've got a feeling that people, ya know...it's kinda weird. And he um...and I was actually pretty good about talking about that kind of thing, and um, we were talking about this and he at first admitted that...he was trying to say he wasn't all that jealous because, ya know, the first day of it was mostly good natured, but he actually did mention the fact that he was feeling a little bit jealous about the fact that, ya know, that like...it was very interesting having this conversation. And I'm like you know that that's not like a big...this is not what it's about...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and we understand that there's no like jealousy like that. But it, it is definitely um something we talked about, the fact that um the hypervigilance of not all of the people in the store but of the repair group in the store on whether or not I'm wearing a wedding ring, which is bizarre. Um, and talking about that. Cuz it's something that um I don't necessarily think we've ever really talked about. I mean I've been, like I spent my entire life around men and it's never been like a, a big deal but I mean it's been like 14 years since like, ya know, that kind of stuff happened. Other than the occasional like I work on some weird holiday weekend and I get asked out by a customer or something like that, but nothing big, like never like that, and it was very awkward talking about it. At first it was like wow, this is a strange phenomenon, and then it became like a, like ya know, having a conversation with my spouse about trying to figure out like if they're all trying to figure out if I'm available, which is to me extremely bizarre and immature because if I did, I wouldn't be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you broke up with your husband last week, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Broke up with my husband last week, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're back on the market this week. [00:23:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm definitely going out drinking and looking for a boyfriend, really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so first of all it's such a bizarre thing, but it definitely shows how much younger they are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And even the ones who are not young are mentally that way. Um, but yet at the same time I mean it was very weird and like I said (pause) not uncomfortable but possibly one of the weirder conversations we've had. Um because it's just not something that really, ya know, comes up all that much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but yeah that was kind of an awkward situation and uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it, uh, a little nice and reassuring that he was jealous?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it was more like wow! I don't think you've ever had a jealous bone in your body before. Like I lived in a fraternity and you had no jealous bone in your body.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know. Over the summer most fraternities like they open up the rooms to rent...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that kind of thing, ya know. But like it was weird, ya know. Not necessarily reassuring. Um, in no way do I have the mental fantasy of oh, if he thinks that something's better going to come around, he's going to clean up his act. At no point do I actually ever entertain that, cuz first of all it doesn't work that way. If threats worked, it would have worked a long time ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, ya know. But also just it's just not the way I think about it. But it mostly to me was really interesting because of the fact that he has had so much going on with this therapy and he's like going through a lot of different emotional things that I don't necessarily know if the jealousy thing was because he was secure as much as the fact that he didn't know he was allowed to be jealous of anybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so. Yeah, like, um in the past if he felt um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most men would be okay...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...it was okay to have a feeling like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He might have had it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Might of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might not be that he doesn't happen to be a jealous person at all, it might be that he sort of doesn't feel licensed to actually have feelings about things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:26:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was one of the things I actually really...and I know I can't pick and choose that kind of stuff and I know this just like a singular incident...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but it was actually one of the things I thought was really refreshing was the fact that he knew that I worked with a lot of men, and you know I had a lot of relationships with people that were very close to me and that he had no jealousy whatsoever. That was great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and so it's an awkward thing to go wow! So you've learned a new...like so you've recently learned road rage and you've learned jealousy (chuckles)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and...we think the medication they have him on is wrong, is wrong. Like he, he's getting like road rage all the time now. It could also just be the drivers, I don't know. But he's getting very angry a lot. But yeah, nothing like hurt anybody, just like yelling at the car in front of him. Saying you're going the wrong way on the wrong side of the...you know that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He never yelled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We've never had an argument...ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! Not like a raise-your-voice kind of argument. Never, never. Um, we had disagreements and sometimes they couldn't be resolved. I mean it took 15 years for us to agree on a couch. Um, like but normally that was...the reason why I mentioned this one is that was especially outstanding. We point out this that the reason why we came to our house we only had chairs is because neither one of us could agree on couches. And so like, but not like we've never had arguments...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and so it's very weird to see this evolving in sort of it's own right, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:28:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, we'll (pause)...I just said I can't pick and choose what happens...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but I do...I mean I want him whole, and if it's things that I miss, then the things that I miss, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um I can't imagine anything's gonna go that far out of control. Um, but it's just, like I said, it's just interesting to see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Boy I really wish with this evolution, though, that somehow somewhere he could just (whispers) he could just stop looking at pornography. (laughs) I just don't know if it's ever gonna end...at this point I just don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We had a moment in that he told me the truth the first time I asked sometime last week. I mean that's not the first time, but it's been a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Normally it becomes like a (pause) ya know (pause) it has become so screwed up, because I don't really want to know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I kinda want to know because sometimes...the number one reason why I want to know is cuz I don't want it to creep up on me when I least expect it and hurt me. It's easier to know now when my mood is neutral than when something else is happening. Um, I think that that is probably the number one reason...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that the lying bothers me. The acting out bothers me too, but that's just...I mean part of it's jealousy, part of it's (pause) I'm an researcher so I think of things in terms of productivity...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...if he could just get back some of that time what in the world could be done with it. It is just mind blowing. I have...part of it's the fact that, ya know, he's um spacy afterwards, ya know. Doesn't always...he's just is a different person, very altered.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's kind of...he's not the person that I know. Let's just put it that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's so...if I didn't know better I would totally think this is like made up, but he has a different gait. He is more clumsy. He is more...I mean more oblivious about everything. He could be hit by a car not that long afterwards. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds, um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like to not walk around without shoes on if he's been acting out, which sounds strange but he's so...like if he's wearing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying this to diagnose him...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but it, it sounds like maybe he's a little dissociated...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's not quite himself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The words he uses, the type of things that happen...yeah. It's very different. Different human being.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Different cadence. When I've told this to his family, they've looked at me like I was nuts, and I've only had a couple of people I've known in my life who truly see it and get it, and they...it's interesting cuz the only other person that really truly understood it had a spouse who had migraines and they said that when they were on their migraine medicine they were like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently like I guess it's like Lyrica...or it's something, some sort of neurological thing that make you foggy and apparently does make personality changes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. Yeah, I mean some of the, um, migraine medications are also mood-stabilizing drugs...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...so maybe psychoactive that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the other place where you see a lot of that is obviously the people who have trauma histories. Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And who, um, uh, you know can seem a bit like different people than usual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Really, really. Especially if something's like...and that's the funny thing is, is that I mean that's what I have felt in my heart for years and years and years...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but felt like I couldn't say it because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it...first of all bells can't be unrung...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and if it's...I don't want to accuse anybody or anything of something that is a wrongdoing that was not wrong done...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but also I don't have any evidence. You know why? They didn't give a damn enough to actually have any evidence, ya know? In terms of like there was something wrongdoing done, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So wait. What you're speculating about is...[ 00:32:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that there...I don't know. There was some sort of abuse. Maybe neglect. I felt in my heart maybe he was sexually abused.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's a fair amount of circumstantial evidence. I mean his sexual addiction...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't remember anything before 17, and he has kind of spacing out of it sometimes. Um, (pause) uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when he spends time around his family he gets exactly the way that it used to be like in terms of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he also sought out abusive relationships prior to me too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he...the only one I really know a whole lot about is um is...well I know that he did a couple of things he shouldn't have. But the one I really know about is Chastity, his ex. His ex drives me nuts. She's...yeah. She's not real bright in the head, but she strung him along and did all these kinds of things and (pause) she screwed with his head quite a bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was only interested in him when other people were interested in him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of thing. Like she was only interested in sleeping with him after he met me...and they knew each other since they were 12. It was like this on-again, off-again...also wildly inappropriate in that she slept over at his house like in high school and elementary...not elementary but junior high school...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, I'm...maybe I'm saying that and saying that there's something wrong with that, but I mean technically with my best friend in childhood I did the same thing, but I had a separate bedroom on a separate floor that I would stay with and I was supervised. It was very different, ya know. It was more like staying over at a friend's house so that my parents could get a night off...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...than like...and he was never a boyfriend. Bryant...we are...we've often said we were fraternal twins separated by 3 months and 2 parents, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We are very much, ya know, not like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, but at the same time like it's like well how can I accuse like that being a problem when you slept over at somebody's house. And like this was a very different thing. This, you were in a relationship with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, yeah. He did a couple of really impulsive things in his youth that kind of weird me out. I don't really think about it all that much, but they do...like for example he fooled around with his best friend's girlfriend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean things like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Like sexually acting out a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and the...ya know it, it just seems kind of like I said weird, ya know, and then it was over. It wasn't like a relationship. It was just like well that's something that happened and it was over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was extremely open with me about that, and that's fine. I mean I, I...I've never wanted to...first of all things that happened in the past I have never wanted to like get upset. I mean maybe if he told me he killed his pet I might be like upset with him...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:35:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but like...we all do stupid things when we're young. Most of mine involved fireworks but (snorts)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but we all do stupid things when we're young...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like, ya know, you have that...like you can say well my brain wasn't fully formed and therefore I made stupid decisions. That's why we don't vote. That's why we don't do all kinds of things when we're young, but ya know when looking at these things in the aggregate, they really do show something really, really creepy and weird ya know? In general, though, his family made fun of him when he dated girls. I think I've told you that his mom really wanted him to grow up gay. Um, I'm not really sure if she understood exactly what that meant, but I think that she had it in her head like a movie-related thing in her...not like a real understanding. This was Kentucky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, which I mean isn't...it was not especially socially open as much, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but I think that there's a lot of things going on there that, ya know, says that something went wrong. I don't know where. I don't have a person I can point to. I think he was abused. I think...I know he was neglected. I mean no one will admit it, but I know he was neglected. I just think that something bad happened. It seems like the only thing that, that makes sense. And I don't want to be like right...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but unfortunately this is one of those things where it's not that it...I can never be proven wrong, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't like that. I really wish they could find some resolution. Say okay, I want to be able to put it to rest my feelings about that, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you might uh, be really proved wrong but...[ 00:37:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not even insisting or saying it was member of the family, he spent a lot of time by himself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like he's, uh, pretty engaged with the therapy if he's sort of seeing some of the kinds of changes you're talking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It goes up and down. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess where I'm going, though, is to say that he may start to remember at some point. I mean that does...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...happen. Oh yeah. Absolutely. Like, uh, if he started to remember it probably wouldn't be first about any abuse that happened...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but, yeah, people absolutely start to fill in more about their childhoods as they kind of ya know continue in therapy. I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that's not the only thing that can help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that hearing about our nephew more and more also, um, is helping him fill in at least some of the blanks in seeing the behavior.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:38:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which sounds weird but like he was talking on the phone with his best friend Rowland. Rowland is by the way Mike's memory. Everything that I know about his childhood comes from Rowland. And Rowland's like of course Nicole isn't going to ever apologize to you. She has a small Mike and the period of time that she liked him best in her own household. He's like the time that she liked you best...you know, because he knew her growing up...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...liked you best is when you were 8 years old or at that point where she could control you, and she's already got a miniature Mike sitting in the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's never gonna make it, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and she's already reconstructing...he...unfortunately he also likes to be a little bit more dramatic about this cuz he was dragged into this in terrible ways, ya know. He was considered to be a bad influence and all that stuff. By the way he was in Newsweek recently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh that's awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He is one of the only like lead certified companies that does blah, blah, ya know, that he started.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He is not a bad influence at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, oh, I see your point, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's not...he's...he is...he does not have like a more money than sense, does not have like a ya know poor work ethic or anything like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's not a playboy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So all of these things are unfounded and so that's, ya know. That's nice. It's reassuring to get it from...that's the only person I get it from that his family's crazy, but he definitely, he's got a knee jerk reaction to them cuz they told him terrible things about himself when he was a kid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sound vaguely familiar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. So, um, mostly told him things about his parents that were terrible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was told that his dad was running around when he wasn't, or he was probably running around because he had a Peter Pan complex. He was 7, didn't know what a Peter Pan complex was, that kind of thing. Anyway, the point, though, is, is that I think that hearing about how basically his nephew that we are completely held, ya know...we have nothing to do with right now is doing the same things he did as a child I think might help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems like he's (sighs) more empathic about that. I think that really the biggest resolution is seeing other relationships play out and it took...I mean it's taken years for them to see this. Relationships play out in his family that are diff...that the ones he was going through or ones being done to me, being done to somebody else...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and therefore he has some sort of perspective on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's hard because it's like, ya know if he had his druthers he would never call his mom and if his mom called, great. He wouldn't bring up anything. And so I sort of have to shove him towards this, and I don't really want to, but I think it's the right thing to do...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to push him on the telephone and to call her. Um, cuz otherwise none of this stuff is going to ever like be understood...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know? Um, I feel like in certain ways he has more of a mystery from his background than I do, and I have a very valid reason. Like when I go to the doctors occasionally they will ask me questions about like family history and because of my mom's side of the family, there's like these holes. You just didn't go to the hospital. The hospital is where you went to get TB.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So like, like knowing today when I have aches and pains...I have no idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know. I have huge holes in my life, like ya know in terms of that or like when people died before baptism like that wasn't a big...you didn't really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that wasn't really a per...not that it wasn't really a person but it wasn't like something you talked about in family war because it happened a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I feel like my holes in my life are big...are smaller than his.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And mine are pretty...like they are understandable knowing where the situation was cuz it was an oppressive regime but his was Arizona and Kentucky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like there's like no reason why he shouldn't know about things and ya know, about things going on in people's lives ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. [00:42:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I also, in terms of scheduling...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah...let's do the scheduling. I got my (inaudible at 00:43:12) so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Friday I think is what you were trying to do before if you still have it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um (sighs) let's see. (pause) Okay. Um, for this week...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...probably if it works for you the easiest thing for me would be like 4:30 on Thursday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. I'll just change that right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And then after that I will have I think a Friday time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I should probably let you know ahead of time that in July I'm gonna try and go home for my birthday and maybe dad's birthday so, so on the 21st 4:30?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me tell you ahead of time when um, when that's gonna be just so that you know that that time is open.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay...it's gonna likely be the 3rd...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and the...I guess it would be whatever Thursday or Friday it's gonna be because that's still flexible right now, but definitely the 3rd and possibly the 10th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So we're off on...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually let's make it the 3rd and the 10th because if I'm getting in, I'll be getting in in the middle of the night and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, we're not meeting on Tuesday the 3rd.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then whenever the other time is that week I assume we're not meeting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then the 10th we're not meeting. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cuz that's gonna...I'll be back in Cincinnati in theory at least.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It'll be nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then we'll um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we'll resume that Thursday, Friday, whatever...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...at that point so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great. I hope I'll have good news. [00:45:11]</p>

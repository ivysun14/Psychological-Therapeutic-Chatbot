<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence, Sigh) Well, I was, something just uhm, I don't think it adds anything new to the way I've been feeling today, but I just heard the woman talking that I had seen you laughing with one day.  And I suppose if it had been anybody else, I probably wouldn't have paid much attention.  Uhm, and she was just saying something to somebody about, I assume that she was still around, because she was trying to get some, something done on a book.</p>

<p>And uhm, th—, I, I don't know, the only reason why I think I'd pay attention after that, is just that today I seem to uhm, I don't know, i, it just seemed like it was quite a swing from the way I was feeling uhm, the end of last week.  And I know I had other swings last week, but after I was thinking about what we talked about on Friday, and (Sigh) you know, I don't know, I was just feeling very much that I did not want to let happen what could possibly happen.  And, you know, my letting MME take your place, or become more important than MSCZ, or become a problem that (Sigh) he didn't really have to become.</p>

<p>Or, I don't know, I left thinking about it.  And then, uhm, everything seemed to go pretty well for me, until uhm, w, we'd, went out with some friends Sa—, uhm, Friday night, and (Sigh) that was, you know, quite enjoyable, and there were certain occasions during the evening when I might have reacted in a very different way than I did.  But I don't know, I, I was quite relaxed through it, and uhm, then we went to visit the VKTs on Saturday.</p>

<p>And I don't know whether this is when it happened, but u—, you know, I suppose I should finish this, hearing about this person saying she was working on a book.  Because the feeling I had today, I think, was very much that I was doing nothing, and that I was nobody.  And I was very impatient with FSO, and uhm, I think she fussed more, as a result.  But as soon as she'd fuss at all, I would just find I could hardly stand it.  Uhm, and yet, I kept, you know, whenever I thought about the day, I would think of it as, I haven't done anything.  And it wasn't true, literally, but uhm, nothing that mattered, I suppose would be the way I feel about it.</p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, because this weekend, (Sigh) I didn't really enjoy myself, and I think it was partly because of the weather.  We couldn't do some things we would have otherwise done.  Uhm, but I ended up feeling as if I were just sort of hanging around all the time.  And since FYSI had a baby to be taking care of, and yet I was not doing the food preparation, I felt I should be available to help on any of those occasions, and that meant, you know, being aware when things were being done for a meal.  (Stomach growls)</p>

<p>And uhm, FYSI and MSXZ clearly did not want really want to go anywhere to do anything, but they wanted us to.  But yet, we couldn't just say in the morning, well, we're off here.  Uhm, it was just too short a time to work that out, that we would just say we'd be off for the day, or something.</p>

<p>So, uhm, that part was a little bit awkward.  But even there I don't think it would have really bothered me.  But something that was very much on my mind, uhm, you know, I realize even more so afterwards than I did at the time, was, it, we found out very quickly upon arriving, that this house belonged to a couple that they don't know very well at all.  But this couple's a friend of friends of theirs.  And the man is a (Sigh) an a, uhm, (Sigh) well, he's a psychiatrist, I think he's an analyst.  And so immediately I thought of you, and thought, what if it were you?  And even though I knew it couldn't be, b, because, uh, before I even knew his name, I knew that he was in PBV.  So I knew it couldn't be you.  But I kept thinking, what if it were you?  And uhm, after that I think you must have been more on my mind than I realized.</p>

<p>And uh, and then this morning, I had a dream — I had other dreams.  I had a dream that woke me up Saturday night, which, (Sigh) you know, was one of those dreams that seemed clear until I woke up.  And then I couldn't remember what it was, but I couldn't get back to sleep afterwards.  And then this morning I woke up having a dream that uhm, I think the situation changed once in the dream, but both times I was a man courting a woman.  And yet I somehow was the woman too, but not completely.  I was mainly the man.</p>

<p>And uh, at the end of the dream — you know, I don't think it would have been the end, except that FSOZ woke me up — uhm, I was being shot at.  So the suggestion was almost I was being shot at because I was courting this particular woman this time.  Before then, I'd been courting somebody and it had gone on and on and on.  And then, I don't know, why it changed.  Maybe I, FSOZ woke me up, and then I went to bed, and then started dreaming it again, I'm not sure.  But anyway (Clears throat) I did wake up and stop dreaming completely when I was courting this other woman.  Or maybe it was the same woman, but it was a somewhat different situation.  And uhm, I think I'd escaped being shot, but, you know, that was the end of the dream.</p>

<p>And I think the other thing was that my feelings for this woman in the dream were very sexual.  And I guess that's where I knew, you know, what the woman would be feeling, because of what response she might have.  But mainly, I was, I was the man.</p>

<p>And uhm, I think that's why I've been so upset today, having had a dream like that.  Although, you know, why did I have a dream like that?  What suddenly is, have I switched around again, to?  I mean, it just seems like I've switched completely around to wanting you in the old way, and wanting to be male, wanting a penis.  And uhm, feeling anything I do if I'm not male, or at least, you know, acting in some way that's a substitute for being a male, that, you know, won't be worthwhile.  And I don't know what would (Sigh) have suddenly thrown me around that way.  (Sniff, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Are you having any ideas about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, well, maybe it's because of this week being the last week.  But I don't know, I sort of reject that as uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I have an idea why.  See, last week we ended on Friday talking about uh, your frantic feeling then that you might have to try to replace me with MME.  And it's like in your dream you're telling me another kind of solution that you can think of.  That if you can't have me, you can become me.  And uh, make love to yourself.  So you can kind of do it yourself in your dreams.  If it can't really be true, you can dream it.  And if I won't do it, then you can imagine being a man and doing it to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, I suppose what, you know, sort of bothers me when I think about that, is that uhm, then it, I'm remembering that time a short while ago, when I wasn't feeling I wanted to hold on to you, or replace you with anybody.  Except, I suppose I wanted to replace you with MSCZ if, you know, put it in those terms.  Or at least I was, I wanted to uhm, be with MSCZ and to have a relationship with him, and it just didn't seem to go, in terms of replacing you with MSCZ.  And uh, you know, then I lost it, that kind of feeling.  Uhm — (Sigh, Sniff, Stomach rumbles, Pause)</p>

<p>I, I, I guess I'm wondering, did I ever really give up wanting to replace you in some kind of a way, (Sigh) and, and I hadn't faced it, because I hadn't really faced uhm, until Friday, what I might have been doing with MME.  And uhm, (Pause) well, a,a, and it, I don't know why I try to think, well, it has nothing to do with this being the last week, because I'm just so aware of time that it must have to.  But I don't know whether it's sort of like the last effort, and I'll stop trying once it's, time is up.  Or whether, you know, it really means I just can't accept either losing you or, you know, not replacing you in some way.</p>

<p>And uhm, because I think, when I think back to this feeling I had today, it was uhm, you know, I didn't realize it at the time, because at the time, I was just sort of thinking, well, FSO keeps being fussy, and she really probably wasn't that fussy.  She got more fussy as I got more nervous with her.  But uhm, I think I was really, you know, feeling kind of a desperation with myself, that uhm, (Pause) well, I don't know, I can't think what it was I was just thinking of the feeling exactly was.</p>

<p>But — (Sigh, 2-minute silence) I don't know, I was thinking about i, it was some kind of a feeling, a feeling I have to get control.  But I don't know in what way.  Uhm, because in neither way was I feeling today I was what I want to be.  If I take the dream, I wasn't what I was dreaming.  And if, you know, I take what (Sigh) I think is what I really want.</p>

<p>But I don't know, (Sigh) it just, I do—, I doubt it because I have all these other feelings.  I think, well how can I really want it, if I have these other feelings?  But of, you know, really, liking being just what I am, and enjoying it, for whatever that means, and whatever I decide I want to do.  And uhm, I clearly wasn't doing that today, either.  I wasn't feeling good about anything.</p>

<p>And I don't know, then I just was starting to think about something which I don't really know whether it effected me particularly, but uhm, it just struck me as sort of funny, given that I had been looking to FYSI for some kind of an answer, secret.  And we were talking some more about, well, 2 things.</p>

<p>One, she clearly has, uhm, been given a new position.  Because we had thought she was managing editor, and we were right.  But she'd acted editor for awhile, while the editor was away.  And in the fall when she goes back, she'll be the editor.  And uh, so she was talking about that, to some extent. And then about MYRZ, and some of the problems that have been arising lately with MYRZ.  And she finally just, really sounded desperate for a minute, said, "I think I've bitten off more than I can chew," meaning having a baby, taking on a new position.  And uhm, you know, dealing with these difficulties with MYRZ, all at the same time.  And uhm, and then she very strongly said, "Well, I know I can do it."  And what she was implying was, I'm just concerned about what, in the end, will be happening with the children.</p>

<p>Uhm, but MSCZ took it also to mean something that was also becoming even more clear to us than had been before.  MSXZ's insecurities, and how much FYSI does have to sort of take control of everything and, you know, keep reassuring him.  And uhm, and I think he was sort of taking it as, she was reassuring herself, or you know, just that, not allowing herself to think it would be something she couldn't do.  Because sh, she was the stronger one in the marriage, so she had to be the one to be doing things.  And uhm, I don't know for sure.  But anyway, just for FYSI to indicate any doubt, which she almost never does, in my presence, anyhow.</p>

<p>Uhm, (Pause) I don't know, I ju—, I just think, it was very much on my mind this weekend, you know, sort of, what am I, and uh, I think it was partly because FYSI's job was being talked about somewhat.  And well then MSXZ said something about she wasn't happy at QBF, and you know, that was another thing that, you know, how could she not be happy there?  Here I've been thinking that must be, you know, something that gives her great satisfaction.</p>

<p>And uhm, and then we met another couple whom FYSI, well, the girl FYSI has known for years.  And I don't know how old FYSI is, but she's older than I, and so is this person.  And uhm, she works full-time, she's with SQM.  And there was nothing much said about her job, but she and her husband were building a house, and she was just full of energy.  And it's not something I would want to do.  But yet, I had doubts about myself, you know, sort of, well here she can get out and do that, and maybe I don't want to go out and build a house, but, you know, what am I doing, nothing.  And uh, I think it was just kind of on my mind the whole weekend, of, you know, somehow feeling th, these stronger women were more than I could be.  Now, I don't know, maybe I was already in the frame of mind to be feeling that way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, but you're feeling this at a time when you're worried that your strength all comes from me.  And that uh, at the end of this week it will all disappear.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Yeah, well, I guess I am mainly feeling scared, and because I was thinking, another thing I was feeling today, was scared.  Thinking, if I'm feeling this way today, with so little time to go, what's going to happen if I feel this way — and it would seem likely — when I'm not coming here anymore?  And even if I think of it as, well, maybe I'm feeling this way because it's so close to the end, uhm, then it means I'm still feeling something that (Stomach rumbles) I should think would cause me a problem.  You know, if it's that I think my strength comes from you.</p>

<p>Uhm, I don't know, it just seems, I, I guess also, I was just thinking that it's so different from the way I'd imagined I'd feel at the end.  And maybe I imagined it differently because I had hoped I'd get what I wanted when I came here.  But whatever the reason for it is, I had imagined, you know, just having this clear knowledge that I was ready, and no hesitation.</p>

<p>And uhm, (Pause) I think that was another thi—, I, because I was just thinking, and I've had this feeling all summer, unlike most summers of not wanting, you know, the time to come when I'd go to PTN, a, and so for now, it's not wanting, uhm, you know, to get into August.  And uhm, (Sigh) I think maybe that was another thing I was doing today, it was somehow, there's certain things I want to do before I go to PTN, that uhm, you know, I still haven't done.  And I did do one today.  But I could have done more than I did.  I don't know how much more, because I had to spend some time with FSOZ, get her out of the house.</p>

<p>But uhm, still the feeling was, however much maybe I did the same as any other t—, feeling any other way, it was f—, you know, somehow a feeling of stalling, and trying to drag out time, or something.  And you know, sort of not let time pass, not do anything, then time won't pass, or something like that.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was just thinking about another thing I fluctuate so on.  Because, first I was thinking, well I just don't, you know, I don't feel I'm completely facing whatever it is that led to my feeling this way, as I did today, and having the dream I did.  And, you know, just wh—, how much I'm still clinging to uhm, trying to hold onto you in some form, or you know, replace you, or something.</p>

<p>And uhm, a, and so then I start getting scared again, and think well how can I finish if I'm still feeling that way.  And then I know some days I feel, well, I have, I don't know that anything can be completely over, but I understand it enough so I have to feel the confidence that I can handle it when I'm on my own.  And uhm, I don't feel that kind of confidence today.  But I don't, you know, and it doesn't even seem to me that it would be possible to.  Uhm — (Sigh, 3-minute silence)</p>

<p>(Sigh) Well, I think I was just thinking mainly about uhm, how I compared myself, unfavorably to an extent, with FYSI all weekend.  You know, just kind of always noticing uhm, you know, very small details, and you know, sort of think, well, she's better, or she does that better, or she's more effective, or she's more, uhm, interesting, or, you know, all that kind of comparison.  (Silence)</p>

<p>You know, I was also thinking about the fact that I haven't felt this kind of, uhm, (Sigh) feeling, I don't know how to describe it.  It was sort of a panic kind of feeling, or something, or just being, you know, knowing I'll be so totally out of place, and feeling panicked at having to go through with doing it.  Uhm, and there was no reason for me to feel this way.  And again, it's not something I've felt lately.  (Clears throat)</p>

<p>But when we uhm, FYSI had said that this other couple might be stopping by, the first evening we were there.  And they finally did, rather late.  I guess nothing had been made definite, uhm, and they just stopped by mainly to say hello, and uhm, you know, say they couldn't stay.  And then to ask if uh, FYSI and MSXZ could come over to see their house, see how far they'd come along on it, the next day.  And, so they just stayed for a minute or two.  Uhm, there was really no opportunity to, well, I mean, nothing much happened, because they really stayed such a sort time.</p>

<p>But then, I became very frightened at the thought of going there the next day.  And, you know, that definitely strong feeling of, I will, you know, just be so totally out of place, and I'll have to pretend that I'm something that I'm not.  Or, you know, or something, just so I won't be so out of place, and, you know, just sort of that sick feeling.  And when we d—, (Sigh) and it was clear we'd be going, because FYSI and MSXZ clearly wanted to go.</p>

<p>And then we, when we did go the next day, uhm, you know, it was just so easy.  I guess by then I decided, well, I'm doing it, and this is silly, to be so ridiculous about it.  And I just have to have some kind of control over myself.  And so I went, you know, not that r, repressive kind of control.  But I think I just, well, I don't know, anyway, it wasn't bothering me so much by the time we went there.  And, of course, there wasn't, there was nothing to feel awful about, at all.  But the next before, I, uhm, it was just very peculiar.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was thinking about FYSI again, and, and the fact that uhm, well, she was at least striking me this way this weekend.  Despite her feeling she might have bitten off more than she could chew, uhm, she still seemed to be self-assured and strong, and you know, the way she'd always seemed to me when I first knew her.  And, I don't know, I was just thinking about MSCZ saying that about thinking she might be insecure underneath, and have certain ways to cover it up.  Well, I don't know.  Uhm, just now I was thinking about it.  I was thinking, oh, no, she's not insecure at all.  Uhm, a, and so just thinking about how, the way she, and then this other woman, made me feel so small and, I mean, I was the one doing it.  They didn't do anything.  But uhm, in contrast to them, I felt very small and insignificant and nothing.</p>

<p>And especially with the other woman, there was nothing I knew about her, except that she was working on this house too, oh, and she'd bought an island in PNQ.  It was near a place she'd spent a lot of summers.  Uhm, and she bought that while sh, she married, this was the first marriage, with this man.  He'd been married before.  But uhm, she'd married — I don't know how old she is — I said, but she married quite late, so that at some point, while she was still single, she bought this island.</p>

<p>And I don't just h—, I guess probably because she, the money to buy the island, and then th—, I'm thinking of as a masculine thing, you know, was what gave her the power that seemed to be so much greater than mine.  Uhm, well, I don't know whether it all just comes from feeling that I'm going to lose any source of power when I lose you, or not, that I'd feel this way with these women.</p>

<p>I, I guess what I'm finding hard, is th, that, as I recall feeling it, it just all seemed to make so much sense.  But uhm, when I talk about it, it doesn't make sense, in that, you know, I'd, there was no reason why I should be feeling anything with any of these people.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just remembering another thing.  I think I had a fantasy, at some point, of something awful happening to FSO.  Uhm, because — and I think I used it in this way — I think I then was thinking, well, so then I'll be so upset, I'll have to see you again.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, as I talk, you know, I can just hear how I'm just holding on to you for dear life, really.  And in all these different ways it does seem like that's all I'm really doing.  Uhm, then I think but how can this other feeling of knowing I can take care of myself, and uhm, be on my own, disappear so?  If it's really there, it just seems like somehow, it would still be there.  And (Stomach rumbles) —  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, and then, I was thinking about how I've had trouble imagining the last day, and wondered what it would be like.  And also wondering, I suppose, what I will do or feel.  Uhm, and I've been, as I was just now, sometimes comparing it to things like, uhm, finishing, you know, certain stages.  For some people it was high school.  I didn't ever find that so hard, but college, and you know, knowing that that was the end of school, and everything would be different.  And the feeling of, in a way, not wanting school to end.  Uhm, you know, being afraid of the next step, because I didn't know what it was going to be like, yet.  But knowing that, uhm, it was the next step, so somehow in the end, it was always easier than this.</p>

<p>And so I was wondering, well why is this so much harder, then?  And uh, I, I'm left wondering, you know, is it because I'm going to be giving up that myth that (Sigh) was so important to me?  Or, except somehow, it doesn't seem like finishing has to mean that, if I don't want it to.  And I do want it to, but do I enough.</p>

<p>And uh, but I don't know, somehow it does seem like there's s—, something that makes it harder is that there's a choice on my part that I'm making.  And I hope it is that I'm giving up the myth.  And uhm, (Pause) because I think of, again, of that reaction.  I hav—, well, there's been no situation where I guess I'd know how I feel, since then.</p>

<p>But when FHYZ was trying to reassure me, that conversation that we had just before she went on her trip, and said something about, you can always go back if you need to.  And my feeling was, I won't go back once I stop.  And I know if I really, if something that, you know, is just so totally unforeseen now that really did upset me, happened, then I really would seek help.  But uhm, my feeling is, I don't want to have to.  And I don't know whether that's because I want to give up what has caused me so much trouble, and, you know, kind of dealing with reality, or not.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

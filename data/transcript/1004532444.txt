<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So tomorrow I'm going back home for a visit, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does this mean we're not meeting on...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we talked about last time that [inaudible] [crosstalk]</p>

<p>THERPIST: [inaudible] [crosstalk] Ok (pause), I know we talked about it. Ok, there we are, not meeting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm really hoping, there's, we may be staying with the neighbor two doors down. I'm hoping that we'll do that because it, it will be a lot of buffers so that everything goes really smooth. I get along with my parents. They have two very loud dogs who, one of them is completely [inaudible] and the other one is starting to, I think its cataracts and it thinks something's coming in the house and it starts barking randomly. And so it's great when you've been around it all the time that they've sort of toned it out. To me it just drives me a little bit up the wall. So, but my parents have a very close family friend and he's been in poor health and he just misses having to going around so we'll probably stay up there and I won't have to worry about the dog barking because it had a nightmare or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They are two of the biggest, dumbest dogs on the planet. It's really hard to raise [parents] (ph) and I've tried to explain to them that they can't have both of these dogs, but they do. (pause) They can't really walk them that well, but I'm just looking forward to going home. [00:01:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I haven't told anybody I'm friends with that I'm going to be home yet because I wanted to make sure I was really going to do this. But I did push Mike to, he's been saying like really like, well he hasn't really been doing much so I can understand why he feels like he's underachieving in his life right now because it's how he is, but I can't say that because it starts a whole cascade of feeling bad about himself, but, you know. I've done it before but it, it's so unproductive, but I did say, hey, why don't you get involved, talk to your thesis advisor, why don't you talk to this other person this other person who pushed you to get a PhD, why don't you like talk to them about these things? You know, like even though I'm talking about bearing your soul about being depressed per say, but I'm sure that, you know if you talked to three or four people that you knew in the department who respect you, they may have a clue about as to what happened, instead of thinking oh my god, you know. Someone may have an idea. So, we'll see.</p>

<p>[00:03:14]I have very strong theories, but I feel very uncomfortable telling him about, which is he's not very good at self-guided activities ever. Like, he's not able to say, "Oh, I don't have anything to do so what do I have on my big list of things to do?" You know, he either gives up or if it's a home he plays video games or spaces out or something. These are things that are fun, that he likes, if it's not in front of him he's not very good at this, which is why it often happens that like, yeah he has an appointment for therapy at like 11 AM and so he doesn't go in, he doesn't go until, he stays home all morning and goes to the 11 AM one then goes [shmullzing] (ph) around noon, 12:30 and then I see him home at 3 o'clock. I'm glad he went so I'm grateful about certain things, but yeah. So this is like (sighs), you know, he, he basically had some things that, you know bother him, so I'm like, why don't you talk to your advisors, you know? Instead of being upset and playing a pity party for yourself. I'm certain you're not the first person or the last person who went through this before. And I'm not talking about like losers; I'm talking about like productive people who went through these kinds of phases. If you were to say that then say I don't, I have no doubts about your ability to hold down a job, so. [00:04:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is in fact what you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I cannot think of an entire time in my life where he's worked 40 hours a week. Now, mind you, he's been in school and grad school all of his life, so most of the time we've known each other so that's, that's a point that's not necessarily true, but I can't think of anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Usually people in grad school work more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well because you don't have to be, it's sort of a, I don't know. It, but they're not always in their labs, they're not always in, I don't really see what he's doing, you know. He's very secretive. He's very particular about like, and I've had discussions about this, like I find this really fascinating that you make it so that the only way he can see is if the window is in front of you and, and you use key commands. He doesn't act [inaudible at 00:05:37] like you're using key commands to switch between windows. Like yes you can do that, but why? Especially when it's not productive. You've got eight or twelve widows open and they're all hidden. That's kind of weird and shady, you know? I told him, like you know that kind of behavior lends itself to being secretive because you're not really putting much out in the open, but you know. It's not, it's not even emotionally worth like, or not arguing with him about, but like having discussions about it anymore. It's not my place and I'm just exhausted from it, you know. But, I mean it's just, you know who knows what happens. He's gotten very good about being secret about stuff. About the only time I can really tell when he's doing something is there's this one video game where it has a very very particular sound of clicks on it that I can tell. That's about it. When the sound is on I can tell, but nobody clicks that often when they're reading a paper or something. So, and it's not really, I don't really want to know really. I just want it to be done, you know. So, if, yeah that's sort of, I'm hoping maybe he's pulling himself out of it. He's had friends who have, you know gone through these things and pulled themselves out of it. Not the say he might, but he's had friends you have done it. Maybe, I don't know. So, we'll see.</p>

<p>[00:07:16] But, so that's pretty much what's been going on with me. I got reamed out by my boss for being extremely irresponsible. So, I'm not using my time as effectively at work and therefore, like I am supposed to be managing and handling a lot of processes. I'm only in three days a week. On these three days a week I only work 12 hours and I've recently told I'm not allowed before and after anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before and after...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, my scheduled hours. I used to come in at eight so that I could, you know, get in an extra client in and, and stay late so like I could get paperwork done. I'm not allowed to do that anymore. So, I just, I think that there is a promotion that I have exactly zero interest in that's coming up right now that people are competing for and I suspect that a few people are throwing me under the bus because of this whole thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't follow why they are throwing up under the bus.</p>

<p>CLIENT: By looking at...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you could apply for it if you wanted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is different. This is entirely different. I have no desire to be like the lead creative at the store. I want to get out of the store.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't want to have to manage other people that are dealing with this anymore. I know. So there's been a couple of people who, I think that what they're trying to do is get themselves promoted by showing how well they're handling adverse situations and where somebody else screwed up on something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's where they're throwing you under the bus, you think. Gotcha. [00:08:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you do anything wrong at work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, ok some little things wrong. Like as in like you know, I was coaching somebody else on how to create a, you know a class and silly me, in the middle of the launch when the person I was coaching said they'd e-mailed off the stuff to, to the person looking at our store who was supposed to make the application. And you know, basically arrange to have it [inaudible]. I didn't follow up with that third person because this third person had supposedly been doing this for years. I didn't, well it never got done. And on top of that that person is no longer doing that job, it's somebody else. That kind of stuff. And so I got yelled at, "Oh, well how in the world are people going to trust you to teach, for you to teach them how to do this kind of thing when you've totally let them down? I mean, you didn't check into this." She didn't know any better. And she didn't know this is the process, you know, you should have checked to make sure this doesn't happen. Like, well I did screw up. I didn't check, I didn't double check. I, you know was in the middle of a bunch of other things and I felt like this person should know how to do their job. Perhaps I should find this out, you know. So, and there's about four or five people, there's an overlap of job, but not everybody has all the, all the same information. Like not everybody knows how to do it competently, so it is what it is. You know, there's a couple of people who want to look good by pointing out other people's flaws. [00:10:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I find this to be fascinating and (pause) I am in the wind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the worst part is while I'm being put under the gun I can't think of anything straight, I, I, you know I went in there with a pocket full of, I knew I was getting yelled at, so I came in with a pocket full of notes so I could make sure that I had, [inaudible at 00:11:01] yesterday anyways. But, you know, I wanted to make sure I, I like hit all of the points of things that I needed to make sure were taken care of and this and that. And, you know it felt like I was already on the defense. I shouldn't have been on the defense, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think you should have done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think that I should have been more (long pause), I should have stopped defending my actions and probably done the thing of changing the subject or diverting attention so that that's, you know what I mean? I've think I've talked about this. I know people who are very good at this, so making it not as obvious, you know because I just, I mean at this point like I did something wrong, I'm completely [inaudible at 00:12:03] and, you know. And there's nothing quite like getting completely, completely just reamed because of this. It's like they think no one can trust, what are doing? This and that and I was like, oh this is just great, this is exactly what I wanted to hear today, you know. I've been doing this for years. Why are the rules this way? This is such a great disappointment. It's like so, to be honest if what you were saying was completely valid I shouldn't be here to [keep fucking up] (ph). Like if I'm going to take what you say to heart and sure, I'm completely incompetent at my job obviously, you know. It's just, I'm way too easily persuaded by other people, you know, that they're right. So, which is unlikely, I used to never, and I'm still very opinionated about things, but sometimes when people start arguing with me I decide to just back off and give them exactly what they want, you know. I just, I'm angry with myself mostly. (long pause) [00:13:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it possible that's part of the problem?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course it is, but how can I tell my boss I have low self-esteem and that when I'm getting the run around I'm just getting discouraged? No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I guess that's (pause) not quite what I was thinking about it. More of like (pause) if you and somebody else are busy beating up on you it kind of makes things more difficult than if someone is kind of unfairly beating up on you and you have a reason to sort of push back or to say in the moment how unfair the situation is to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In my head I see that if I acknowledge that everything is completely wrong and I'm in the wrong that this is going to end as quickly as possible because they don't have to persuade me at how crappy I am at my job. You know what I mean? You're absolutely right, I have great, if I, if I [head] (ph) back and explain to them that, that I understand even before in I knew that I had screwed up on something, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, I mean I follow how you understand from a little more distance what happened is that, yes they were saying playing on something you did wrong, but it really was not that big of a deal, not nearly as big as they are making it out to be. And so, I don't really know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, this got blown up. Ok, I don't know if you've spent any time in retail, but the smallest things get made into the biggest things in the whole wide world. Like it became the, "How is anybody in this store going to feel like they can trust you with anything every again now that you let this poor girl down?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It was absurdly over the top. [00:15:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's pretty much what they said. You know, nobody can trust you, you know. Because you acted like you were the expert and you dropped the ball.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you're saying, I thought that you're best responsibility had been to kind of change the subject or to pull the attention away from that onto something else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like somebody else's neglect of this like as in the person whose entire job it was should have been done. And, you know, how about that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I follow, the thing that gets in the way of you doing that is tendency in the moment to sort think self-critically and agree with the person who is being harsh with you?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's, that's I guess sort of what I had in mind was that like, sure I'm not saying you should tell any of those other things. Just imagining that it's easier to sort of have you think that you hadn't screwed up in nearly the way you're being accused of and gotten kind of annoyed at the person in your mind who is berating you, it would have been easier to sort of figure a way out. I don't necessarily mean berating them, but like just diverting things. Is that [inaudible cross talk at 00:16:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Making it somebody else's is kind of the only possibly can be the best way out of the situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And really one of the last things you tend to do?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I actually recently had a very dear friend of mine, who I thought was a dear friend, say something really horrible to me and, you know, really mean, mean to me. And I said, oh gosh she must be so stressed out with, you know just moving and this and that. I made excuses for someone who basically said something terrible about me, this way too. I'm just, instead of just saying, oh my gosh that's a really big shocking thing, you know. I am willing to believe the worst about myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or like (pause) is it possible you can be a little bit blind to people being mean to you? I mean part of it is you kind of think the worst about yourself, but I guess, it sounds like in sort of a way that at the time...[inaudible crosstalk at 00:18:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible crosstalk] Right afterwards I realize it. At the time, though I'm completely convinced that they're right, you know, completely convinced. (long pause) And it's really creepy because I used to have a lot of fight in me on this kind of stuff. I had, I still like for the most part I used to be it and still to this day certain things [relating] (ph) relating to my boss I have no problems talking back at them for certain things, you know. You know, like (sighs) that doesn't bother me and so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have that kind of enduring attitude that's like if you're right you're right and it doesn't matter who you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I actually said, ok, we have one hour, do you wish to be right or do you wish to get this completed? We can only pick one. I've actually said that previous, more than once in my life to people who I've reported to. Way higher on the report chain, you know, you can be right or we can have this done correctly, which one? And you know, that doesn't bother me, but for some reason lately when it's coming down to like, if I have some fault in my own, like some hand in something that I screwed up on, sure, you know. And I feel like I can't, I'm being yelled at because I'm not communicating enough with people, but the minute I communicate something with them I get these e-mails back that make me feel like a moron.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did this start with your in-laws?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And so now it's like sending an e-mail takes forever for me because I spend all this time making sure people understand me and then they are like, "I have no idea what you're saying." Or like, my boss specifically said to me, "Ok, there are three people applying for this job. Who do you think that you think is the person you really, you really feel like is the best candidate. I said none of them and she was shocked, like, no, none of these people are the right candidate from this. I want someone from outside who has a different fresh perspective on this when, you know everything's going to be status, [quo] (ph) and quite frankly the other people don't have the skills to motivate anybody else. So, she, she said, "Give me a list of three things that are, are, are you know, are not, you know, that that you think this new lead should have."</p>

<p>[00:20:43] And just to give you an idea of the exchange I got, I can't believe I'm having these kinds of conversations via text message. It seems like such a terrible concept, but apparently this is socially acceptable to do, is conduct business via text message. Ok, here we go, from Sandy. My wish list: inspiring others on the team, you know vision on the creative on how we can grow as a group and in the number of us and the skills, pragmatic approach to programs. I got, "We can talk later, that the three that did not, that the three that an external would not provide." That's what she got. She asked me to give her the three skills, like not that they didn't have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, what did she say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: "We can talk later, I asked for what the three do not have that an external would provide."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought I gave three things that our candidates do not have that an external could provide. But, I just got told that I misunderstood the question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she reiterated and I said yes, nobody inspires anybody on the team. There's no one who has a vision on how we could progress and create jobs and there's not anyone who has a primary purpose to our problems, period. I answered things adequately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're saying that each of the people of the three are all that way?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. [inaudible crosstalk at 00:22:17] She's like, "You misunderstood the question. What I'm asking for is what..." And like this is why I don't want to have, I don't want to conduct conversations by text message. Text messages are for "please bring milk on the way home." You know, I feel like also, I don't need to send e-mails saying I did this or I did, or even worse. I have currently screwed up and mis-did my job. I super pinky promise not to do this again. Like, why am I supposed to send these kinds of e-mails out? You know, instead of just fixing the situation and making sure it doesn't happen next time. (long pause) You know? It just feels extremely like I'm constantly misunderstood and this isn't just a single person, this is like, this has been a lifetime, not a lifetime, but like in the past five/six years I have had this happen more than once. You know where I just don't get, you know (sighs) I think the world is leaving me behind because I am too uncool to be able to get the way they're trying to communicate and conduct business. Because obviously I'm not, I'm saying things and they're not understanding. Everybody else understands but me. [00:23:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok, the impression I get, and correct me if I'm wrong, is a little more like these guys are being knuckleheads.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I'm just wondering if I'm missing a key portion of this [stokes] (ph). I have, more than one person has done this to me so I'm wondering if I'm just not getting it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, I want to clarify that I understand you well. I do hear a little of what you're saying, that you are really doubting yourself because you've gotten the message a number of times that you haven't been clear or you haven't been on the same page with people. In a way that it seems like others around you are much more easily [in often] (ph). And now I'm adding, this would be very disturbing if it were true. Because (long pause) the way it kind of sounded like when you read the text message, and see this is where I may be misunderstanding, was how like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: There weren't even verbs in some of those sentences too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right and she was sort of being an idiot. She asked you something, you give it to her and she responded that you misunderstood the question when you had not. So, I guess if we look at that example, how could you have been out of step with that? Like in other words...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not just being out of step, but why would I even want to respond to, to respond and give my feedback if I'm going to get the, "You don't seem to understand what we're even asking, much less give us relevant..." Why would I want to? Why would I want to participate? Why would I want to communicate when I'm getting feedback on, you know, we don't understand you? You know? Just like I do not like talking to sales people and this is completely random. If I go into rural areas they can't even understand I word I say. I had trouble in general, but they can't even understand a word I'm saying at all and they actually kind of make fun of me for it. Like, "You're not from around here or..." Like this, whatever, it's just like, I'm like, you know what, if I need it I'm just going on Amazon because feel like dealing with like county behavior over like getting, like the proper type of like applesauce or something. I don't know something. It just seems like such, I am shutting down because I feel like am not understanding the world around me.</p>

<p>[00:26:54] And I feel like constantly being misunderstood is making me be more scatterbrained, more nervous, and more disorganized because I'm constantly having to re-, rewind and try and figure out what's happening fast enough so that I can get them the answer that they want to hear. And it isn't just my job; this is my life. You know? I have too many people in my life like this. And (long pause) I'm not a mind reader. (long pause) And I just don't know what to say or do anymore to properly play the game because it isn't, I'm you know, I'm a straight talking [guy] (ph) in here. If you ask me a question, it's you know, which one, they said, "Which one is going to score higher?" I said none of them. I said one of them in six months has changed a lot and he might make a good one someday. One of them might be really great going to a different store, you know. But none of them are, you know, ready to play. You know, to step up and be a leader and inspire people and make people want to do things for you, none of them. And I think that threw her off and then, you know I thought there would be sort of good things to say about what I want out of, you know my wish list of, you know the person I want to be leading me. You know, but I feel (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I guess another aspect of what you're describing is that, like with that or with the sales people, these are people who in theory want to hear from you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I assume.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, and part of the frustration is that in spite of that, like this manager asked for your opinion. She can do that. She wanted to know what you thought. And then she reacted as though you were giving her something she really hadn't asked for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I feel like right now their pet idiot savant of the store. That I have extremely valuable things, for reasons they know. I've actually been referred to as, I guess from a movie about a kid who played football called Rudy. That was a different boss at a different store, you know. Just because I have a great wealth of knowledge, I don't just go out of my way to expound it. I only talk about what is relevant, but you know, it's, I don't know. I just feel, I'm feeling very, very frustrated because obviously I'm having difficulty being understood. Now I'm starting to wonder if this was a test of some sort to see whether not I can comply. I, I'm not a big believer in paranoid things, but I'm starting wonder if like Debra is on board with everybody else? Is she picking the same person? Is everybody else? I don't know. You know? (pause) [00:30:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the thing is at least go halfway there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. I do know that one of the people, I have no idea why in the world she is so emotionally invested in getting this job, but she had decided, she's getting this job by miniature managing me by asking me what I'm doing every single moment and kind of asking me things like, kind of things that are really none of her business. Like, "Are you punched in?" Really? Do you need me to do something? Is that what, tell me you need me to do something. Don't ask me if I'm punched in because you want me to wait on somebody. If it's just because you're wanting to know if I'm actually on the clock, go pound sand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok, see what you just said is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Different person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no, but here's, I understand from the kinds of things that you've been telling me that you find this confusing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, in, in the moment I'm scrambling to, to explain why it is I'm punched in and why I'm doing something relevant. Why? I don't know. I'm defending myself in the moment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm panicking because I'm feeling put on the spot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you ever like, it's not making a whole lot of sense and you're being asked, you're being, you're on the spot. And you're scrambling to figure out what the hell to say and do to like make it go away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But making it sure as possible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your tone is, as you describe this as annoyed, but I understand...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That happens later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but I understand that is certainly what you feel in the moment, but probably isn't exactly what you're feeling now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am frightened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So much as frightened, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is you being really scared.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not for any particular reason other than the fact that, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds pretty disconcerting to have all this happening all at once where you're feeling so out of kilter with the way people are talking to you and so, sort of attacked in one way of another. When, as best as you could tell you were just [trying not to be in the way] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I mean honestly, a lot times it's like, tell me what you want me to do or like between the two of you figure out what it is and notify me of the results and I will do it. There are a few things in the world that I will fight for, this is not, some of these things, I mean, I pick and choose my battles. I'm just like I don't care, let me know what you decide, let me know, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't hear you having a huge stake in any of this</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like, like the whole posting, you know to name the corporate circuit from the website, you know for this class. If honestly, if I'd known he wasn't going to do the job I would have done if for free on my own. Why? Just so it could be done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:34:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't care, you know. I just thought I was doing, I was using the chain of command that you are supposed to delegate and, you know to other people and this person said that's their job. Two weeks later it's not their job, it's this other person's job, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right and was the situation different or was your frame of mind different, you could have explained that and sort of cleared up what was going on, but you were so much on the defensive and so, I guess upset really about what was happening that you couldn't think very clearly about what best to, what you were supposed to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I, like on this one, this is, it's not been going on for a long time. This is recently. Like, there are seasons where I do get hell for not taking things down the way they want me to, but it's usually related to my health, and I understand that. They do, they hold like a I really need to yell at you but I really don't really believe it. I'm yelling at you and we're just doing this to make someone else happy, kind of thing. That happens. This, this is like ever since everybody wanted this, this job that honestly, for $4,000 a year extra, I'm sorry, for $40,000 extra a year I wouldn't even do it. Why? Because I, I have to be responsible for 18 other souls. No, no way. I can't, all of these people are very independent people who are going to do what they're going to do on their own if they feel like it, you know. This, this is not like a group of people who are used to being cohesive. It's not like it's bad, it's just the nature of the people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like herding cats.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I'm mean, that's just that group of people. Nothing in the world could make me want to do this. And so, I mean, part of it I, I can be amused by the fact that all these people are scrambling to show they, to show that they are management, to show that they can manage these people, but that's not what it is. Acting like you can do the job does not necessarily prove that that's what it is, you know. And so it's just so silly and, and I just feel really on the spot. I feel like I'm like panicking in the moment, doing anything possible to make the pressure stop and then afterwards going, wait a second, wait a second, this person you just said I let down I never seen, like coming around the corner, I've never seen this woman in my life. You just told somebody that I screwed something up and I swear to you I've never seen this person in my life, you know.</p>

<p>[00:36:53] That kind of stuff. Or someone telling me I saw, I saw your handwriting, you know, saying this. I just assumed sure, I guess I did write something down, something that I gave to a customer that was incorrect I guess. I just took at in good faith and I find out later on, wait a second, what exactly was written down, that kind of thing. Because I just assume that someone's going to tell me the truth or do things in my best interest, or do things in somebody's best interest at least, the store's best interest of something. It seems unproductive, but at the time because I work from this goal, this belief that wow, if something's screwed up and I obviously had a part in it then it must be all of it, you know. And (pause) it's a lot to have to deal with but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's a in which you sort of like give away the benefit of the doubt. You give it over to them and sort of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why would anybody do that otherwise? You know? Why would anybody say that you screwed this up with a customer of you did this if it weren't true?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although, in the place you don't give yourself the benefit of the doubt. In other words, I do take your point about why somebody would do that. But at the same time there's also the question of why would you give someone the wrong information? Or....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it, I mean, it, it, it's been known to happen, that there was a miscommunication and I said that this is what this is and they understood something completely differently. That's, I mean it happens.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but even then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm putting the [inaudible at 00:38:53] over here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even that, giving someone the wrong information that's a miscommunication. In the customer's mind it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand, but in terms of explaining to your manager what happened (pause). But I think that's not really the larger point here which is that, if I follow, you know, when somebody comes up and says you've done something wrong you presume they're not making shit up and that they're being reasonable and fair to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially when like you know at least you did one thing wrong and that you probably should have followed up with somebody. Ok, yeah, I did. I forgot to follow up with somebody. [00:39:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So obviously chances are it's probably completely right. Based on that iota of information that I have it sounds like it's pretty valid argument and then after that I'm like, wait a second, I need to ask, I was so panicked I couldn't ask any critical questions that I needed to do to find out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting because you can think so critically and analytically when it comes to other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But when it comes to this kind of interaction with somebody else that goes out the window.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Completely. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, like we said before, it kind of started with your in-laws and that it, it has a lot to do, I mean just what you said earlier, with I, I guess kind of your self-esteem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're critical of yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really say this is actually a causation, but there is a high correlation of women in power. I don't necessarily think that that is really happening, but if you look at the track record it is more often than not. There's trend in there. Whether or not that's just coincidence, I don't know. Of my nine to eleven bosses, all but one are female, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, maybe that's, I don't really know if that's true or not, but I do know that every female member of my husband's family really puts me in a panic, you know. Could be that, I don't know. I just don't feel like dealing with derision, you know. And just like, you know (pause) when I am being given insults by certain people, you know, because I want to make them happy I will put up with it and it's even, well, you know laugh and convinced at the same time that that's probably what's true. I mean if they're being a little sarcastic, but not entirely sarcastic, you know. (sighs) (pause) And then maybe just say this person was stressed out afterwards, maybe they were more harsh, or this person, Sandy is getting like pressure from above about some things therefore she is coming down harder on me, you know. All said and done, yes, I'm really empathic for most people, but maybe I need to stop freaking worrying about other people's lives and worry about this person is acting this way because of this and be like, you know what, I don't deserve to be treated that way. That I can't do that in the moment and I don't really understand why, you know. [00:42:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and again the, the, the distinction in my mind seems to be like to do with losing your sort of critical faculty. In other words, if they put an argument in front of you and said you know, here's my philosophy or you know, logic or something like that, you know to make sense, you'd be all over it probably. But, when it's a person saying something directed at you that capacity goes out the window.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And...</p>

<p>CLIENT: To give you an idea of something, this has only happened once in my life and I'm really reticent to actually tell another, an actual person about this. One of my cousin's favorite stories and my other friend's favorite stories that they like to have is when I was treated with less than respect, more or less in a public situation, that I actually clocked a hockey player. I had a bit to drink, but he more or less was a jerk to me and more or less called me other types and this is many years ago. Some sort of demeaning, whore, bitch kind of things and I said you don't talk to a lady like that and I actually clocked him pretty damn hard. And then all of my friends who were at this party which was a combination of like hockey players and math geeks decided to run (laughs), but the point though is that that type of thing in that point of my life I wasn't a person to ever hit anybody, but I was, maybe my [inaudible at 00:44:04] but the fact that I would say, you never speak that way to a lady and hit a hockey player, a professional hockey player.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, like as in like the farm team. Like, semi-professional, you that's minor league, but it's still pro, that's their job and I hit a hockey player.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Never done it again, never will. I actually think I ended up hurting my hand more than I hurt him. The point is though, like I used to never be afraid of standing up for what I thought was right and you don't call people or treat people like that in public that way, especially when you haven't even been properly introduced to them. You know that kind of thing. But, you know, why is it, you know, I can't fight for myself now? (pause) I miss being a jerk (laughs).<br>
 <br>
 THERAPIST: I don't see it as being a jerk.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok, but I could have gotten my friends and everyone else around me for my own like, I could have just said, I could have just taken it and walked away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It may have been risky, very risky.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't think it was unjustified.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Either case, it seems to me that watching the [inaudible].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it was 1998, so that was a long time ago (laughs), ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The question you raised about why you can't do things like that anymore...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Seems to me a very worthwhile one and one worth hard think more about.<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: I don't necessarily think being as brash as I was back then was necessarily the best.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I didn't take your example as the kinds of the behavior you want to have today, so much as an example of you know what you were capable of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what, in a more toned down, socially appropriate way you'd like to capable of now, but clearly are not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or when people used to try and like talk me up by saying things like, "Oh you're so smart," they, they, they, this happens a lot. There's actually a phrase for it called a bullshit sandwich in which you put two compliments, and you know you say something nice to somebody then you say something really, really awful, then you say a compliment at the end. And I had a boss that said to me, "You know, I think that you're one of the three smartest people in this building and this and that," and I looked at him like, I'm one of the three smartest people in this area code. And to be honest that you said it to me means nothing to me because I don't value your opinion.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of stuff. I mean, that's not, that's a lot less brash, but it is very true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, it's like, you know I was trying to explain that I really don't, like don't even bother giving me the compliment at the beginning and the end, just, the corporate speak for this thing, just, just tell me what you're upset about and be done with it and because we're wasting our time otherwise, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to stop for now, but we will talk more about today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have a good trip.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. Have a good holiday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks.</p>

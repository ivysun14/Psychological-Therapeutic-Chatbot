<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How is life settling down after losing your wife?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's getting better. Uh, there's moments.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just not the same.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know. There's moments. And there will be probably the rest of my life. I don't anticipate, uh, yknow, that ever going away. I cared for her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In these cases, time is the healer, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. Yes. So slow progress, but, uh, I'm getting there. I'm working my fool head off, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You still using your garage for your workshop?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That and a shade tree. I'm a shade tree mechanic. I truly am. I got an old leaning elm tree and I'd rather be there as anywhere else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If there's a breeze that would be nice.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what I'm after because there is a breeze. It's between other buildings so it kind of funnels air in there in front of a big barn and sometimes, uh, if the wind's out of the east or northeast it'll funnel it right through that barn and.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Can you blow you off if there is a tornado.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it would, but, uh, I don't have any anticipation of that happening. That's not the greatest fear of my life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about, how are the kids?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Kids?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The boy was giving you grief?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. I don't know, he checked himself into [DEIDENTIFIED] a couple days ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Had he had any kind of psychiatric issues before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, he had been going to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I didn't know that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's been going to [DEIDENTIFIED], yknow. And he missed a session and I think he probably missed more than one session, but anyway he said he missed a session to go to his mother's funeral and they wouldn't let him back in. He kept going back and they wouldn't accept him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED], oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so I was told that he's been really having a really, really bad time with his mother's death, which I'm sure he did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that why his mom was so blindly supportive of him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Could be. I don't know why she was, but she was. I don't know. I don't know what she thought, what was in her mind. When he was not around she would say she was washed up with him and she wasn't doing no more, but when he'd comes around whining, she supported him, bail him out, do whatever, give him money.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is he living with you now or is he out on his own?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, no. No, no. He has a, uh, trailer on twenty acres, long story. He had bought it, she bought it for him with the intent of selling it. But he's still out there in a trailer that he had bought on the land. And, uh, he has a daughter that, uh, he hasn't seen much in his life. Maybe, I don't know if he's ever seen her before a couple of years ago. And her boyfriend said they're getting married. They're living out there with him. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about your social life?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't have a social life. I see people and visit once in a while. But since the last time I was here I went to Kansas. Three weeks ago this Thursday, four weeks ago this Thursday. Kansas, my son's, he's in baseball, plays in baseball tournament, my son, my grandson. And, uh, he came back with me and spent three weeks and left Saturday. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You said he was with you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old is he?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That should have been fun for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he's a pretty intelligent kid. He's a pretty intelligent [AGE]. He doesn't act like a normal [AGE]. Uh, but anyway, he was here three weeks. During that time we made a run to Kentucky to pick up a car and he had a good time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What kind of car did you pick up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A two thousand four Crown Vic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So why Kentucky?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's where it was.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's so special about the car that you have to go all the way?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It happened to be one on auction that I bought, a surplus auction.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really. They have those here too, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do they sell anything good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes. You have to keep up with them and see what's going, usually them auctions, most of them don't last but a week or ten days and they're done. But, yeah, you buy a lot of good things in Oklahoma.  [DEIDENTIFIED]. Complete [DEIDENTIFIED], county governments, city governments, colleges, yknow, whatever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I saw some time ago about two or three months ago a funny ad on the TV. There as a town of about six hundred or eiht hundred people in California was on sale. The town was on sale.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, is it for sale? Well, I guess somebody could buy it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right. And they're not asking a ton of money. I think one point five million or something like that. I said how could there be a town on sale. I never heard anything like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I don't know, but I guess they can sell themselves if they want.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Everything's for sale. There's a price on everything. I buy stuff from these occasionally. I bought a car in [DEIDENTIFIED]. I flew up there and drove it home. I'm still driving it. Good car.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you fix them up and sell them or do you just?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A little bit. A ninety seven Crown Vic. I've got a lot of them that needed a lot of fixing, but I'm so busy doing other things so I can't get to them. I'm going to have to drop these other things because the cars will be more profitable. I got a list of things. It would take me, I don't know, three or four months to do all the things on my list if I never got anything else. But somebody calls about an air conditioner, word of mouth, my car died, where I get my business. They come back or send somebody else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, yknow, given that you are all by yourself at home after your wife's demise it may not be a bad idea to be busy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it's good to be busy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In the days, so called idle brain is devil's workshop.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely. And I hate the inside.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you also have to keep it in mind, sir, life is not all work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Work is for life. And hence you need to have a life as well, sir.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you get any girlfriend of something?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you meet anybody or is too soon?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't even thought about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me why not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just haven't considered it. Also my granddaughter is coming from Kansas in about ten days, uh, and she's gonna stay with me for a while 'til she gets her feet on the ground. She's [AGE]. She's going to go to some, probably a vo tech to pick up some, get computer literate and, uh, get a job as. So I suggest she work days and go to school in the evenings. They've got a whole bunch of shop courses and things where she can learn all the computer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. Does she have a good head on her shoulder?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's got a good head but I'm going to have to retrain her 'cause my son and his wife is not a good place. They're not a good example.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That age, [AGE], can be a little bit tricky age.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you guide them right, fine, turn out just fine. But if they go in the wrong channel. But at least it will be somebody at your home. That was my concern that you are such a family man and my major problem was that all along you had depression and then you talked about your wife, we talked about that, there's some bitterness.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I was concerned that given you being a Caucasian male in your age, um, things can spiral out of hand real quick.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I used to see you every three months, now I'm seeing you more frequently because I want to keep an eye on you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I'm good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I wish I could share everything that my patients say. I have to see in between the lines.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm glad that you are not crying anymore. I'm glad that you are getting the physical and emotional energy to do your stuff because there is a brief time you stopped doing your stuff. That made me nervous. But still I have to keep an eye on you, sir.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your age, your sex, being Caucasian, just lost your wife, had a chronic depression, these are going against your safety. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that's why I need to keep an eye on you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> On the [DATE], about a week, I'll be [AGE]. That's getting old.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It depends on your mind.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My mind.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you keep your mind at [AGE] or you keep your mind at [AGE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, mine stays at [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good. Way to go.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But my body sometimes tires out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me about it. I feel that way too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> However, for last visit, which was [DATE] about a month ago, you were on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg in the morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you taking it regularly?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What is it doing or not doing for you, sir?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it helping you or not helping you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I can't answer that. I don't what it'd be without it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are taking the Paxil 40 in the morning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  Now, again, I can't tell you what it would be without it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And your trazodone was reduced to 150 mg at bedtime, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Correct.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The one that at nighttime?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you sleep at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many hours are you getting?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Eight or nine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Whoa, I'm jealous of you, sir. I wish I could get that much sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I figure if I go eleven to seven, eight hours, and sometimes I don't get up 'til nine o'clock.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How does that work?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's, uh, I'm tired when I go to bed. It reaches a point, it comes up to a point where my body is ready to give up. Last night I'm tired and sleepy today because I didn't go to bed 'til one o'clock. Phone rang at eight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need any prescriptions today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, possibly the 50 mg trazodone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which does come in 150 mg, you know that, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, does the VA have it in that, they didn't?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know because the last prescription I wrote Wellbutrin, Paxil, and trazodone was in March. So have you been getting your meds from VA now or do I need to write or what do you want to do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I've been getting them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. I'll write all the three prescriptions.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  Yeah, if I wasn't so busy I'd go back and take some classes at night too. I went to school all my life. I enjoy it. Depression and my wife's passing and I know there is a lot of mourning that is done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At least for the first year and as of when you reach the -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Let me finish my thought. I miss her very much as a person and know I'll never ever see her again. But there's also the biggest part of mourning is the regret of things I could have done differently and should have done differently to make her life better. Now therein is a big part of mourning, the regret. The sorrow after the fact at what'd been so easy to do at the time, rather than refuse to do it or neglecting it, not picking it up. That is a huge part of mourning, regret.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The way we can say, sir, we should never forget our past because past is our best teacher.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is our teacher.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But let's not live in the past.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, but I'm just telling you that's where sorrow comes from.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mostly regret.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you cannot make any changes and that's why let's not look back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you've got to -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Go forward.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You've got to go forward. You've got to at some point you've got to, yknow, you can't ask that person to forgive you, but you still can.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ask for it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ask for it, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Go to her grave, sit down, and ask for her.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Talk.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely. Yknow, some people believe that happens, some people believe it doesn't happen, who cares who's right or wrong as long as you get your peace.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. I'm totally in agreement with that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm sorry I couldn't do the best thing I could have. Maybe next time when we meet I'll do it right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're a good man, sir. That's her looking back. And, again, as many times I have told you I'm sorry for your loss, but let's look forward.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Have to. I mean.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't have a choice.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yesterday you can't change. There is no tomorrow, only today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. Maybe you can make a little change tomorrow if you use, you start as a teacher.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Start changing today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's true.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Tomorrow will take care of itself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good luck.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you, sir.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Pleasure meeting you, sir. It was not a session for you, but it was a session for me as well. I thank you for letting me record our conversation.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Very well. Thank you, sir.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll see you back in a month.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You be good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  Did you learn anything today?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes I did.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bye bye.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know where to start. I can start with the problems stuff, or I can start with work frustrations, or, I don't know, pick up where we left off yesterday. There, I think, are a couple of options. I don't know where I want to start.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know how to tell you what to pick. Whatever seems [pressing] (ph) or whatever (inaudible at 00:01:00) hurts. </p>

<p>CLIENT: This is going to sound kind of vain because it's only on my mind at this moment. Because I walked past a reflection of myself on my way up and realized that my hair is kind of a wreck right now. But I have this ridiculous aversion to talking to people on the phone to the point where I've been wanting to get my hair cut for the last two months, but haven't because I can't bring myself to call and make an appointment. Which is a little bit absurd, but I just freeze up every time I go to pick up the phone to call them and make an appointment. </p>

<p>And this is completely crazy, because as far as I can tell, there's no trauma around making appointments over the phone, or getting my hair cut, or anything else of the sort. So, it's very strange and I don't understand it. [00:01:59] (pause) And my hair is a mess and really does need to be cut. And I'm tempted to just buzz cut it so I can avoid having to call and make an appointment with my stylist which is really ridiculous. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like, why couldn't you stop by to make an appointment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's out of my way and it's kind of a pain to get to. And I don't have enough hours in the day to make a separate trip out there to make an appointment in person. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It's kind of far away then?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's in the Square, but I don't go through there except on Sundays to go to church, and they're closed on Sundays.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to, like, make an errand out of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. During rush hour on my way home from work and fight the traffic on (inaudible at 00:02:53) which it's just not pleasant. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else (inaudible at 00:03:25) </p>

<p>CLIENT: About phones? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever. I mean, what I asked like... I'm not saying, like, "Okay, give me something new about something else."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or, like, "and what more about that," just... (inaudible at 00:03:41)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, I don't... (pause) Yea, I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess part of wondering a little bit—point is, I'm not yet sure what to say, or something what to say. [00:04:08] And I also imagine that your next associations, may, or may not, but may shed some light on what you're wondering about what to do with the phone, even if they don't seem related. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I was just thinking of all of the various little things that I've been meaning to get around to doing for the last couple of months and haven't because they all require getting on the phone. Especially getting on the phone during business hours, because not only do I not like getting on the phone in the first place, but I work in a rave (ph) cubicle so people can hear me on the phone (inaudible at 00:05:02) I mean, closing a brokerage account to transferring funds to a different account. There's nothing particularly embarrassing or kind of salacious about it that I would be worried about other people knowing, but it's not like I'm getting on the phone with my lover on my lunch break. But it's still, I don't know, sets off a bunch of feelings of self-consciousness. (pause) </p>

<p>It's also why I haven't had a physical yet this year because I don't have a GP and getting on the phone to find one and dealing with front desk staff. [00:06:05] And I've had difficult experiences communicating with front desk staff, even face-to-face, and it's been worse on the phone, so... but I should do that. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think that comes up from self-consciousness? Like, did you get down on yourself or were you just referring to like, another thing, like the haircut in that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's stuff about being concerned about how you look all over all of this. [00:07:03] It's like, I think in terms of being maybe a little more halting (ph) at some other times and you're not sure what to say, obviously in terms of feeling self-conscious on the phone, (inaudible at 00:07:22) haircuts, and physicals.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'll bet that has something to do with it. Something, I know, though you sort of brought up in the negative that, that actually it is for your neighbors at work as though you're talking to your lover on the phone. Yet you're calling to close or transfer money from a brokerage account, or something like that. It's like, that you're exposed in that way. [00:08:01] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (pause) I was like, people around me make personal calls from their desks all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I certainly don't pay any attention to them like anyone else does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's weird because I don't feel this inhibited about text communication. So e-mails, IMs, perfectly fine. But a lot of these places won't accept e-mail communication. [00:09:02] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A brokerage firm won't let me close an account over e-mail for obvious security reasons. Most physicians' offices won't take appointments by e-mails which I think that's ridiculous, but what can I say. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No hair cut appointments by e-mail either, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not my stylist. And other places will, but not the one I like. I could just find a new stylist one day. [Could be] (ph) less trouble. (chuckling) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, how self-conscious are you feeling in here? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right now? Not very. I mean, except the knowledge I think my hair looks like crap but... [00:10:02] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe a little because of what I thought of your hair? (pause) Well, maybe you do feel a bit self-conscious here. [00:11:16] I'm aware that you just said that you don't. (chuckling) But you're bringing a problem that you really don't know how to solve. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That, I think, makes you feel silly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you don't even really have a lot of ideas about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you're sort of helpless and passive around. And maybe all that is making you feel a bit self-conscious. [00:11:58] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just not easy for you to—any more than it would be to, like, go to a co-worker's cube and say, "I don't get it." </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I don't know what happened. This isn't working."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I don't know what to do next. I don't know where to start or how to think about it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's been getting easier, the more I do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still don't like to do it, but less kind of digging in my heels about it. Especially the positive feedback I get for actually going and asking. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do people say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, so I have one-on-one meetings with my manager every week. He does with all of his direct reports. And he's been telling me that people have been noticing that I will ask for help and that it's a good thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. [I notice] (ph) that sometimes the problems that I get stuck on I take it to a senior engineer and they don't know what to do either which is reassuring. Because that means it's not me. [00:13:06] And it's not just being new, it's that it's a legitimately confusing problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it has something to do with the phone? Like—a little less connected? You can't read the other person's responses the same way? [00:14:08] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, maybe. I mean, to pick one example... (pause) Let's pick one at random: the hair cutting place. Like, just thinking through the steps of looking at the number, and dialing, and then someone will answer the phone, and I'll have to ask if I can make an appointment with my stylist. And then she'll say, "When do you want your appointment to be?" And then I'll have to say, "Well, when is he working because I don't know his schedule?" And then there's this confused back and forth and... (pause) It's just very frustrating for me. (pause) All the times I've called them in the past. [00:14:59] </p>

<p>I mean, and that's one example. The reasons for being frustrated aren't the same as for other places. But there's always, I don't know, like, the issue of transferring my funds from one brokerage account to the other. (pause) I have to explain what I want them to do and it's kind of complex because of the old brokerage account. I sold a bunch of the funds that I knew the new brokerage firm doesn't carry that I left some of the others that's a mix of cash and funds. (pause) And then there's the issue of trying to be talked out of closing the fund and transferring it which I don't want to. That's a frustration. </p>

<p>So what's the other one on my list? Oh yea, it's making a physical. Just... (pause) I actually can't think of any way that can go badly. [00:16:01] I mean, you call and you say you'd like to—you're a new patient, different insurance than you used to have, and you need a GP, set up an introductory appointment. But I still don't want to do it. (pause) I don't know why. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, I guess with the others it more clearly has to do with frustration.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess particularly a frustration that really gets in the way of getting it done. [00:17:02] (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, that's (ph) a similar kind of feeling, this morning at Dunkin' Donuts, that I get sometimes when I'm on the phone with someone I don't understand. I was standing at the counter waiting in line and another employee walked up to the second cash register and asked me what I wanted. So I was second in line. And so I started saying, "I want this kind of sandwich." And she was like, "Well, what kind of coffee do you want?" I was like, "I want this kind of sandwich with a side of hash browns." And she was like, "What kind of coffee do you want?" And so, I was like, "Fine. I want a Dunkin' (ph) coffee." And she walked away. I was like, "But I'm not done." </p>

<p>And I didn't realize until after I left, that her job was just to make coffee, and she didn't know how to use the register, and she couldn't take my order. But that wasn't clear to me. That's what the interaction was about. And so I was getting frustrated that... and then a third employee came up and asked me had I ordered. And then the second employee came back with my coffee. And I was like, "But you didn't ask if I wanted cream or sugar. And I want cream and sugar." [00:18:10] And then she got very upset that I didn't tell her, but she walked away before I could tell her. And then the first woman—the one who was running the cash register—asked me for my order and I said, "But I already ordered." And she was like, "What did you order?" And it was just... I was so confused. I didn't know what was going on and at one point, all three of them were talking to me at the same time. It was just very —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it wasn't quite (inaudible at 00:18:37) "Who's on First?", but it's like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I was frustrated and angry and for a second I just felt like turning around and walking out and leaving my food and coffee. And just being done with it because I just... it was... I feel like I'm making a mountain out of a molehill really, except that it's that sense of frustration and not knowing what's going on and being upset. That I don't know what's going on is the same as the feeling I often have when I'm on the phone with someone. [00:19:08] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The frustration of not knowing what's going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It gets you] (ph) kind of confused?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not just an obvious thing that the confusion of not knowing what's going on would be a big part of what gets so frustrating. [00:20:03] (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:20:11) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well—(pause) I know, I guess it's just not that obvious to me. Like, I could imagine that it was like, "I just want my fucking my sandwich and coffee and get the fuck out of there."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [That would have been a] (ph) part of it. That's really frustrating. There's delays, there's like, inefficiency. You have to wait for something you might really be hungry for. I don't know. [00:21:03] I guess, that seems more obvious, I guess, than what I would have assumed. But then, maybe, there's an element (ph) in that. But I... </p>

<p>CLIENT: They were actually remarkably fast. They gave me my food before I was done paying so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, so it wasn't that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were... this particular Dunkin' Donuts is ridiculously efficient, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, so I guess that makes the point that it's really not it at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's much more being unsure how things are working... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that is really irritating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or that maybe it makes you really mad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess... I don't, in general, think... it doesn't seem to me, in principle, that thing with those two things would go together. [00:22:16] I mean, I understand that if [you're insisting that's] (ph) weird or surprising. I'm not saying that, but... (pause) I guess it seems more obvious to you than it seems to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, I'm not saying it doesn't make any sense. (chuckling) But, but... (pause) But doesn't seem... do you know why it is? [00:22:56] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Why I get frustrated and why I get confused? Or why I get confused in situations like that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not at all surprise that you're confused by that situation. I mean, fuck, you have three employees telling you different things at same times and different times and yea, yea...sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, I don't know. (pause) I mean, I get frustrated when I'm confused a lot in a lot of different circumstances. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there something about this that has to do with putting yourself in other people's hands? I guess that's how it's gone in a lot of these situations is that confused but you're also, it's related to asking for help. I mean, even with, "Get my sandwich." (chuckling) [00:24:02] </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yea, or "Put cream in my coffee, damn it." (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's all right. It could have been more your kind of thing? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does the phone seem related? Like, in other words, let's say you, just as an experience, stop by the hair cut place to talk to them about an appointment and I imagine you have a similar interchange.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it wouldn't be... you wouldn't anticipate it would be as frustrating? [00:24:59] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. (pause) Yea, I don't know, I guess. (pause) Yea, I don't know. (pause) Because it would be the exact same exchange. So why would one be less kind of anxiety-inducing than the other. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be you had more contact face-to-face communication and so maybe you'd have more confidence that it could be easily resolved.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems like the sort of... like, one likely possibility. [00:26:09] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I really think] (ph) that's it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also really frequently mishear what people say on the phone. It's really upsetting to ask someone to repeat themselves two, or three, or five times before I finally understand what they're saying. There have been times where I've had to ask people too. I'm like, "I'm sorry. I can't understand you. Can you spell out what you are trying to say?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's mentally frustrating and embarrassing. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so? Frustrating, sure. Embarrassing? [00:27:01] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I don't know why. It just is. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One possibility with (inaudible at 00:28:08) with frustration is that you feel kind of vulnerable when you're confused? [00:28:19] Especially if you're out and asking for help just in general for not knowing how things work or what's going on. And I think you sometimes respond to feeling like, kind of vulnerable or exposed that way by being angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Shocker. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You seem quiet. [00:29:12] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Just thinking about my dad. (pause) And how he gets angry instead of admitting that he's hurt. (pause) I don't think I've ever heard him verbally acknowledge being hurt or being sad, always anger. He doesn't acknowledge being scared either. [00:29:52] (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What ... [00:30:55] </p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me a little bit angry that so often these sessions end up with talking about my dad and his issues because these are my sessions, not his sessions. But at the same time, like so much can be traced back to his neurosis, I guess, for the lack of a better word. (pause) </p>

<p>Dad doesn't like getting on the phone either. He refuses. He'll have mom call for anything business related. So mom will make appointments with... well, make doctor's appointments for the kids, dentist appointments as they needed to see their (inaudible at 00:31:40) because they are of a generation where you don't do all their stuff on the Internet. They actually (chuckle) do a (inaudible at 00:31:47) office in person. </p>

<p>Mom would call and make the appointments. She did everything involving the phone except calling my dad's family. Or in my dad's case, I think, I'm not sure, but I think it's because he was self-conscious about his accent and he's difficult to understand on the phone. [00:32:08] He has a bad accent. (pause) So I don't know, maybe I just don't like the phone because I got it from my dad. It might be that simple. (pause) </p>

<p>When I was job hunting in the spring, a lot of places where I applied wanted to do a phone screen before they brought me in for a real interview. Those were just horrible. [00:33:03] I ended up getting to take Ativan before each and every one of those phone screens. I just couldn't get through it otherwise. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I imagine part of what you're saying you're angry about is: how much of an influence your dad remains and how much that he continues to take up in your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. [00:33:56] (pause) I was about to say that I feel like it'd almost be easier if he were actively malicious or actively hostile. And I realize that he is pretty malicious and hostile. He just doesn't think he is, so maybe... so the phrase, "kind of actively malicious or actively hostile" isn't... doesn't really apply, right? It's the wrong phrase for what I want to express which is, I don't know. (pause) I don't know. [00:35:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was the point even through just... by my being correct (ph) where you were going to say that it would be, in some sense, easier if he was more of the real bad guy... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...out there in your life now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Than having this sort of, I don't know, active (ph) at a distance from your childhood or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I meant more like... (pause) if he was more, kind of, classically evil, right? [00:36:02] I mean, so there are kind of, just parents who just beat their kids, and are neglectful, and are clearly abusive parents. Whereas with my family, it wasn't as clear that what was going on was abusive because they provided for our needs, and were engaged with the school, were active in the PTA. Where from the school's perspectives: model parents because they chaperoned field trips and acted like caring, loving parents who just extraordinarily fucked us up. (chuckling) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, some of those physically abusive—and not as much the neglectful ones, but the abusive ones certainly—they're sometimes on the PTA... [00:37:06] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...too. And... (pause) You don't actually talk that much about your mom and things she's done or said to you. Much more about your dad and the things you said about him, very clear cut. I understand —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not as clear cut to me, maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, absolutely. And that's no surprise. But, yea, I imagine we're both on the same page like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (pause) But he says he did everything he did for our benefit, and he claims he did the best he could do, and that might even be true. [00:38:08] (pause) And sometimes I feel guilty even criticizing him. Even very gentle criticisms because there is this constant message when I was growing up—and especially when I was in college—of, "We've sacrificed so much for you. We love you so much, and we've given you so much, and we did... you never wanted for extracurricular activities, and we've had tutors for you, and we gave you the best education possible, and..." [00:38:57] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are they all true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Well, no, but... (chuckling) There were many times when they did not support my educational goals because they thought my goals were stupid, because they didn't understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My point was that—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The harm they did was really mostly to do with other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (pause) It's the whole, "we've sacrificed so much for you" that really gets me. Because the way they frame it, there's this implicit, "and you owe us because we gave you much" when... I mean, those were choices they made so what's (ph) a classic examples that my dad will always bring out is, "Our neighbors would hire babysitters and leave their kids with strangers for hours at a time and go out for dinner and we never went anywhere without you. [00:40:28] We never took vacations without you. We never went to dinner without you." And it's like, that's a choice they made. They didn't ask us when we were kids if we wanted to always go out to dinner with them. </p>

<p>And, kind of, as an adult and as someone who wants to have kids and thinking about parenting strategies, it's completely ridiculous to never spend time away from your kids. That just sounds like a recipe for destroying your marriage. Never spend time as adults without shrieking hellions around. [00:41:07] (pause) </p>

<p>And so part of me understands that they're blaming us for choices they made and I don't have an obligation to pay them back for things that I never asked for. But, on the other hand, there is a part of me that does feel like I owe them in some sense. (pause) And it's not fair and I wish I didn't feel like I owed them because then my life would be much easier. (pause) Strayed far afield from the original topic. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No problem. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still bitter about the time I got disqualified from the science fair because I had the wrong kind of poster board for my presentation. Because my parents told me that I was stupid for telling them I needed the foam trifold poster board and that I could just use a sheet of just regular —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:42:33) non-folding poster board.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. They actually said... I came home and I told them that I needed this foam tri-fold display board instead of the poster board that they bought. They actually said that I was stupid for challenging them. And who knows more? Them, with their 40 years of life experience or me, I was just a kid. I was like, "But my teacher said." And they were like, "Stop being an idiot." </p>

<p>And they made me do my presentation on the poster board and I got disqualified because... and (ph), it was a stupid rule. I don't know why the fair required that you have a particular type of poster board other than, I don't know, corporate (inaudible at 00:43:09) or something. The rule is kind of dumb and I can sympathize with my parents for thinking that the rule was dumb. But they called me, personally, an idiot for telling them that it was the rule. And then I got disqualified because they were cheap bastards and they didn't want to buy the $5 poster board. </p>

<p>(inaudible background conversation)</p>

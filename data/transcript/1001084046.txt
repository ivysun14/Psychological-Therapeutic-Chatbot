<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, good morning.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hi.  I, I've reached a level of anxiety that's not controllable.  I can't, I'm having trouble, I'm having trouble.  Um, it's just like holdin' on to something as tight as you can and not lettin' go.  Just constantly.  I went back to work and I'm having trouble functioning.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, I know that you've had a combination of things in the past, um, you've had some depression.  You've had some irritability.  You've had some frustration.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you've had some anxiety.  Are you still having kinda the mixture of all of that stuff?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, the depression is, I, I don't think I'm depressed any more, but just the anxiety is what I can't control.  Because I'm going to work and I can't be still.  I'm moving from foot to foot and just, I can't, I can't be still.  I can't relax.  I can't, my, it's just like holdin' on to somethin', yknow, with a fist, and I don't know, I can't, I've tried breathing exercises.  I've tried, that's really all I've tried, is just breathing exercises.  Just anything to calm down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, you are restless and you are, are you preoccupied?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty much, yeah.  To the point that I, I get something in my head and I can't let it go.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, is this something that's stressful,</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, very stressful.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of stressful things.  Is it things inside work or outside work?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'd say mostly inside work.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of work you doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm a [INAUDIBLE] phlebotomist.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so it has to do with the actual performance of your job.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does it interfere with your job?  I mean, does it interfere with your actual performance?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It's not, to my knowledge, because I'm still, I'm still able, I'm just, I'm just a bundle of nerves when I'm doin' what I'm doin'.  Sometimes I hit veins, sometimes I don't.  I don't think it interferes with the actual hitting of the veins, yknow, I'm not, I'm not physically hurting the patients or anything like that, I'm just, I get so worked up that I can't, I can't relax.  And I need to be relaxed to do this.  I need, I need some type of release to do this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, the, the being worked up is about actually having to go and draw blood?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if it is or not.  I really don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it the interaction with the people themselves?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, the people, the people, the interaction with the people themselves, I do fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I can talk to anybody.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, the donors are really special people.  They, they come in on a regular basis.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, you're working in a blood bank where you actually are drawing blood for transfusions, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I went and applied for the job and they trained me.  So -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Had you not done phlebotomy before?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've never been a phlebotomist before.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How did you pick phlebotomy?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I took a course out of UTA, a computer course, and was talking to one of the counselors and she said, yknow, I was asking what type of jobs were available, what the job market was like because I needed to get back into the job force and I didn't know what to look for and she talked to me about the phlebotmist course.  She just basically said pick up, pick up a career that you would like to do for the rest of your life because you're gonna be doin' it for 20 years, yknow, because I've got a good 20 years left</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, before I have to retire, or before I'm in any physical condition to have to retire.  She said something that's rewarding that you, yknow, enjoy doin', that sort of thing and I picked the phlebotomy class just because [INAUDIBLE] trains ya, they put you through the 8 week training course.  So, that's how I ended up in it.  Just, they had a job opening and they hired me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.  That's neat you would pick something at this point in your life and go do something completely different.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh it's, it is completely different.  I mean, and I had no background in it, no medical background at all.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you like it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, I like it real well.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.  So you are prep, getting patients ready, the donors ready, um, actually physically setting up the draw.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Handling the materials, supplies, equipment.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Handling the blood itself, getting it back to wherever it goes and do you do anything in the laboratory with it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  There's a separate laboratory.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're all, you're just a collection, collection site.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, how long have you been having this anxiety, agitation</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I, I've been having the anxiety and the agitation yknow since, well, since I started seeing you, to some degree.  The agitation with my husband, of course, that hadn't gone away.  That's, that's still there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I handle it a little differently.  I don't get as angry as I used to.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really.  How'd you do that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I, I'm, I just try to let it go.  Because, yknow, you told me, you come to the realization that he's not gonna quit drinkin'.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  You can only control yourself and not him.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But, it's just, I get in the car and drive and my knees ache because I'm so tense.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you taking any medication?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The only medication I take is Geodon.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, and your Geodon dose is how much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking 80 mg.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you're still on the same dose you were on before.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I cut it in half.  I was taking 160.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you were on, the last time you were here was November.  And you were on Geodon 80 at the time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You had reduced your dose before then.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, I had reduced it before that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And you had stopped your Lamictal at that point and</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Lamictal, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you had been on various other medications before that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just, I just wanna let go.  I just wanna, I don't know how to put it.  I wanna relax.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I see you've taken hydroxyzine before, you've taken Buspar before and you were on those quite a while.  Did they help with the, I mean apparently, you were taking those for anxiety.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think that the Buspar helped.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You took it for a long time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  But this is worse.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And hydroxyzine, do you remember that 1?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think it ever did anything.  I only had 1 prescription of it and I never got it refilled.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the, the, um, the issue that we look at is, there are several.  First of all, is this just you?  And you have just this anxiety that goes along with everything else you've had in the past?  And if you're taking Geodon, which is helpful for some of what you've had in the past 'cause you're still taking it apparently.  It still does benefit you.  Is this a Geodon side effect?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow, 'cause Geodon can produce this kind of thing as a side effect.  Um, and then if we think about treatment, do we provide, yknow, Buspar and hydroxyzine are the 2 medications which are most often used in people who have an alcohol history because they're the safest.  We can use Klonopin because it's a good medicine for anxiety.  It's a good medicine for restlessness, it's a calming medicine and it's probably safe for you.  The concern I have is if we start you on Klonopin, will it activate your alcohol.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've been sober since March 17th of last year, so, I've done with the alcohol.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but will this, will this aggravate your alcohol cravings.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I doubt it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's my concern.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's kinda a 2 edged sword.  We have to do something.  We can increase your Geodon.  That's a possibility, because you were on 160 for quite a while.  Will an increase in Geodon cover this?  Will it stop this activation?  And if this is a side effect of the Geodon, increasing the Geodon will make it go away actually.  Probably.  Then the question is, of course, what if it doesn't?  What if it makes it worse?  'Cause there are 2 mechanisms of side effects that occur.  So we have lots of options.  So, I think the thing we do is to do the, the easiest thing to do, the safest thing to do would be to notch your Geodon dose up.  That's the safest thing to do.  I mean it's easiest to do.  It's quickest.  We can do it today, basically, and you can see if it works. And you'll know in a few days whether it works or not.  And if it doesn't work, or if it makes it worse, then we drop back and do 1 of the others.  Because I just don't wanna put you at risk, because I know you had a long sobriety prior to May of last year.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> March.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> March of this last spring?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This past year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So, it's been over a year, a year and a half.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're talking March of '06, oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Have you ever taken Ativan?  You ever taken Librium?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't remember.  I don't think so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And Klonopin?  Clonazepam?  And Xanax?  Valium?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It's a total distraction for the people I work with, as well.  I mean, I'm supposed to present, um</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Of course.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A calm, serene</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Calm, serene, confident looking and be smooth and put people at ease.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  So, it's an occupation</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they've noticed me jumping from foot to foot and of course, the people I work with notice it as well.  But it's, I just can't, I can't be still.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, there's another option here and that is, if this is a side effect of Geodon, would reducing the dose help?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Reducing the dose?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, reducing the dose of Geodon.  And we can certainly try that.  Along with, and what I was thinking about, in my head about, what, what medicine should I use, I think Ativan or Lorazepam may be the best compromise between all the 1s that are available.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, let me get, I'll give you some samples of some, of a lower dose Geodon and we'll cut your dose down.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  I have a problem getting in to see you because I have to request off like 2 weeks in advance, just to arrange to take off.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that the same with any physician you'd see?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Any physician.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b>  I'll get you some samples.  Be right back.  I have 20's and 40's.  So what you might do is reduce your dose to 60, say for 3 or 4 days, see how you do.  If you get improvement, you can stay on 60.  If not, drop to 40.  'Cause I think it'll still cover, like the Geodon will still cover you.  I mean the lower doses will still cover.  This is Lorazepam.  And you can take, make sure that it's dry, still using a fountain and it's wet.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is this a tranquilizer?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, yes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> How often do you take it?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Up to 3 times a day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> How many refills?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Two.  I probably should see you in 2 weeks.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me just take these.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm gonna [INAUDIBLE] this.  Am I seeing them again?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, yes, let me just.  Thanks.  Now, you done stayed in the hospital for 4 days?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 3 days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And what did they do in the hospital?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nothin'.  They just took me off the Effexor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Took you off the Effexor and did things stabilize after you got off the Effexor?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I didn't have that impending, I'm think I'm having a panic attack.  I think I was having a panic attack which I lived with for several, a number of months.  But after that, I became lower in mood and, uh, I am sleeping, but uh</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, you're still taking the Gabitril.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And still taking the Geodon.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And your Gabitril dose is 16 mg a day.  Eight mg twice a day, or 2, 8's or 4, 4's.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Two, 8's, 4, 4's.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 4 4's.  So, 16 mg, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is it 4 or 8?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I have 16 mg total.  So 4</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so 4 times 4.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sixteen.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And your Geodon dose is how much now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sixty, 3 times a day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sixty 3 times a day.  That's going to 180.  And you're still taking the</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Gabapentin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Gabapentin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Eight hundred, 2 times a day, which I, I'd be willing to up one of those because, yknow, I'm really, I'm really struggling.  I saw Oprah this week about bipolar and boy did I ever identify with that.  I spent a hundred dollars this week that we didn't have the money to spend, yknow, and I might spend a little money every now and then, but not like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So the Gabapentin, you think, helps with your thinking?  Your judgment?  Impulse control?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I need some more impulse control.  But it keeps me where I'm not so</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When your Geodon dose was higher</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I'm afraid to drive with it higher because I had that wreck, but it makes me calmer and more, um, put together instead of being, yknow, I'm trying to think, like if you put more pencils in something, how it's tighter together?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It kinda pulls me together a little bit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Where I'm not quite as all over the place.  Does that make sense?  Is that possible?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, yes, yes.  So, you're not taking the Effexor now, or did you go back on it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, you're off of it.  Okay.  So, Gabapentin, so you could take 4 of the Gabapentin per day and you think it would help?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I'm sure it would because occasionally I'd do that because I'm not feeling good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let's do that, then.  Let's increase your Gabapentin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What are we gonna do about the Geodon?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Leave it the same.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Three a day?  Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that enough?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Honestly, I don't know.  I just know being this emotional, I know that I have not, I don't know if it was the Effexor that I went onto, or, I just remember being this emotional before and I don't remember which medication, yknow, kinda reined that in.  I don't know if that was the Effexor or if I was, yknow, it seems like the older I get, the more medication I need.  Is that possible?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Could we do this?  Could we add a little bit of Geodon extra?  Like 40 mg?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Extra.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And see if we can't kinda bring things under, get your thinking [INAUDIBLE] control and focus and, yknow, the emotionality and so forth.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I was looking at the weather as you were taking and you said something about reining it in and it's raining.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's a beautiful rain.  Not too heavy, not too light, just.  I think part of the reason I ordered something was because I wanted to get something in the mail.  Isn't that weird?  Yknow, it's, it's, that's why I buy.  It's the sensation of when I have it.  It's the fun to purchase it.  It's fun to get it and for years, I'd think oh, gee, what've I done. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And when you order something online, it's in your house.  I mean, there's no taking it back.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.  Well, I think the thing the doctor at the hospital must've been thinking was that the Effexor was driving some of this emotionality or make it worse.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I wasn't emotional.  I wasn't emotional before that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so do you think the emotionality is now coming because of the absence</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Of the Effexor?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let's do this.  Let's just for a week have you just add the Geodon and increase the Gabapentin.  Do it more often.  And let's see how you do.  If we need to start the Effexor again, we could.  I think the Effexor was probably started because of the depression component at one time or another.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was wondering, see, I ask, we talked about when I couldn't get a sample any more because is it Pfiser?  They was having trouble not getting out, it was some medication wasn't gonna give me, or you weren't gonna be able to help me with, um, samples, and I called in, I was at the pharmacy and I said by the way, will you give me 75 mg, ask my doctor to give me a refill.  Well, when it came back, it was 150.  And I didn't discuss with you did you mean for it to be 150?  Or, um, I just took for granted and then I thought about it later, what if I should ask him?  But I never thought about that when I was here because 75 had worked for me for a long time and I just thought well maybe he thinks I need more.  What's it been, 4 to 6 months?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You've been on Effexor 75 in March of '06.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And then</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was either the first of this year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Then you went to Timberland</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hmm?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you came out of Timberland on Doxepin 10, Geodon 60 twice a day and Gabapentin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And then, by January of '07 you were taking 150.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, see and I don't know where the 150 came from.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I meant to ask you before now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let's, let's hold off on it and see.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And see how you do.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So will I have to have another prescription of Geodon?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Same prescription.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't have 40's.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'll give you some.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll give you some.  Let me get some for you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I had 40's this morning.  What I have left are 20's.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that'll work.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  See, I used to take Depakote.  Is that a mood stabilizer?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I changed doctors and somewhere that got changed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Call me in a week, would you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or, I'll plan to see you in another, I'll see you in a month for sure.  Call me in a week, let me know how you're doing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Let's make it 2 weeks 'cause I don't like the way I feel.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Two weeks.  You got it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  It this a picture of [NAME OTHER]?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, that's [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].  This is</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Those are both [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He was in Europe?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, he was a Canadian doctor who ended up in Baltimore and then went to England.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, I will see you then in 2 weeks.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

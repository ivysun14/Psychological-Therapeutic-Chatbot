BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: How’s it going?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [I feel so much better] (ph) when I don’t wait out there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Either I’m late or on time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would guess that would be true for other patients, too, but maybe not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t know. [0:00:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did you have a good weekend?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I did have a good weekend, yeah. How about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [I had a really good weekend] (ph). My folks are in town.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They’re leaving town now. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was the visit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was good, it was short. It was the dance… Indian classical dance recital (inaudible at 0:01:43).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [It’s a] (ph) kathak (sp?) dance academy, and…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, it’s what? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s a kathak dance academy? [0:02:00] And my parents… all of us feel so grateful towards… the cousin is her husband and then his wife.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Raoul and Paula] (sp?). We feel a lot of stored up love and gratitude towards them. They’ve just done a lot in a lot of different ways over the years. So people made a lot of effort to come to her dance recital. So they were just here for, I don’t know, 20 hours?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The dance recital was so cute. There were adult women dancing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [0:02:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there were also these tiny little girls, this big…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: 14 of them…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in really colorful outfits, doing really hard stuff. The… do you know about Indian classical dance?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mentioned you did. I mean, it’s a storytelling form. So there’s a lot of emphasis on facial expression and subtle movements.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they all wear bells on their ankles. Yeah, it was irresistibly cute. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So was the recital for a school that she (crosstalk)? [0:03:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the academy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause) Very cute. (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. A lot… all of them, all the little girls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they had their hair in long braids with jasmine, and, I don’t know, they were totally so affectionate towards the teacher, which is (inaudible at 0:04:49). (Pause) [0:05:00] How do you know about Indian classical dance?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I knew somebody growing up who was pretty involved.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:06:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it? What’s on your mind? </p>

<p>CLIENT: All the things that I did this weekend and all the things that happened to me. (Pause) A lot of things made a big impression on me, and it’s hard to be engaged with you about it sometimes because it’s not (pause) a normal conversation. [0:07:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it’s easy to communicate with you. I don’t find it hard to talk or to talk about what I want to talk about. It’s just… I don’t know, maybe there’s a filter or a use-my-time-wisely pressure that I feel?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they’re not related. I’m just thinking about how to weave a story and whether or want to at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [0:08:04] (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you have a cat? (Pause) [0:08:58] I look for cat hair on you sometimes when (inaudible at 0:09:02).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. (inaudible at 0:09:06) amounts of cat hair on my sock there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Usually there aren’t. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really? That’s surprising. I believe you, but I (crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, not ever before that I’ve noticed. And I look. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh (chuckling).</p>

<p>
CLIENT: Do you see what I resort to? It’s pretty silly? It’s kind of fun, too. I guess I could have just asked you way back when, when I had the feeling you had a cat. But I… [not as fun] (ph). (Pause) [0:10:00] How does it work for you to meditate when you’re gone from home?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I imagine it works very well here, but in a way here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Crosstalk). Oh. It depends on, I guess, time and quiet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or even at home, just on weekends? [0:10:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Time and quiet (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:11:08) there’s not much of either one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn’t think so. So just sort of take what you get?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I usually get up earlier, stay up later, (inaudible at 0:11:22).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I’m imagining, if my parents had a practice… well, maybe they did before we were around. Both of them have a practice of prayer and some kind of sitting quietly, in the morning for my mom, and my dad… and at night for my dad. But it’s totally like, Dad! Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr (sp?)! [0:11:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Running around, and he’s just sitting there and (laughing), and…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Things break, going to bed, everybody’s misbehaving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah. (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I’m having a really hard time expanding my practice to anywhere that’s not… I don’t know, it’s… I think it’s… I think it will come. Sometimes I can meditate really well in this closet we have in lab…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>
CLIENT: Because it’s a breastfeeding room. People tend to not… it’s locked, but everybody has a key. [0:12:56] But if you’re breastfeeding you can put a sign up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I took my parents and Jeremy to Meditation Center (sp?) last night. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Jeremy was doing all the bells… or bowls… sound bowls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They have different bowls for (inaudible at 0:13:27)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. We did that for five minutes. It was really nice to show Jeremy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Had he not been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, (inaudible at 0:13:40).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, and the… almost on principle. [0:13:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What principle is that? The principle that his wife’s trying to get into (crosstalk)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or he knows his wife really wants him to do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: 20% of the time do I indicate that I want anything from him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The rest of the time it’s just, this is so great for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I want to share it with you, because it’s great. So I think it made a big impression on him, how beautiful it was and how clean it was. Have you been there? It’s a very special place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [0:14:57] (Pause)</p>

<p>
CLIENT: I considered living there for a second. There’s a room open?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: One person lives there in one room. But it’s kind of a restrictive… I think that there might be a time in my life where I view the constraint as being freeing…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it might be a nice time to do it. But right now I view it as being obstructive, so it’s not the right time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You can’t drink alcohol, and you have to be a vegetarian. And you can’t make a lot of noise. You have to sort of be around when the center closes at 10:00 every night. [0:15:57] (Pause) But you have access to all the teachers, and you have responsibility over the whole house. You have access to the meditation hall all the time. (Pause) I think it would be amazing to be a meditation teacher.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But it’s superficial because I don’t actually know the mind. [0:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What distinguishes the people who are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. There’s not really a hierarchy, it seems like. But there are guiding teachers who are the leaders, I guess, of the center. And they tend to hold the retreats and do a bunch of the heavy lifting when it comes to figuring out what gets offered and what the structure is and what the tone of the center is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s not a particularly… I mean, it’s not a ritualistic place at all, and it’s not… the teachings are so practical, and that seems to be their main goal. [0:17:58] So there isn’t a lot of proscribing they have to do. But they’re old. They’re in their 70s, and there are three of them, a husband and a wife and a younger guy. And that… but then there are a bunch of people who come in and will teach a workshop or a class. There are practice leaders who sit… who will ring… sound the bell at the end of the sitting every day. So (inaudible at 0:18:42).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>
CLIENT: And the guiding teachers have lived the monastic life for a whole bunch of their life. I guess that’s probably the most important thing (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [0:18:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They’ve gone to… (Pause) I don’t really pay attention actually to the (inaudible at 0:19:17) monastic life and has studied under the enlightened (inaudible at 0:19:38). (Pause) Yeah, and they’re the ones who hold the seven-day silent retreats and the fourteen-day silent retreats. Have you been on a retreat? (Pause) (inaudible at 0:20:39).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it’s hard. (Pause) [0:21:00] That desire is challenging. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it conflicts with other things? Or do you mean in its own right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:21:33). I don’t know what… which of my thoughts about you and about this are to support and care for and protect and which ones to just sort of observe and let go. [0:22:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And that’s one of those sort?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) I was in for six weeks. Monday… the last five Mondays have been the hardest days of the last five weeks (pause), very hard. [0:22:58] (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What sorts of things have you felt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very, very sad, really off-balance and (pause) jet-lagged? It’s kind of like this disorienting transition day. (Pause) [0:23:58] There’s not really much momentum yet for the week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I’m usually more tired, and I usually (inaudible at 0:24:15) the most. I’m usually the most conflicted. I’m the most upset, the most challenged by (inaudible at 0:24:28). (Pause) [0:24:57] Mostly I hate (ph) Monday afternoons and evenings. And then something happens on Tuesday morning where I feel recharged, and I feel like I… time away from you is an opportunity and restful. And there’s a lot more buoyancy and momentum from other things that sort of tend to hold me more?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It just started, and I don’t know why it started. [0:25:59] (Pause) Five or so weeks ago it started. (Pause) [0:27:00]</p>

<p>
THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What aspect of this are you thinking about? [0:27:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess I’m trying to figure out kind of what to make of it. I mean, there’s a part of it which seems just kind of… it’s sort of the rhythm of weekends and weeks and pulling yourself together for the week. And part of it on Tuesday morning seems to be that you’re kind of more pulled together for the week, and you have stuff you’re occupied with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there seems more, too, than that. But I’m not sure. I guess two of the things you’ve said that have struck me so far today are one with Jeremy and mediation. [0:28:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s a big deal in its own right but also seemed to me to echo things that happen here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there (ph) was talking about meditation and (inaudible at 0:29:25) CIMC because that in a way sort of is a place that we share. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it feels pretty normal (ph) to talk about meditation here. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And… (Pause) [0:30:00] I guess… I think it’s a way that, [because you’re with me] (ph), you sort of know that I’m there with you…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a way that’s sort of really more personal for… or really is personal for me and that is endowed with other things. I mean, I’m hopefully (ph) there, but it’s unclear how much of that… being there with you versus what’s also… or to what extent it’s kind of a part of my own life, what you’re talking about. [0:31:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, I think you’ve said many times that… you’ve asked whether it feels like you’re not (inaudible at 0:31:18). I’ve always said no because [I think to them] (ph) I’m just sick, so that (inaudible at 0:31:37)? And I think it does feel like you’re not here with me all the time, but not in the way I think I understood before. I don’t think you’re anywhere else. I think (pause) you are deeply invested…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [0:31:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) are listening, and I think it’s hard. It’s not something that feels automatic to me (ph), or doesn’t seem to. But (pause) you’re not… (Pause) [0:33:00] I’m not inside you? So somehow that influences how it feels, how it feels like (inaudible at 0:33:25).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. I think in some sense sort of meditation is more like you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know why you told me that you had a meditation background. [0:33:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn’t seem to be consistent with the other… (Pause) I don’t think I know why you do most things yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:34:23) (Pause) You told me a long time ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it isn’t consistent. (Pause) [0:35:00] It isn’t consistent. It doesn’t seem to me to have been bad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it’s one of the reasons why you feel very (inaudible at 0:35:23). I don’t know if that’s what you want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know how much you want to influence how you… [how right you feel for me] (ph). [0:35:59] (Pause) I mean, most of it you can’t help. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m… I’m okay with influencing that… [ways that you feel about me] (ph) actually (inaudible at 0:36:55) (pause), not for the sake of influencing that but just as things like that come up. [0:37:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Pause) I got a bikini wax on Friday…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: By accident? My friend Kali (sp?) was visiting for the night, and I thought that she had signed me up for a leg wax and then showed up. [0:38:00] (Chuckling) And the…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I knew that Kali was getting a bikini wax.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, it was like, no, sorry, I don’t have time to do a leg wax. So I had to make a choice, and I decided to go for it. I’ve never had it done before professionally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hair removal has been part of my life since I was 11,various (inaudible at 0:38:33), electrolysis, (inaudible at 0:38:38). It was a very traumatic part of my childhood to have facial hair and arm hair and other kinds of hair (inaudible at 0:38:50).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Can talk about that some other time. [0:38:58] Pretty secure… I feel really secure now. But this bikini wax is kind of a special thing. Do you know about it? Do you know what a bikini wax is?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I know what waxing is. And I know what a bikini line is, so…</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckling) So it’s a lot more than a bikini line.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, [I guess it’s something you have done] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It made such a big impression on me. It was like a radical time quake. So you show up, and you remove your underwear. And you’re just lying there, and it was so nice to have this woman spend all this time… I don’t know, grooming seems like the wrong word, caring for me. [0:40:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I’m bald. I’m nearly bald. There’s a tiny little patch. And she waxed… she waxes the inside of your butt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s totally radical.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn’t have… I didn’t even know I was doing this. For the whole time you’re so vulnerable, and I felt a mix of deep gratitude, because it was kind of like the wild, wild west. I’d never had it done before, and you’re supposed to do stuff to prepare, trim. [0:41:02]</p>

<p>
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So anyway, after a long time and kind of a lot of pain, kind of a lot of warm wax in all these places, I emerge as this hairless, very soft being. And right away it was like, I wanted to spend more time there. Jeremy wanted to spend more time there. We spent a long time just looking and feeling, talking a lot about (pause) what my vagina is and what it feels like, what it looks like. [0:42:04] And sex feels really different, better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels like a change in my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it changed Jeremy’s life, too. (Pause) Yeah, it’s totally different. I feel temperature more, I feel touching more…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:42:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it’s also a little conflicting, because I consider myself (inaudible at 0:43:02). I don’t need anything to be done to me to feel whole and strong and beautiful. And this is totally just complicated. The grooming thing needs to be done regularly. And it’s also… first it’s beautiful, aesthetically beautiful. And I’m not sure how I feel about (pause) that area being on display.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. We should stop. (Pause) [0:44:00]</p>

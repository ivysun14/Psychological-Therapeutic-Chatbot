<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so then now I always forget where the microphone is but I'm not sure if it matter, so we just put it here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where is it?  Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Again I'm not, maybe this little thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Could be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, it seems to, it seems to pick up so it doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's right here, hon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so, all right, now you should fill me in on what's happening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, ready?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay, I'm ready.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've had like, like this Thursday would have been, uh, uninterrupted 2 weeks of feeling great, of like feeling like, you know, like balance, even, grounded, you know, centered, everything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yet, I think it came to a close yesterday was it, Monday?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Monday night it came to a close.  Today is Tuesday, today is Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Wednesday, hon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Tuesday was like whatever, like irritability and unsettling—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm, I'm amazed, it's like a miracle, I'm surprised that I went so freaking long, I went close to, just under 2 weeks.  I went near 2 weeks of, of a great mood, a good mood, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stable, like better than stable, just like an elated type of, you know, an elated type of mood.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Elated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, elated is not what we're really shooting for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, balance, even, everything is, you know, conditions not withstanding.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, uh, well, so let's, let's define—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not high or anything, none of that freaking [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's define feeling good as normal or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and elated usually means very, very happy so elated, when we talk about bipolar disorder usually means elevated, so you're not talking about elevated, you're talking about good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean up, up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you would agree?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was he a little energized or elevated?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, the thing is, is that he's not sweating the small stuff like, you know, the little things, like maybe with his job or something with just making like, make it a bigger issue than what it is and he's, he's learning to, it is what it is, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sometimes you can't like, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Can't make big things out of it but he's been really good lately.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm been using the serenity prayer, like I've been going on these commitments—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two, three, up to possibly four a week that I go to hospitals—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right,</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Institutions, jails and carry the message of, of experience, strength and hope to the, to, to, to you know, people, men behind, people behind the walls.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's really been helping, that's been helping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's very helpful, you know, in doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, and then somebody told me like something about saying the serenity prayer, meditating the serenity prayer, they said the our father but I know the serenity prayer a lot better, like for the last 8 years—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before and after meetings, we always say the serenity prayer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I've been saying the serenity prayer like, not once, but multiple times—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, repeatedly and it sort of like gets me into like a frame of mind, like an even breezy feeling good—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, just normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing crazy but nothing like, I used to go in cycles, I used to feel great for like 2, 3 days at the most, then I'd have like a freaking down, I had a down, not a depressing down but down nonetheless, a day or 2 and then I'd be brought back up, you know, it's like I would get back in the, in the, in the groove, you know, but I've stayed in the groove, on track for, coming up this Thursday would have been 2 weeks but now Monday night something happened, like maybe some negativity and I, you know, and then some concern and then like the manager but I'm okay, I mean I'm still like, uh, overriding it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'll have to say it concerns me a little bit that you're having periods of feeling a little this or a little that because for a long time you had described it as, as kind of steady.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, steady but I'm always, something happens, it's sort of like it doesn't throw me but it upsets me and I start obsessing, it's like my addictive nature takes over and I start obsessing, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you think this is the best you've felt—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This week or two?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, these 2 weeks are the best I've ever felt, ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you've had other times—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Consistently, consistently.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right, so, so you've had other times that you've felt as well but maybe only for a day or two, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, exactly, for a day or two, then something happened right, like I'm be immersed with something, I just like it'll, it'll like overwhelm, somewhat overwhelm me—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he almost—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To the point where it's effecting, I'm becoming irritable, angry, you know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It could be something that maybe someone in his group might have said something that, you know, I tell [PATIENT NAME], try not to take things too personally either because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you know, in, in, in that respect, I mean he, I have to understand that if it's somebody in his program and it's they're harming themselves, it could probably harm him too because it's a very close knit little group he has there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, you know, but I mean like with [NAME OTHER] on Monday, you were trying to tell me like, well, if it's effecting him then it's going to effect me because you are close with him, you know, and he considers you a friend and you don't want to see him get hurt but you don't want it to effect you either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's the same way, if he's feeling great, I feel I can't help but feeling good myself, you know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Someone that, you know, general interaction, just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Overall.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, you know, but I mean you've been, you kind of let it go and that's it, you know, you'll have a talk with him and, you know, it's just, you know, it, it, it's true though, I mean he's learning not to take things so like personal, you know, where it does maybe make him angry or a little bit upset but not to the fact where he's depressed or anything like that, nothing like that, you know, I think he just worries about his friends if anything, you know.  Yeah, no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Correct me if I'm wrong, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the last time you were here, and it's been about 2 months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's when I'm, when I'm not living in the moment, that's what it is, I've been living in the moment for close to 2 weeks, that's the best I can put it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the now.  Now if something happens, it disrupts the moment, it, I get stuck in before or after, you know, before is, uh, is resentment and, and, and I'm currently angry and after would be the fear, you know, feeling the fear.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well, it's been 3 months since we did anything different and so I don't suspect that it was medication, I suspect—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Growth, it was just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everyday—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Perhaps you got more used to this new manager, you know, you're more in a groove as you said.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, she freaking threw some freaking hurdles at me, you know what I mean, starting yesterday, like I'm being watched, like the eagle, I don't want to see that movie because I'll freaking go into like, uh, what do you call it, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	State of mind is you start thinking—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that movie—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's happening to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, flashbacks or something with the eagle eye, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I don't know the movie.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's being watched, you know, somehow satellite camera or something, voice and everything, FBI type of, uh, you know, equipment that they use.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There was a Will Smith movie like that a couple years ago, Gene Hackman, you know, where they were being watched.  Um, enemy of the people or enemy of the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of the state.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Enemy of the State.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't think I saw it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it was pretty good actually.  All right, so what, what is your explanation, why do you, why do you feel that it happened in the last couple of weeks, was it just a run of good luck or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	More than good luck, I did some good work and I work on my spirit so it sort of sent me into a new, a new level, uh, uh, I don't want to say elevated but it elevated me, it advanced me into a new realm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you feel from working your program, you've gotten further—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's allowed you to live in the moment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, friends—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, you know, they're awful when—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	New friends, new, new, new, uh, acquaintances, you know, like I've been working real good with this [AGE] guy that has 49 years in the cleaning industry helping me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's been going to a new meeting—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A new meeting on Sundays.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Also on a Sunday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	During the week, I meet these guys, I spend time with them, like it's just been a better balance, you know, like I've been living more, more in tune—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, a lot more in sync—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Comfortably.  And now I'm not totally down now, you know, I'm not whoa is me, I'm not oh my God, I'm not like replaying the tape, I mean like I'm sort of digesting, deciphering and dealing with what's happening and like tomorrow I'm going to have to call in for whatever and then I'll mention some things to her then, I'll find things out, like I'm taking things as they come a lot better, like I'm, my acceptance has, has increased.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you think for many months you've been doing well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you've reached a new high but not being high.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just a new, a new, uh, the best—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Plateau.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, a new plateau, okay, yeah, and you haven't seen any marked—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, actually—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Periods of—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Going down or elevated?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's, uh, you know, taking time out for himself, doing the things that he, you know, doing whatever and I haven't seen any like, like any like, as far as a depression of any sort, nothing like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, I mean I would—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I would definitely call you, that's for sure, [LAUGHING] if I would think something is, you know, not right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm getting the right amount of sleep every day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very good, all right.  Well, I think everything helps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's no question, everything helps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm constantly striving for improvement, constantly striving, you know, to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean you really are doing a lot of things—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just become better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, you know, things have gone well and, you know, considering from where you started, like everything has really gone in the right direction.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It certainly has—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I usually tell [PATIENT NAME] when I think he's overloading himself—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	As far as meetings, late work, I mean he knows I tell him to slow down and he's pretty good about, you know, yeah, you know, taking some time out for himself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You don't want to overload your mind either, sometimes it's not good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, what we've been talking about is how low can we go, how low can we go, that's the question and so 3 months ago we went from 5 a day to 4 a day and we sat there.  And when we first did that, you said that you felt improved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, there certainly has been improvement from that, I, I, I believe, I mean it, like a kink, like a little notch, you know, nothing, nothing—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	To big or nothing else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Extreme or anything but just like a little—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like put a little dent into it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so on 5 Lithium, was it on 5?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	One in the day and, uh, 3 at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Put the day back because I think I still need it in days, like for whatever reason.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, 1 in the day and 3 at night.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we were lowering the nighttime ones.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now when you were on 6 Lithium—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No energy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, hang on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sleepiness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you were on 6 Lithium, you had a level of around 0.7, okay, that's about a year ago that we got you to that level and I probably wrote it down on the next visit point, yeah, about 13 hours after the dose it was 0.68, so in fact the level was probably around 0.6 or 0.65, something like that, so on 6, so we can maybe guesstimate that if your level was around 0.6 on 6 pills, it was about around 0.5 on 5 pills and around 0.4 on 4 pills.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As a, as a, I mean very rough estimate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now people, there are people that do benefit from as little as 0.4 or possibly even lower, I have seen it, um, I remember learning that there are some people that Lithium passes very readily where it needs to get and in those people a lower serum level might be effective.  By your history, Lithium at this level did not work all by itself, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you were just on Lithium.  If you missed a few days or you dropped a dose or whatever—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I was on other stuff I believe, I know I was on a lot of other stuff, right?  It wasn't Lithium so much as the other stuff that really didn't work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When we started—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You were on Effexor and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I was on other medications.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	With it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, Lithium was always the mainstay, that's always been—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's always been there, I think since I started but along the way there's been like other medications, right, other medications introduced that really sent me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, but no, this is what I want you to understand, when we first met and it's just about 2 years ago, almost 2 years ago, the only mood stabilizer you were on was Lithium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were on Wellbutrin, you are on Effexor but you were on 2100 mg a day of Lithium, so now you're on 1200 mg a day, so at that time, you wouldn't have stayed well on a lower dose of Lithium but we subsequently added the Lamictal and then the Geodon, so the, it comes back to the same thing, we don't know if you would do well on 0 Lithium or on 2 Lithium or, we don't know what the lowest is, we're tempting the fates by going lower because we don't know if it's good until we try it and you do well for a, you know, an extended period of time.  We lower it to 3 and you do well for 6 months or a year, we probably, we figure, well probably he's fine on 3 in combination with the other medicines.  So it, it comes back to is this a good time to consider lowering it?  Do we need to lower it?  I mean are you still having side effects that you feel that you would like to shed from being on the Lithium and if so, is now a good time of the year, is there anything coming up that would make us want to just stand pat for a while, I mean those are the questions.  Uh, what, what's your thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it can only help, my mood is stabilized if I'm held tight, you know, if I'm kept in, I think it'll really help because, you know, with the energy level, the, the decreasing weight, just overall, just like more what, what was brought on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In terms of side effects—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With the, with the previous reductions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If we talk about side effects, I would strongly suspect that you feel even better in terms of sharpness, alertness, possibly tendency to, to hold on to weight with no Lithium but we don't know if that's a good idea because we don't know if you'd stay well on no Lithium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I have people on every different combination.  I have people on a little Lithium and something else and something else.  I have people on a lot of Lithium and a little bit of something else, you know what I mean, everyone is on a different combination.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's trial and error then?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It, there's no way, there's no way we can hook you up to a scanner and say you only need to be on 600 mg of Lithium plus the Geodon or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, there's nothing really pressing coming up for, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing really, no vacation, nothing is changing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Holidays in the next couple months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Holidays, Thanksgiving and then we go into Christmas, I mean it's, that's spent with family, that's spent locally and, uh, other than the season changing, I mean fall into winter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so you're voting to drop down to 3.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I would—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just drop down to 3.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would, I'd like to give it a shot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nothing happened when we went from 5 to 4?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You mean last time?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He is on 3, he's at 3 right now at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One and 3, 4 total.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, 1 and 3 and then the 2—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, [NAME OTHER] suggested at night would be the best thing, to leave the 1 in the day just for, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	My concern is, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like a safety net.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Day because he's up and about and out and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here's, here's what I have—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In April, we lowered the Lithium from 5 total to 4 total and then about 6 weeks later in June when we met, you had said you went back up on the Lithium because you felt more tense.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I grew—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then we went up on the Geodon and subsequently I've learned that, yeah, you really do need to be at 120 of Geodon to be assured of it working, so, uh, you felt improved, then we lowered the Lithium again in July and then you've been doing well ever since.  So again, I don't know whether we can now lower the, you know, the, the Lithium, you know, 1 pill every month or 2 and just off or whether we might need to be on a little more Geodon, in other words to be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know it, it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I follow, so replace, replace the whatever—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To provide, for further effectiveness, yeah, because it might be that on 120 Geodon you only need this much but maybe at 160 of Geodon, you could do with less—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or something like that but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We don't know without—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're not going to, we're not doing both the same way because that's your MO, you've never done both together at the same time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I usually like to make one move at a time, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So if we went down on the Lithium and then—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Up the Geodon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then if it's, it's needed to up the Geodon, I'm not sure if it would be needed but if so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can present it either way, we could, to hedge our bets, we could go up on Geodon—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And drop Lithium at the same time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, no, go up on Geodon this time, make sure that's okay and the next time lower the Lithium or we could lower the Lithium and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See what happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See if you need to be on more Geodon because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Again, we don't know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'd rather, less is best, right, isn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, theoretically but, you know, if we lowered the Lithium and you didn't do well, I'd feel badly I think that maybe we should have, you know, had you on a little more Geodon.  Now 120 is a potentially effective dose of Geodon and 160 may not be any better and might cause more side effects, so you're right, less is better, it's all trial and error, I mean it's informed trial and error but it is trial and error because every person is different, I can't say because I always do it this way it's going to work this way, that's not true, everyone is different.  So given what I've said, you would prefer to try and lower one more Lithium at this time without increasing anything else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes?  All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Here's, here's, just tell me [PHYSICIAN NAME]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm really watching myself, I mean I'm really carefully watched, you know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, tell me what I should be looking out for if we do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like the last time we called and we went right back to where we were, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I think were you 2—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not looking to feel any worse, that's, that's the whole, the thing behind everything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm looking to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what are the early symptoms that you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Increasingly get better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you have become manic in the past, what were the early symptoms?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It wasn't so much manic was it?  What with the Lithium when we dropped it and then we went back up?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Years ago when you had become manic, before I met you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sleep, couldn't sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Couldn't sleep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Constant sleep, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Around the clock, sleep a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not sleep a lot, I couldn't sleep, manic, when I'm manic, I'm not sleeping.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	When you're, oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're saying when he's depressed—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He sleeps excessively, all right, which is very typical, so if, if we lowered Lithium, uh, I'd be more concerned that you were going to get high rather than low but either one could happen, so we'll monitor and make sure that you're not starting to sleep less, all right.  Are there other early symptoms in terms of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Irritability.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Irritability.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was the last time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I remember, I just wasn't, I didn't feel, like I couldn't, I don't know what, if I could put my finger on, like maybe it was just a, uh, passing phase or something you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like a cycle running its course but now, but we don't want to chance it either so that's why—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel hyper or revved up or speaking faster, are those something that you notice?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You mean now with the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you become elevated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, I'm just, to much stuff in my head, I'm doing so much more thinking, you know, I'm, like was I psychotic?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like going through psychosis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it becomes severe, it would be psychotic but would you recognize it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you realize, I mean because a lot of times people don't realize it, they think I'm just chugging along, I'm doing great and they don't realize that they're sped up or hyper or absorbed in thought or having—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I recognize it, I mean, uh, I watch myself very carefully too as well, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To see like what I might be thinking, you know, just to gauge myself to know where, where I'm at.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what side effects are we trying to get rid of by lowering the Lithium?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, just improvement, overall improvement, uh, of health, you know, health, the health improvement and the weight, the weight would help, would benefit and the energy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has your eight been pretty stable in the last couple months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It has been.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my weight, my weight has been pretty stable.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, it has been.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Within 5 pounds.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he hasn't really lost like a significant amount.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you feel if we were to lower or possibly get off the Lithium, you'd lose significantly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, if we completely got off, you told me I would.  You mentioned before that I, that I should.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, remind me, when you first went on the Lithium did you gain a lot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, but I didn't know if it was the Lithium or, or there was so much more—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At that time, so I don't know which, which was which.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, all right, so you feel it's okay to drop it one more and we'll just watch it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	At nighttime, yeah, I'm more concerned during the day if anything, you know, if we drop the day one, how is, because I'm not going to be around to see him or watch—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, yes and no, the total, it's the total daily dose that matters, most people feel it wouldn't matter whether you took it 1, 1, 1, or all 3 at bed or all 3 in the morning, except in terms of side effects.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's the total daily dose, it's, it's having the level come down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We've done this very slowly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Is he—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's concerned about the levels, I mean the balance between day and night.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If, if we—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We took him down 1 at night, how fast, if there was a side effect, how fast would I see it, right away?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In other words if there was a, in terms of his mood symptoms, from days to weeks to months—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean because people with bipolar disorder, even untreated, some people might do well for weeks or months or years—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're on these medicines to prevent recurrent symptoms but we don't know exactly when you would have gotten sick, right, so we keep you on the medicine to just to prevent it.  So I think if it weren't a good idea, we would know in weeks to months.</p>

<p>
CG:	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But honestly, it could happen much sooner or much later than that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, for example, let's say he did great for 6 months and we left everything the same but then something upsetting happened and he got sick, we wouldn't know if he would have weathered that on a little higher dose of Lithium, you can never do a controlled study because you're either on this much or that much.  You can't have 2 [PATIENT NAME] and have one on this much and one on that much and see which guy does better.  So, uh, but this is exactly what we usually do is try and find a combination where you feel very well with the minimum side effects so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what I was thinking about earlier, excuse me, that I've been warm, you know, there's a song out by Tyler Perry, is that her name, what the hell is her name?  You know who it was, the girl who sings I kissed a girl.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I'm familiar with the, I, I know who you mean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's got a new song out now, it's hot and cold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, so I'm, you're, either you're hot or cold then she goes into front, back, up, down, you know, like the whole thing back and forth, you know, and then, um, it's, it's bipolar, it's a, she references bipolar, she's talking about I got the bipolar stuff she says.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the song, only once she mentions it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not like part of the whole lyric, lyrical though, so that's what I was thinking, I've been warm which is good, warm is a good state for me, you know, to be in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I guess when I'm real hot is like I'm, you know, close to getting burnt and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the cold, you know, I'm feeling a little cold now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, but you know, hopefully, I'll warm up and just override.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think my concern is, is that he's been on Lithium so long that it, it has helped him with the right other combination now that we're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do things fast too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Lowering it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sorry to interrupt but I just thought of it, you know, when I'm manic, you know, I do things fast, faster.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, and now that we're lowering it, you know, I'm going to be extra cautious just to be sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't, I'm afraid to lower too much because I don't want nothing to happen, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, at this point we're lowering it from a dose that can often be an effective dose to a dose that might or might not be an effective dose to be honest, you know now, although maybe we already crossed that line with [PATIENT NAME] because he was on 2100 mg a day—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which is a pretty, it's, it's a higher dose than average and now he's on kind of an average dose and we're lowering it to a below average dose that, that's more—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we replaced it with Lamictal and the Geodon, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We replaced it with Lamictal and Geodon and we're crossing our fingers that those allow you to be well without any Lithium but we don't know until we know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we'll try it, okay.  If there's a hint, even a hint of you're not feeling as well, then jump back on the, the 4 a day and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three a day, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me know.  Well, 1 and 3.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're on, I always think of the totals, so you're on 4 a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we're going to do 1 and 2, 2 at night?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I would do 1 and 2 and then I'd have to write you scripts for Geodon and how about Lamictal, I think everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You think so?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think so, yeah, it looks like, Wellbutrin, I think everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we haven't seen you in—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't even know how you got this far but okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's because she doubled up or tripled up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right, any other questions?  Uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just take it and see, right, take it and see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We have to just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get real paranoid, the slightest irritation or change, I mean I get sort of like paranoid because I don't want to return to where, you know, where I've been.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You've got to be, uh, you know, honest with yourself and everything if it's just not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I have been.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I want to feel as good as I can and if I'm not feeling good, you know, there's a reason.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The other thing I'd like to do is get the blood test again, it's been a year, I think it would be appropriate, all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When did they do the blood test, they do it Saturdays?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They do it on Saturday—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did it at Quest last year.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you want to have another one after this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think it's, it would make sense.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	How soon after he starts the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It doesn't matter—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, it doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It doesn't matter, it doesn't.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, if we want to get the new blood level, I would say at least 5 days, so we could say wait a week—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	After we lower it and then do it, how's that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Next Saturday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Next weekend, not this weekend, the following weekend.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And make an appointment, you know how they are Saturdays if you don't make an appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right, so I'm going to shut this off because I'm just writing prescriptions.</p>

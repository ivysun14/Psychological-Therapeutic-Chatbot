<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, have you been dying to know to hear about Friday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have. I've been—-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't even sleep at night. Oh, it was awful. </p>

<p>THERAPIS: Oh no. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It could have been a lot worse, but the attorney, seller's attorney, was very nice and very—. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, he was like, he was like I was just waiting to hear from you and— And I get an e-mail from-because he had closings too, so you know, he's, he's like, you know he's kind of in the same boat as I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, he's just at the whim of this stuff and— if I get an e-mail early on that I'm going to have, they got the transcript in and that I'm going to have docs at 1:00, so— [00:01:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And wasn't it supposed to be at 12:30?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It ultimately it got pushed back to 12:30. Originally, it was 11:00 and then 12:30 and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you're supposed to get docs at 1:00.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At 1:00, which means let's say I assume I really got them at 1:00, I still wouldn't be out the door until 1:30 quarter to two. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, and the seller's attorney had a 3:00 closing in his office. So, I basically called the, the borrower and said you know let's sign some point today and I'll get the seller's attorney first thing Monday morning. And originally it looked like I was going have to do it after my 4:30, like 8:00 at night because— </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have kids, but they came in at like 2:00. I got the docs at like quarter to two and just kind of put together the settlement statement. Printed out the docs and you know normally I put them in a specific order that I—. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just had them sign. [00:02:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And while we were doing the closing, they approved the HUD or had me make some changes to the HUD, so I was able to get that done and get up to my closing on one where the docs were fucked up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But not so bad that I think it's going to mess everything up, but you know, they didn't want to escrow for homeowner's insurance and of course, Thursday I had printed out you know, copies, you know, two sets of the the package before they realized this, so then she sends me a new package. I print it once again, twice and don't realize it until I'm at the closing that a lot of the documents still have the homeowner's insurance escrow on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I think this is—I think I'm, I'm lucking out in that you overnight the, the docs to the lender and they look at them when they look at them, but they use e-mail docs to approve funding, so that's all I care about is that I get funding. I can fix anything after a closing. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I was able to get the attorney to sign first thing yesterday. [00:03:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Drive right in to the city. Get right on record and I started getting all this shit coming. I was just like the— I just wasn't ready for it on a Monday. You know, where just all of a sudden I need this, I need that. You know, I had a one to one lunch with the guy from AFLAC and Jess wanted me to pick up Ian from school because I was taking him to Boy Scouts and she needed to get work done and so it's like I had all of this stuff I needed to do that I really didn't get done.</p>

<p>You know, I was just kind of like in triage mode just trying to get the purchase dispersed and taken, you know, get that taken care of. So, today is going to be a mop up, but I survived. Barely. (laughter) [00:04:17] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I even, I mean I picked up Ian and we went to dinner and then we went to Cub Scouts and there was a Webelo there which I never realized this. Webelos stands for we belong, we belong, we below—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are Webelos between Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They are, they are, and you know he was in full regalia and Ian was just blown away by all the different patches and badges and all the stuff that he can get. You know, he was just like ahh. And so he's all excited about getting his uniform and they made like scrapbooks to put all their stuff in and I I got a little testy with him because he wanted to-you know, they're making a cover for front of the notebook. It's a three ring binder and he, he wants to put it in the in the three rings, so he's trying to put holes in it and I'm like don't put holes in it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he ends up ripping it, and I'm just you know. He didn't seem upset by it, but I'm upset. I get upset by it. You know, I'm just like; just can't you just listen to me? You know, it's like I told you you're not putting holes in it. You know, I probably should have explained it's going to go in the front.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:05:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but, but other than that, it went pretty good. They had the parents—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm only laughing because it's familiar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you're a parent; you know how this shit goes. You're also the trained psychologist, so you should know how it goes, even if you don't have kids. Right? Sorry, but not really. You know, it's like law school. You know they teach you certain things, but everything else you've got to learn (inaudible at 00:06:13).</p>

<p>But, you know, they had the parents kind of, if we had any questions or whatever and I'm just like you know. [00:06:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, he's going to have fun with it. He wants, there's a camping thing this weekend</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he wants to go. It's like first of all I've got two tournaments, one on Saturday and one on Sunday and your mom doesn't want you camping because there, there's bugs out there that might get you. You know, you know, he doesn't know what to believe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know that he's ever going to get to go camping. I'm going to have to put my foot down at some point. I think they actually even do a winter camping thing. So, maybe we'll try and try and do that and— but he was totally excited. He had a blast. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's looking forward to it. [00:07:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you take him to a soccer game too? Was that this weekend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. He loved that as well. And, and he, you know, it's like when I think of the games I am not really sure he's watching the baseball game. You know-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He may be looking at the players or whatever, but I'm not sure he really is— </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Paying much attention to the game. He's talking to the guy next to him. He's looking around. You know, he's just taking it all in and— but the soccer game he was watching and there was just an awesome goal, it was the only goal of the game and the guy who scored the goal of course now is his favorite player and I didn't know and who is that, that what's his name? I was like I don't know the guy's name.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was the goal? What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just like he kicked it between like two defenders and all the way across and caught the goalie out of position.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just, you know, it's just really hard kick. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's like one spot he could have put it in and he put it in that one spot. [00:08:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was the goal, right. We were sitting like right behind the goal. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was just a really good shot and the, they are a bad team. You know, they're not a good team and then so they ended up winning, but so to figure out, I had to Google to find out the name of the player and it turns out Ian's favorite number is 14 because that was his number from t-ball and of course this guy's number is 14, so now it's like his favorite player. But I got him a hat and a t-shirt. We went to the pro shop. And it's funny because I had promised him a t-shirt and somehow that had he spun it that I promised him two t-shirts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugher) Amazing how that happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never said that. You know, you may have heard that, but I never said that. [00:09:08]</p>

<p>But, the, so, so it was the last game, so all that stuff was on sale. And they were out of most-like I think there wasn't even a shirt that fit him, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it was an adult hat, but you know you just— </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Adjust it and, so. And then the thing I was a little disappointed in the stuff they have there, especially for kids. You know you'd think that's their big market.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's all jerseys. It's like you know, you go in to the souvenir store and they've got all these t-shirts and stuff and it's almost like you've got to pick the t-shirt for the kid because there's too many of them. You know they pick the hat, you know.</p>

<p>It just wasn't like that. It's just the selection was really, you know-but, but he got a t-shirt and he likes it and he of course wore it to school yesterday, all day Sunday (laughter) . So, and Lucille seems to be getting along better with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When, when was it? Sunday morning when they came to pick up Ian, you know, sometimes, you know, I can't tell because we both come out and I can't tell if she's smiling because she sees Ian, who she really misses, you know, and like last night she apparently started crying because she wanted Ian— or is she smiling because she sees me because I always start making faces at her, you know. [00:10:40]</p>

<p>And, you know, they were going to the zoo. I'm like are you going to the zoo? And she's going to get to see the animals and she was like yeah. So, she didn't, sometimes she gets upset that I'm going to take her out of the car. You know she thinks that the-you know. I just thought she was doing better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know, I got work and shit to do. Title orders still slowly rolling in, so-scheduling, everything's— I don't know why I'm having such a hard time. It's just so much shit going on (sigh). </p>

<p>We were originally supposed to have a game tomorrow night and then they moved it to Thursday night and there's this thing at a restaurant. It's a fundraiser for the farm and they wanted someone on the board to go so I'm like I'll go, you know. I'll go. You know, I've never been there and, you know, and it was $45 bucks, but I was like you know, there's probably, you know, cocktails, really good, not cocktails, hors d'oeuvres and, you know, really good food. It was a cash bar, and so I signed up for that. [00:11:55]</p>

<p>And then they ended up switching the game back to Wednesday night because there's not enough people to play on Thursday nights.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like—So I really need to play.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To get ready?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To get ready for the tournament. Yeah, and, so I called the executive director and there are two other board members going</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So-I can bail. So, yeah, so, it's just, you know, it seems like that's all my day is doing. Even today, it's like, you know, I'm going to see my prescriber later and I forgot that I've got swimming so it's like I've got to call Jess and tell her I can't take Ian to swimming. It's just—everything just seems so overwhelming and just too much shit going on. E-mails coming through constantly and—. I don't know. [00:13:02]</p>

<p>Keeping home today. Hopefully I'll get a bunch of shit done. I still have six or seven files to open. I got another, a file I haven't even opened yet and they're looking for a title on it and it's just-it takes two months with most of them are going through the bank it takes 60 days to get through. So, I'm slow, you know, I'm using that. Which, you know, if it goes to a different lender, that wanted something, you know, like some of them want title before you even submit the loan package, you know, those I'd open up right away. </p>

<p>So, hopefully I can at least get a couple open tomorrow and-you know just, I don't know-I feel like I need just a, a bit of a break. [00:14:09]</p>

<p>I went to the game on Saturday, on Sunday, and really didn't feel that good to me. I didn't go, we drink Goldschlager. It's like our traditional thing that we do. So I had some Goldschlager shots and they didn't sit well. I didn't have any beer and I was almost tempted not to eat anything, but I, you know, had a hamburger and I just wasn't feeling that well. </p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of coughing and just have had all these lung boogers. You know, and I don't know. A lot of crazy morning puking going on, but today wasn't that bad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I woke up kind of dry and my nose wasn't that backed up. I didn't have to puke or anything like that. I dry heaved a little bit, but it's been, the last few days have been kind of rough, just-you know, like I'll have these coughing fits throughout the day. Surprising I haven't coughed at all at during practice you know it's like I'm running around and I thought for sure that, you know, that I'd have some sort of coughing fit, but I didn't. Kind of like a tickle. [00:15:37]</p>

<p>- (Sigh) </p>

<p>There's another e-mail someone asking for something. It's like when I went to work on when I went to the office on Saturday and— you know they want docs for funding, you know, look over the settlement statement, and the note, and the mortgage, to make sure everything's signed correctly which is it's like I'm a lawyer. You know, if I can't get a note signed correctly, you know, I should be disbarred, you know. To get initial, initial, signature, you know, and but I guess people do fuck it up or else they wouldn't ask for it, you know. [00:16:36]</p>

<p>So, I sent it over on Saturday and of course this morning I get an e-mail, you know, send over the funding docs. I'm just like you know, they can't fucking, just, they lose everything, you know. And then I got an e-mail 10 minutes later to disregard it, so I guess she found it. But I thought it was weird because they were calling me yesterday to verify my wiring instructions. So, I was like wouldn't you order the wire and wouldn't they verify my instructions after you've ordered the wire? So, I don't know. It's just-but I hate that a lot of times you do the same thing over and over again. You know, make this little change, do this, do that, just— [00:17:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I remember on Friday having trouble getting to what was so much the problem and I don't know talking about it or not. I guess I it's all more clear now that. It's sort of just all the crap there is to deal with like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Managing it all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anticipating that, you know, while you're doing the next thing you're doing three more things are going to crop that you have to deal with and two of those are going to be a real pain in the ass and that will require you to make other arrangements like that are going to be a pain in the ass. [00:18:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I was walking out the door and they called to verify the wire instructions and it's just like, you know, I ordered a wire yesterday for the seller and I get a call that they want it to sent to PO box for the send to for beneficiaries address on the wire. It's just like all these extra little things that take five, ten, 15 minutes, but they add up, you know, just— [00:18:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they're annoyances. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it's not like 5 or ten minutes of having fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Sometimes I wish I could just work at a coffee shop. You know, I don't think I'd make a lot of money, but I'd probably be happier.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a little too late though, but —I've got money now which is good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. That's a good thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (coughing) I, first thing I did was take fourteen hundred bucks and send it to my landlord, so I just sent him a check, so I just two days later sent him another check yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, just get it out so that's getting me a little more caught up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How, how close are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea, really. [00:19:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little closer than you were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well one of them was just the current month, so one was a catch up month and one was the current month and—you know, but you know the loan's going to fund on Wednesday and that's going to be almost a thousand bucks and then as these things start closing they'll be between $800 and a thousand bucks each, plus any other work that comes in. </p>

<p>So, my landlord tenant people, she texted me that she sent the money, and but I haven't gotten it yet. And, yeah, it's just, you know—Like I constantly feel like I need a break from, you know— </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then when I kind of get a break, I just, you know, it's like I didn't go to the pub last night and came home. For some reason I came home. For some reason I thought the debate was at 7. I was watching the end of the debate and I'm just like neither of these guys deserve to be President, so—. [00:21:15]</p>

<p>I mean, I'm socially liberal, so of course I want Obama to win, but you know, it's not good when your, your, for your, your main campaign tactic is to just tear down your opponent and that's basically his tactic. So, I mean it's easy, it's Mitt Romney, you know. It's not like there's not a lot of stuff to work with, but-but we may need to do triple sessions if Romney gets elected. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ha. Alright. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you're like fine, sure, whatever it takes because I always back away from the out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:22:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm kind of sick of all the crap on Facebook about politics, you know. You should be able to filter posts by, by topic, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not really on there, but I know what you mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, like you can choose who shows up in your newsfeed and I've got a cousin who does a lot of political posts, you know. He's a big gun advocate and just you know super right wing, you know. He lived his, you know, childhood and teenage in the South, so, you know, he's pretty conservative. But he also has all this other stuff that's funny and or you know, interesting, or you know, so it's like you know my mom has hidden him from the newsfeed, but it's like I don't want to because I like the other stuff. It's just the—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know and it's all, you know, it's like, like I try and tell people, it's like for every complaint you have about one candidate I can give you the same complaint about the other candidate. You know where one has done one thing and lied in some way and the other one has lied in some way, you know. So, it's not all-I don't know. I'm kind of glad I wasn't a political science major, but I mean at least it's interesting, you know. There is a lot of psychology involved. I don't know if you find it interesting. [00:24:08]</p>

<p>They did a study where they, they would determine people's ideology by asking them a series of questions (coughing) and then they would give them fact patterns. Either ask them questions about fact patterns or ask for their interpretation of the fact pattern and overwhelmingly how people perceive the fact pattern was based on their ideology.</p>

<p>So, this idea that, you know, there I guess there are people in the middle who really do, you know, go back and forth between one party and the other and one candidate and the other, but-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think most people—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like you see somebody standing by the side of the road with a bag in their hand. What do you make of it? And it's either like oh no somebody whose car broke down or got stuck somewhere, you know, I wish there was something I could do, like you know, that's (inaudible at 00:25:18) about .</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably hoping somebody will stop so they can help them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's probably some oversimplification, but yeah, that's the gist. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's it, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know somewhere there's this thing that, you know, and I think they caught people saying it, but maybe People think that Obama is giving them a cell phone, like an iPhone, you know, and it's just like, exactly, but there are conservatives who truly believe that there are people who believe that, you know, Obama's going to get them iPhones and that's why they're voting for him. [00:25:59]</p>

<p>It's like no, it has nothing to do with the fact that they're black and he's a black President and they are proud and they want to vote for a black, you know, that has nothing to do with it. Or that blacks just don't vote for republicans. (laughter) </p>

<p>It's like I find politics interesting, but I'm overwhelmed with it at this point. Sick of the commercials. Sick, sick of Scott Brown. Sick of Elizabeth Warren. I think neither one of them would make a good Senator. I like Mike Capuano. Do you know who Mike Capuano is?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he the rep? [00:26:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's a smart guy. You know, he, he takes positions and he stands by them. He was against the Iraq war, you know, he's pro-business. It was the first that had competing cable companies when he was mayor. And so, he, you know, he's socially liberal, but he understands business, you know and just-</p>

<p>And he, people don't like him because, you know, he went to Harvard and he's got a heavy Mass accent and he's somewhat arrogant, you know, and, and kind of talks down to people instead of, you know, but that's the thing. People shouldn't be voting on someone's, you know, personality. Whether they get the, you know, touchy feely from them. They should vote on whether they are competent to do the job, you know.</p>

<p>That was the thing that drove me crazy about George Bush. It's just like oh, he's just such a nice guy. And it's like yeah and I'm a nice guy and would you vote for me for president? And most people would be like, you're not a nice guy (laughter). So-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When I first saw George W. Bush I didn't think he was a nice guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's not, but he's the kind of guy you'd want to have beer with, you know, or a line of cocaine or whatever he did in college. [00:28:31] </p>

<p>I don't know. You know, it's like I want to play in the tournaments this weekend, but I kind of also want a weekend of, you know, not doing anything, but it will be the end of the season and just not having to play the last couple of weeks, it was kind of nice playing last night. I wasn't too terribly out of shape. It was hard to tell because I didn't ride my bike, I drove because I had to go from Cub Scouts straight to the game and they made fun of me for not showing up for a few weeks and, so that tournament is on Sunday. </p>

<p>So, I have a feeling I'm not going to play that well in that tournament on Sunday because I will have four or five games on Saturday. And usually, you know, in a two day tournament, you have like two or three games on Sunday, but I've got four or five, so hopefully we have a large enough squad where I can just-you know, what's the word-spread out my points, you know. Don't kill myself in the first game. Try not to injure myself. [00:30:06]</p>

<p>The first day is the, is the team. I know they're going to want to go out after the tournament. I'm just going to want to home and go to bed. So, I don't know. I also— too much shopping. Tournament shopping for fall is really just Gatorade and salty stuff like beef jerky. I've already got a whole big bag of sunflower seeds. Get some Red Bulls, bunch of Red Bulls, get an eight pack (coughing).</p>

<p>If the weather's like this, you know, it would be perfect, but if it's cold, I'll bring some whiskey to warm up. Sunday I might bring a four pack of Guinness just to help with the pain</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they help you play?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much, you know, you know, it's just-you know because usually, it's close, you know, it's going to be close enough to Halloween that people will be in costumes or whatever and so, one year I went as an alcoholic. Even at, our first game was at 9:00 and I just slammed a Guinness and I was like—it was the same thing. I had a tournament the day before and it just kind of helps with the pain. [00:31:59]</p>

<p>I don't know if you do, you know over exertion exercises. I mean I don't know how many crunches you do when you do them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Full body pain. Everything aches. I don't know if I have anything on Monday. But yesterday was the day, it's like, the days after a game I really need off just because it's not, you know, it's like I didn't, didn't drink. You know, I did a few shots of Goldschlager, and—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just a long day, you know, tail gaiting, you're standing up walking around, you're standing up the whole game, you know. I really didn't even feel like cheering or screaming or—. You know, I just really felt off on Sunday and I feel better this morning, so hopefully I'm, I'm over it. Maybe running around was a good thing. Sweat it out whatever I have in me. Though I really didn't sweat because it was kind of cool. I know you're not a medical doctor so you don't know whether that stuff really happens or not. (Sighing) [00:33:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right— Yeah I guess I sort of think that's what I think you're doing today is kind of burying the pain. I mean you know, you're talking about stuff that's been irritating or frustrating or bothering you, but there's this sense of like-there's such a sense of oh, fuck it all. I think I hear when you're talking.</p>

<p>Oh this is all fucked at work. Oh, fuck all of this, just fuck it. I've got to do all this shit, but I just, I don't want to do it. I'd rather be doing anything else or maybe I've got the tournament, but you know, I've got two tournaments this weekend and it sounds like you're not looking forward to playing anymore. Playing tomorrow night. It sounds like ugh, it's like fuck it. I want to be I don't know what. Politics.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A vegetable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's all kind of-that wasn't quite the right word but something in that direction. [00:34:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's part of me that wants to do these things and there's part of me that doesn't, you know. </p>

<p>And I've got to find a finance committee. It's like I've got my doctor's appointment and then I've got finance committee, meeting at the farm. No one will, we don't really need to meet, but no one will really pull the trigger and cancel the meeting and you know, I've got to go to the farm for an hour and a half.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think there's, there's also a bit of a commentary there on how you feel here with like emotional stuff or stuff that's upsetting. It's just like oh fuck it. It's like I don't want to necessarily look in to it. Think about why this is bothering me, like try to sort it out, just fuck it, you know, put it out there, but it's the sense of burying the pain by saying fuck it, sort of suppressing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's easier that way, isn't it? Or I guess am I'm just heading for another nervous breakdown.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine that it's easier in the short term like it's less work. A lot of this I think is about I think doing less work</p>

<p>CLIENT: We've already established that I'm lazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing) But that doesn't help in the long term. It makes things more stressful and congested. [00:36:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sigh)—When you say things confront things emotionally, I really don't understand what you're, what you're asking me to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, um-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I'm alone, okay, so I feel alone. How do I confront that? I'm using that as an example.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, I-talk about it. How it hurts, when it hurts, what you do in response, how you avoid it, when you avoid it. You know, you notice you avoid it. You would think about the things that are, you know, keeping you in that state and whether they're all sort of things, sort of external realities or whether there are ways you can do yourself as well as well in general people, there are. Stuff like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is one thing that all this sort of constantly running around stuff that I've been doing keeps my mind off of, you know— </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The emotional things, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's anger and frustration. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, just like for my job. The other things I don't have time to think about you know (cleared throat) [00:38:57]</p>

<p>I was having lunch with the AFLAC guy and he was saying how I should date the chiropractor in our group. And she's mildly attractive, you know. She's, you know, there's some women they look attractive and the next day they don't, you know, she's kind of like that.</p>

<p>But like personality wise, you know, like completely opposite, you know. She's like super goody-goody chiropractor, nationalist, you know, don't eat sugar. You know, so-that kind of stuff is like no thanks, but, you know, I don't know. I mean I haven't dropped and had sex with her. If I could get away with that, that would be fine, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that all you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not even sure I want that. I mean the sex, the drinking and, you know—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing) Great. [00:40:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's just like I think it sounds like that and it's like you know the options I have are so, I don't know if I'm talking myself out of any options I might have, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I haven't heard any yet, I mean—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because there aren't that much, you know. And I asked Barbara out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really, you know- There's like a handful of women, but I just, for one reason or another-like there's this woman who plays on our team that helped to sell our house, but she's crazy. You know, she was the one who when her daughter was rolling on the floor with Ian when they like four and six, you know, she got all upset. You know, so she kind of freaks me out- Other than that, there's not really a whole lot-(coughing) Ugh. [00:41:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there things you could do to meet more people? I don't mean like on line dating. I mean there is that. But also just that, my impression is that—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I imagine if I joined a temple, you know, that that's the Jewish way, you know, you'd, you'd have some lady in the temple who's like oh there's a new man in the temple, he's single, he's a lawyer. You know—. Poor Betsy Baumgartner hasn't had a date in two years, you know (laughing). So I do think like that, but you know, I hang out with the people from the team that who are, you know, somewhat younger than I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it's not like they have friends who are, I don't know-I don't know. I mean I've never really known what to do. You know, it's not like, I didn't really date anyone in law school. [00:43:10] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just kind of saving it for (inaudible at 00:43:12) I think. You're not having known what to do or feeling. I think kind of at a loss—what to do about dating now I mean I see a number of reasons for that, but for the part of that's about not really ever having been so clear or feeling kind of a feel of regret. </p>

<p>Oh we need to finish up for now. I'm going to be out. I'll remind you again on Friday, on November 9th. I think that's two weeks from Friday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. I need to mark that on my calendar.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Howdy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did you ask how I am? Is that what you just said? Howdy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I said, howdy, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I was going to say. I...I had (big sigh) I had an appointment with a new lawyer for today. I also had furniture coming from my lay friend, Lisa, has just sold her apartment and is bringing in some furniture...for me at my place, so that I have a lot of work to do to make room for it and all that stuff. So, it's important that I give this new attorney, maybe the full story on my case. So I've worked like two full days, I think but I don't know, more today and...like...the deadline and I'm going crazy there, and I also understand that part of the symptom is I feel I have to put everything down on paper, explain everything, I knew that, too. But I want her to have everything and I want to make it easier for her to skim, so that she doesn't have to read the whole thing and all that stuff. And that my...I lose some things on the computer today and have to start all over and I get there a couple of minutes late but we're fine. So we're talking and then she learns that I had discharged the previous attorney, so she's all...and, "I don't know if I ought to get involved until we check the file from the case." And so forth and so on. So I worked like crazy, I literally, yesterday didn't go out of the house...just in pajamas at the computer all day long and into the night and so forth. And now I have to go home. I can expect movers there tomorrow about 8:00, so I have to go and move so much stuff out of the way. [0:03:04.4] I mean things under folding tables and stow them somewhere and fold the tables up and whatever and so forth and so on, and I feel so harried. And what I did was, I took the precaution last week of saying, "Hey, my back is really hurting." Which in fact it was and still does. And I said, "Before it gets worse I want to take two..." I have a whole store of complimentary days coming to me. So I said, "I want to take two comp. days adjacent to my two days off this week, Wednesday and Thursday." So I've had four days, well, so far three days and I have to go home now and...work my head off, and then presumably the mover shows up some time in the morning. And there's no way I, I don't know, it's just everything's so formidable. I was hoping to be able to go shopping for food and all that stuff. Every three or four weeks I take a ride into New York and do some shopping. So I took four days off and I worked like hell! And I'm very frustrated that, that whole and redoing the whole case on the computer...took so much time, more it should have. Well, more than I should have devoted to it I suppose. But I just can't get it out of my head that I have to explain, have to give every nuance to the...and I'm pressured because the first attorney turned out to be ineffective, ineffectual, and so forth and so on. So this whole matter is...it's now more than 14 months... [0:05:05.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...since the accident. It just looms over me and never goes away and all that crap! So, that's how I feel, pretty, kind of uptight. And I come here and I was just down there, I was there at 4:30 and, downtown right near Christopher Columbus statue, just had a slice of pizza and come up here and I said, "You know what?" Saying to myself, "I hate having to be anywhere." Meaning...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...here at 7:00, wherever. I was rushing and I had a 4:15 appointment, now due that something that, a glitch on the computer. I pulled my stuff together as best I could and I got down there at 4:30 and I was late...and I've got these...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Knots in your stomach?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...was because I don't like to keep people. I don't like to be late, I think it's very rude and all that stuff. And that's the way I feel. (emotional)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That you didn't want to be anywhere at a particular time. And you were thinking, you had your slice of pizza and you were thinking, "I don't want to be there at 7:00."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to be there at 7:00. I didn't want to be, I didn't want this squeeze-play I put on myself for the lawyer today. I have a squeeze-play...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tomorrow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...tomorrow. I have to get up in the morning because he may be there at 8:00 in the morning and bringing in two or three chests of drawers and a couch and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sounds like you are feeling really stressed out by all of this stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah! Sure! Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By everything, meaning you had four days off and you didn't feel like you got something out of it or as much out of it as you wanted and instead, you ended up feeling more stressed out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. Exactly...but you figure...two days off is nice, four days off is even better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it would have been easier to me to work...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...at that kind of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...easier to work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you thought about not wanting to be here tonight...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what was going through your, what were you thinking about? Or what were...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking, I said, "Should I continue this?" Listen, I live on 89th Street and I got to come down, and generally...I come down here for this, although while I'm going to therapy there's, it's...I have a stop, I come down here to 10th Street, too, which doesn't (chuckling) thrill me but... [overlapping voices at 0:07:39.5]...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that, I mean when I started with that doctor, with the psychiatrist (ph)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...when I started with him, he was sort of right around the corner from the store on 34th Street. So, I'm saying, "You know and if I were home I'd have to come down here now." And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were thinking, "Do I want to do this? Do I want to continue with this?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, right. Yeah, it's, and what would that mean to me or what sort of a, what would I be missing, what if, I mean, if anything? Has my life changed in any way in these or ten, maybe more...if Dr. Cantor and, and why don't I just make things simpler for myself, make my life simpler? [silence from 0:08:47.3 to 0:08:57.0] And this feeling that I don't want to have to be anywhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me about that feeling? If you, whatever you can.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It...it bothers me, it frustrates me, it, because it's not a new feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want people depending upon me. I don't want people to need me. [silence from 0:09:34.8 to 0:09:49.8] You know, I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean, you don't want, you don't want people to need you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...another way of putting the need, another way of phrasing that would be, I don't want anyone making demands of me, of my time or of my effort or of my presence, whatever. It's not new at all. It's not new at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it's a familiar experience, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sure, yeah. Yeah. A friend, a good friend, a gal who I met through the...from want ads, the romance want ads I mean and so forth and so, and...I mean and kind of where we kind of like each other and so forth and we went to bed once or twice but...it wasn't, we weren't for each other in that sense and I didn't want to get too involved with her. So I see her once in a while, she'll call me and I'll call back and so forth and so on. And she called up and said, she's a social worker and she was having a problem with the school that she had just left, and there was a thing with her unemployment something or other, and she said, "Would you...I value your..." Oh, your viewpoint, your thinking, well...however she put it. "...would you go down with me to this hearing?" Or something like that, and I said, "Well, sure, Beth, of course I will." And so...I didn't want her and I didn't want to. And, "When is it going to be?" And, "Well, I don't know yet." And I said, "Well...well, let me know." Because I mean that's another component because with me, with my job, I don't even know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're going to be there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...what it will be in two weeks or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...she was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...she was making a demand on my time, on my...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's that like for you when people put demands on you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (big sigh) Oh, I'm, what it's like is, [silence from 0:12:11.8 to 0:12:24.3] well, I've always said I don't like it but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...well, to put a finer point on it, I think it's that I'm on the spot because I can't or don't want to say no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe you feel like you have to please people and you have to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, right, right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So... [0:12:47.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's even more complex than that because part of me wants to help a person...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but on the other hand, I don't want to, for different reasons, not because I don't want to help but I can't be bothered, I'm bugged, I...I have, I'm busy studying my own navel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But also, if you feel like you need to please other people it puts a lot of pressure on you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you might begin to resent that and not want to do something. Not want to be with people because you feel the pressure to please them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I mean, that's very true. When you said that...I'm saying to myself, "Well, yeah, well that fits." I can't generalize it and say that anytime somebody wants to be with me it's because they want something or anything like that but...so my mind started thinking, "Well, who else needs me?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, I'm wondering how that plays into our situation here, in your not wanting to come here tonight and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...not wanting, and that perhaps you feel like in some way I place demands on you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, certainly symbolically or figuratively, I mean I signed up here but you are the symbol of what I signed up for, what I committed myself to, whether to you or to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Which is what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I come here to work at, because I find it work, at, okay, to work at gaining some sort of improvement in the aspects of living. I can't even articulate beyond...what I've said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but that's more, but in a way what seems to happen is that, you came here wanting something for yourself and then I became, I've become a symbol of that, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:15:47.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of, and maybe it is maybe some changes that you want to make. But it seems like now I've become the one sort of in...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Making the demand, the time demand?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Where the demands or not just the time but maybe in some way I've become the person whose demanding that you change or demanding that you make changes in your life. Somehow I think something's going on or something has happened where...initially you're the one who wants certain things but then, I become the judge or the, I don't know, if, that I've become, I somehow get in the position of the one demanding something from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The authority figure or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And then you begin to resent that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And I think this comes into play when, I'm not sure if you'd characterize it as when in the last section, session, will not have been, to my eyes, productive or I think the last session, I'd said I characterized it as frustrating or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So like it's not working...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and walk out happy that, with a new revelation and so forth, that it were, I mean it may have been a new revelation but not a positive one. So that colors the theoretically bland demand for time, of the demand for scheduling, demand for - I think, I just got a flash. There's something else comes into it and there are two things that came right into my head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And one is, here I am, I'm 65 years old and I'm punching a fucking time clock.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At work, going in, leaving, during the day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never did that before in my life! Number two, why am I working? I mean there's a demand for me for five days a week. To make it worse, five different days a week at different times, which wrecks havoc with any sort of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Consistent scheduling, yeah, I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah...I love the plays...I don't dare buy tickets four weeks in advance or...whatever because...I just can't do that. So that whole job is a demand on me and my state, the state that I created for myself or allowed to be created for myself, the state in which... [0:19:08.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I have to be working now at this job, which we know I don't like, is a great demand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely. That it's hard, it first of all, at 65 to be punching a time clock for bosses who are probably younger than you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, for sure. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And to be on their schedule, entirely, to not have control over that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So there's a whole bag...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a whole bunch of things going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...of demands.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...which makes, well, this...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, tell me about the, 'at age 65 part'? Tell me about that part again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, my brother Doyle is retired, well, he's also married to a kind of wealthy young woman, very comfortable, and all they do, they're always traveling..., "Where did you go this year? Where did you go then?" And so forth and so on. My friend Jim is living with somebody very comfortably and...they take a trip now and then and I know...they're having a nice life together. My friend Owen is too old to all extents, to all extent and purpose he's retired. He goes into the office [that they own] (ph) a couple of times during the week in nice weather, but now he goes down to Florida with his wife for maybe four or five months in the winter and so forth and so on. And I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you [inaudible at 0:21:02.4]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...(a) am working; (b) deny myself, well, I was just trying to, how should I put it? I'm very frugal when it comes to discretionary spending, about going to plays, the movies or this or that and so forth and so on. And just to make things worse, my friend Lisa, who has got more money than I have but she's probably more neurotically insecure than I am, she's still like in the dating mode and so...we don't do much of something but I'll say, "Come on, let's go out to lunch and dinner." We'll go to a real cheapy place. I'll still pick up the check.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...she doesn't go reaching, reach for the check, except...a couple of isolated times, which exacerbates the feelings that I just enumerated about my friends that are retired, living...in nice, rather comfortable life, taking off to an elder hostel or this or that. And...when somebody says, "Hey, elder hostel." No way, it's for a school or college fund. Two weeks on a particular, wow! You know? [0:22:31.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So how's it make you feel when you think of yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like a schmuck. I...I put myself in this position.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So very critical of yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I let it happen. I mean I...I know there are explanations for why it happened. I was, and nobody, I didn't have the kind of guidance, if at all, any guidance, and that I would have with my son...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...when we were living together and so forth and so on...it just wasn't there, and nobody made me goal oriented and, well...a lot of reasons, but I don't want to go on about that because that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So but...I'm not, I have nothing to be pleased about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would it help and then maybe you can add onto that list? You know you were saying, you got to work...at this job you don't particularly like, you have to work on their time schedule, and then maybe somewhere it's also...going to therapy? "I'm 65 going...and here I am, I got to go downtown, all the way downtown to therapy with..."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, downtown is less important than, "When are you going to get straight?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "You're 65 and you still need help in living?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's the bigger part of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, right. Then I can see how it would get into this sick scenario where I became the one putting the demands on you, because if it begins to feel like it's not your choice to be in therapy, something that you're choosing to do, but rather something that you have to do, then I become the one whose sort of saying..., "Greg, you have to do this."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now when you're going that far, as you're going...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, tell me where it doesn't work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You represent something but you are not the standard against which I rail, it is not that personal. It's somewhat personal in the sense that I could be frustrated last week, but it's not, you aren't the personification, no, you're the, you're not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe I am?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you're not the size of the personification that you attribute to yourself. I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...can deal with this very well, with the concept that here I am at 65 and still trying to learn how to live and...how to live a life comfortably, correctly, how do deal with people and so forth and so on. Let me put it this way, if it weren't you, it would be Jane or Sally or Dick or Harry, sitting there and it's... [0:25:46.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it doesn't matter, it's the thing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...the thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And in this case it happens to be me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think I didn't quite understand what you were saying before about...your last week's session coloring this week, coloring how you feel now about therapy and so your reactions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if it was frustrating, I think, was that the word? Yeah, frustrating. If it's frustrating...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...frustrating is a negative thing, meaning...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...not only would I not have gotten something out of it, but it was irksome to feel frustrated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that attaches itself - excuse me - to the basic feeling of, "Here I am 65, I got to go from 89th Street to 10th Street to learn how to learn?" And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's irksome.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it's frustrating because I have, I had a session that didn't work, and...there was nothing relevantory (ph) and it was irksome and it was, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that's pretty...I think I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So on top of it all, not only do you have to do all this stuff, but you go and you hope it's going to be helpful and it doesn't feel particularly helpful, so that adds to it all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure...if I wanted to be poetic I'd say, "Well...that's the story of my life!" And...it's not quite but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...not a terribly unfair thing to say. (chuckling) It's just that it's just grist. There are many things I can say...just like this stupid case going for 14 months. You know, I realize that there are sometimes I have no right to say 'why me', because I did it, whatever, but then there are other times I can say 'why me', so. So nevertheless, I'm quite use to feeling frustrated at so many things. I mean, I mean...that we have like this whole thing about...me and my son and how I was feeling about that, very frustrating. I mean...just about everything I threw out today was frustrating. [0:28:50.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So it makes sense that it would happen with us, too, in some way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Yeah, why should you be any different?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well, I guess I hope, and I think you're right, I wouldn't be any different, right. But maybe the thing we can do with it, which is different, how we deal with it can be different. And that's to try to focus even more specifically, really take a look at where you're getting frustrated, I mean, what the frustration is and what are the feelings associated with that? If this is something that happens over and over in your life, repeatedly, again and again, and you experience it in different places, experience it with your job, experience it with this case, experiencing it with Lisa in some ways as well it sounds like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my son.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your son, exactly. So maybe we have a chance to look at it a little more closely, sort of hone in on that and figure out what happens. What goes on? What goes on with you? What goes on between you and other people, in this case between you and me? Where did things break down? Where did things go from being something that you're choosing to do, it could be a positive thing, to where does it start to break down and go downhill? And that's not to say that anything is always supposed to be positive and sort of Pollyannaish, therapy included, because obviously...therapy can be unpleasant and difficult...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or painful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And painful. But it sounds like we're talking about something a little different, which is that there's this feeling of, you're running up against things or other people or getting that sense of impatience, I remember you were talking about last week, and frustration, feeling like you're spinning your wheels. So if we can sort of understand how that happens here, maybe that's how this can be different. [0:31:15.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's interesting, there's...I just, a light went on, in general, and I was going to throw it out and then you said, "We can see what happens here and let's see if..." It probably fits because I was going to say...that the thought that came to mind as to what happens, I mean, "Well, how would I describe what happens?" There's an 'ah' and I and there's, my expectations, maybe my expectations are high, too high...maybe that may be, maybe that is a component of what happens when they don't go as right as I would like, expect, whatever. And that's not unfair in this case because I come here with the expectation that I'm going to gain something, I mean, I'm going to be better for it, that's why I come to therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So expectations is a fairly good...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now let's look at that. Let's look at your expectations a little more specifically in this case. What do you think, when you say, "I want to get better." What do you mean exactly? What do you think, when you say that I imagine you have some things in mind, that your expectations are 'X', you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, this has got to be, right now at least, theoretical. What I would expect, which frustrates me for not receiving it is, (big sigh) a way of having good judgment about, about judgments that I make. [0:33:16.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hold on a second, back up. You said 'frustrated about not receiving it', not receiving what? I'm not, that's where I lost you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know I am frustrated about receiving, I'm not quite sure where I said this but it was probably, what I would come to therapy for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is, and that's what I'm trying to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...trying to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...clear my life of the cobwebs, of the things that trip me up, both (chuckling) figuratively and indeed, literally. [silence from 0:34:07.9 to 0:34:20.1] See I, I say it's hard, it's hard to answer this if we're going to use this as a model, because it's more a Morpheus. I mean what comes to mind is this, my relationship with my son.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's very...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. But I think when you came to therapy initially, when you came here, I imagine you had certain hopes or certain thoughts or expectations...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...about what you wanted to get out of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...the treatment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what, what kinds of things were those?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was, stop procrastinating, open your mail, pay your bills. If you say to somebody, "I'll send you this." I'll send it to them. Go do your whatever, when you think it's appropriate to do it or whatever. Stop, stop living like, this point of reference probably wouldn't make much, the Collier (ph) brothers. Many years ago when I was young, there was a story about the Collier brothers, two old men and finally they died. And they lived in a house, you couldn't walk there because they saved scraps of paper from the year one and this and so forth and so on. And it was a veritable...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...attic, the whole house...was an attic and so forth. And, yeah, I got the tape, I'm listening, and I'm going crazy today looking, I'm, "Where is that, where is the document for this? And where is Dr. Jergen's medical report?" And I remember, I remember when I was at Columbia Pictures and I worked with a guy named Ira Goldberg, and Ira desk was like this. How he got things done, we, none of us will ever know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:36:20.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And today, and yesterday and today, when I'm hunting around here and I said to myself, "Well, God, I'm becoming a Goldberg!" And in a way that I never thought possible, because when I was married, I used to be, get really angry at my wife because she was the one who would always make messes, work at the diningroom table and never pick up and so forth and so on. And the house was always - excuse me - the house was, well, unkept or...kind of a mess, and it wasn't to my taste at all. I mean, Lisa, she looks at me and she says, when she's at mine, she says, "You know, you're so strange." She said, "Listen, look at, this place is something to behold and yet, you're so neat. Well, look in your closet and you're so neat (chuckling) the way everything's hung up here and then wherever, and so forth, and everything is in place, and you're personally, bodily clean and so forth, and yet, this, there's such a split personality here." So that's what I came here for. I called up and said, "Hey, do you do procrastination?" You know, if that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was a year ago...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or over a year ago.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible, overlapping voices at 0:37:48.8]...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's gotten better in one respect. I'm now, since I've been paying...used, I bank online...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do better with that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I got a bill yesterday in the mail and for a Visa Card, whatever, and so I walked right over to pay this...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So your expectation, part of the expectation of therapy would be that you would stop the procrastinating, clean all that stuff out of your apartment, get your life together...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sell, go over to Jennifer, settle, get my half of the, my quarter...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...of money back, for which I would need help from my brother, who was my attorney. Bring over, I mean, there's this furniture, there's a whole...there's a set of furniture that I was supposed to bring over with me and so forth, which I never did, and which are old cabinets and books and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So, so far, I haven't provided that for you, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You haven't provided that, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I haven't done it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (big sigh) You know, when you just say that...I want to be the teacher and correct you and say, that so far I haven't provided this to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, except I'm not sure that that's, my sense is that there's something that goes on here, and this is, this is just, it is my feeling that I have about part of what happens (ph) as you said that, you end up feeling like there are all these demands placed on you in your life, right? And my sense is often with us that...you look to me as a judge, as the jury, as the...as the one to tell you whether things are okay or not. That what happens sometimes with you and me is that, you end up giving me a lot of power about how you see things. Now and this may be a little bit of a reach, I don't know. I mean, we can, we could play... [0:39:57.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, we'll play with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...around with this, but, and that you've said before that you're very aware of what other people think about you, you're very attuned to that, how people view you and you want to please other people. And I think maybe that same pattern happens here, that you're very aware of how I might view things, that somehow I take on a lot of power, so that when the changes don't happen, maybe you are more disappointed in me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I mean, while you're talking, and I've forgotten what you said, I [en view] (ph) you with a lot of power and so forth or it was, I don't know if you used the word teacher or whatever, but I say to myself, "No, no, no. No. He doesn't understand. He is the doctor. I've come for medicine to get well." As opposed to the power, however you just put it, the provider.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You're the doctor...you have the secret that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The secret?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...the pill, the...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm going to give you the pill and make your procrastination...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, and the work...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...go away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah...it may take time for you to mix, the old Fonzy (ph) way, put...you make a, with a personalized prescription for me, two of these, one of those and a dollop of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're sort of waiting for me to get the mix right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...it's fanciful but it's...it's fair. I come here to get fixed, to get well, to get cured.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what would that look like? If I got the mix right what would it look like? What would I say or what would I do? Because this is, I think, goes to the expectations that you might have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think you would probably say, "Ghee, Greg, have you ever thought about the fact that you're usually thinking 'a' when you're saying, 'no way, I don't want to deal with this now' or you're, have you ever thought about the idea that you're not thinking and one way of doing it is to say the magic word every time you walk into the house and you throw the mail on the table, instead of pushing it away because you're hungry and you want to go make something for dinner, say, 'Abracadabra.', and you will automatically take that and do that first before you make dinner?" Or...or something like, all right, or the magic bullet, the pill, the lecture, the formula, the ladder...the formula. Yeah. [0:43:27.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, in practical terms what...I mean, I say that and it really makes sense to me that there's, though you're asking and I'm saying, that's the wishful thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, I wasn't the most diligent when I was with Dr. Cantor and he was teaching me how to relax, the breathing exercises and so forth and so on, this was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, to do those when...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. This is essentially, that can be characterized as any of those words I use...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and yet, I really wasn't good at that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it didn't work very well it sounds like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it didn't work, yeah. Yeah. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what's, I think you're right. I mean my sense is that it didn't work. You got those, some, and I, and maybe you can look at those as tools or you can look at those as elixir or whatever you want to. But I sort of wonder, if there's something else that maybe is even more essential to this. That somehow your expectation is that I'm, that I, and...as you say you're not saying it literally, but that I'm going to mix the formula, give it to you and you'll say, "Ah! That's right. This is what you need to do." And those things will fall in place?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't think fall in place but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that...one, one improvement would lead to...the journey of a thousand miles, the first step...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or that kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But those, see, that'd be my way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's maybe interesting about this is, and then you're saying I'm the doctor in this case, so I'm the one you look to. But it seems like you very quickly give up your knowledge of yourself and your sense of what works for you and what doesn't work for you, and that you give up your own authority about yourself in this case, very easily, looking to me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not completely, because of the, call them the breathing exercises for shorthand, that wasn't my thing. It's as if somebody were to say, "Come, let's go to where I'm going to take the bus to Wicker Park." And I think, "No. I want to walk. I really want to walk."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or, "I really want to take the cab. I hate buses." You know, it's got to be something that I'm... [0:46:29.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Amenable to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...amenable to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, we actually need to stop for tonight, and I know we're kind of in the middle of things, but I wanted to see how you're feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can calm down (chuckling) to make it home, but I mean, oh, my God, where do I start, but that's okay, because I can do it. I can work my head off and whatever and then I can go to sleep tomorrow afternoon and I mean...whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But...I mean I think a lot of this comes down...you were talking about demands and the fact that you don't have control over certain parts of your life, over your schedule, over your work, and you don't have as much control over things that you'd like to have control over, and including this court case. That try as you may, right, as much as you want on the computer, you still don't have total control over it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it may be just for the next couple of days...this is not a prescription, but it may be helpful for you to just sort of try to let some of that...when you think of the control and the tension about that, just think, maybe let a little of that go for, just see what it's like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I don't have to get it exactly right."</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a tough one. I mean, let it go, yes. (chuckling) I don't have to get it exactly right is something else. But your point is well taken. I could let it go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe we can talk more about what's so touch about the 'exactly right' part.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like the tough part for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, exactly...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As you said...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...exactly right for who?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you also said high expectations, you have very high expectations for yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that's always been there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually, I don't have an extra form, so I'll have to give you two forms next week or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I'll mail you one or something like this, so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Or I can make a xerox, because along the way I have...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have an extra one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...access, so. Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Are we back onto our regular Monday schedule, next week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: One of the things that I never got to do was to call the store and say, "Hey, make sure I'm free Monday nights." And so forth. Let, let's do that and I will...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...confirm that tomorrow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I think, well, why don't we just, I'll schedule... [0:49:08.4]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Lots of unexpected thing today when I was trying to leave. The (inaudible at 00:00:09). They're running in with three new ideas. I should try to leave way earlier than I need to so I can be on time. (Pause) The fog feels like it is lifting. It's so short term it's hard to know what to make of it. [00:01:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:01:30) that fog.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It sort of comes and goes and it's different every time. (Pause) I feel like I have this interesting choice with the medication (pause) so I doubled the dose of Zoloft I was taking and like clockwork I woke up in the middle of the night from vivid dreams and was like wide awake but I was so tired and that's always how it's been with the activating medications. I just have to wait to go back to sleep but I end up getting up a lot later like waking up a lot later in the morning. So it's like I have to choose between... [00:02:55]</p>

<p>I don't know. Maybe this is a fake choice but it feels like quality of life during the day versus quality of life at night. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like the increased Zoloft helps during the day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who knows?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah (inaudible at 00:03:27). I mean who knows why I feel better and worse. (Pause) It's so subtle. (Pause) Like the shifts too are really subtle and then the consequences are like really big changes in mood or outlook. So when the shift happens it's so subtle. [00:04:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see sort of like, I guess, it's like you're in the middle of a scene in one movie and then all the sudden without quite realizing it you're in the middle of a scene in a different movie. Everything's very different but it wasn't obvious that you changed from one to the other. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It wasn't clear why the changed happened or what the pattern is. I mean I'm feeling more connected in lab. Actually the dream that I woke up from was very sweet. The lab was in Kelly's house and that we all lived there. I was the last one to turn off all the lights before going to sleep. In my dream I was like putting the chairs up on the table like you do when you're mopping and you're vacuuming. [00:05:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have associations of those things? One way to approach interpreting a dream is to look at what comes to mind like what elements of the dream remind you of or make you think of. And it could be anything. It could be the feeling. It could be the action. It could be (inaudible at 00:05:47) person. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So the strongest association is with home not like my home or my parents home but like we're all at camp. There's sort of this joint communal...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm also talking about sort of the individual elements like putting the chairs on the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. And there is carpeting underneath the kitchen table which was strange. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does the carpeting remind you of anything? [00:06:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was soft and I was not wearing shoes which is strange in lab. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that bring to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being extremely at ease. (Pause) What else do you mean by that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess like memories, other situations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like oh yeah there was this time we were at the beach and it felt kind of like that. Maybe nothing comes to mind. I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually I was on my feet a lot yesterday with my day, and then jazz rehearsal, and then waiting in line at a place where we got take out with some friends, and walking four miles, and biking. So when I got home and I took off both my shoes and socks and one of Jeremy's great family friends made a rug for us for our wedding, and it's this gorgeous cabled rug, and it's very thick, and yesterday I just stood on the rug, and walked back and forth for about two minutes. It's about this wide. [00:07:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a very clear sensation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe... Yeah that was pretty much the exact feeling, but I never would've thought of the association on my own (inaudible at 00:08:15).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. How about other things like the chair?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I just remember mopping like the freshly mopped kitchen which happened once a week in my house growing up. [00:08:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does it (inaudible at 00:08:51)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just because it's what you thought of. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. We have had a house cleaner and my mom usually cleans like my mom usually does all the house cleaning and then there's the house cleaner that comes so there's a lot of mopping going on. And she just likes the floors to be clean so she... I mean she cooks two meals a day for six to seven days a week in the kitchen so it's always in use. And there is a pretty clear picture of the kitchen being closed for the night like she's done whatever she needs to do, everybody's gotten what they need to get, the mopping is the last thing that would happen, and all the chairs are up, and sometimes they'll stay up until the morning if everybody's going to sleep. [00:10:01]</p>

<p>And often it's like you can't believe my mom has the stamina to mop after like at 11:30 p.m. after a whole day of whatever working, hosting, cooking, cleaning, being attentive to everyone. But there is a carpet so I don't know that there is actually mopping happening in the dream. Maybe it was a vacuuming. We vacuum in our apartment. We don't mop. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The feelings are the same, I guess, or kind of overlapping. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Yeah. Comfort.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah at the end of a long arduous day. [00:11:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I guess both of those things happen at the end of the day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are all these juxtapositions, I guess, of sort of life now at the lab, and your and Jeremy's home, and the home where you grew up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, it does feel like a pretty clear new chapter. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder (pause) if it sheds some light on fallout that maybe what happened with Kelly cuts both ways more than was clear before. I mean not the part that's been clear already of how wonderful she was, and how supportive, and how warm and caring she was when you were much more open, I guess, or more open and expressive than you've been, or you put some things out there. [00:12:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I did. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sort of leaned on her in a way that you hadn't often done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So clearly that's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I wonder if (pause) it's still not home. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I don't think it is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or I guess what I should say it's not home. I wonder if it's still kind of sad because even if she was great she wasn't your mom, and you are kind of far away from home in a way. [00:13:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She doesn't... But she's not my mom like I don't see why that should make me sad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You miss your mom. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I'm not saying she isn't, or she shouldn't be, it's not like in a way you'd expect her to be, but the fact that it still sucks that she's... It's human. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. But it doesn't suck that my landlord's not my mom or that you're not my mom. Maybe because she's the closest...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She evokes maybe your longing for you mom...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: More so than your landlord or I do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like she's kind of close enough to really make you miss her in a way. [00:14:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah she was quite close and she has a pretty big role and mentorship if she wants to take advantage of it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) My mom still doesn't (pause) seem to be encouraging me or to—I mean she was clearly encouraging me to spread my wings and have my own life her, but she's still pretty... I don't know what the word is but an example is I was talking to her two nights ago and explaining just how the day was pretty rough, and we were—we had already talked for like a while in Whole Foods, and then I called them again because they got the wedding photo book that I made for them. So I was insisted on face timing and seeing every page so we had a nice little session with my parents and me doing that. [00:15:52]</p>

<p>And at the end of the call there is this normal pep talk which is like you're doing great. But there is all of this like but we're here and you can come home anytime. And actually I was like but my life is here. Kelly said that and somehow it really resonated with me when she said it. So my life is here. And they were like yeah your life is there, but after your PhD if you want—and this is all my mom. My dad would never say anything like this but like after your PhD if you want to get a job closer to home you can do that. You can live near home. [00:16:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of funny because it sounds so much like she misses you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She really misses me. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she's doing that mom thing where it's like you know if you feel like bunking up for a while or you (inaudible at 00:17:01) because for your sake you might like that. You can just kind of move closer if that seems to you the right thing to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just saying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: My only other real example is Jeremy's parents just like because I don't know other people's parenting styles so closely but with them it's like we always love when you visit. But there's no—there's very much a respect for how can we help you make your home your home. [00:17:51]</p>

<p>(Pause) Yeah, maybe it's hard because she misses me. (Pause) I think just about... Sometimes I guess I do get kind of sad that their life is (pause) so focused on service to my grandfather. And they don't have this emptiness traveling like pursing... I mean they're incredibly industrious and productive people like my mom just started an online course and my dad has this huge garden. And they go biking, and they do a lot of stuff like they're not trapped at home, but they're taking care of my old grandfather who's been living there for my whole life so he's a member of the family just like we are. But there this thing about life where you get closer and closer to being like an infant again. [00:19:48]</p>

<p>We talked about it very openly this weekend like life is a circle, and my grandfather is just laughing at how much it really is like a circle, and he's so dependent. Like part of what's sad to me when I think about my mom missing me is that they don't... I don't know. They're so committed to him, and they want to do it, and I never hear much about how they don't want to do it, but I do hear a lot about how it's hard. [00:20:36]</p>

<p>And I think I bring a lot of light home. I don't think of the home as being dark without me, but I definitely think—I give myself a lot more credit I think than is due for brightening up the home and I always have. I always have felt not guilty but like oh the home should be really, really bright like it won't be as much when I go to see my friend for the evening. But I felt like I'll come back is good enough. My brother feels that too. He feels like a tug—not a tug—yeah a tug but not in that guilty parent mom way that (pause) my Jewish friends and I think like 99.9 percent of my friends are Jewish. There is this cultural phenomenon of the Jewish mom guilt thing. [00:22:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've heard of that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. I'm sure. And that does not sound at all like what this is. Like I could not be happier to be at home and to live there. And she is very respectful of whatever I want to do like there is no I wish you spent more time with us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I haven't heard...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Come home. I wish you'd come home for this holiday. It's just like we love it when you're home. (Pause) Maybe it feels like a lot of responsibility (pause) That maybe I can't have anymore now that I'm married. It doesn't really sound familiar. I wonder if that's (pause) something that I'm putting on myself. [00:23:35]</p>

<p>(Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you and your mom are like with each other and are a little worried about how this is going to look now that (pause) you're married and in some ways that I imagine, at least for now, is more symbolic than anything else. [00:24:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. In practice it's not much different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The idea of a kid and you're so focused and occupied with that that it's like you don't make time to see them or something like. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not like we've just moved in together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or moved (inaudible at 00:24:43) somewhere. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean there is a part of the ceremony that was like this is the last time you will (pause) It was like a good bye ceremony like this is like bid'ah. Bid'ah in Sanskrit is literally leaving. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bid'ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bid'ah. Maybe it is related to bid. But there is this whole thing like after the wedding there's the wedding, and everybody claps, and then we go inside the house and have this bid'ah ceremony, and then I'm supposed to go to my husband's house. And symbolically we went to the end where the reception was together. I think to my parents the symbolism is important. Jeremy and I didn't make much of it on the surface. [00:25:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that's it for now. We'll talk more on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Need a hand? </p>

<p>CLIENT: See you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye-bye. [00:26:27]</p>

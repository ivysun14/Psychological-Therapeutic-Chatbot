<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATiENT:  (Pause) Well, the thing I think first and I'm finding hard — I know I must have been starting to thnk It yesterday and, uhm, (sighs) well, I guess I'm also not sure where It's going to lead so that makes me find It hard too.  But I was thinking — I mean I wasn't thinking this until I came In here — but Immediately started remembering, uhm, talking about feelings I had whenever I'd get Into questions that led me to, to the final question of "Should MSCZ and I get a divorce?" or "Do I want one?" I suppose, Is more It.</p>

<p>And, uhm, I think yesterday I began hav—, began thinking this only just now It just was very clear.  Uhm, I d—, well, I don't know If It's more feeling It or, or If It's a question to me but, uhm, I suppose some— somewhere along the line of what you think.  And, uhm, but then I think It takes on sort of the, the tone of your wanting us to get a divorce or your, your leading things so I will decide I should.  And then, I, I wonder, well why would I think that?  And so then It, the next thing I think Is because you want me free.  Uhm, and this Is the part I find hard because I can't think why you'd want that unless then you'd want to uhm, well, I'm not sure If exactly marry me but, anyway have me free (laughs).  And, uhm, — (Pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know, It just, It just seems like It's my getting back to the old fantasies I had about, uhm, your being Interested In me, I suppose, or (pause) well, then, then this occurred to me that, uhm, — I guess because, because I, I was just thinking that It seemed as If, ah at the end yesterday, I was coming more and more to feeling, thinking about divorcing MSCZ and, and just that as a question at all and everything, just going through the process of thinking about It was a very aggressive thing toward him.  And It wasn't just simply deciding what was best for me and for him but It was an act of, uhm, hostility.  And, I don't know, so then I'm, I'm, I guess wondering now If, uhm, thinking this way about you Is because now I won't have a chance, I mean that would be sort of a final — I know It wouldn't destroy him but I would think of It as an act of, uhm, doing something horrible to him anyway.  And, uhm, I don't know, It's almost like, well, I'm wondering, I guess, If, If then I am wanting to start over with you.</p>

<p>And I guess I was thinking, too, about, uhm, before I went on vacation how I, I don't know, It just seemed like I was fighting you all the time.  Or was, my thoughts always went to ways of getting the best of you of, uhm, castrating you, I suppose, In a way or, uhm, well, somehow getting at your penis, I guess Is really It.  And this way th—, If the fantasizing this way now might be the beginning of thinking of how I could do It again.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I think there was more of a connection that I'm, uhm, (sighs) uhm, I don't know, I guess somehow I was wondering If I'm going to get Into a, uhm, well, I, I don't know, mood Isn't quite It — but the frame of mind that I was In before vacation.  Uhm, well, I'm not su—, I started thinking about work and I'm not sure whether I was thinking about It as, well, no matter what I could do to you or to MSCZ I always have work.  Or whether It was more I'm wondering If I begin to actively be aggressive to you and that</p>

<p>still happens with MSCZ, uhm, how much this would affect me at work, how much It would affect how I can relate to people there.  I don—, I mean I'm not sure what angle It was that started me thinking about It but I did.</p>

<p>And then the next thing I thought of, when I thought of work, well, It, I mean It has something to do with my Image of myself, I think, because I think I began to wonder If people think I'm capable, that I've met there.  And there are some areas — because It's a different type of teaching than I've done — that I don't feel that capable right now.  But then there are other areas where I'm surprised at, uhm, how just because I've had experience I'm feeling very comfortable over things I have to deal with.</p>

<p>And, uhm, one of them was over, well I, apparently I will not have to be working with this mother, at least not In the beginning.  But, uhm, the director, Mrs. BBF was telling me about It because her child had been In my class and the mother had pulled him out of my class, which Is In the morning, to put him In an afternoon class.  And, uhm, she hadn't really wanted him to have the same teachers again but, uhm, she somehow has some problem right now about having him go In the morning and h—, and having him with the older children.  He's old enough but apparently he Is a problem and Immature.  And, uhm, well, she just feels he couldn't do It.  And, anyway they, anyway when Mrs. BBF was talking about It — and also the teacher who Is getting him had mentioned It — uhm, they were talking about how depressed she was and they aren't sure, but that she might be going through a divorce and, uhm, just they kept stressing how depressed she'd sounded, and, and, uhm, I suppose In effect how depressing It was to deal with her because she was so depressed.  And, and they were sad to think about the boy.  And, uhm, well, I don't know, I guess I'm trying to, then I'd start trying to put myselves (sic) In her shoes or something.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, now, uhm, I don't know whether I'm running away from thinking about things that are really Important or what, whether there's something In this.  Uhm, I feel more comfortable In thinking about It so It makes me kind of feel maybe I'm running away.  But, uhm, I was just thinking about we visited 2 families this morning for the home visits and one was a child who's very very shy and It turns out her father Is one of, connected with the church that the school Is, In effect, part of.  Uhm, I don't know whether he's some assistant minister or exactly what his position Is but he Is there and he's, he's very nice and his wife seemed very pleasant but quite quiet.  And then this little girl Is extremely shy.  And FLMZ, who Is my assistant, was her, one of the teachers In her room last year so she recognized her and ran right to her but then was kind of shy with her too but yet was very affectionate.</p>

<p>And, uhm, I don't know, I mean I, I understood what had happened and It was awkward between us as a result and maybe partly because I guess I'm not as relaxed as some people In these things.  Uhm, but then I just started thinking about the d-, some of the different teachers and, uhm, their manner that I've seen, which I would suspect Is a clue to what their manner Is In the classroom.  And, uhm, I don't know, that I'm comparing myself to them.  But one In particular, who's very outgoing and seems to be sort of a leader amongst the teachers who are, who are older tea—, I mean who are, they're not older than me but they're people who've been there before.  Uhm, she's a stronger personality and, uh, I don't know, I guess I was just seeing myself as being the opposite of her.  She's very open and, uhm, gives the Impression anyway being very open and warm and, uh, and gay.  And my, then I get to feeling more and more closed and awkward and, uhm, well, sort of distant In, In trying to relate to people or to the children.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I don't know, It seems to me this Is sort of typical of what I used to do.  When I say I feel more comfortable I think I, I don't like what I'm thinking except I think what makes me feel more comfortable Is because It's sort of an old way of, uhm, well, I don't know If exactly looking at things or, or just thinking or what.  But, uhm, In a way I don't really know why I think about It at all because I'm whatever I am and so what does It matter whatever this other girl Is and how she Is with her class.  Because I am what I am.  And, uhm, yet It just se—, It's, It's a very familiar thing for, for me to.  I don't know, again I guess almost as If well, maybe she has some key or, uhm, I'll find something In what she Is If I think about enough and compare us, me to her enough so I'll be something different, I guess.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, now I think I'm really wandering off because uhm, well, I'm not even sure what I was thinking there for a while but It's, I'm quite sure, unimportant things.  I know I've been thinking about, uhm, I don't know, little things that I have to do I haven't done and just things I've been doing In the room and, uhm — (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I, It feels as If I'm trying to stop thinking what I'm thinking because It's ridiculous for me to be thinking It here, I mean, It's things aga—, just more things connected with school that, uhm, mainly, I guess, Involving things that I haven't done yet or what I want to do.  But, uhm, but If I think, well then, what do I want to get back In to thinking, I, I think of what I started out with today.  And, uhm, I just feel I can't get back Into It.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You know what It reminds me of Is, uhm, the kind of thing you said you did to MSCZ this summer.  You were talking about how you would think about making love with him until he wanted to do It and then z,,,, somehow different matter.  And how one time especially, you did something you thought, felt was dishonest In the sense that you told him that you had been thinking about It as a way to sort of manipulate him.  Now here what you do Is you sort of tell me something about your fantasies a little bit and then you stop, go off on other things and then you let me know you're doing that and you'd like to get back to It.  As though you're saying to me, "See, I was thinking about It, eh, I really wanted to do It but I just can't."  Sounds like doing to me exactly the same kind of thing you did to MSCZ.  Except that, eh, here It doesn't Involve making love but It's the same kind of teasing.  Or trying to have It both ways.</p>

<p>PATiENT:  Yeah, yeah, because, you know, I see what you mean.  Because the th— well, I mean, part of It might be I want to tell you I want to get back to It even though I won't.  Uhm, because I think you would be feeling I should be.  But then part of It Is — I mean I clearly don't want to or else I would.  Uhm, but that I think, I think on my own, that, uhm, regardless of you, I'm thinking I should just because It's clear that would have much more to do with my solving my problems than thinking about school.  But I don't know, I have, uhm, well, maybe this Is something too, and that I was doing with MSCZ.  Because It Is true that I, when I told him what I, what I was feeling was dishonest mainly because I was, I knew I was manipulating him, was, uhm, what I was manipulating him toward, I guess, was then he would take, he would want to make love with me again and he would take the Initiative, which he did.  And, I don't know, It seems like maybe part of why I said what I did just now Is that then I wanted you to take the Initiative and make me do something, make me think of something that I should be thinking about.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I mean this, well this re—, I mean the, the I don't know, I don't like the word should because, uhm, that Implies maybe I'm just accepting your evaluation of what would be best to discuss here.  But I don't, I mean I think It's, uhm I don't know, I guess the only way to put It Is something that I kn— that If, If I get Into It I know would help me but that I don't want to get Into It on my own, I want you to make me.  And this I know I've felt this way before.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know, I know I've understood It at other times but right now I can't think where I think I'd be getting If, If I manipulate things so that you're making me think about things that I'm resisting.  And I'm, I don't know, I hadn't thought of this before but I'm not even I don't know If I'm, maybe I'm resisting them because I want you to have to make me rather than — I, I guess I'd been thinking I'm resisting them because they're making me feel very uncomfortable to think them.  But, uhm, maybe — well, I'm sure that might me part of It — but If I didn't resist them then you couldn't make me so — make me think about them — so, uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And If I try to make you and you succeed, as you usually do, In defeating that then you've chopped me off again.  And If you get MSCZ to take the Initiative In making love and you don't really respond to It, you don't really love him and you don't really feel anything about him, then you've also accomplished the same thing.</p>

<p>PATiENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   He can't touch you.  So again, I think you're doing the same thing to me that you do to him.</p>

<p>PATiENT:  (Silence) You know, I, I think I just started getting that feeling that — I don't want to get It again because It seemed to me I was using It last, well, before vacation so much — uhm, of feeling, well, It just seemed like sort of an endless thing that, uh, It keeps happening, I keep seeing It and you keep helping me see It and then I just keep on letting It happen or doing the same kind of thing again.  And, uhm, because I guess I was wondering well, how, how would knowing this help me change?  And, uhm, the only, the only way I can see It could help me change and then I just, I guess It's — I'm refusing to let that happen — Is to see these things enough so that I understand It enough so then I anticipate It and don't do It.  But, uhm, I don't know, then, then what I'm thinking Is well, uhm, If that's happening then It must mean that my desire Is still there to, uhm, — well, I don't know, I don't like the word castrate, maybe because that's what I really want to do — but anyway, uhm, attack you or attack MSCZ, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, why don't you like that word?</p>

<p>PATiENT:  Well, It seems too extreme.  I don't know, It seems like what I really want Is just to hurt you a little, not really hurt you that much.  Except that's not probably true, what I really want probably Is to hurt you that much except then my only way — I can't do It that much so then I only want to hurt you a little.  Well, I think there was something else about my not liking It, though.  And, uhm, part of It — because that was my first reaction to your question — was, well, It seemed too extreme.  But, uhm part of It, I don't know, It, It's easy for me to start using that word and then It just becomes sort of a formula or something or meaningless.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, well, that's rendering, In other words, my words, eh, useless.  You destroy them.</p>

<p>PATiENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Which Is exactly what you're up to.  And I think the real point of the fantasy of getting rid of MSCZ and then, you know, turning to me and I would want you Is that then you'd do the same thing to me.</p>

<p>PATiENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But you are already doing It.</p>

<p>PATiENT:  (Pause, laughs) I don't know why, but what that made me think of Is uhm, well, specifically my situation right now with FMC and then sort of a general attitude that I think Is my family's or my mother's.  Uhm, but with FMC, anyway I've, uhm, she started today and, and I feel much better about It then I was yesterday.  But, uhm, I'm continuing because It's, until I get through the year It'll always be something on my mind or at least until we've gotten further along In the year — that this may not be what she really wants.  And If she, In meeting more people here and talking to people, finds that she really would prefer something else or fI—, or hears of something that pays better, uhm, then she might just suddenly leave us.  And so I keep thinking well, I have to be really nice to her so that we'll be so nice sh—, how could she leave us?</p>

<p>I guess what I, why I thought of that Is, uhm, wondering well, If I'm having that kind of fantasy then, and then yet I'm doing to you what I do to MSCZ before I've gotten you to the point that I want to get you at so then I can really do It to you, Is, uhm, I, well, I was just wondering why would I have that fantasy and yet really be treating you the same way?  Uhm, because part of the fantasy would be my being nice to you to catch you, I guess.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But tha— I guess maybe I'm making more of a distinction than at first I was between what Is really happening and what's fantasy because what's really happening Is I'm coming here every day and so you're In effect caught.  That just makes me think of something that I don't know, I guess I've always really known, but some—, I don't know, sometimes It would really almost be a puzzle to me.  Uhm, why I, especially when I was younger but I mean It's still that way today, I think, to some extent — why I'd be so different with my family and particulary when I think of those years that I was just constantly unpleasant to my parents and really, In effect, unpleasant whenever I was In my house.  And then I'd be totally differently, act differently with, uhm, people I knew at school or my friends.  And, uhm, I suppose It was a feeling that my parents were really stuck.  If, If I knew somebody outside of my family were really stuck with me, and the only person that this has happened with Is MSCZ and then I am doing the same thing.  And now you too so — (Silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was thinking again of that girl at school that I mentioned.  Uhm, her name Is FHYZ and, uh, this time well, I also was thinking about the 2 girls we visited today and, uhm, I, I think the Impression I got from what FLMZ had said Is that she liked one better than the other.  And yet she described them pretty accurately for the little I saw of them but I think I would have just the reverse feeling that she does of which one I'd like better If I were just thinking about which one I responded more naturally to.  And, uh, because It seemed to me the one she like gave very little of herself, at least today when we met them.</p>

<p>And the mother was, I guess I was thinking about the mother too, who was, uhm, very, well, over the phone she was very outgoing, she wasn't quite so outgoing when we were there, which relieved me because It seemed to me she was excessively outgoing over the phone.  But, uhm, but she was very pleasant and the contrast between her and the child was quite marked as a result.  Uhm, but th—, but then, I don't know, I was thinking about this girl FHYZ at school, too, who Is sort of, the, of all the older teachers one of the strongest personalities and, uhm, and then I thought of this Incident that Mrs. BBF was talking about some of the things she doesn't want done or some of the philosophies that she'd like us to be backing her up on, that are hers and that she's expressing as the school's.  
And, uhm, then she, I don't know, she was go— getting Into some particular things that had happened to her just to give examples.  And one was, uhm, speaking about, uhm, well, I don't even know If she'd even talked about what children got to eat at school, or something like that.  But she was taking around parents.  The man was a dentist and uhm, she must have said something Implying they did not give candy very often to the children.  And she came Into the room of this girl FHYZ (clears throat) and she said there was candy everywhere.  Uhm, and apparently there was some girl FHYZ had In her class that kept bringing In candy last year.  But, well, I don't know, It seems like I'm now setting up competition with her because then I started thinking, well, If she'd really wanted to do something about It, It would have been quite easy to at least make an effort to stop this girl bringing In the candy through the parents.  Because It was clearly the mother giving the girl candy and sending her In with It, or at least letting her take It.  And, uhm, well, I don't know, It seems like I'm going back and forth, I want to do something to you and then I think about being competitive with this girl.  And she just Is one of the many female figures that I've set up that kind of competition with.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, the only thing I can think about It Is that I do that out of frustration of feeling I can't really do to you what I want so then I turn to being competitive with women.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I guess I'm just thinking things again that, uhm, well, I don't know how I got onto this but I was thinking about FSO's schedule lately and how I don't think It's going to work out badly In the end, but, uhm, since she was sleeping quite late this summer and her whole schedule was quite late It's been slow to get her on a much earlier one so that she doesn't wake up with us In the morning even though we, we don't try to be quiet.  And It used to be that she would and I think It probably will be again.  But I'm always having to go In and wake her up and, uhm, wake her up from her nap so that I get to see her and things like that.  And so I was thinking kind of, of that and then kind of, of, uhm, the fact that I'd like to help FTPZ out, who's packing and moving right now, I mean she'll be moving.  I guess Saturday Is the day that they actually move the big things.</p>

<p>And, uhm, so I was, I had offered, I had stopped by yesterday to return something that I had used of hers and she wasn't home.  So I left a note just saying I could watch MVE this afternoon If she wanted me to.  But then when I called she was not home and so I didn't take care of him.  But then, now I was just thinking about tomorrow.  And, uhm, I suppose I feel, I feel partly that way just because I know how It must be to be packing and moving and then partly because she helped me at a time when It must have been — It worked out alright for her because then MVE and FSO played — but that It was a h— It was a bad time to be asked a favor In any case.  And, uhm, because It might not have worked out.  Well, I guess, I guess I'm feeling I have to even things up, or something.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.

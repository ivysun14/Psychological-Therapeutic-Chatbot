<p>PATIENT: (4-minute silence) It was, sort of 2 things are on my mind and uhm, I hadn't thought one was really directly con—, well I mean, it is connected with you.  But as I've been quiet, I, I see it differently than I did when I thought of it.  And it was uh, I was thinking about tomorrow, and, and also my reaction yesterday when you said you could not change the time, and I think I was angry then.  Even though I was trying to tell myself I had, that, it was a very reasonable thing that you might not be able to.  I still, I think, felt angry, and uh, then when I got home, I, I even wondered if I sort of made her get a cold, just because of the way I've sometimes gotten colds. </p>

<p>But I had thought she was getting a cold for the last 2 days.  And when I got home yesterday, I felt pretty sure she was, so I called the doctor and found out what to do.  And then it was, by evening it was very obvious she was sick.  And uhm, so one of my solutions, which would have been taking her somewhere else, I don't really want to do now.  And so then I, when I came in here, I was thinking about just saying I didn't know yet. I'm trying to get a baby-sitter 2 different ways.  One is through MYJ, who said he might be able to find somebody.  And then, I was given a name of somebody else who might be able to.  And I haven't been able to reach her yet. </p>

<p>And I was just thinking of telling you I didn't know definitely yet if I had a baby-sitter, and then it just occurred to me, there's not really,I mean, I'm not telling you anything until I know definitely, which I could do tomorrow, I suppose.  So (Sigh) I don't know, it seemed like maybe I was thinking of it because then I wanted you to know how hard you'd made it for me by not changing. </p>

<p>And I don't know whether, w—, I, i—, this was something that was on my mind while I was waiting, so — it might have even been on my mind because I don't wear, I haven't, well, when I was pregnant I was just wearing maternity clothes of — I almost — well, they were mostly 1 length.  But this is practically the only thing I have.  I have one other thing that's the longer length, and so I suppose it was on my mind because I put this skirt on today.  But uhm, when I was outside, I was thinking about clothes because I still haven't lost enough, so I can't fit into most of what I had, or have. </p>

<p>And I was wondering what I could wear here.  And one thing I was thinking of wearing was pants.  And I saw 2 people go by with pants on, so that, that sort of made me think of it.  But then I was finding it very hard to think I could really do it when I came here.  And I don't know, I mean pants are just worn by so many people today, I don't know why I feel that way, unless it is a switch from what I usually do, in, in my training, which was always you put on a skirt when you go anywhere.  Or a dress.  And —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What does wearing pants mean to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess being more casual, even though some are as fancy as — being more casual and more free, I think.  (Pause) Or maybe just being more free, because when I think about it, there are some outfits that are either, it's 1-piece or half pants, that are very dressy.  So it can't be just being more casual.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Free to do what?  Free in what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, this was just occurring to me when I was thinking about er, I didn't think it was really how dressed up it was, although I've been telling myself that's what I've been thinking.  Uhm, but somehow it's, I mean pants is always something a man wears, and I don't know, I was just sort of, I, I think I'm thinking in this way, I was reminded of the feelings I've had about, or what I had after I got out of the hospital, about wanting to call you so I'd commit myself to coming back.  Otherwise I was afraid I might not get myself back, or, or, or just I was thinking when I was walking here, maybe that was connected with the feeling I've often had about not wanting to cancel, because then I'm afraid maybe I'll cancel all the time, if I start doing it. </p>

<p>And maybe wearing pants is something like that.  That I connect it with men and, and being male, I guess.  And maybe I think, I don't know, by wearing them that I'll become more masculine which is s—, I don't know, sometimes it seems that that's what I want to be.  (Pause) 
 
But the other part of this, I, I, so I don't know whether it's well, I do—, I uh, I don't know what the connection is, but the other part was, when you came for me, I don't, I don't think I remember that you've ever been dressed this way before, when I've seen you.  Maybe you have, but I don't remember it.  And so I'm used to you in a suit.  And I think I sort of expected that, and I would expect that anyway.  Just like I would expect — or, or, I don't know, that's why I was thinking it was connected with my thinking I should be wearing a skirt.  And I felt shocked, I think, when I saw you.  And i—, because you were dressed differently.  It had nothing to do with how you looked, it's just so—, it's just that you were dressed differently.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think it's definitely connected with you, because I can see uhm, I mean, just whenever I've seen anybody else out while I'm waiting and how they're dressed, it never affects me one way or the other. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, it isn't clear to me what "shock" means.  I mean, what's the idea that you're —</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) I do—, I'm not sure, except it seemed like it was you weren't dressed the way I expected you to be, and I couldn't absorb a change.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was just uh, well, sort of thinking about (Clears throat) my resistance to change in any form.  I was thinking particularly again about, mainly because the apartment question's been on my mind, uhm, how I've adjusted now to living where we are, despite aspects of it that are hard.  And since I have a little routine and I, and I know how to handle all the different situations, at least ones come up so far, I'm feeling less anxious to move and make a change, even though it could be for the better.  And (Sniff) I was thinking that has something to do with the fact you're dressed differently. </p>

<p>And then I think it, it must have something to do with, too, that it's almost like you're a different person, and I don't know who you are if you're dressed differently.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   It strikes me uhm, that there are some things going on, uh, we'll get to.  But the word "differently" is so ambiguous.  It doesn't say much.  And I find myself wondering what you're hiding behind it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, it probably is something, because it makes me think of the fact, when I saw you — well that's why I use the word "shock".  Or, uh, well, maybe that's not a good word, but uhm, when I, when I saw you, I think I immediately felt I couldn't look at you anymore, because I didn't want to see the change.  And so now, I use the word "differently", because I'm thinking, well I didn't really notice how you were dressed s—, except I know it's differently.  And yet I think I really do know what you have on, or at least uhm, uh, that that must be — I really feel as if I don't want to go into what I f—, remember that you have on.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And the other thing I keep wondering, is if I don't want to notice or remember, or did notice about what you have on.  Then, it makes me wonder if what you were wearing suggests a c_ certain image to me that I don't want you to be.  (Pause) But I'm not sure, because it almost seems, it seems connected with the fact you're not wearing a suit and shirt and tie, and looking very conservative and uh, and sort of businesslike.  I mean, it seems like there's almost something about that.  (Sigh, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know if this is running away from the whole subject, or if it's just another way to get at it, but I was starting to think about how I've reacted to the way MSCZ dresses, too.  And the fact that, on the whole, I've sort of enjoyed seeing men wear different things, and be freer.  Or at least have more of a choice of kinds of things they can wear, and everything, that the styles in the last few years have brought.  And uhm, I, I want MSCZ, I think, to dress fashionably to, an extent.  Except I don't want him, I get upset if he starts paying attention too much to how he looks.  Because then I f—, I don't know, somehow it's part of my image that a man doesn't care.  (Pause)</p>

<p>You know it's funny, I don't know whether it stems from the fact that my father was always sort of (Sigh), well maybe it was slow on the fashions or, or just dressed in, in a sort of indifferent way.  But when I think about it, in a way he really does care, it's just maybe his taste is different.  And so I like the effect of what MSCZ does when he cares.  But on the other hand, it bothers me to see him do things like look in the mirror to see how he looks (Sniff).  Because somehow, that's, that's the kind of thing a woman does.  And it's alright for a woman, but it's not alright for a man.  (Pause, Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>Mm, I'm not sure if my reaction to how you're dressed fits into this, but it just seems that somehow my feeling about the way people dress that I'm close to, like with MSCZ, fits into a feeling I have about, uhm, there being a distinction between, I mean, sort of exterior type distinctions between men and women that maybe have nothing to do with masculinity or femininity, except I don't know, somehow by having those exterior distinctions, then it seems to me you become masculine or feminine.  And, and then I feel more confident, or something.  And, I, I don't know, I guess it makes me think I'm, I'm not really sure what being masculine or feminine is.  And so then I need those differences as, or ways people dress or something like that, as a crutch.  And, and then that's what makes the difference, or makes you masculine or feminine, which instead of just being a sign, it becomes being it, itself.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You know, maybe it's time to start to put some of the things you've been saying this week, together.  For example, you, what you just said in effect is that there's an exterior sign that really distinguishes men and women.  One thing might be clothes and you say, well, I'm dressed differently, and you don't even dare to say what you see.  But then your thoughts go to MSCZ and the whole idea that if he looks at himself or dresses in a way that might uh, be different, he becomes almost — he does something a woman does.  Then you mention that you had been tempted to wear pants here, but you didn't dare.  Because wearing pants is for men to wear.</p>

<p>And you talked about this fear that you had at the time you were being sewed up when you gave birth to FSO.  And the idea that your vagina had been cut out, and that you were all sewed up, stitched up.  Something vital had been taken away from you.  And then you've talked about how you have this feeling that's very strong, that you should be regarded in a certain way now, by your obstetrician and your pediatrician and me, and I presume, others, too, because you have produced a baby.  You now have tangible proof of something exterior that says something very important about you and what kind of person you are, and how you should be regarded. </p>

<p>Now, at the same time that you say these things, this whole issue of who's in charge of the appointment time comes up again.  And it's true it comes up ostensibly in connection with real difficulties.  But you make it clear that at the same time, they're not all entirely of your own, that is, you, you have made some contribution to them, by forgetting what MYJ had told you, for example, as though it were very important for you to keep control over these.  And I think that's part of your shock, if I dress differently.  It's not only what it might mean about male and female, but I'm doing something you don't have control over, it's ex—, it's not what you expect.  And therefore, you're troubled by it. </p>

<p>Then you mentioned the idea that you had lost your virginity a second time.  Or you said MSCZ joked about it that way.  Now I think all these things add up to 1 central idea that you seem very preoccupied with and concerned about at the moment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (2-minute silence) Well, the thing I kept thinking while you were saying all these things, was I don't know it seem—, it seemed to me almost as if I went in a progression from first thinking I was a castrated male, to then if I'm not a male I have to be a female, and then desperately trying to work out something that I knew would be being a female, and yet not really feeling it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But then I think of having to control things, and wanting to control the time here, and uhm, I don't, I don't know if that fits in.  Except I'm just reminded that that's what my father meant, my having to control everything wh—, whenever he'd call me a bitch.  And uhm, I would always deny it.  But it's something I've been doing all my life, and I don't know whether it's part of trying to prove myself as something, whatever it is.  Because whenever I think of control, I think of that as being a masculine thing. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, I think that's clear.  You do.  And that's why you didn't dare wear pants.  Because that's what you want, and you're were trying to deny it by not wearing pants.  And my hunch is that part of what you're talking about is, this is your reaction to having a girl.  This is the way you're expressing your disappointment, I mean, to not having a boy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) You mean in trying to become more masculine myself?  Or —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Keep a tight rein on everything.  Go through all of these things.  Because you said that you didn't think you had felt anything about it, and you said nothing.  And considering how important the whole idea was to you before, that's rather surprising.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, something occurs to me, and then I'm puzzled about something that's been said today.  What occurs to me is just that uhm, for a long time I found it very hard to speak of FSO by her name.  (Pause) And it seemed like that came out of somehow, my keeping a distance from her emotionally.  And I also found, just when my reaction to her being sick reminds me very much of what I always thought my family's was, or my parents' reaction was to my being sick, or any of us.  That I don't know, it was as if there was a danger there of something happening to the child.  So then you had to make up to the child for all the — maybe it, they were unexpressed things, but at least feelings that you had had — negative feelings. </p>

<p>But then the thing that puzzles me is that, if all these things have been part of this, I don't, I guess I just don't understand how, how it all works in.  Or, I, I was thinking in particular about my feeling after she was born, and you know, feeling I had lost my vagina.  And then, well I guess, — (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure which came first.  But, uhm, I just suddenly felt you were laughing at me, and then I felt angry.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why would you think I was laughing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, I mean, it was partly the sound that you made just at that time.  But it must be from what I was saying.  (Sigh) Which makes me wonder if I were (Sniff) really thinking I was denying something that I knew was not unclear to me, I, I'm not sure.  But —  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You see, I think there's absolutely no question, at least there's none in my mind now, but what you have strong feelings about FSO that you are not really letting yourself have, or, or, or become aware of.  See, one of the the things for example, that struck me, was when you said now that you couldn't call her by her name for a long time.  It reminds me of how I was very struck by how casually you mentioned her name to me in the very, when you first came in this week, I_ it just struck me as it was such a, it, it must have meant something that you told me her name the way you did.  Not by telling me her name, but by referring to her, casually.  And so exaggeratedly casually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was aware of it, too. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   And that means you're hiding something, I'm sure.  From yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Uhm, I, I'm remembering just (Breathes deeply) the first few weeks at home when I, uhm, I don't know, just sort of mechanically took care of her.  And I, if anything, felt res—, not maybe resentful, but — well maybe resentful.  But certainly I wasn't enjoying her, and I didn't feel any great warm feeling toward her.  And I felt very guilty about it, because, I don't know, everybody always says how wonderful it is to have a baby, and suggesting immediately there's a strong warm feeling.  And I just didn't have it.  And I'm enjoying her more now, and I don't know whether it's because I've repressed whatever the real feelings are, or if, or if it's something else. </p>

<p>It's, I, it's almost like I've gone through a thing of convincing myself a girl can be just as nice as having a boy.  I think I've done that, to an extent. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   But the need to convince yourself implies the opposite feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Interrupting) Umhmm.  (Pause)  Well in a way I've been, sometimes I think I'm glad I had a girl, I mean glad in sort of a indirect way, because I, I, I don't know that I understand fully, why I wanted a boy so much.  But I know I did want a boy and I think I get sort of afraid of what I would have put on to a child if we'd had a boy.  (Sigh) But maybe that's just another way to convince myself I'm really glad I had a girl. </p>

<p>But I also — probably because I keep thinking of it must mean there's a connection I'm just not seeing — but I keep wondering how this feeling toward FSO, or feelings I'm not yet really admitting, have anything to do with my feeling about losing my vagina, or having intercourse with MSCZ.  Well I can see having intercourse with MSCZ, because I think I've always associated intercourse with loss of control.  Which makes me almost think that, I mean I, it occurs to me that then being afraid I'd lost my vagina might be wishful thinking, and I (Mumbled) p—t that I had lost it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I'm not absolutely certain of this, but you did have the idea as it turned out, incorrectly, which makes it even more interesting maybe, you did really think, you know, that your mother had a hysterectomy after she had MLWZ.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   That she had something removed that was vital.  And it's true, you weren't thinking of a hysterectomy, but it has the same ring to it, almost as though that was an expression of your wish that it was all over now, and you had had your boy, and that was it.  
 
PATIENT: (Pause) It just, that recalls to my mind another thing, another feeling that has gotten rather vague now.  I mean, I suppose now I'm thinking well, I have to have another baby so I can have my boy.  But I know that right after FSO was born, even though I knew she was a girl, or maybe I hadn't really taken it all in, but I — my feeling was at first, uhm, that I didn't want to go through it again.  Or I didn't see how I could.  Then by the time I left the hospital I wasn't feeling that way.  And I don't know how much that has to do with just physically I felt so much better by the time I left, so I was feeling differently, or what. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

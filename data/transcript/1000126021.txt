<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 15. Interview 15.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just woke up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just woke up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:00:10.8) to wake up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I was awake; I took a nap.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:00:16.9) this long, I couldn't even do that. I've been up since about 7:30. And I [had to] (ph) take a nap, you know. Things went OK over the weekend at my folk's house. I guess I, every once in awhile I had thoughts of wanting to say something to them, you know. 0:00:47.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wanting to say [to them] (ph) about the abortion or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and how I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your resentment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I was, you know, kind of toying with-well I asked my dad and (inaudible at 0:01:03.0) I [hate going to] (ph) the clergyman's consultation thing. I asked him if he knew anything about it. And his knowledge about it was it was for clergyman who are thinking of leaving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The clergy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I said, "They also do some other kind of counseling, (inaudible at 0:01:24.7) they do abortion counseling and all." But he didn't know anything about that. And then I kind of asked if he knew anything about that. And there was another time I asked him it he knew anything about the (inaudible at 0:01:34.3) Society (inaudible) help make my connection [for this] (ph). They have a-they said -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you were kind of throwing out hints or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well I had wanted to just ask him, you know, what he thought about, you know, women having abortions and all. But I kind of felt somewhat paranoid about just blatantly throwing that out there. I was throwing these other little things out. He didn't know-he knew a little bit about them, but didn't agree with them, their philosophy. That was really all I (inaudible at 0:02:16.3). And then Sunday night, I stayed over till Monday, the news was on and I was working on my paper in the other room. And I heard them talk; the newsmen were talking about Illinois legislation to liberalize the abortion law in Illinois. I was listening; all of a sudden my mother comes up with something totally-while the guys talking about this-totally unrelated, you know, so she hadn't even been paying one iota of attention to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were sure paying attention to their reaction, but they weren't paying attention.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) they weren't paying attention to the TV and what they were saying. And I just thought-sort of sat and laughed to myself (inaudible at 0:02:57.9) (laughter). Like she wasn't even paying any attention to what they guy was saying. And I guess for me, whether I had an abortion it's still an issue of concern, you know. I've been close [enough] (ph) related to the issue. But they didn't hear it though. I was in the other room [and like, did they say anything about it] (ph). 0:03:20.5</p>

<p>But they were very pleasant all weekend. And I-part of it was that it was nice to be out of the city. And it was a very nice weekend. And that was enjoyable. And I got my paper done. And I had to deal some stuff out about the wedding and they were unbelievably cooperative about that in terms of letting me do whatever I want to do with it, which was, you know, really nice. 0:03:48.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:03:48.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it really turned out to be free of hassle. I was so amazed. Like they, at one point my mother-and I guess this is that the bride's mother always buys her dress for her. Well I didn't know that. I don't know these traditions [either] (ph). So she said she was going to buy my dress for me. I said, "Wow, that's really nice" like that. I don't want a wedding dress, you know." She said, "Well you're going to wear a dress." I said, "Yeah, but I'm not wearing one of those wedding dresses" you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:04:16.7) things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she said, "Well" you know. And she was really great about it, you know, even to the extent of, you know, and I said, "You know, I'd really like to [get into] (ph) like something like one of those jumpsuits; you know, with the big, big legs, pant legs." And she was even accepting of that. So it was really amazing. Then all of this came out very well. And I, I'm sure that helped, you know, me not feel overwhelmed or anything. 0:04:46.9</p>

<p>And there was only about once during the weekend, you know, [when] (ph) everyone was being so nice that I felt "what [am I] (ph) being so nice about?" and you know I felt as though I really-you know I kind of feel as though, from our talking Friday it really got [worked] (ph) through in a lot of ways that perhaps there's that [mental] (ph) still there, but it's, you know, kind of accepted and not -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:05:11.0) live from that kind of resentment and act-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it kind of sounds like [you] (ph) were really able to [be] (ph) pleasant (inaudible at 0:05:22.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was, yeah, it really was nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of [strange] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really had an enjoyable time and it was OK. You know, I'm sure I would have, you know, reflecting on it I'm sure I would have felt a lot differently had they created hassles about the wedding. But that helped, you know, make that issue about having an abortion and not being able to tell them about it less serious, you know, less overwhelming. 0:05:54.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of, it's like there was just enough pleasantness and lack of hassle so it didn't cause that to be brought up in a way (inaudible at 0:06:04.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Could have] (ph) swung the other way had it been different perhaps.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I might have really, you know, felt bitter and made walls (inaudible at 0:06:14.9), you know. But you know, like my father's thing was he wasn't really sure about the idea of having it outside. And he said it was because of rain, but I really kind of sensed it was the whole idea of the church, you know. You should have it in the church, you know, after all it's a religious ceremony. You know, and I told him that we were going to write our own vows and stuff. 0:06:38.0</p>

<p>And as the weekend progressed, you know, they were really-he was even accepting of that. And I said, "I agree that an alternative ought to be set up so that in case of rain or something we have something to do." And he's very structured; things have to be done very correctly. And you have to know-he has to know exactly what's going on. You know, one point he said, "Now, you have to let me know what you want me to do, you know, what you're going to say, what you're going to do about this service." I said, "Pops, it's only middle of May, this isn't going to happen until middle of September. And I have to talk to Don. We have to put our heads together what this is going to before..." I said, "Don't worry; I recognize you're need for structure." [Anyway] (ph), and he, you know, went along with it then. 0:07:23.2</p>

<p>And [he was] (ph) really OK with it. And so I feel like that's, at least that's as settled as it can be and I don't have to feel-I don't feel bad about it so much anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:07:41.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess something that happened last night isn't much of a big think except that I've gotten to the point, you know, I can not wait to get out of that apartment. It's just getting intolerable. There's a lot of reasons. But it's like my roommates and I, particularly Jill and Kevin, you know, not so much Daisy and I are much closer. But it's that we can't say anything to one another [around] (ph) something that we don't like. Like Kevin leaves the lights on all the time. Like Jill never cleans up after herself. And like sometimes, OK, but when it's after several days it get to be kind of (inaudible at 0:08:30.6).</p>

<p>Last night I was, you know, I decided to go to bed, I turned off the lights that I left on and I said-I have some plants. Jill's already broken one of them. And it was an accident. And it didn't bother me. But I'm, you know, really particular about it. They had a dog around Christmas time and he destroyed a plant that I had. So I really-you know it's something new for me that I just started really liking. (Inaudible at 0:08:54.8) take good care of these things. (Inaudible at 0:08:57.4) window open and I had to move the plant, so they moved it [the wrong way] (ph). And I said-that was all right. I said, "Would you just close that window part way before you go to bed?" because it was supposed to rain. And you know it's just (inaudible at 0:09:11.4) [be sure you do] (ph). "Yes and I'll turn the lights off too." And I said, "OK." you know. And she said, "You make me so angry when you say things" you know. And I said, "Well, Jill, things don't get done and I just asked you to close the window." And I don't know. She said something else and I said, "The other night the lights were left on." You know, I got up, I woke up at five in the morning and the lights were on in the living room, you know. They don't get turned off. OK, and I said, "I don't mean to make you angry." 0:09:45.7</p>

<p>And I didn't-you know, like it seems to me that we can't say things to each other without sounding like a parent kind of thing. And I've gotten to where, you know, I won't say anything and it just makes me angrier that we can't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you can't say it without kind of having loaded innuendos. It sounds like that and it's really bad because there's a whole lot of irritation there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean they really are. And I'm sure I do some things and once in awhile they come up. And I try very hard not to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it just sounds like it's pretty tense there in a way, kind of like bad habits getting on each others nerves.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they really are, you know. And afterward I wished I had-you know I didn't blow up or anything. And I walked in the room and I almost started crying and I [said] (ph), "This is stupid to feel like this." You know, it really put down for [us] (ph) saying something that that won't get done, you know. And then I started to think, "I wish I would've blown my stack and said, "For Christ's sake, we can't say a thing to each other." We oughtn't to feel like that. We ought to be able to say, "Look I can't stand the fact that you walk around telling me to do stuff, you know. But we can't do that and I just got really angry. And I decided, "Shit, I'm not even going to stay in this apartment. I'm going to leave as much as I can. I'm not going to do anything. I've had it." And I woke up this morning angry. I couldn't talk to anybody. Daisy came in and I said good morning and I said, "Don't talk to me I'm a bitch this morning" you know. And I went the whole morning just feeling really angry. And like Kevin came in and I didn't say a word to him; I didn't say good morning. And like I also get stupid picky (inaudible at 0:11:27.2) about things and I know that so I really try and keep my mouth shut because I know their stupid.</p>

<p>Like most of everything in the apartment belongs to me. And OK, you know, that's alright. So Kevin comes in, he always uses the blender. He never, you know, washing it out for him is running some water through it, you know. So every once in awhile I clean it out because it gets just, you know. So he's running this thing -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:11:57.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he's running this thing and I said, "The instructions to use the thing say don't run it for a long period of time. You should run it, stop it, and run it." So it was going on for 30 seconds, it's still going. He's (inaudible at 0:12:14.1) "you think that stuff's mixed up enough?" He said, "Yeah." OK, then he turned it off. And I wonder if that sounded irritated, you know. Like I was really paranoid about sounding like I was -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were feeling irritated, but it was kind of like that seemed terribly reasonable for you to ask that. But you just knew-kind of felt paranoid that I must be saying this and showing my irritation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I, I really don't even like to be all right when I come back to the apartment Monday (inaudible at 0:12:44.5) I can see it's going to be one big pig pen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like it just becoming so much irritation; just you'd rather not go home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean like I don't even want to be there anymore. There's just absolutely no (inaudible at 0:12:56.1) because people don't pick up after themselves, you know. And I'm sure; on occasion all of us are guilty of it. I know some people are worse about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now you don't [care what] (ph)-you feel like they're the pigs, the guilty pigs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I just feel like not lifting a finger to anything anymore. I don't know. I guess what it is, is I just feel like there ought to be some way for us to get together and get some of it out because I'm sure it must be building up inside of Jill because she wouldn't have said that to me last night. You know she wouldn't have jumped so quickly to feel irritated either, you know. 0:13:35.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like the annoyances of (inaudible at 0:13:38.0) so it makes the psychological tensions to the, just the things that are wrong too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And I-I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you sound pretty fed up with it. I mean because when you're talking about it (inaudible at 0:13:54.0) hear you're -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I am. I just really am. It's just gotten to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like it doesn't feel like home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh like I'm counting the days to get out of there. Every time I go to my parent's house I take as much junk as I can put in the car and take it, you know. Like I've already started moving out.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if I could I'd move out today, you know, without any qualms with it. I'm sorry; I'll pay my rent, but I ain't living here any more. And that's not right either. I feel like, you know, in a sense that's sort of unfair, too. We never can sit down-like what we had done when we moved in was decide to meet together about every month at any rate, just to get rid of some of those tensions that build up, you know, and let off bitches. In a situation where we knew it was -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was the thing that [defined] (ph) the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right that we could do. We did it during the summer and sometimes it was really helpful. It helped to say, "Look Casey, you don't do this. So do it" you know. And it would remind me that there are some things that I do that irritate people so I would be conscious of trying not to do that, you know. And I could do the same. 0:15:05.0</p>

<p>And Kevin never liked it, you know, when he moved in. We did it twice during-we've done it twice, you know. And I think they were OK except they were so few and far between.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. They just (inaudible at 0:15:21.8) function (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it wasn't as useful as we, you know, wanted it to be, and like things just begin to build up. And I didn't want to leave, you know, feeling angry about having lived with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you don't want to feel like you're running away from a mad house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:15:42.5) I feel like I'm running away from them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like to feel better than you could (inaudible at 0:15:48.2) group living in (inaudible) would be OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's for sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It sure is help] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Anyway, (inaudible at 0:15:58.0) deal with it. I guess -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:16:00.5) you got (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I do. I don't see any way of resolve here. You know, I guess Kevin's perfectly satisfied to just, to survive in the environment without doing anything about it. I don't like to live that way with people. And Jill gets fed up and I understand why, because Daisy and I always-things that Kevin does have to go through Jill, you know, like we aren't as open to Kevin about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that her boyfriend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. and-which is unfair, but it's like he's unapproachable, you know, like, it's like if you say something you're not sure he really hears what you're saying anyway, you know, and he thinks they're really stupid things to say to him anyway, you know. I don't know. Like what had happened is Kevin went to South Dakota two weeks-last weekend, two weeks ago, and borrowed my camera. It was OK. (inaudible at 0:17:12.3) last week I said-and I thought, well he said there was some film left in it so that he and Jill are probably both going to use it. So I said to Jill, "Hey, I'd like my camera back next week because I'm going on a camping trip and I want to take it with me." "Well talk to Kevin about it. Tell Kevin." So OK, you know, that didn't bother me, you know. 0:17:32.5</p>

<p>And then I-so the other night I said, "Hey Kevin, before I forget" you know he had just walked in the door, but I forget to say stuff and I don't see him that much. I said, "Kevin, before I forget I wanted to ask you, can I get my camera back by Friday because I need it, I'm going away?" "Oh well, yeah, I ah, yeah." So he didn't say anything. Well and then he came back; he went and made a phone call. He said, "Well I guess I'll have to get you a new one." He lost it (laughter). 0:18:03.6</p>

<p>And I said, "Oh, you just [lost it, huh] (ph)?" Oh, OK. I want a Kodak instamatic (laughter) just make sure it's Kodak because the other ones are cruddy. And I said, "OK, but I need it by Friday." And I'm really. I'm not sure if I should say anything to him because -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To remind him, you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know it's not going to show up Friday if I don't say anything. I'm pretty sure of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that sure sounds irritating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You lent someone your camera. They don't say they (inaudible at 0:18:36.9) and you have to ask for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like I had film to use up. And he knew it was missing or he wouldn't have-because he said, he said to me, you know, when he was saying he lost it, he said, "We thought maybe it was in Dan's car" you know. He didn't have any God damn film in the thing at all. So I don't know. I decided how can I do this. I want a camera to take on the camping trip because it's the last time I'll be with a lot of these people from [uptown] (ph) and I really want to take some pictures. 0:19:06.3</p>

<p>And I want to tactfully let him know not to forget to get that to me Friday. I know he goes to work all day Friday and I'm not sure, like, I don't know whether I should say something-I can't say anything today, I probably won't see him today. I'm not sure if I'll see him tomorrow. I hate to go through Jill because she'll get Kevin really angry probably. Now I may see him at supper tonight. And I'm really, really sensitive paranoid about saying anything about it. And I don't know, maybe I'm jumping the gun by assuming that I won't have a camera by Friday and being really untrustworthy. On the other hand I don't-there's no reason to trust him. 0:19:55.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, [he sure] (ph) kind of (inaudible at 0:19:57.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I guess it's kind of, you know, in one corner of my mind a preoccupation kind of thing. How to deal with that; not sounding parental and getting it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like, I mean it's kind of like it's kind of functionally necessary to have these things, but kind of to try to do it the right way. I mean it's kind of uncomfortable to begin with (inaudible at 0:20:30.8). But yet, you (inaudible) camera. And how to do it without kind of sounding bitchy about it (inaudible at 0:20:38.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and the other thing also -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like you feel guilty for wanting your camera.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Well another -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It shouldn't become a struggle; I mean it is your camera.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (laughter). The other thing, it said it was an old camera, you know, I've had it for a long, long time. And I feel a little bad about him having to buy a whole brand new one. On the other hand, I don't have the money anymore to buy it, you know. And if I said pay half for it I couldn't afford to pay the other half. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you wouldn't have [wanted] (ph) a camera. You feel bad making kind of a profit on the deal, getting a new camera for an old one, but yet, it was a camera.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he lost it. Yeah, (inaudible at 0:21:17.1). I guess I shouldn't feel bad about it, you know. I'm sure that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I'm sure you feel OK if you got your [equivalent] (ph) of your old camera, but just (inaudible at 0:21:25.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I would, you know. Well like Jill said, "Oh just think, now you'll have a flash." The flash didn't work on my camera. And I took it -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of felt she was saying -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I didn't. I took it as her, as just a nice comment. I didn't take it-but afterwards I thought gees I'm really making something off this deal. I don't know. I guess I just wasn't-you know, how do you think-how do you think I can deal [that out] (ph). I really don't know because it's just really disturbing to even approach it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I (inaudible at 0:22:00.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter). You want to come over and ask Kevin for a camera?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, [I mean] (ph) look it's going to be, it's, you know, the nature of the thing (inaudible at 0:22:10.7) we have to talk to people. You know the point is you have really two choices, you can say f**k I don't-f**k the camera. Or you can say I [need] (ph) the camera. I mean to yourself, in your [attitude] (ph). Obviously you need the camera. That's (inaudible at 0:22:25.0). You can just say, "Hey, you know, it is important for me that I, you know, I really do (inaudible at 0:22:33.2) to use my camera." And I just, you know, maybe you wouldn't forget, I just want to remind you and make sure."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. I was just thinking -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it doesn't sound bitchy or [anything] (ph), it just kind of sounds like I'm concerned. Maybe I'm silly to be concerned, but I do want the camera, I need a camera.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I guess to preface it by saying that I don't want to sound like I'm pushy, that I do want my camera.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Crosstalk) or, you know, you may remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I was just thinking one other thing -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it's honest, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, right. Because now I don't feel bad asking for it because I was just thinking-I guess I look at Jill and Kevin, they're due to be getting married in June anyways. You know I kind of look at them as, in one sense, you know, one, a oneness, you know. And I was just thinking as you started talking that (inaudible at 0:23:25.8) some time ago I let Jill use my car and she put a dent in it right when I had just had it fixed, I just had the door panel replaced from someone had hit my car and took off. So she put the dent in the car.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like (laughter) she doesn't bring you good tidings (laughter). Don't (inaudible at 0:23:46.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and I didn't know what to do. I [thought] (ph) hell, if I go through the trouble of having the door replaced it's going to cost her about $100. A dent isn't that serious. If one dent [were a little paint] (ph). Well it [is, you know] (ph). It will take several days, you know, there's that whole hassle of being without the car. So I sort of decided not to do and I said, "Look, I'll get some paint, some touch up paint and you can pay for it." So and I'm really kind of angry I went up and the touch up paint only cost about two dollars. And I feel "oh I ought to get more out of this than two bucks from her for touch up paint." So I think what I'm going to do when I go buy the paint I'm going to tell her it cost me about five, six dollars, ten dollars (inaudible at 0:24:31.7). It's like the more I think about it-or every time I think about it. I don't think about it except when I question getting-Yeah, I got to do something about that. At least the rust spot, you know. And I think of it and I-dam that makes me mad that I just had that redo. It was only about a month afterwards. 0:24:49.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of just, you were being nice (inaudible at 0:24:53.2) your car and (inaudible) gone to the trouble and the inconvenience and the expense and the inconvenience of having (inaudible at 0:25:00.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really unfortunate because I'm always very reluctant to let anybody use my car [anyway] (ph). It's like the only real -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Crosstalk) use mine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like it's the only -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it has dents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's the only piece of property I own, really, you know. And I'm really having that, dam that was really upsetting when she did that. And she didn't tell me about it right away either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was she kind of really upset about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well she said she'd forgotten to tell me. How do you forget to tell somebody you put a dent in their car?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds kind of like she's wanting to (inaudible at 0:25:36.3) just like he was with your camera.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What had happened was it had happened and I hadn't noticed it until about the next day or something like that because it's on the side. And I came out of work from [Albany's] (ph) and I thought, oh shit. Look at that. I just had it fixed. Who the hell did that? Is sort of looks like somebody had taken a key only there's a dent not just a scratch, it's a dent. And I went "oh." So I was, called my, I was talking to my brother on the phone and I said-I was just complaining to him just to tell him that I'd gotten a dent in my car. And Jill overheard me on the telephone and she comes out and says, "Oh [Casey] (ph), I forgot to tell you, I'm the one that put the dent in the car." (Inaudible at 0:26:22.8) like that was two days later. She forgot to tell me. 0:26:27.2</p>

<p>And like I can't deal with conflict like that creates inside of me. And I said, "Oh wow" you know. And I really didn't say anything. And I couldn't say anything because, you know, it really creates a lot of anger, something like that. And I can't deal with that, you know. I guess it's sort of like last night too, you know. Like I really got angry with the attitude that Jill had about something I didn't think I-like I thought I was very careful not to sound parental about just saying "Would you make sure that window's closed at least part way?" because the wind was-you know, the whole room would've blown out. And I can't deal with that kind of conflict. 0:27:12.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of like things that just, you know, like you really want that way kind of don't feel right in saying that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wait, say that again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you did want the window closed. It's like feeling like you really want something and it isn't (inaudible at 0:27:29.4) to you, but kind of it feels very uncomfortable kind of to have to say that, you know. It's like you want to, but you don't want to come off shitty about something you want and cause others, you know, respond bad to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I end up being, you know, like I feel like sometimes I end up getting shit on because I can't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you can't say-[you're in] (ph) conflict to say anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know because I can't stand up to saying something. Well and then, then the anticipation of getting shot down for being honest or for saying something creates more conflict, you know. I'm more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Crosstalk) the thing is you don't say anything just feel lousy about it (inaudible at 0:28:17.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I was starting to make connections in terms of like working with groups of kids that I've been doing, you know. And it's really rough if a conflict arises, you know, unless I really feel safe about it, to pursue it. Just the fear of the results of encouraging conflict to take place. And sometimes I really think it's a good thing, intellectually anyway, I do, you know. But like doing it or provoking it, pulling it on because the end result may be positive. You know it's just really threatening. You know, like I really think that if we could bring some of the conflict I'm feeling anyway, and I sense that Jill at least is feeling some of it too, if we would bring it out I'm sure we would feel a hell of a lot better in the long run, you know. If we as adults were able to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Commune] (ph). It's kind of the keeping it inside. I mean it's kind of it's just it's lousy [me] (ph) to make (inaudible at 0:29:38.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it really is in terms of I can't wait, like I can't wait to get out of there because I can't stand to live with them anymore. And it comes-and I just, you know, I thought of it this morning (inaudible at 0:29:52.6) just like I'm beginning to dislike Jill and I've always had some distaste for Kevin. But that's, you know, just a personality kind of conflict and I can deal with it. But I've always, you know, liked Jill and felt somewhat close to her. And now this sort of build up inside and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Kills you] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and begins to really, yeah, kill a relationship that we've got. And the thought of trying to bring it out or work it out is really threatening. And, you know, like it's one of the things that goes through my mind right now is; is it worth the time, you know, to take that effort. And it probably is in the long run. Like I get around to thinking, like losing my, you know, about a month left, less than a month left to live in that place. So, you know, why bother to do anything about it now? Let it ride itself out and I'll be out of here shortly. Except that it's sort of a rationalization to avoid it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's a cop out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like (inaudible at 0:31:18.1), you know, just kind of wishing (inaudible) already rather than just trying to make it better (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I, but I, on the other hand I thought of trying to confront the situation. It was almost overwhelming.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why's that? Because it sounds like you do feel (inaudible at 0:31:45.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's like, how do you say let's get together because, let's get together, I don't know how you feel about it, but things, tensions and stuff are just building up inside and I feel if we got together and talked for awhile, you know, we'd all probably feel a lot better. You know, I can say this to you and approaching it -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds great (inaudible at 0:32:08.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then I-but the thing I see, you know, "Yeah, that's fine. When do you want to get together?" "Well how about-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, when do you want to get together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well how about-"Oh I can't then." "How about this?" "I can't then." And I can just see us going through it from day to day through the month saying that oh, we can't get together. F**k it. You know. That's where it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well do you-you don't know for a fact that that will happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't know for a fact that will happen. I can speculate just in how our days go and how, you know, like I don't think there was a day I've seen all three of my roommates and myself in the apartment together in weeks. And like, well I see suggesting it that someone, all of us, really have to make an effort to be together in order to work this through. And I guess, you know, it's sort of threatening to think, well-speculating that Kevin certainly as hell won't go out of his way, you know, to make sure he's there. Daisy will if you pick a time, you know. "Pick a time, I'll be there." You know and arrange it all. And I'm seeing that to really do it I've got to take the whole responsibility on myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at0:33:34.8). It's like, you know, you're feeling irritations, obviously they are but you're kind of have to be the one to really follow through to do something to kind of clear the air on things, in hopes of clearing the air.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and if I took that whole responsibility like I'm really afraid we'll sit down and everyone's going to say, "Well what did you want, Casey?" you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, "You fool."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. "Yeah, OK, you got us together now what do you want?" Like it's all mine. And then I open my mouth and, you know, like what I'm afraid of-and this might be unrealistic, but it's like no matter how tactfully I pursue it I'm being the bitch, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're doing the complaining. Kind of like you feel like you're going to have to do all the [swaying] (ph) them. Like what do you want? You're forced into the-you'll be put in the role of everyone's so reasonable except me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Complaining or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that's what it boils down to, you know, being afraid of that happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that kind of is the same kind of thing in a way as what makes you afraid just to say anything in the first place ever. I don't want to come off like a bitch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want (inaudible at 0:34:46.3) I don't want (inaudible) you know it's the same thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was just thinking, Don is coming this weekend and he'll be here for a little while. (Inaudible at 0:35:09.6) be with those other people (laughter).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Escape.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can complain to him for awhile.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like it's just to [what it is too often] (ph). It sounds like you really desperate to (inaudible at 0:35:21.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't sat down until now and really considered how realistic it might be to approach, you know, the thing. And I don't know how I feel about it because I haven't-until, you know, just now talking about it, thought about it. You know, maybe it is worth it. Another thought came to me this morning, you know, going through all these things. Daisy and I are throwing a party for Jill and Kevin and this other couple who are getting married in June. And I thought dam, I sure as hell don't want to put a damper on enjoying that, doing it, you know, and-because we were going to make it a surprise and we ended up having to tell her, just because of our disorganization. We were afraid we'd never get it pulled off.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: (Inaudible at 0:36:21.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like now I've begun to really fear that there's going to be this whole damper on even wanting to go to it, you know, be there.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: It's kind of like in a strained relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know that it will-the party itself, I guess I-</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Yeah, not the party, but if you-[well what were-I] (ph) thought putting a damper would, you know, a damper is if you brought up this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no, no. I was just saying that the kinds of tensions that exist now put a damper on it. I don't know-I didn't even consider whether trying to resolve conflict is putting a damper on things. That really depends.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: (Crosstalk) resolve them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it might not. I don't know.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: (Inaudible at 0:37:17.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've gotten to the point of planning days so that if I can't be alone in the house I won't be there because I can't stand it</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Yeah, you're just really trying to structure your life so you can avoid being I the apartment when they're there because you don't want nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. For example, Monday night I went uptown, for a useless trip when I got there, you know, like we were supposed to have a meeting. When I got there it was cancelled, no one had told me. And I thought, oh if I sit around here it could get boring. And then I thought, hmm I [hate to] (ph) go home (laughter). What do I do there? I'll just drive myself out of my tree. You know, so I stayed there for about an hour and a half and finally decided I would go home. 0:38:11.2</p>

<p>But even last night the same thing, we had a meeting and it was done relatively early and I could go home. And I kept thinking, I don't really want to go home, you know. And like I'm overjoyed, I know I don't get home until after midnight tonight. And I know tomorrow night, tomorrow [Wednesday] (ph) and all night I'm going to be gone and I'm going for the weekend, you know.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Oh boy, I don't have to think about having to be there. [And not] (ph) be there for all this time. 0:38:39.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know, it really is to that extent. And when I think of I don't have to clean up after people. There'll be something, you know. And I can just let the dirt pile up and I don't have to take any responsibility for it, though some of it is certainly mine. You know, I just really get driven into a wall about it.</p>

<p>As I talk about it I start to get really mad at myself for letting it bother me because it-I begin to think it can't be that bothersome to other people. Like I know it isn't that bothersome to Daisy, you know. And I know for sure it isn't to Kevin.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: [And you know] (ph) you may have different ways-you know everyone kind of has their own tolerance level [too though] (ph). Theirs may be more chaotic or dirty or whatever. 0:39:31.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you know what's so funny, Scott, is that I'm not the neatest person in the world. And I really recognize that. And all of a sudden I become this, you know, person who has o have everything immaculate. And I'm not like that. And it sort of evolves out of the fact that-</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Just kind of maybe its (inaudible at 0:39:50.2) and maybe reaction to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh it is, you know. It's like sort of, you know, it gets to the point where I recognize it being silly and I like I am now, like I'm beginning to feel angry with myself.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Um-hmm for getting so bothered by it. Kind of like you'd really like to be, you know, just more casual about it. And like it's-you're really worked up about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm at a point now I didn't even want to talk about it anymore because it's-</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: It's not worth it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not sure it's worth it.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: It's kind of like talking that is making too much more of it than I should be making.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, [that it's] (ph) like going overboard. And I sort of feel that talking about it to the sense that, you know, sort of helped with to let-to make you have to [layer it] (ph).</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Steam (inaudible at 0:40:52.3).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just let it out. Yeah, you know, I [get] (ph) to feel guilty because sometimes I just bitch at Daisy. Not at her, but about things that are going on. And like I've noticed Daisy used to clean up her dishes and her stuff and that's all besides other responsibilities that we each take on to clean up the house. But she'd clean up. But the biggest issues come around the kitchen and that nobody cleans up where everybody is all the time. And I noticed recently Daisy starts doing, has been doing other things besides her own dishes and stuff like that, you know, (laughter). And I'm sure much of it is a result of my bitching.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Bitching.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. [All that stuff] (ph).</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: (Inaudible at 0:41:41.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (laughter) seems like anyway. Wow. Actually everything else is fine (laughter).</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: When everything else is fine you can really appreciate the littler things in life can be bothersome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that's part of it, you know. I guess maybe also it's a part of, you know, it's getting closer to leaving and part of just termination of friends, you know. And I guess maybe the dissatisfaction of the living arrangement is that I'm really anxious to be traveling, you know. I'm really anxious for it (inaudible at 0:42:36.0) too. And that this is just getting drawn out. You know, like I got my paper done. I'm scot-free till graduation, at least in terms of any kind of written or exam requirements concerned. So that's all sort of done with and-</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: It's kind of like it feels like not [much to do anymore] (ph) just kind of [passenger time] (ph) until you're [moving] (ph) out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I have things to be done, but they're not-</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: The biggies.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the biggies are done with. And now I'm anxious just to get out of here, you know. And that's probably what adds to the tension. And I'm sure that starts welling up-you know like I guess I can identify that Jill probably feels some of the same kind of build up that I do because I know she's really anxious to get out of here. You know, like she's getting married really soon. And she's really excited about all that so I'm sure that that's part of her feeling too.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: She's kind of feels like put here until June. And kind of hoping for and wishing - there's kind of a tolerance for that kind of a, not (inaudible at 0:43:51.9) but it's kind of putting up with it kind of. You know, and that's the way you feel too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it really is. And (inaudible at 0:44:03.4) is that I recognize that. Again, you know, I'm not sure about trying to bring up the topic, you know.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Kind of like, well, it can be gotten through. It's not great. It's pretty bad. But it can be gotten through. I'll (inaudible at 0:44:26.2) five days and, you know, I'll be seeing them five days less.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (laughter), it is. I've got every weekend from now on until I get out of here planned so I don't have to be around, or be around very little. You know, like I foresee that this weekend but the following weekend is the only weekend I'm really going to be present, and maybe that, maybe only Friday. I might be able to get out Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>Because that's times when we're probably more likely to be around at the same time. And I've got it all planned out. I don't have to be there. And that's nice. I feel good about it (laughter). I don't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>So, I don't know. See what happens with that. One of the thoughts that ran through my mind was, sitting [upstairs] (ph), how many more times do we have? Do you know?</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Check my records. Five.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I had been keeping count and I (inaudible at 0:45:42.4) keeping count is by the-</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: The slips.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The slips. And then Sue gave me the month thing and it didn't coincide with what I had. So I said, "Oh hell. Somebody ought to know." (Laughter). I don't know.</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: This is, according to this, our 15th time (inaudible at 0:45:59.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I had, I guess I thought we met more than that, but I don't know.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:46:18.9) I guess I feel depleted (laughter).</p>

<p>INTERVEIWER: Should we call it a day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On Wednesday, December 2nd, Wednesday, December 2nd.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was a weird thing, I almost panicked. I was downstairs and you're usually early and you weren't here (inaudible at 0:00:12.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, was it? Wow, (inaudible at 0:00:17.5), what was that like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was like a panicked feeling of oh, Jesus, what am I going to do is she's not here today? (Inaudible at 0:00:24.8) weird, but I don't know, I haven't been doing as much thinking as I was before with myself. And I tried to - (inaudible at 0:00:32.4) on the way over here trying to open my mind up and find out what the heck is going on inside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Doesn't seem to be working, I don't know why. You know, I've been trying to go deeper and I realize that, you know, what I've said already is most of the things, at least the surface things from, like, a few years ago, you know, from, like, right now. And then, like, things that I can remember when I was a little kid but not much more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, there's something else you want to get to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know - the funny thing is that, see, if I would not know whether there was something there - but I do know there's something there, it just seems like - it's, like, I keep grasping for it and I can't get it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:01:09.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know where it is or what it is. You know, I just try to figure - you know, try to figure out where it comes from because we had a - oh, Jesus, we had a big hassle over the weekend. In a way I think it was kind of a (inaudible at 0:01:25.6) because I realize it - I know now a little bit what love meant. And I knew because I never get to that point where I did, you know, in friendship type love. And, like, my girlfriend has two friends and one is going to - now he's going into therapy up in Connecticut. Before he was with a psychiatrist who was taking him for his money in his group psychiatry, you know, or whatever it's called. And group therapy I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so anyway, you know, I was trying to explain to him and he didn't know what we were talking about. It was so frustrating because, you know, I just learned myself, like, a little bit what sharing and love was among friends and that. He just couldn't realize it. You know, it's like hitting your head against a wall and it really hurt because you know he was hurting inside too, and this would help a little bit if he knew how - have friends that would be able to share it with friends. And then we had another fellow that came over, oh, Jesus. Five o'clock in the morning he cracked up his car because he drunk. He had left our house, taken my girlfriend out. And oh, it was so depressing and frustrating. And then, you know, and then I realized something that what I should have been is more of a friend to him first.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I wasn't. You know, like, I started - and she said, "You talk to him" because she was tired, she went to bed. So I was sitting there and talking to him and I'm going (inaudible at 0:02:43.2) friend and you weren't very much of a friend and Jodie tonight and all this - and I realized what I should have done was first I should have just, you know, held his hand and said okay, you know, because this is $18,000 car he just cracked up. He was going to start to a livery service with an Oldsmobile and oh, God.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I wasn't - I felt like, you know, like, I really wasn't a friend to him at first. And I was just telling him, you know, like, all this baloney that - not baloney but stuff that, you know, like, most of the stuff I believed and everything, but I was trying to explain to him, you know, like, about friendship and everything. And he - and what I was thinking of, rather than explain to him I should have just better friend, and then maybe he would have caught on to what I mean, you know, then talk to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:03:19.6) done.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, and so - and I felt like I was a failure. But at least - it's very funny because, like, when I was talking to the other fellow these things just came out and I realized that, you know, like, I've gotten to that point where I can feel a little bit, you know, like, love. And I was reading Spock and, you know, like, he starts talking about children and if you didn't have love when you were a child, you can never give love. And I thought, "Oh, Jesus, you know, it's a good thing that I can feel like I'm, you know, giving." Because for a long time I would want to do something for somebody, like a friend but I was afraid to do it. You know, I had this wanting that I (inaudible at 0:03:58.4), well, if I do too much maybe they'll take advantage of me. 0:04:01.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my one girlfriend said one time when she can walk all over somebody, she doesn't like them anymore. I thought, "Oh, God, so then I got to watch what I do, you know, I can't go too far." And it's a weird thing, but I'm sort of getting a little less afraid of that now. But I realize...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give enough (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was - I realized that I must have had love when I was little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, and this is another thing that really bugs me because if I had love when I was little, why can't I remember it? I talked to my girlfriend I said, "You know, I can never remember my mother sitting down and saying 'I love you.'" And I can't remember my father hardly at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can't remember either one of them just sitting down and saying, "You know, I love you." And another thing is - and the reason why I was always self-conscious and that and feeling inferior, even as far as looks go and everything, you know, I said to her, I said, "Well, my mother was a good Catholic." And my girlfriend's mother had the same problem. Her mother said, "Well, I'm glad you don't look like me," you know? And I never realized it, but my mother had said just about the same thing. "Well, I'm glad you're not heavy like I am." "I'm glad you're not this," like, of course, I am but that's beside the point. But, you know, she's really like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she says - you know, like, things like this and I realize that, sure, that's what (inaudible at 0:05:08.8), how can you logically say you don't look like your mother when you know you do? You look in the mirror and you got the same facial features and everything. And she says, "Well, I'm glad you don't look like me more." You know, like, how can you feel?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's, like, almost like saying you don't exist somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, in a way but in a way, it's not even so much like that. It's like saying - let's see, how can I say it? Well, it's just so logical, how can she say that she's glad I don't look like her. First of all, it is almost like - to me it was almost like she was denying me, that I wanted to look like her, she's my mother, I loved her, you know, I wanted to be like her, and I wanted to have her personality. And (inaudible at 0:05:48.3), she's got a beautiful face, she's 54 years old and looks like she's 40. And, you know, and then she says, "Well, I'm glad you don't look like me." Well, thanks, you know, "You look like daddy," and I never thought I looked like my father. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: First, it doesn't make any sense (inaudible at 0:06:01.6)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it makes me - yeah, it was a little different with my girlfriend, she thought she wasn't pretty. I didn't exactly think I wasn't pretty, but it was just, like, I felt like, well, why doesn't my mother want me to look like her? You know, what's wrong with me that I can't look like her and I wanted to look like her, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:06:17.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: But she, like - she just came from this good Catholic background, that you don't look in the mirror and you don't do this and don't feel like you're pretty, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But to you it felt like she was pushing you away somehow?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, it was like the type of thing that - you know, like, I - like, you know, and like she said, "I don't want you to look like me" rather than what she really meant was, you know, like, well, you're prettier than I am or whatever she wanted to say. But rather than just coming out and saying you're pretty or whatever, she says, "I'm glad you don't look like me," you know? And again, it was, like, again, it was like pushing me away is right. That's a (inaudible at 0:06:46.8) the right - the size of it. But, you know, that's why I figure maybe that's why I was a tomboy too when I was little because I couldn't get any attention that way, like, I think a normal little girl should have. That's why Jewish parents are supposed to be so great and that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They always tell the kids that they're pretty even if they're not gorgeous, you know, they're pretty or the boy is handsome or whatever. And they get like a - you know, like a confidence about themselves, you know, in that area first and then in other areas, you're smart, you're this, you know, and I never got that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you wish you could have had that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, because, you know, like a little kid, you got to have something. And, like, it's almost like - well, I know why she didn't do it because she was afraid of conceit and all this that the church teaches.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I understand that now, but, you know, like, I can remember that - at least what I can remember - now again, I was talking to my girlfriend about this, she said, "Well, probably you just wanted to push that out of your mind because she..." a normal parent would have to say I love you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, they're just - she's not abnormal I don't think so it must be me. I'm just trying to probably push it out of my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, like, the other things - the hurts were probably were stronger for me than that. So that's about the only thing I could think of in that area that's, you know, whatever it is. There's probably something, you know, like, I really haven't gotten to yet that's really a deep hurt because otherwise - the things I've touched on, they shouldn't be that deep that, you know, like it would block out all these other things that my mother and father would have done that are - you know, that are good for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The hurts are blocking out the good things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but whatever it is - and it's funny because - well, I guess not. Like, a lot of things - like, when I hurt myself physically I can remember to way back to six years old and then five years old.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet, you know, like, there must be a hurt that's deep and it's - you know, like, with the - not to do with physical, you know, the mental and that, that I just cannot get at. You know, and this is what's bugging me because there's got to be something that's covering that up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that every time she'd say something or she'd say to my brother, I'd get jealous or something like this, there's got to be something that - you know, like, I thought that he was the one that was preferenced over me. I think that's part of it. And yet, my mother says no, she says, you know, I'd get all the presents and the aunts would come over, they would always give to me. And I said I don't remember that. I cannot remember when (inaudible at 0:09:03.9). And my brother buying stuff for me, I can't remember that either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just, you know, like, I can remember instances when my brother, like - one time he beat up some fellow because he was hurting me, I can remember that, but I can't remember him always giving me stuff. I just can't remember it. 0:09:19.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you just don't think of yourself as a child who got things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, uh-uh, it's, like - well, maybe it's because to me - that's why I'm getting now I think (inaudible at 0:09:29.2), material things don't mean a heck of a lot to me. And I think maybe because maybe my mother - well, maybe she didn't know. She might not have known how to really to give me love. And maybe that's why she - how she gave it, you know, any time she had money she'd be proud of herself and get me a toy or something. I remember I always had guns, though, which is weird for a girl. You know, and I always liked little boys' things especially guns, and now I can't stand them. I'm actually almost afraid of them. I hate them because, you know, like, I know what they can do. And I can't stand violence because I think it's senseless. But, you know, like, when I was a little kid this was the big thing. And I always like such a boy. Maybe that's part of the reason I don't like guns either because now I accept it almost that I'm a woman and I like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before I didn't like it. I always wanted to be a boy, wanted to be a priest and I couldn't be a priest because I was a girl. Things like this I felt like, you know, again, that was, like, a second best type thing. And - but there's something back there and I know it and it's just killing me that I can't reach it. And, you know, like, they say if you really go deep enough in that you can get way back to, you know, two or three years old if you remember whatever the heck it is that you're trying to cover up, or you are covering or and you can't get at it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it like you're trying to get something back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, like, I lost something when I was a little kid or I felt like I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something like that, like, you're really looking for something, it has to be something good (inaudible at 0:11:04.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm trying to find something good, but I think that I've also got something that maybe was even related to that good, like, yeah, that might be. It might be something like when we had our dog, we took in a stray and we got to love the dog, and all of a sudden the man said, "You can't keep the dog anymore." You know, and then it was gone. And the hurt was so bad that for a long time I couldn't even remember having a dog.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and then I said, "Oh, yeah, we had a stray that we picked up for a couple of months and had to get rid of." I think it might have something to do with that. And whatever it was, it was really good for a while and then, you know, like, it's gone and so I just wanted to erase it. It might even be when I was eight, I don't know.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good is always mixed with a lot of hurt (inaudible at 0:11:50.6)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you just forget the whole thing and then you don't have to worry about the good part either because, you know - (inaudible at 0:11:57.6) the bad part either. But, you know, I'm thinking that it was, like, when I left my mother when I was eight, why could I remember some things before that? I would think that I probably blank the whole thing out if it was because my mother left. But I can think of, like, a few inter-reactions we had. But just nothing to do with things like I love you and things like you're pretty, and things like you're - you know? I can remember her saying - she was proud because the baby (inaudible at 0:12:25.0) paper things, you know, like, paper chain.</p>

<p>And I said something like - I was about five or four and I said, "Is that sufficient?" And she thought that was very funny because I guess the word "sufficient," she thought that was big, you know, at that time I guess it was. But I can remember that because she was so proud. But (inaudible at 0:12:44.5) was she proud? I don't know, she talks about it now she was proud. But when I can remember it, I think I was hurt because she started to laugh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:12:53.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't know what she meant by the laugh. And then she said - what did she say? "What does that mean?" And I said, "Oh, that means is that enough." And then she laughed again because she thought it was funny again because I knew what it meant, not just using the word, but I knew what it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't remember whether the second time I also felt hurt or not. (Inaudible at 0:13:10.6) I think there was a great lack of communication. I don't think my mother talked to me a heck of a lot, even though, you know, like, there's probably more communication than I gave her credit for before. I know there's more. But I think - well, I know if I ever have kids I'm going to change that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, my kids are going to be talked to, they're going to be taught how to do things. But they're not going to - you just sit back and say, "Oh, how cute she is when she does things," you know, rather than have me lead them like you're supposed to, but she didn't know this, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because at that time they didn't have child psychology and everything. You know, it's just the idea that maybe that's probably what it was, we didn't have a real good communication, and I was just, you know, like, floundering back and forth. And I couldn't reach her. Maybe that was it. I just felt like I wanted to reach her and I couldn't reach her any way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't get to her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was, like - well, partly because she was in bed, she was bedridden a lot and she barely could get up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way you can see that because, like, you couldn't go out anyplace together. You couldn't - maybe she felt - I know she felt like she wasn't a good mother, I know that much from her saying it. Every time I go to the hospital, "I wasn't a good mother to you. I wasn't that (inaudible at 0:14:25.1) that to you." You know, I go like, come on, you know? In a way maybe I started thinking and didn't even realize it when I was little that she kept saying that "I wasn't a good mother." Maybe I felt like - like maybe she really wasn't a good mother, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And why wasn't she a good mother? If you want to be something you can be it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right and you deserved it too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, because I think - you know, well, maybe I do feel that way, that a child - you know, if you're going to have a child that's what you're going to do is give them love. I mean, it's silly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe in those days it wasn't because I guess they could have children because they didn't have the pill and that. We can if we wanted to now, we don't have to have children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:15:07.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, like, she only had two so she must have used something. And I don't know, it's just a funny thing that I feel, like - I feel like - you know, like, when I was talking to her and that, like, when she said this - and I don't realize a lot of times why things hurt me. But I can feel like a hurt coming up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can remember when she said that, "I'm not a good mother." And I tried to (inaudible at 0:15:32.3) say oh, come on, come on. But, you know, like, sometimes I hear myself inside saying yeah, you know? And I thought, "Wait a minute, you're not supposed to feel this way." Because, you know, like, again that's religion and things like this, you're not supposed to feel that way that your mother doesn't love you or that you don't love your mother or anything because it's wrong. And, you know, it's like a covering up, it's a weird, weird thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, two things, on the one hand you want to say she was a bad mother, but on the other, that's wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, and then yet, I feel, like - you know, like, now I sit down and I think I'm going to see her Sunday and that might help something, I don't know. So maybe by next week I'll know a little more. But, you know, and yet, I'm afraid because I don't want to hurt her. I told her I was going into therapy. And I thought, Jesus, I thought she was going to die right on the spot, oh, my God, what did I do, my daughter's, you know, a misfit. And I tried to explain to her that, you know, like, I just had problems that I had to get out, you know. Then again, you know, I could see the look on her face, like, "It's all my fault." You know, I'm going oh, Jesus, you know? I don't want her to feel bad, but then, you know, like, if she saw me and I was kind of upset because I might get upset, I don't know when I see her again. Because I know a little bit more about myself, not much but, you know, I do know that there is a problem there and I never realized it before. I just thought, well, I was a bad daughter because I didn't go out there very much. And I use the hospital as excuse, everything you can expand (ph) it. It's too hard to get out, you know? And it's just an idea that, you know, like, I want to see her and I don't want to see her. It's just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:17:00.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but now at least there's something there, you know, I feel some way or another. A little bit afraid but I kind of want to see her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then before I just said I don't care, you know, one way or the other. If I don't go out, I don't go out, that's the way it goes. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's, like, you have some obligation to her, but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's why I went before because it was obligation. I had to go see her and I had to tell her what I was doing. And then I would turn around and I would kiss her goodbye and I would walk out, you know? And, like, I could walk out of there, you know - when I think now, you know, I come in here and I talk about some of the problems (inaudible at 0:17:35.3) I start crying. And I go away from my mother, I know what kind of condition she was in, the rotten place she was in. I don't have the money to get her out into a nice nursing home or anything. But, you know, and then I could just walk away from that. And I could be going home and I wouldn't even think about her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and then I think to myself, "I could go see a stranger and I would have more feeling than that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I go away and I'd say oh, my gosh, look at that person, oh, that's terrible and I'd start to cry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't feel anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it's weird that at the same time you cry, like, here and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and even when I talk about her and my relations with her, so, you know, like, I guess I do realize I do love her, but, like, I - I just thought of that now, that I could walk away from her in the hospital and not think anything of it. Just walk away and say good, now it's over for another month or another two months and then I'll come back out again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and just walk right out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could do that, but somehow, it's still important to you that you love her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it is. I don't know whether it's more because society says it or because I really do love her. But it's way - you know, it's deep down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There are things that probably way deep down I can remember, you know, that she did love me and she did care about me and things like this. But at the same time there's got to be something there that's blocking this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is blocking a feeling even.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying to make it be true, like, you're trying to make it be true that you love your mother. There must be something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I don't know, maybe I'll find out someday, I don't know, whether I really love her or whether it's just that I feel I should love her because of, you know, what society says. I really don't know because, you know, logically I say she really didn't do anything wrong. What did she do? She got sick, that's not her fault.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's selfish to say, well, you know, like, you're depending completely on another person. But, you know, emotionally speaking she's my mother, you know, and it's, like, when people get divorced and they got the same problem, "Daddy didn't love me or mommy didn't love me, one of them took off and left me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, or it's me, I broke them up, you know? And then you got all this problem and I often wonder if something wasn't said, like, I got sick after you came along or something when I was little. Because, like, I can never remember her being really well when I was little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can never - I can remember her once in a great, great while just getting out of bed because she was always sick when I was little. And, you know, I couldn't help but just feeling like it's partly me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, you can't exactly say it's all her fault.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:20:15.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I can - you know, but (inaudible at 0:20:18.2) too, I think that little incident with my brother. She was well then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, she could do things with him, but as soon as I came along, I can never remember her doing anything. Oh, I think once in a great while she could possibly get up to the park when we were real little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:20:32.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was about maybe four or five and the park was, like, two blocks away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was the end, when you came along everything stopped?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was that - it seemed that way. And I don't know, maybe my brother said that too. We used to go on trips and we used to do this and that. I don't know, I can't remember. But I'm saying that he might have been the agitator.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it was, like, I talked to him the other night. We started finally, you know, after I got him calmed down because he's kind of (inaudible at 0:20:57.7), he's a chef so he's - what do you call it? He's, like, in the trades, but they threw out the union but he's still in the trades. And I was really getting mad because, you know, like, what the GE workers and everything are making and everything and how we're - you know, the economic situation in the country is getting ridiculous. And, you know, I'm talking to him and then he got on my source by the Kent State, you know, and I kept saying, "Look, I'm not even blaming the National Guard even - because they're not trained and they overreacted but they didn't know, actually, you know? Because somebody was throwing bottles at them, they didn't know how to react. I didn't really blame them. I said the person I blame is the governor for not having tear gas and things like this here that, you know, you subdue a crowd, you don't kill somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and my brother is going, "Well, (inaudible at 0:21:43.7)," like more of this baloney. And, you know, now you say to him, you know, but how can somebody learn a lesson when they're dead?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I said don't be ridiculous. And then, you know, we got almost into a fight and then I felt bad. But it's just - you know, like - yeah, see, he was raised by these old Catholic step parents that I was only there for three years, he was there about nine or ten, and they felt this way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it was just - I guess it bugs me because I'm getting a little more open minded. And see, this is partly with me, this is one of my problems too and I know it, that when I get to a certain point I want everybody else to get there too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my brother is not there and so it's sort of, like, I try to push him in something that maybe he is not ready for or maybe he doesn't even want. Maybe he wants to stay the way he is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, (inaudible at 0:22:32.1), like, you want him to be with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I never thought of that. That's possible too that I want him to be - go along with me rather than always going on his separate path. You know, going, like, with the other step parents and I got out with other different people, that could be. And them I'm thinking that, you know, like, I want him to go along with me. Yeah, that might even be more important than the issue itself because I remember I was really vehement with him about that issue, you know, he wouldn't see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:23:02.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: He wouldn't see it, good Catholic background, he wouldn't see it, "Kill them, kill them," you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's, like, he's your brother and what's he doing saying that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I guess maybe that's - maybe it is, maybe it bugs me even more because most small minded people like that, I could just say, oh, the hell with you and walk out of the room, you know? But it bugs me because, you know, this is (inaudible at 0:23:24.9) these stupid wars because of these small minded people. But, like, what can I do? I can tell them my point, if they don't want to listen then - you know, I just walk out. I say well, maybe they'll think about it. Maybe something will click in them, you know, they might change their ideas. If they don't, well, there's nothing I can do. But really bugs me that my brother thinks that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and I was really happy because he was looking into a Baptist religion. Well, like I said to my girlfriend, at least it's a first step. He may never get to the point of, you know, throwing off religion, but at least, you know, he's seeing that, you know, like, the basis of all religions is love and he's getting to that point where I was, like, about two years ago or a year and a half ago. And I'm hoping maybe for him that he'll get out of this. Well, again, maybe it's for me. It might be the same thing, maybe I'd like him to go along with what I will do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Like, (inaudible at 0:24:12.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it would be nice if it was somebody that I cared about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's funny, now I'm getting to the point where I think I feel a little closer to my brother again, you know? I don't think I could go through, like, a (inaudible at 0:24:27.8) going up to the Foley's, that's the other step parent for Christmas again. Because that year when I went up and that little kid was there, I was ready to strangle her. I was really jealous. And I admit it, you know, I felt like I was the outsider. My step mother is real nice to me, we sat and talked for about three hours. But, you know, it's just the feeling, you go up there and my brother buys her a watch for Christmas and he doesn't even send me a card for Christmas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I mean? I'm his sister, hey, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here I am.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, I mean, you know, my mother does it and then my brother does it. And it's - you know, it's getting ridiculous because, like, I've got friends. And when I think about it, my girlfriend's mother has been more of a mother to me than my own mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I move in and she's, "Come on over," you know, "Come on over." Okay, you know, and then it's, "Well, let's go swimming" and let's do this, you know? And here she is, you know, this woman that I don't even hardly know and she's going, like, to her - she calls up, my girlfriend says, "Jesus, I feel like you're her daughter. I go over there and all we do is talk about you and, you know, how you're doing and how is everything going, and is she having any problems?" You know, and I said, gee, you know, and then I invited over - I was there for Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it's just - you know, I can't believe that she'd do that. And then she makes everything and we help out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She does so much for you but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and she's...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's known me really as far as anything else goes, but I guess, like, over in Sweden they're like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, if somebody doesn't have anybody, "Well, come into my house," you know? "Welcome into my house." And, you know, here I am and I've got my own parents and they don't seem to want me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my own brother, you know, when he did that. When I went to - boy, that was such a trauma for me and I can remember it. I didn't forget that for a long time. And when I talked to my brother, I figured, you know, if you're going to be like this, I'm your own flesh and blood, I'm your little sister.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you don't even care, calling somebody else my name and everything. You know, this kid, okay, so she lives in the same house. So she's a nice little kid, she's spoiled rotten but she's a nice little kid, you know? But it's just the idea that I'm his sister and he doesn't even see me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, you should have had a family?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, we didn't. That's right, and it's so funny because people will say something, you know, sometimes it's really funny when somebody will ask me if I have any brothers or sisters. And I say, "Well, what do you mean, real or step?" You know, I said, "I've got one - I've got one - I've got one girl, this is another thing. My step sister, I lived with her for a year and a half. She's got a lot of problems in her marriage and everything. But she says, "Sure, mom's moving way out, come on move with us."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it's just, like, why? You know, like, what did I do that they want me as a sister? And she's always inviting me - I'm going out there for Christmas, you know? And you think about it. Thanksgiving, family time, I'm with one person's family. I'm with somebody else's family for Christmas. I wasn't even invited - I've got two of step parents too. Nobody's invited me for Thanksgiving or Christmas, you know? And it's just - it just - well, I know one of the step parents who's got, like, 60 kids she's raised. So, you know, I can see that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the other set never invites me out. Never - you know, like, it doesn't even bother me all that much I guess, it's just the idea that they were supposed to take the place of my parents supposedly so say the Catholic charities, you know? That's bull. But they didn't really, you know? And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hypocritical in so some...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, were they hypocritical, it was - if I ever had a child in my house, first of all, I wouldn't have one with my own children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would have, you know, one by myself or - unless if I did have that, then it would be an adopted baby and it would be raised and be my child, you know? But, like, I would go in there and I could see things, like, maybe it was just me partially because I felt rejected by mother. But I could feel that I was not, like, one of the family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:28:24.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and there were things, like, with the case worker would come out. It was, like, sort of reminding me that if you're not good, out you go, you know? And you kind of wonder and, you know, like, this is a family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is the way a family should be run? You know, not to me, baby. And then (inaudible at 0:28:44.7) and you're into another one and they decide to move out. And things, like, not even saying, well, you know, she's started going to the other - you know, like, the other foster girl, I wonder where she's going to live. "Oh, there's no problem with you, you're going to live with Jenny."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, thanks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, just shuffled off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, who cares? I guess what she was trying to say is this other girl was probably more insecure than I am. I mean, she was - she couldn't take care of herself. She was really - like, she was very below average in intelligence. She was very, very emotional. She would go through things, like, in the middle of the street she'd start balling and things like - and, you know, I mean, really not just balling but going hysterical just for no reason out in the middle of the street, you know? And she was really, you know, uptight and upset. So what she was trying to say is, like, "You're strong enough I guess so that you can help me with her because you don't need as much help." But see, I didn't realize that then. The only thing I could feel was, like, "Well, I'm worried about her, but I don't care about you." You know, "You can just go your own way."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. And I'm sure she didn't mean that because even now, you know, she said, like, why don't I call her and all of this. And she wants to hear from me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's the way it felt?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you really needed somebody and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and when I did need somebody or when I at least needed somebody to care about me, say, you know, like, if she would have broke down and cried and said, you know, it really hurts me that you're leaving me. There's just not enough room in the house or it's going to be too far for you to go to work, or even would you come because I probably wouldn't have gone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, but she didn't give me that choice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She just said, you know, like, "Well, you can't go."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and you kind of figure, I've been with that woman for six years. I used to clean that whole house and things like that for her. Nothing, you know, like, she couldn't care less.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you gave out a lot (inaudible at 0:30:33.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:30:33.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: As much as I could. It was hard for me to give love to her. I think it's always been hard for me. It was hard for me at the other place to the mother to give love. I mean, as far as like affection and that goes. Like, a lot of people come over and, you know, just grab her around the waist and kiss her and things like this. I could very, very seldom do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just like a thing with me, you know, I just couldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, just stuck?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I felt like sometimes I wanted to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but it was - I don't know exactly what it was, why I just felt like - but see, I've been like this a lot. You know, I feel like I'd like to do this. Things come up in my mind, you know, like, what could I do and I think, "Oh, this would be so nice (inaudible at 0:31:14.1). Well, should I do it? Am I going to get burned?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But maybe if you show your love then something will happen to you? 0:31:23.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that's part of it. But, like, with the last couple of weeks, especially, like - you know, it's been, like, about the last two weeks, my girlfriend sat me down one day and she said, "Look, like, you're not being a friend" because I burned a table, you know, like, a cigarette burn on a table and it's expensive, but I have to get it replaced. And I've only been calling the store and saying, you know, like, when your salesman goes in the lobby (inaudible at 0:31:48.8) order another table. And, like, that's all I've been saying. The woman says "Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I'll talk to him," you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said, you know, like, "You don't go halfway for a friend, you go down there and you yell at them or something and you get them to get that table."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I sat down with myself and I said, you know, "You do do that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then she said, "Well, you wouldn't do that for your own." And then I sat down with myself I said, "Well, I don't know if I would or not." First of all, I probably wouldn't have been bothered with the burn, I would have covered it up, you know, that's me. But then I said, "Well, this is, you know, a person..." I realized it had been from another dear friend and everything. And then I sat down I said, "You know, she's really upset about that." And I was when it happened, I was really upset but, you know, like, mostly I was upset and I realized (inaudible at 0:32:31.8) cried and everything, but mostly was upset because - not because of what I did, because it was an accident, you know, like, the cigarette fell out of the ashtray and it burned it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but it was because I was afraid that she was going to get so mad. And one time we had a fight before and she said something, like, "I don't know if I can go through this, you know, and you may have to get out of here," and things like this, you know? And I think I was really afraid that, you know, like, she was going to do this - that and she's going to say, "Well, if you're going to be like this in my apartment, you're going to be so careless, get out of here," you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, but then I got to the point, like, last week where I was doing things, you know. Saturday I made her a fruit basket and things like this (inaudible at 0:33:11.1) that one friend from Connecticut that's really messed up came over. And things, like, I was going to go home and I was going to go to bed, but then I came in and we had all these things laying around from the night before. I knew she'd bring him over there, and I thought, "Oh, God, she's not going to walk into a pig sty." And, you know, like, but it's just things, like, now I can feel - how can I say it? Rather than just always saying, "Now what's good for me?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I can think now, "What would be nice for somebody else?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and things like I wouldn't share a lot of times things that were funny at work or things. The only time I would say something is if I was complaining or if I was mad or - how can I say it? It was, like, I wanted something - like, I wanted to lur (ph) or something like this, if I had, like, a problem, I would go and I would talk or things. But rather than just, you know, silly things that happened at work you share and things like - now I can do that. I couldn't do it before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's more like giving (inaudible at 0:34:06.0)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's, like, because she would do that. She would call me and say, "You know, this happened." But my reaction to that would be, like, "Oh, Jesus, I wish something like that would happen to me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have such a boring existence. If I came out with something that I did at work, she's probably say oh, ha-ha, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's, like, before you were always sort of caught up in yourself and worried about what was happening to you, and now you can go out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm getting to the point where I can do that, but only for my very best friends because I trust them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:34:33.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, especially her. My other girlfriend, Eliza's got a few problems too with giving, you know? But, like, I don't talk to her all that much, we're pretty close, we can have fun together but, you know, like, we're not real, real close. And things, like, see, she's sometimes to the point too where she can't give to me, like, things like - or maybe it's just me too, my reaction. Like, she said - I said, "What are you doing Sunday" because I wanted her to meet my mother and to go to this auction afterwards because there's a really sharp priest. I mean, he's not Catholic, he's Anglican or something. But he's really for his people. In other words, like, he's for, you know, the love - the brotherly love, get out there and do something, don't sit on your rear end and go to church and pray. And, you know, like, go to church but only as, like - go and have the guitar masses and get into it, you know? And then go out and do something.</p>

<p>Now this is fine, if you want to be religionist and you want to follow that. But follow - basically he's teaching, you know? But anyway, I wanted her to meet him too. And she said, "Well, I got to go to a race" because, you know, like, our teacher, she also runs asked her to go and she hasn't seen a competition. Well, she said, "There's not going to be one till the end of the year." Well, the end of the year is the end of this month, you know? So that means there's going to be one probably next month. So I said, "Well, okay, you know, like, it's okay, don't worry. Some other time when I go to see my mother I'd like you to go along" because I met her mother, I'd like her to meet my mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the way she said it, she said, "Oh, that's too bad because I wanted somebody to go with me, I didn't want to go by myself." And, you know, it was like saying, "I called you just so I have somebody, like, to go along so I wouldn't have to go up there by myself."</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, not because, you know, you're my friend and, you know, this is the last competition of the year. Now, you know, she would have worried like that - "This is the last competition of the year and I'd like you to go with me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, or, like, she also said that she wants all the people from the gym to go, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So she said - she would have said, "I wanted to make sure you knew about it and I'd like - you know, maybe we can go together."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, this type of thing would have been great, but say, "Well, I didn't want to go by myself, I want somebody to go with me." You know, I said, "Well, as long as you're in the gym too you may as well go with me," you know?</p>

<p>COUSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:36:40.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this is so impersonal. You know, now I can't stand it anymore, that type of thing at least not among friends. I guess that's why Jodie and I are a lot closer because maybe she watches a little bit how she words things. I know I do because we've got a lot of some of the same hang-ups except she's more advanced.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, than I am, and she says she's got insecurity with men for different reasons, you know, because of her father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, like, it's really important to you that people make it clear that they care about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and for a long time I'm not quite so bad. Now this didn't hurt me a lot, but I mean, it just bothered me a little bit. I didn't even realize it. Like, I didn't even think about it again till now, you know, what she said on the phone. It was just, like, a slight thing. But at one time I would have thought, "Jesus, she doesn't care anything about me and, you know, this and that." I would have felt real hurt. But now, because I understand her problem, I still feel a little bit - because, you know, like, I can't get rid of it until I know exactly what the root is and then, you know, I can possibly replace it with something else.</p>

<p>But I realize, like, what Jodie said, you know, like, my girlfriend - the only time - like, the only time she really gave was she picked the person, she picked what she was going to do for them. And she wanted them to accept it and they wouldn't accept it so she got all upset.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but I guess I kind of understood it, then the second thing I thought of was, "Oh, my God, you know, like, she's not realizing this but again, she's being - she's not sharing as a friend." So the first thing was the little bit of hurt, but then the second thing was, you know, right away logic stepped in. So I mean, I didn't feel real hurt and start - I used to get real moody if somebody said - just, like, one wrong thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it's not that it's totally wrong, I mean, they really are going to be with you somehow, it's just that they say a little thing that doesn't make you feel enough cared for?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and then I can realize too that partly, I used to always think it was my fault no matter what it was. And then now I can understand that, you know, everybody else isn't perfect and you very imperfect. She's got a little problem giving too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:38:41.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she probably doesn't even realize the way she worded that. But it was like saying, you know, "Like, me first, but I want somebody to come along. I need somebody that I can lean on." So that, you know, in a way it was almost like, you know, like, she really almost depended on me being there, you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way if you wanted to take it that way. But see, I wouldn't take it that way because I still have that hurt. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's, like, you could take it either way, but you get caught in the hurt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm caught in the hurt naturally because I always take it in a negative way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it happened again the other night too, something about - what the heck did my girlfriend say? Again, it had to do with judo, that one of the fellows - I kind of liked one of the fellows at one time. But I found out that he engaged and his girlfriend's coming over there, and they're going to get married or he's going back to Japan and getting married. I don't know which. But anyway, the one I kind of liked the other girl was going out with, was supposed to go to a dinner with. And, like, she was going out with both him and then the other two fellows that (inaudible at 0:39:40.8) there's, like, three fellows she's going out with. So right away she says, "Well, I went out with him and I went out with the other two." And I said, "Oh, that's nice." They have never asked me out, you know? And then that's the first thing that comes, rather than - then the next thing that comes, "Oh, did you have fun," you know, that comes naturally too. But the first thing is why not me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's still that. I get so mad at myself when it wells up. But it's still, like - you know, there's something that's not quite, you know? And then, like, Jodie said too, "Oh, well, they asked me first."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "If I wanted to go." And then the first thing I would think of is, like, you know, "You always have to rub it in, don't you? That you're the very first one to go and then if you say no, then they'll ask either Eliza or I for something. But it's always you first."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm wondering, you know, like, first I would say that it was because she always feel like she has to be first.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then partially it probably is because she does like to be center of attention. I mean, that's just - you can just see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But partially it's me because I'm not there and I'd like to be. Now, they asked me, you know, to go over to their house for dinner, like, all three of us. And they've asked me if I wanted to ride to a demonstration. But I never think of that, the times they have asked me. I just say, "Why not, why didn't they ask me to this thing?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. You don't think of the times when they did ask?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They did ask me to different things and I said, you know, I was busy. He asked me to go to a move one time. But see, I thought because he wanted to pick me up at my apartment and I live with Jodie, and he likes Jodie, that what he wanted to do is just, you know, come over there to see Jodie then maybe take us both, or just take me just so that he could talk to Jodie, you know, before we left. And I said to myself, "I'm not going to be used like that." Even though possibly he just wanted somebody to go to a movie and he didn't care who it was. (Inaudible at 0:41:23.9) I didn't care, but, like, anybody who he kind of liked he'd like to take.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, it's really hard for you to see the good?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People coming after you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and - well, partially I think it's hard where I'm living now. And I think I'm going to grow a lot more when Jodie's not there. I mean, I can get a lot from her, you know, and I can - well, I don't know if I can give as much, it's part of the reason I feel like an inferiority complex, like, I can't really give as much as she can give because I don't have as much right now to give. But, you know, like, in a way I think I would grow a lot more if I had her like I had before - like, I had her as a model and as an example of some of the things and I've learned a lot from her, but not having her be there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, if I've got a problem I can call her long distance when she's in Europe or she can call me if there's something, or we can just talk and compare notes on what we're doing. But when I'm on my own, I'm a lot better or when I'm in a crowd that I'm either the best or I'm one of the best, and there's not really, like, that much difference between and whoever else is around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I almost prefer it, I admit it, I prefer - I like being the center of attention too. Sometimes I go down to a group that - I mean, they're college kids and that, but they're - I don't know, some of them, I don't know where they get their ideas. And some of them are, you know, like, "Kill the dirty niggers" and that, which that's another thing that really gets me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:42:46.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: But they'll get to - they - you know, like, in that group I find - I went to a party Saturday night and there was eight fellows in the kitchen. And there was one other girl who was very, very bright and myself. And we were the only two in the whole room and there was, like, eight fellows. The rest of the girls were in the other room glowering, you know, because some of their boyfriends were out there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or the ones that were with their boyfriends were sitting there like this, you know? And we're out there goofing around. I walked in and - walked in and had a drink in the kitchen, and one of the fellows came with me and all of a sudden, another one trickles in and all of a sudden, another one trickles in, another girl trickles in. And, you know, like, everybody's standing in the kitchen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, there's a living room full of chairs and we're standing in the kitchen and we were goofing around and having a ball. But see, like, I'm more confident in an area where I can - like I said, I can either be the best or close to the best or one of the best, you know, rather than this, I'm so far down from her in so many ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, that I - I can't - I guess maybe it's a competition thing with me partially, probably because of my brother too. You know, like, there must have been a competition, he was older, he was bigger. There was some way that he - I couldn't get.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Number one in almost any slot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, she set you off in that, you get a lot from her but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but, like, I can't go out with her because, like, if I cared for somebody, if I liked a fellow, forget it if she liked the same fellow because, I mean, she just knows all the ways. And I don't yet and partially because I'm younger than her, and partially because I haven't been around. I mean, when she was 16 she was living down on Cambridge Street and all this. She had had a lot of - I never was. I was very over-protected.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So here I am 21, na�ve Jane most areas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's - you see, this kind of bothers me too because I think look at now what she's had, 15 years old she was in college because of, you know, going to European schools and that, they finish quicker. And she was double promoted I think a couple of times too. So then I say - again, I say, "Why not me?" I think probably my mind works in certain areas as fast as hers, so I'm probably almost as bright as she is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:44:51.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, this is why it really frustrates me because I know I'm almost as bright as she is, I have the capabilities. I have practically all the capabilities she has.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you could be where she is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could be, that's right, I could be where she is and I guess I look at that. I say, "Look at this, you know, look what she's doing. She's making ten bucks an hour teaching, she's doing this." And here I am struggling along with my little typewriter and, you know, and these stupid jobs to make extra money. And sometimes it bugs me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really frustrating?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, to live in the same house with somebody who's been that successful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think once I start my voice lessons that that might help me a little bit. Because I really would like to do that, sing in a club on weekends or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it would have to be, like, a comedy routine because - or something like folk singing, like, Joan Baez or Joan Collins does because then it's important to - you know, it's not just the limelight, it's important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if it's not important then - you know, like, this is why I can't stand working for this rug company because they're dishonest with people. And I know if I get a lead or, you know, like, an appointment and there's going to be another salesman who's going to give them another bunch of hogwash. They're going to buy this carpet, and they do have some good carpet. Some of - they've got five grades, the best grade is good and so is, like, the second best or third best is fairly good. But the cheap stuff is rotten.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, like, they give these people this big bull line and I know I'm part of it, you know, and this really bugs me. It's not because I'm a religious, it's just that, you know, like, here I am (inaudible at 0:46:25.2) let's get out of Vietnam, let's do this, let's do that. And here I'm - you know, in this stupid business that's doing this to people so I'm quitting, you know? I just got to the point where I just couldn't take it anymore and I think that's why. I said it was because I wasn't getting leads, but I wasn't getting leads because I wasn't pushing for leads.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just wasn't pushing for appointments. A person would get on the phone, I found myself - I'd get on the phone and I'd say the pitch and they say they don't need anything. It would be almost like I'd be saying - when I'd say goodbye and have a happy Christmas, it's almost like saying, "Thank God, you don't this junk." You know, "And I hope you don't know anybody who does either." And I don't know whether that comes from my religious background or because, you know, like - well, business is full of baloney like that, though. Actually, probably any business I get into. I was typing envelopes and found out from this girl who was my contact that the fellows mixed up with the mafia. I said, "Well, as long as he doesn't give me any envelopes addressed to the mafia or anything, then I'm not going to worry about it." But, you know, I know there's probably people in my own firm that are mixed up in it. 0:47:25.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, it's just an idea that it kind of tugs at me that I don't like to do things that are - that's going to hurt somebody else. And maybe - you know, maybe it's because I don't like being hurt myself, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Might be, like, a selfish thing because I know how I would feel in that situation. Jesus, you know, I wouldn't want to buy a rug that's guaranteed for 15 years not in writing of course, and three years later you have to get a new rug.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you just don't want to be involved in that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's kind of hard to do to get a part time job where you're not involved in something that's kind of shady because most of them are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, at least what I've heard, a lot of them are. So I'm trying to get a part time job with this - I think it's, like, an ambulance service or emergency service or something so that, you know, this would at least be a help to people even though I know that they overprice that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know, I just get so frustrated sometimes with people. And I'm wondering if it doesn't have something to do with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, that I feel like how can people do this to each other?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't - I don't know (inaudible at 0:48:28.6) maybe because when I was a little child I was a roughneck and I used to like all the shows, now, I used to get - you know, like, my daydreams and everything, even now sometimes they're violent, which is funny because, you know, like I said, I don't do that. I wouldn't think of doing something, I'd never think of hurting somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm wondering if, you know, like, with my daydreams that are more or less like frustration and getting it out some way, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's funny that they should be so violent when you're...</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm not violent. You know, like, at least not consciously, I couldn't stand - when I'm judo and (inaudible at 0:49:01.2) showing something, the head teacher with a fellow - first of all, I like the other fellow he usually demonstrates on. But, and he's the assistant teacher. Like, one day or a couple of times I've seen him, he's going like this, you know, slap, but when you hit the mat that means you're supposed to stop that's enough. And he's going like this (inaudible at 0:49:18.1), I go, (inaudible at 0:49:20.5) "Stop it," you know? And I was, you know, I was about ready to hit him. You know, "Stop it, you're hurting him."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet, you know, like, in the daydreams - I guess maybe that's because these are real people. These are people that I can - or fabricated people they're never somebody I know. It's just something I fabricated completely in my mind and maybe...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People you don't know in the daydream?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the daydreams, no, there's nobody I know in them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 10:49:20.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Barely ever, if they are, they're more or less like a compatriot of mine, you know, they're not - I never hurt anybody that I can remember that I know in my dreams. It's always something I've just made up. And I guess maybe it's because I really can't bring myself to hurt a human being. Because you look and there's a human being, and you know what's inside of the, there's a soul and everything. But, like, this is okay because it's just like a - it's like going to the movies and getting involved in a movie, you know, it's all fabricated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, there's men in it, but they're playing a part, you know, like, people get killed and you know they're going to get out. They're not killed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like images you see in your head?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, like, sort of like movies or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like a movie type thing. It plays like a movie in my daydreams and dreams that sometimes even when I'm sleeping that I can remember from...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:50:31.7) a daydream it would be a gangster or something...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that type of thing. Yeah, it's this type of this thing, like a gangster movie or it's like the old Roman days and they have the coliseums and the fortress and this baloney. But this is very funny because I always switch roles.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I'll be starting to think about it and, like, I'll say, like, somebody did something and I, like, over react like the police would, you know, and you get whipped or something. And then, no, no, no, no, that's not me that's somebody else. And then I come in and I save, you know, then I stop. And...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't get the first part.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of switch roles in these things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, I'll start out and I'll be - like, somebody will do something to me, like, he's supposed to be, like, a servant or a slave or something, usually a man. I don't know but it's usually a man. And then I go something, like, "Well, you're going to get whipped." You know, and then I can see this going on in my mind or, like, not really the thing itself, but, like, somebody in pain, like, a man's (inaudible at 0:51:28.8). Then all of a sudden I wasn't that person anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was somebody else coming in and saying, you know, "You shouldn't do that." You know, I would stop it, see and see, like, I'd switch a role in that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So first you want to be cruel to him and then you come in and say...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I say - yeah, I come in and say, "No, no, no." Partly, I think I almost bring myself out of the daydream when I do that because I think to myself, (inaudible at 0:51:49.8), you know, I wouldn't do that. That's wrong, it's, like - it's almost like I'm writing a book of fiction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I say, "No, that's not right, I got to change that chapter."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I got a very creative mind, I've done things, like - you know, like, I've always gotten A's and B's on creative stories that I've written. But, you know, it seems like this, when I get into these things I go, "Oh, my God, wait a minute, I can't do that because that's not me or it's not what I think I should be." And I don't know whether it's - which it is. You know, which is more real, that I really have, like, a frustration and it might almost come out in a violent sense, but I've never been violent. I could never bring myself to be. Like in running, I worked out with my girlfriend and she's smaller than I am. I was scared stiff I'd hurt her. 0:52:34.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and maybe - that's very funny because when I'm working out with a fellow I don't feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Working out with a girl, I'm always afraid I'm going to hurt her, but I'm not worried - well, fellows first of all are stronger. I can work out with a fellow and, like, he can fall and, you know, I'll even say, "Are you all right?" "Yeah, I'm fine." And they throw me around, I say, "Don't treat me like a girl, just, you know, treat me like a partner." But, like, I was very afraid because my girlfriend was smaller than I was. I was so afraid I was going to hurt her, she's my friend too, you know? But one thing I'd feel - God, I'd feel awful if I hurt her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The images - it sounds like you're worried that they have something to do with real life and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really be violent?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was afraid of that because, you know, I think of myself, why am I taking judo, you know? So things are getting - you know, I put them together and I say, "Wait a minute." And then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yet, I don't really - I can sit there and when I do a punch, when we practice punching, I hit and I hit hard. One of my teachers, he's really funny (inaudible at 0:53:35.9) getting the double punch. And he's going like this to the fellows, you know, hitting the hand. And he comes up to me, he goes (inaudible at 0:53:42.0), all right, you know? But I can do that when I'm not working with a person. I don't like hurting a person when there's a person. But I can imagine an attacker right in front of me and really throw a thing into it because, like, (inaudible at 0:54:02.2) will even say that, "Imagine somebody's coming at you with a knife, and what would you do?" You know, and then you go into the motions you're supposed to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet, I really don't know what I'd do because I've never been attacked. I don't know what I'd do if somebody attacked me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, also I'm stuck on the images, but if you can get into it, the images are telling you something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, probably.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's probably something about anger, I'm not sure. But I mean, I just know that when people have images of that, killing and like that, it's - you don't have to be too scared of it. It's telling you something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're sort of angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might be anger, it might be - I don't know what it is for you. But...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Though, what's funny too is I notice, I did try to figure out a little bit about the dreams and I'm figuring it - what kinds of funny is that they're always fellows.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I could ever remember - when I do it doesn't seem natural when it's a girl. But it's always a fellow that I - he's done something and I, like, over react. He hasn't done anything really bad, but, like, I'd always make the excuse, like, well, this is supposed to be a different type (inaudible at 0:55:07.6), you know, this baloney.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm thinking to myself, "No, whatever it is, some fellow must have done something to me, he must have." There must be something there and I over reacted to it. Like, I just couldn't stand him anymore or, you know, it was that type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something must have set it off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I've been having these things for years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm having dreams like this. And I've been, like - I'd like to see if he's - not so much great and bloody, but, you know, like, things like where they would be violence, almost sadism.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and yet, oh, my God, not me, I wouldn't do that to somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I like to watch it, you know what I mean? And that's just as bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something really fascinating about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, it's that type of thing. Now whether - I don't know. I doubt very much when I was little if I ever hurt anybody back, but I think maybe, like - if it's an anger type thing and that could be, maybe it was the idea that I wanted to hurt somebody back and I couldn't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just, like - maybe it was my brother, I don't know. It could be my - like, (inaudible at 0:56:12.5) a problem with my brother when I was younger, that, you know, like, whatever he did to me it might have been small, but the way I reacted to it, you know, it was, like, I was really angry, but what could you do because he's so much bigger and stronger than I was. I couldn't do anything. But I love to see it done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, maybe I would have love to have seen somebody else hurt him. 0:56:30.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You were angry at him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:56:33.6) get back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think maybe it was because - because I can remember I was - you know, I was a lot smaller than him. And I can almost remember play fighting with him. I probably did because usually kids do when they're little. It probably got me very angry because I couldn't - you know, I couldn't outdo him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I (inaudible at 0:56:55.1). It's a weird thing with him, my brother. When I think - isn't that funny that (inaudible at 0:57:00.4)? I never thought before that it had anything to do with my family, but it could possibly have had.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it had to do with my father, though. I really - it's so weird, I can't remember him. I just cannot - I can remember what he looks like and I can remember that one incident with the candy, but I cannot remember my father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it really bugs me. I can't remember my mother saying she loved me either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It's two really important things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, it's a weird thing and - but why in the dream - see, this is what bothers me is why is it always a man? And when it's a woman it's something like - with another girl or somebody, it's not so bad. But with a man - that's funny because I thought I had just the biggest problem with, you know, competing, but there must be something with a man too, that when I was a little kid there's got to be something there that - you know, like, he hurt me and I just - somehow I just couldn't get back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there was no way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "He hurt me," but you couldn't get back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I wanted to because otherwise, why would I over react in these dreams?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and then I can't - but I'm trying to figure out, maybe it's something like - maybe I was angry and yet, that I feel like I shouldn't be angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could have felt that, that I felt like I shouldn't be angry and then, you know, that would be when I'd switch roles and say, "No, you shouldn't be angry because that's wrong." You know, the religion bit comes in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It's not okay to be angry at someone you love.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I bet that's - it must be - it has to - I know it has to be something with (inaudible at 0:58:41.0) because I wouldn't have these things over and over and over, otherwise, I mean, if you had them, like, once, okay. But these things recur all the time. It's almost like a different life, you know, I just walk out of - well, that's partly because I just don't - I'm not satisfied with what I am so I just, you know, take it and say, "I'll be something else, someplace else." But I never thought of that. It has to do something with my family. It has to do. Whether - I don't know, and then another problem is, is that my brother is my father. It's got to be a man, it has to be, there wouldn't - it wouldn't always come back with a man if it weren't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But why, why, why, why? I cannot think why the heck, you know, I felt like - I know I must have felt like I had a father because, you know, they always say that you have, like, a romantic attachment with your father and all that, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you get an image of it right now? And can you see it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like what, the dreams or my father?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like your daydreams?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's hard to do when you're not in the mood for daydreaming.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, when you're trying to hit reality, then you try to put yourself back in un-reality, it's a little hard to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's see, okay, well, usually in these dreams - I can't really get myself into a dream as such, but I can, like, maybe tell you about, like, some of them I've had.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's okay, I just want to sometimes get into it with you. I mean, we can really do that, we can get into the image and work with it. And I think we might learn something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That could be. Always in these things I'm, like - let's see, I'm like a noblewoman all the time. That's one of the things, I'm always seen, like, upstairs and, you know, maybe...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you look like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. I know I dress beautifully, but I can't really picture my face so much. Supposedly, usually I'm very beautiful, naturally, you know, daydreams, everybody's beautiful, right? And let's see - and I got favorites so - he's, like, my captain and my guards. I even have a name for his, his name is Matthew.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 1:00:59.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I call him Matthew. I don't even know where I got that. He's big.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he's got dark hair. I can even - this is a riot, I can even picture exactly what I have pictured like, like a typical Roman or a typical Greek slave. And he has, like, the beard and the mustache.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think he's got dark eyes, you know, he usually has dark eyes. And he's big and he's strong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, yeah, he's big and he's strong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he's big and strong, he really - you know, he's real sharp in the brain and everything, you know? And usually nothing happens between him and me, but there's, like, another one who's - what the heck is his name? Oh, Jordan, that's the one I'm always having problems with in the dreams. This is the one that usually hurt. And he's a blond - and let's see, what did I picture him as? Let's see, he's blond and he's also big and strong, but he's more like a Nordic strong, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he's the one that was, like, always fighting, you know, to get away. And it's, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fighting to get away from...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he was either trying to run away or he was - he was, like, the one that was that was always the problem child, you know, like, he wouldn't obey and it used to make me so frustrated I'd cry and everything, and he just wouldn't obey. And he wouldn't come over, you know, he'd always says, you know, (inaudible at 1:02:24.1) "I'm not going to obey you and I'm not going to get, you know, like, under your thumb." And so I would have to - I think, like, in one of them I said he had to go away for a week, but I didn't tell him it was for a week. And I put him in the field and then what happened was, he was really a smart off [ph] so I went to collect him at the end of the week and I guess the (inaudible at 1:02:45.0) tired of the field.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the field?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The field, like, you know, where he was working. I had - I said, "If you want to be a..." what did I say? Oh, I know, "If you want to be - if you feel like you're really a slave, you're really one of my guards." And I want him to be my lieutenant right under Matthew but, "If you want to be, then you can," or "if you really want to be a slave, then I'll let you be treated like one."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, this is I got from some movies I can tell too. You know, like, some of the things...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now, it's, like, you're the queen or something, like, you're really in control?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I just couldn't get him controlled, you know, like, he'd say, "The hell with you. You're going to kill me but I'm not going to obey you." And then he went out in the field, but, like, at the end he does submit, see?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He goes out into the fields and then I go out there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm looking for him after a week and he's not there. And the guy who I, you know, told, "Now just make sure that he doesn't get hurt too much because, like, in a week, I want to come back and bring him back." He had been either killed or he died or something, and somebody else was in charge so they didn't know, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so they had him back, I guess whatever they call it, like, their torture chamber or something, came back and he was all messed up but he was still alive and everything. And, like, I came in and I was crying. And he said okay, like, "I submit." So then I took care of him. See, this is funny. I took care of him and then everything was fine. You know, he would still be, like, a little bit, but he was always (inaudible at 1:04:13.9) a baby. And this was the end - this was the typical type dream, you know, when I have problems. But I always overcome them at the end. I will become somebody or something at the end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know. But Matthew I don't usually have problems with, he's usually the one that just stands by and if anybody tries to touch me or hurt me, he's there like a big protector.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's time to stop, but I would like to get into this more. If we can work with it while you're seeing it, I think maybe we can find some things out. 1:04:47.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it's a big - I mean, it sounds like it's a big part of your life. I mean, it's a...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It does come in quite a bit. But it's very funny, it's always when reality becomes too much for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I go (inaudible at 1:05:04.1) say, you know, like, now it's too much, I've got too many things on my mind. Forget it, I'm just going to throw everything out. I'm going to be some time when it's nice and I can control things. I don't have to be, like (inaudible at 1:05:13.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, yeah, that's one place you can be in control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, but what's nice about it is because I know too, I can turn it on and I can turn it off when - you know, when I don't want to daydream anymore, I can just (inaudible at 1:05:25.4), you know, I can turn it off. But you can't do that in real life, you know, it's there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but I don't know, it's very funny.  Matthew, how I got him in the first place (inaudible at 1:05:38.3) most of my dreams were - he was - I saw this in a movie and I think this is where I got him from. And he was going to have his eyes burned out or something and (inaudible at 1:05:49.6), "No, stop," you know, "Don't do that." You know, "But will you serve me?" He said yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's where it came from.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's where he came from. That's when he came into the thing. It was weird. Once in a while he was even my lover in there. When I decided it was about time I grew up, he would be my lover. But he was real gentle and he never hurt me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, whereas, you know, like, I guess some other people might have. He was always - he was just like a perfect man, you know? Like there isn't any around like that but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you could count on him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, whenever I need - right, whenever I needed something, there he was. I got to get to the bottom of this, this is getting ridiculous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We'll get there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so funny. It's very funny that I could really - I didn't think I could do that. That's the first time I've been able to, you know, like, talk about it. I never want to say anything because - well, of course, you wouldn't think I was crazy but most people would, you know, like, "Jesus Christ, she's got daydreams."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you should know that people have them. I mean, it's not a crazy thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And people really do have them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well, maybe it's because nobody else is - everybody else is afraid to talk about it too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 1:07:18.3). Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never thought of that, you know, because I always thought most people - normal people dreamed about things, but, like, not like they were in another times, but, like, maybe that they were something that they're not. Like, they were - if they were only a clerk, they might dream they were president of something like this. But something that - how can I say it? Something that would be - something that they could attain at some time. You know, like, but how can you go back to Roman days? You can't, you know, it's, like, I know inside that it's a dream. It's something that's not real, that can never be real. Oh, well, I'll see you next week. Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I guess, we need some introductions. I'm Frank Dattilio. I'm gonna be your COUNSELOR today and I'm- I'm interested in just knowing a little bit about the family. But maybe, you can tell me your-- I-- You're Randy?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I'm Randy.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Marie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Marie.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: (crosstalk) Felicia.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) And Felicia, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We have three other children.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have three other children?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're in the car?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No.</p>

<p>(All laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (crosstalk) No. They're at the birthday party.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (crosstalk) They are at the birthday party.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, a birthday party. Some family member's birthday party?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Little brother's.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm, okay. So would they have wanted to be here or did they opt not to come, or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: One has a choice but she just opted not to come.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm, okay. The other two were just ignorant (crosstalk) to come?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: They wouldn't care. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: They're too little.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Okay, good. Well, so I'm gonna rely on you three to tell me a little bit about the family. And I'm interested to know a couple of things. One, I'd like to know a little bit about how your family works as a unit. (someone coughs). And specifically, I like to give you the opportunity to talk about (coughing sounds) some problems that you may be experiencing within the family and see if we can uh, help a little bit in terms of coming up with some solutions and some direction for you, okay? So, my understanding is that uhmm, this is the uh-- Is this the first marriage for both of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: For me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I was married uhmm, when I was eighteen but only uh, for about six months then I get annulled or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were married for six months then had an annulment. Did you have any children during that time? Okay. And so, these children are all from this union?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Except Felicia...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No, I'm not.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...I've had Felicia uhmm. Also, I met Randy when I was pregnant with Felicia.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm, okay. But uh uhmm, Randy, you basically raised Felicia?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I'm with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: The whole time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, uh, Felicia, you're the oldest?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then, next come...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Michelle. She's eleven.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's eleven and...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Andy, he is eight and Vincent has just turned six today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, great. There you go. Uhm, I understand that you've been to therapy. And I understand that there had been some family problems. So, I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about what uh, what's been going on at home.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You wanna fill this one out?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (laughs) Uhmm, well, uh uhmm. (sighs) I guess maybe, sev- several different things. Randy and I was kind of you know, fifteen years married. And we've kind of, had the uh, what do you call that? Midlife crisis, sort of a deal going on. And we're really far apart and that's why we started seeing Paul(ph) in his school. Except... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. May I be excused. With respect to ages, you're?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Thirty-eight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thirty-eight.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Forty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Forty.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Sixteen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sixteen. Okay. So uh, you agree that you are going through a midlife- midlife crisis and uh?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Must have been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what they tell you, uh?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, I certainly felt different. Something's going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did this- when did this occur?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Hmm, I dunno...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (murmurs) October.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...before uhm, she uhm (inaudible 00:02:58)(laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, it had kind of, a big impact to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This- this happened this past October?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh. Personal reason, I mean, I really don't know how long he was feeling that way before, but it was October... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...when I realized that we were, you know, that far apart and things were different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So things kinda came ahead of that? What happened? (coughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, I changed jobs two times and uh, (laughs) We've had uh, (someone clears throat) we have a lot of-- I've been working night 'till night-- night shift. We got a job. We don't have any problems with the team.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh, yeah. I hardly make time to be together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, what occurred first was you started to have job changes and shift changes and that impacted on the family?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, the job for one, was one thing I needed to get away from 'cause that was causing a lot of problems. Uh, my employer-- (sighs) If you're not best for your self image, you'll not really feel comfortable with yourself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I needed to get out of that situation which I finally did...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...recently. And so, that really helped a lot...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ... but uh. Oh, I don't know I started paying more attention to my appearance and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...you know, and here I am thirties, you know. I mean, is this what I wanna be doing with my life?(inaudible 00:04:25)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me back you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: But I really don't wanna focus on that. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. No, I understand but let me back you up uh, for a minute, Randy. Just wanna ask you, when- when things weren't good at work, how was that affecting you and your role with the family? Not only with marriage but with the family, though.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, I'm-- I wasn't too sure I think. On first person, I probably didn't notice any changes. I- I just, you know, there (inaudible 00:04:48) the family problem. I couldn't see. That I was- was confident. I was like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they saw, they noticed some changes in that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I don't know. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, le- let me find out at-- What were your perception?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I thought he was irritated with us and I thought I was bothering him and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (crosstalk)Not always.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (murmurs)(inaudible 00:05:12) And uhmm, distant and uhmm...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3:(murmurs)(inaudible 00:05:18).</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Oh, out of patience. He was like, he had no patience with... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...especially, with Felicia's uhmm, uhmm you know, her adolescent things... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: It was like, all of his patience was getting used up by (counselor coughs) his job. And so by the time he comes home, he didn't have any patience left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: You know, it was like uh, better. Just be, you know-- There shouldn't be an- any more problems with the...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I didn't come home and have any uh- have a beer or anything, either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this became obvious this time ago? Over a period of time? Or did it happen very abruptly?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: It's kind of, progre-- It got worse... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: But it wasn't like that every day. It's just, some days were worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it was noticeable?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hmm. And then... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you agree?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And then uh, what I really thought to my mind, I don't know, you felt-- (laughs) Once we went to a party, a company party.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...uhmm, uhmm and I saw how uhmm, what happened? What? You're looking at me, I'm not saying anything... </p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I don't know what you gonna say.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (laughs) I just thought how Randy was relating to the people he work with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And of course, how he related to me. And then that's when it uhm, dawned on me, that there was a big problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you notice?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: That he was more intimate and more friendly with some people there, than he was with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So your first, (sound of water pouring) your first- your first thought that went through your mind was?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: That he was having an affair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (chuckles)Uh huh, yeah. Because he had changed sexually. And he had changed about his appearance. And he was distant from me and I always felt like, I was being irritated. Yeah, he was irritated by me. So my first thought was that, he was having an affair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was your perception.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Felicia?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Later... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I had no clue about the affair (CLIENT 1 and CLIENT 2 laugh) (crosstalk) thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yes, you did.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Not until Mom mentions something... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I- I didn't go to a party or anything. So, I just noticed that uhmm, he was really impatient with me. He didn't wanna spend any time with me. He didn't want to be in the same room with me because we would automatically argue. Just-- It was first response, he'd say black, I'd say white.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how did that strike you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I always did that.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: He didn't always do that, no, not when I was younger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ho- how did that strike you Felicia? What went through your mind about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Just as far as, us arguing? It just, I don't know. I'd- I knew that when I was younger, we didn't argue. And as I got older, you know, he go through those changes and we argued more and more. And I just noticed that it was getting worse. And that, we just couldn't be around each other at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELLOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we just fought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, this was different from what your conceptualizations of your family, was prior. Is that correct?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, it's the maturity. That I have to say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's your- it's your... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Early on uh, trying to figure-out what you're doing and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...you're working, having children. Oops! There's another child and then you're still working. And then, want more money and buying a house...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were all the children, surprises? Or were they planned?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh, one was planned.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So a lot of surprises in your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah, sort of.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. But I'm trying to understand if prior to this recent event, what- what the, what are overall conceptualization of the family was? Uh, normally, that Dad was attendant to family. And Mom and Dad were attendant to each other and things were kind of harmonious?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Pretty much, I would say. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: We did more stuff together and uhmm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...we'll have more time. And we spent more time with the children. Uh. Actually though... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That was in California.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: No. When- when uhmm, uh. Randy n- w- had more trouble with Felicia. But as far as with the other children, he still got along with, you know, (inaudible 00:09:18) He was still a good parent. And he wanted (sound of coughing)(inaudible 00:09:20) but he didn't wanted to include me and Felicia.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhmm. Tell me about... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And he promised (sound of coughing) we'd be going to Grandma... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me about Randy's problem with Felicia, a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Now wait a minute, this is, "Randy's problem with Felicia."</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh humm?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We're focusing on me a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: No! I think it's a problem between us. I don't think it's uh, just a problem with him or just a problem, you know, that I have. I think it's- it's kind of a, combination thing here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm, okay. Yeah, uh. I don't want you to feel as though, we're designing this to be focused on you, but it- it seems to me that, what I'm hearing from the family, and again correct me if I'm wrong, but that things were kinda smooth until things changed with you. Then there was uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well. No, that's not true of us.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's not true.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Not true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No? Ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Because, because I've had my promises(ph) of Felicia, too. In fact, uhmm, (all laughs) some- some... (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you, are you sure? (crosstalk) </p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh. Sure. (all laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're dead about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: So, but my (inaudible 00:10:14) has been more uhmm, I uh-- You know, she's always been a very strong personality, very willful child...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...and uhmm, she is either really good, or really awful. But nonetheless, in between there and uhmm-- When Felicia was thirteen, that's it when I really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...had to (inaudible 00:10:32) Was that thirteen? When she's a freshman in high school? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I was thirteen... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (inaudible 00:10:36) Whoa!</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...she tried having... (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Ahh... (giggles)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Of course, my neighbor was involved in this. But it was a strange thing, we actually got in uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Typical fight.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...typical fight. It was going (inaudible 00:10:47) me up one time, but it was uh, pretty terrible and uhmm, so I've had my-- And Randy was the calm one helping...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...but uhmm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, this isn't just because Felicia ha- is the oldest child but you're saying, it's more of a temperament?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Yeah, other children are much, well I think, they are more easy-going. But Michelle is sensitive and she, you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She needs a lot more attention.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...she's easy. And Andy is- is good. He almost is never bad. And Vincent is a little bit more huh, easy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: But still, he's not to the point where we have uh, such a clash on will...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: When Michelle is almost, she's about four, she sat Randy and I down in the couch and said uh, "Mom and Dad, you know, things would go a lot smoother if you would just do what I say and the way I want it done." (crosstalk) </p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Without a question, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And everything would be easy.</p>

<p>COUNSELLOR: Work properly.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (crosstalk)(inaudible 00:11:42)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: You know, I should still... (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:11:43)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: That way would still work to this day I (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:11:45)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And I think also, she's maybe a little resentful of some of the other children. And she feels like, you know, she was the perfect, what we say, child. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: That was hard for me �cause my sister and my two cousins came at once. I'd-- Until I was five years old, I was the only daughter. I was the only niece. And I was the only grand child. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you had a big deal?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right. So when Michelle and her two cousins came along on the same year, it was... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You're about what? About seven or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I was five. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Six? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Five. So, that kind of, I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then, there's really not much time in your relationship at, before they came along.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: We always have Felicia.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you don't know life without Felicia?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: God forbid... (laughs)(crosstalk) (inaudible 00:12:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (laughing)(crosstalk)(inaudible 00:12:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (crosstalk)(inaudible 00:12:26)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible 00:12:29) before about life without Felicia, huh? And so, Felicia has really been an integral part of your relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Specifically, because she's uhm...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She's like a third parent.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A third parent?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: She is now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you agree with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: She tries to feel she is.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She tries to be on our shoes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Not to us. But this two of the children.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How has Felicia become a third parent?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She's got a lot more responsibility and she thinks she can start making rules and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: In fact, she even thought that sh- that I was not doing a good job with the children.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I didn't say that.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Yeah you did! You said that I should be spanking them.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I didn't say you should spank them. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh, you said I should spank Vincent and she said even Michelle at eleven would still, plenty(ph) on to be spank in that butt. (inaudible 00:13:11). So...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: That she, Felecia, also doesn't think we should ever get hurt. So, I proposed, it's interesting that... (laughs) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't know. I always said that when Michelle was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is that, that surprised me?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, I always said that Michelle starts seeing some pretty obscene things.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: But you should have to see children while-- until we get home from work. So, she does do some... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, Felicia's assigned some power, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Felicia's (inaudible 00:13:36)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, if you're in charge, you have to have power.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's- that's a good point. Let me ask you a question. How does that differ from the way in which the two of you are raised? When we talk about family of origin, we mean, your family-- your mother and father that system; and your mother and father, that system-- where the two of you came from. Is that- is that commensurate? Is that the same or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We're opposite. She came from a large family. Large family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How large?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Six children, I'm the oldest.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And were you in charge, too?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were like... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I ran the house and the children.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, so you were like, a third parent there?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No. She wasn't the parent... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: In fact, my mother actually gave me one of the children.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She gave you, so that, she's like a Christmas gift? (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:14:13)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: She just said-- Sh- she, you know, she just can't do it. So there...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That was a lie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, she assigned complete responsibility over to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (in a low voice) Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I felt, I did a better job than she did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they endorsed that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: They let me do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mother and father?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: He is not there a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where was he?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Working or drinking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it's basically, your Mom?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No, and the brothers and...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Yeah. Well, the other kids are close though, I mean... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah, you're all in one room.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: It was sort of, (inaudible 00:04:49) but it was at the same time, it was sort of like, I was against them, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's against the... (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:14:54)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...against the parents.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (coughs) Ah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that was, that was allowed to be?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, well yeah, in a way. I guess so. (sneezing sound) We were encouraged to stick together and you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you kind of brought that to this union, I guess, at a sense. Now, wha- what about you dad? What was your life before? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Me, my sister and my mother and we had really, in big trauma.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: They have this, div- divorce.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At what age?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I think uhm, like I was too weak (inaudible 00:15:30) dad when I was fifteen. He's alcoholic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh humm. So you both came from an alcoholic family?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I did live with an alcoholic. Got worst when I was two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The process was there, in a sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah. I guess the awareness was there. But he actually live with alcohol.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, when I say, you both came from alcoholic families, I guess, what I'm trying to say is that, in often times in alcoholic families, the children are often times, endorsed as the parent...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...ins- instead of a drink. Or the- the parents usually drink. So, I guess, what I'm hearing you say is, both of you came from families where you were don the roles of parental power.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I was not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You weren't. You were... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Always a kid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Always a kid. So, who is the parent in your household?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: My mother. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what about your sister? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She's not alcoholic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your sister was-- You're older than she?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She's just one year older than I was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, it's the single-parent paradigm there?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No, and there was, nope, strangling of each other or anything. (chuckles) Some of the stories are, you know, from raised families.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, unlike your wife's family, you come from a little bit more of a traditional household, in the sense... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that the kids don't run the rules.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>PARTICPANT1: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And- and Marie comes exactly from a different family situation. So, what kind of a combination do we get as a parenting team, from the two of you in terms of, you know, addressing issues with your own children? How does that philosophy in those, let me call them: schemas; belief systems, work about parenting and family life?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, I feel more like, it is such uhmm, ground rules. Everybody understand what they are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh, I think, we may-- Maybe she- she goes more about, to see her parent takes action as we, as- as indicated. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...maybe a little inconsistency. Wait a minute, last time we did-- How the kids gonna understand?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you're telling that, the train never meets? You kind of, parent, independently?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: If I may say one thing (inaudible 00:17:53) a little bit. (coughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, what's the outcome? Do we get what Mom says (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:17:58)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We better get together to, "Hey, what do we do?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: At times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At times. Tell me about the times... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: When Mom is not here...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me that times when you don't... (coughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ... with the kids would fallen over on, they do. I could be someone (inaudible 00:18:10)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, correct me if I'm wrong, but would it be fair to say that there's some, there's some times when there's uhmm, lack of unity between the two of you as parents?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Parenting. Parenting? You accept that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: But I think for the most parent (inaudible 00:18:39) although we have a- some sort of, a plan...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok. But I'm-- I am trying to understand, how do you come to the agreement of that plan. And how do you come to implement and facilitate it? Do you work together?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We don't have family meetings. That's uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uhh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So just, catch-you-when-you-can kind of thing? And...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah. (in a low voice) (coughing sound)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I'm trying to understand how it has evolved, that Felicia feels, what I'm perceiving, has almost the right of entitlement to call the shots once in a while. And kind of, be a parent. When you're telling me that, in many respects, you work together and you're kinda close as you can... (coughing sound) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Was that the right question? (crosstalk) (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...right question? Yeah, why is that? Uhm, I think, the reason she feels entitled to- to do uh, some parenting is because she watches the children, you know, for two or three ho-- You know, about two hours everyday after school and...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's just something as simple as, getting the kid an ice cream. (crosstalk) Getting-- Felicia got some ice cream...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...and Felicia got- She... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...and then the boy, maybe he wants, in a certain way. She's annoyed to get it this way. And then, they have little...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, she cooperates as an extension of- of parenting.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But my impression is that, that causes some conflict when it comes down to Felicia wanting some of what she wants. And that comes into conflict with what you and your wife want for her.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there's a little bit of clash? My understanding accurate?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I don't understand what you're saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (sighs) By virtue of the fact that Felicia takes care of some of the kids sometimes. And she's- she's a good daughter in that way, okay? She's becoming an extension of the parenting force, the regime. That is good, in the sense. But in a negative sense, I guess and I'm hypothesizing, and I'm gonna find out in a minute. My impression is that, Felicia always also believes that, that gives her the right of entitlement to demand some things. And when you say no, that causes conflict.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Sir...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (crosstalk) No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that- is that correct? I wanna try to get an understanding of what some of your automatic thoughts are, about these situations and what your belief is and how you see this conflict. And maybe, we can talk a little bit about, how we can change that conflict. My impression sometimes, Felicia, is that you're a little confused.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, yeah. I guess so, I might. It's just kinda hard for me because it's like, I don't know, when I'm watching and it's like, "Okay, Felicia, you're in charge of the kids and you need to do this and this." And it's not. And then, you know, I also have my other responsibilities of, you know, my horses. I have to-- I'm responsible for all of them, I'm responsible for all the animals at our house. And it's just kinda like, "Okay, you're in charge, you're in charge, you're in charge. Wait, you're in the charge..." (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You took the horses, though. You like the horses.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah. I like the horses uhmm, you know. I think that I've-- I couldn't live without them. I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that mean to say that, she didn't like to take the other responsibility?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Did I just say that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, you said, "You took the horses, though." But it might... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And she picked that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there are-- Are there other responsibilities that she doesn't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yes. Well, no, I- I think, if she had her way she would uh, watch the children...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (murmur) Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...and take care of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that, you do... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...and make sure they don't get hurt or I mean, you know, we're asking...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Not here to fight, just make sure they're fed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is a mere-- Your thoughts and feelings about your role?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, I'm-- I- I kinda like where I stand, in the fact that I do get to make decisions. I'm a willing-to-take-charge person. And I'm happy when I'm in-charge and I get to tell everybody what to do. That's why, I'm happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even Mom and Dad?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, no. Uh, sometimes..(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh, we're happy there, too.(coughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I mean, she might let me do it, I'll probably be doing it but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But they don't always let's you do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there's times, my impressions is-- There's times where, you kind of, wanna tell them the way you see things that should be in, uh, there's some conflict.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could we talk about some of the errors and conflicts, specifically?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Oh, there's a conflict in, uh, the way I treat my brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh, well, my sister and I don't get a long at all. We just sit there and fight and throw insults at each other, constantly. In a long... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a rude way?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Once in a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Ooh, definitely. Yeah. (in a soft voice)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Considering... (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:23:12)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why- why is there so much, uhm, bitterness between you and her?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I think, in a way, I'm angry at her for just being born! 'Cause she kinda, took my parents away from me, in a way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, all the attention wasn't focused on me anymore. And I hate that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The only attention you get is when you're responsible?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's part of why you always assume that role?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Probably?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't have that role or responsibility if you think, you've had that much attention by your parents?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't know. (in a low voice)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then, think about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, the worst thing she's done in her life is being born.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So after that, it's been down hell?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you get along with her at all? About anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh, once in a blue moon. We can actually get along and talk about something and not fight about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: But usually, we fight. I get along with my brothers better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't know. Just them. I've always gotten along with... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Better.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, I get along with Vincent very well 'cause... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: He does what she says.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...he thinks I'm a god and does what I say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs) Well, there's probably...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's one of the reasons... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...one of the reasons. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And A- Andy and I get along for the most part but he's very strong-willed, too. He's stubborn. So, if I say something and he said, "No." That's the term, we'll fight about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: 'Cause he just-- He doesn't let down and neither do I.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who do usually win?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Me. I'm bigger... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: He's at the end of the room...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then, what happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And I start giving and go like, it start with her, boy gets out, he- he leaves the room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...to see if-- To watch arrogantly or something. And uh, she sometimes, she takes her correction and sometimes not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughs) So the conflict comes with this issue of power and responsibility?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Partly. And then the other is, a responsibility for the horses. 'Cause Mom and I disagree sometimes about what needs to be done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you work out disagreements in your family? What's the rule?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: One who yells loudest wins...? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: There's no rule.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughs) The most (inaudible 00:25:40) person (coughs)is uh, the person with the loudest voice.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No..</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Everyone... (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:25:45) I don't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's- that's Felicia's perception... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Usually- usually, we have end up compromising. And somewhere, we'll end up compromising and then dad will just go, "Fine, do your work."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh, they give in...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Walk away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you- you keep at it until the other gives in. If they don't, then let's compromise?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Usually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Mom, what- what perception do you have in the family, in terms of, how we deal with that concept?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uhmm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The scheme about the family's process.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh uhmm. As far as conflict-solving disagreement is concerned, (clear throat) it isn't quite the way I'd liked it to be. And I don't, I- I will be-- Uh, I hate yelling. And I just wish she could say, you know, talk about it in time and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...have it, uhm, you know, think. I just think, things works easier for now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But how do you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, mostly, we just talk about it. Like, as far as the-horse-thing issue now, we talked about it. And uhm, I don't get angry very often but sometimes uhm, if we really cannot-- Before of that, there are some, well you know, a compromise. Then, one person or I'll just take over sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: It's sort of, give her the horse and go on the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she loves it?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What goes to your mind when Mom says that and...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: To give me the horse?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: It's not a good fight for a horse.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: It's not? (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: So I don't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't give in...? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: So- so, well, yeah! It's the fighting. If we're gonna fight, I'm not gonna do it in the barn, for most part. With the horse there 'cause it upsets the horse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let's say you are in a barn.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: If we were in a barn outside, in the back horses?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: It just depends, sometimes... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: We don't fight about that? We don't usually fight about that. We'll disagree about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And you know, a lot of time, we end up just go on in a low. Just try that then, if it doesn't work, we'll do the other one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Can... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ... most part of them, they're pretty, uh (inaudible 00:27:52) issues work out with the horse (inaudible 00:27:53)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about your perception of how family deals and they negotiates. How they- they, uh, resolve?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I think things to be a lot smoother and equal. And, and their whole attitude, you know. Kids, especially, they get it out of the home. Sure it's, (inaudible 00:28:17) home or school. And Felicia, the things were a lot smoother. She (inaudible 00:28:22) so much and she was like, (inaudible 00:28:25) that, with the kids talk-- The- the kids talk to each other like that. And, I never liked it. I'd never had to do that when I was a kid but they did. Uh, I don't think I did. I probably did. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, do you (inaudible 00:28:42) when you don't like something like that?(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah. Pretty much. I just jump in there uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how is it work?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Not well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: 'Cause, uhm, not as uh, armed, maybe with experience. Or I think, Marie handles things a lot easier because she has that uh, a lot of good, uh, cha-- She, she leads children more than in a big family. She interacts well with people. And she's on the- the uh, debating, you know like, it stu... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. Debating? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...tell me about...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I'm not that, I'm really not that very good... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>(all crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (crosstalk) ...I've gotta take that class for debating (chuckles) with the- the teachers, and winning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're good at that, huh? You got that from her? But, it sounds from me like, when you said, you- you don't have the skills. Uh, that you don't have anything to draw of- of- your family, of origin. In terms of what... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: 'Cause everything is kinda like smooth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That's why you have problems with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: So, is she some kind of luck...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, was it- was it-- Is it fair to say what your expectations about your family's life is that, it's gonna go smooth?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what happened when it violated those expectations?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I got nervous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got nervous. And you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And I don't know what to do...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...you like growing? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh, I should.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, what do you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I do, uh, sometimes, uh, uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes the difference between the times that you're doing (inaudible 00:30:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You know sometimes I-- If I get into it, I don't let her. I keep handling my point home, �cause I don't think they did it. That's the worst thing I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not very flexible?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No. I guess, not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then your wife, what- what role does she take when at home?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (sighs) She will handle things in a lot, lot more common sense. "Why don't you just say this?" Oh, I did not. But I didn't. I reacted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does she ever cut you off or undermine you in anyway? Or have you ever (crosstalk)...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She tries to and then I, I don't respond.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: So, I'm in my mature level, as far as that. When things get hot and people say, get into arguments...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...I don't handle it well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I like things to be all nice and smooth. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you, do you...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We all, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, of course. But do you heed your wife a little bit more than her handling it, so that there's- there's order?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (sighs) I'm starting to handle. (chuckles) But, you know the things, her working now, and she is a lot more stressed. She's not coping quite as well as she used to, either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, there's a lot of things going on here.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My understanding about how the family works is that, it's really a trade-off between individuals in terms of uh, taking control. Everybody's been kind of, trading places with regard to this power and so on and so forth. Let me ask you a question as a family, would you like this system?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It works for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, I don't like the fighting part of it, but if we- if uhh, we could just like, know what we're supposed to do. I think that's kinda like, my biggest problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know what to do? Y--you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: When I'm-- not knowing when I'm supposed to be in charged or when I'm not. Because, I'm just a take-charge person and it's an automatic response to do something, to you know, take control of th- of the situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And who else said that, too?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We're at some ground rules. I never did it, though...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: So that's why... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mom, you're kind of... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You can lay us some ground rules.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, no, I'm used to-- I always think I am in charge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You all think, you're in charge.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I think that's where the comfort comes on the play (laughter in the background).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if I, what if I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You were paid, you all paid for this. (laughter continues)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if I would say something to you? What if I would say that my impression is that, nobody's in charge here.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's valid.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Far pretty accurate.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: But, how can one thing... (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:32:56)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that pretty sure? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, but how can one person be in charge without other people have to be, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh hm, in charge...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Following.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Like a-- It's like a democracy sometimes. Sometimes it isn't. Sometimes, you know, dictatorship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know, it's a funny thing because one of the things that I see interfering is the lack of unity in certain areas. And I noticed something, Randy, when we were talking about the fact that sometimes you and your wife don't always work together. As we talked more about your working together, I noticed you moved your seat a little closer to her. Is it my breath or is it maybe just... (laughter) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah, it's your breath. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's my breath... (laughter) It got nothing to do with this factor. (coughing sound)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh, it's m-- It may have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It may have. It may have. And I'm wondering, whether or not, you know-- Whether the processes going on here, is that, there's not some any real clear guideli- guidelines or rules or constitutions that have been established. It's kind of like, you go along as you see it and feel it. And if there was a little bit more unity, which may not take a whole lot of work, you may do a couple of things here. What is it that may make it easier for the two of you to function as parents in this relationship? But also that Felicia opt to work a little bit for not really knowing, you know, when to and when not to. And of course, that unity may be able to dictate a little bit more, with regards to what you need her to do or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: My family is matured to this point now. I kinda, lost sight of that and then everyone is kind of, smart now knowing it's easy to manage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. But do you think that, it's behind you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I guess you really has a lot to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Our marriage has matured also. It's gone to another... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me a little bit about that. What-- Would you feel free to talk about that in front of Felicia? About your relationship?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well then, what do we gonna talk about it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just a little bit about how to make marriages mature and when, how you'd come together.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, I feel that we're a lot closer than we have then. Because things are just kind of uh, out of fire, like the work, and when we come home, and then, "How was your day?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, is this before or after the uhh, change of life or the thing you went to?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I don't know. (laughs) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it better since that time, or worse since that time?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh, even maybe that-- Even during that time I was there, I can always come home without you. There's been a lot of things then. But uh, we're also in a mood. We're emotional people and uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was over.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Our- our loving each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I heard concern about the possibility of another person in your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That, too. That I wasn't aware of feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you just try this after that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, that worked out?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I guess it worked out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, if we were to try to work towards a little bit more cohesiveness in that relationship, and in specifically, the parenting; in the distribution of power; in the distribution of maybe, assignment of chores; and the way things work; that may make a difference in the family here, you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's the way I would feel? Is that you're asking me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Maybe something more structured? Yes, certainly. I'm speaking for like a-- You know, I like order. I guess, we have in general, more like-- Things like these, we'll have to deal with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're easier for you to do in a way. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Sure. This is, "Yeah, you go." This is, "We're on." That's how.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That it's the family man, you know, that sometimes doesn't now exist. So... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah. Because it's hard to maintain the house, either. Because you got people everywhere dropping things on the floor, you just- you just can't do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I think st-- Maybe, structured most of the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you-- Can you envision or imagine yourselves ever having that structured form of words, "harmonic"?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Part of the time. I could imagine it will be harmonic. (coughing sound)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then, we have dear Felicia...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Hmmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and what would become of Felicia if your bond, as parents, become a little bit more cohesive and...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, Felicia is now growing up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. How old are you now Felicia?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Sixteen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You still have that two years?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you think you're gonna react if Mom and Dad changed a little bit?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, I don't know. As, I'd like to see the family a little bit more structured.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: So that, you know, rules are obeyed in a way. 'Cause you know, you can do it and, you know, you can't do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And, compared to my friends we already have a lot of rules.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And, there's just-- There's like, things we have and it's like, "Okay. I know I can do this. I know I can't do that." There are some things you do know which they don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, but you're still a little lost with some of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (clears throat) I wonder if sometimes, as a family, we also based some of our actions or the distortions, particularly, the way we perceived each other in a relationship. Is that-- Do you think that's possible? Do you think that you misperceived some of what your parents are doing and saying at times?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah, I guess so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As well as maybe, they both do the same with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think we've seen an example of how (clears throat) Mom and Dad had- had some misper- misperceptions with regard to Dad's changing his life...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and what he was going through. I'm wondering if there are similar distortions that function in the family. And we operate often if there are distortions at time, without enough information.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh, definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (clears throat) Kind of, comes under the area of communication which is my next question about, how- how you feel with communicat- (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, we communicate, we usually do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Whenever we have misunderstanding about somebody's saying-- If she says, "It's market time..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...and you know, I just made-- Respond (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, what do you think about your communication patterns? Would you say it's better?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh, I think, they're better with my mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Between your Mom?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's not as good as your dad?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Dad and I don't communicate very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about Mom and Dad, how do they communicate?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't know. I guess...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You're in the same room...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...very...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From your perspective?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: One hears one thing and one hears the other, sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's a miscommunication?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mom and Dad, do you feel the same way? That it happen sometimes?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I think communication is so difficult to your better-half.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And my other question is problem solving. How do we feel, if we solve problems found? (silence 00:40:06)'Cause we talked about that a little while.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: On the fly...(in a low-toned)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On the fly.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See the defense.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: The reaction, I guess. That's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Reaction, that's interesting. Do you see any connection between the thoughts that go to your mind, than the reactions that you have at times? Or when you say reaction, do you feel that there's more you've got responses, "Shoot my hip."</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uhum. Well, maybe I- I- I think, maybe the lack of structure of whatever we we're talking about before. Uh, it seems more like to-- You react to different situations that'll be coming up when you can't control everybody to do it, you know. (in a low voice) So, once the problems come up and you've...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (clear throat) (crosstalk) problem at once too...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Just tell 'em finish this one here and got another...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you can't separate that.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Yeah but sometimes you've to do it more than one thing, simultaneously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Which means, that you really have to come up with the quick system on how to do that. And if there's no unity or there's disengagement, we got big time problems, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think one of the things I hear is that, we need a better system. That everybody is saying that, they're not happy with the system. Not that we have to get rid of the one because there's lot of quick points here.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, there's probably a lot of times we work well together as family. And I think in lot- lot of- lot of ways, very loving. But there are some things about the system. There are some bugs in the system. And I think there are problem. And I think that, some of that comes from uh, difficulties in the way we perceived situations and uh, lack of structure and lack of, maybe a guideline or model of what you had to interact. One of the things that I want you to think about is some ways in which we can improve that. I want you to think about what would help improve that system a little bit. And uhm, and next time, when we meet, we're gonna begin to take a look at some of that. Do you guys fit? You look a little reluctant to me, Felicia. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Oh I don't wanna...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We don't wanna lay down rules here, you know. That's part of the problem cause even there's something as simple as going out of cab, who gets to sit in the front.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Can be-- Could get- could get a rumble over that!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why ... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No. Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Yeah, okay. I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Right.</p>

<p>(coughing sound)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't-- You don't like to, (coughs) be fair, say, you- you don't like to lay down rules for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yes. Say, "This is your spot, this is your spot, this is your spot." Uhm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are your thoughts about that? That if you will do that, what would that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: It sounds, it sounds so real...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds so what?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah. Like something from- from school, from uhm, authoritarian. And it's just a seat!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little too heavy for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mom, how you would do it? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I think they should take turns.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, that's possible. What about you, Felicia?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I think I should seat in front. I'm bigger... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you- you wanna drive... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>(laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: She don't have a license</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't have a license.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She still wants to drive, anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Definitely.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, no. I want to seat in the passenger seat and tell him how to drive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, at least you wouldn't be a backseat driver, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right. I'll be in the passenger's seat, that's so much better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think about the idea of taking turns?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, we end up doing that, (crosstalk) anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Somebody has to keep track of his turn, as well. I may have to disagree about that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah. I- I believe we- we've try that once before and...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We still... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: We still argue about it. "No, you, it's your turn last time!" "No, it's your turn last time."</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh my, gosh! That-- So... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: You know, there's four of us going on-- sitting there... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know that there's structure, there's still some confusion.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right. So must-- When I sit and charged it all down. And this is gonna be long and teasing and stupid... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah, come on!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you gonna come up with a better alternative?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I can do it for a while and we'll might just...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: She thinks it's very easy to say...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, Felicia should always seat in the front driver, the fact she's almost always next to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know! It's really...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Too bad! For all three that goes in the back... [in a low-toned]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'm...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I can go, eventually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's a good point! How would that impact in your family?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well at least, we wouldn't have the conflict every time we're going to get in the car... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that would-- (laughs) Or that would be going against, I guess what Dad is saying, you had trouble with. And that is... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, everyone is happy with her and they don't argue. I would... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: They're not gonna be happy with that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you really think that the kids are gonna be happy with sitting down on there? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: They still have to learn to live with it...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait a minute, you're sitting in the front!</p>

<p>(all laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: That's right! They're going to learn to live with it. They're not... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, if I said, "Oh, from now on, you sit in the back and they sit in front. You'd have to live with that." Would you be happy with...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No, I have to sit on them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to sit on them. Okay. You see, we've gotta take a look at equality and uh...(in a low voice) and uh,...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And then democracy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Some may go and will say, "Oh well, what's up Dad? Can I sit in front?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, we'll put that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ... until I get the answer...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and that's I think where we need the unity because then, we can say, when no- nobody comes and just asks dad. You ask Mom and dad. And dad doesn't respond until he checks with Mom. And vice versa.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh gosh! (in a low voice). True!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're still shaky to that? I see that-- Or you think it's gonna... (crosstalk)</p>


<p>CLIENT 3: You could've liked it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said, "Oh gosh..." (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, that might be another toy in the house. Oh it's just the-- it's just an issue. Well maybe, we're not deciding about the car seat there, either. It's like... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I better think it's symbolic... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And I have it good... Sure. Mom- Mom- Mom, might say, "Sure." I might say, "No." (murmurs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, how do you come to the (inaudible 00:45:48) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Ahh.. (chuckles) No one's in the room! If it's just me, I'll just make the decision. But then, it might not go well... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah! Why can we fit, take turns bein' in charge, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Take turns, hey!...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Begin to make a chart and mark it up.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yes, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where's that leave her? Felicia.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Oh... In charge of the (inaudible 00:46:08)(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She's in charge, all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Of 'course you know, I've talked about this. She knows I find her in charge. If I'm not there and Randy is out there...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, she's a non-commissioned officer, in effect?</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, yeah.(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, were gonna have a little bit of trouble with that, Felicia... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uhmf.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I- I think we may have some (inaudible 00:46:28) but we'll see.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uhm. So, it's not like she is dazzled, uhm, she doesn't fit. She has freedom, you know. She gets to do things that, with other children...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And to get my freedom, I mean... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Like, she gets to go out one week, or one night or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And she knows that feeling can be, whoah, (inaudible 00:46:47)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't- you didn't know that? Who would revoke that for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't know, it's just- just depends on what it is and who I'm arguing with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you ever challenge that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Challenged what? Challenge than revoking, all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum. How did it go?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, we-- I ain't - We- we fight, just like everybody else in the face of the planet. And sometimes I win, sometimes they win. Usually, they win... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Win, where? What would it mean, not to fight? What would it mean, to just back-- we ask or give in to...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: It's really hard when you given in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughs) It ruins your reputation. Tell me, sure(ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Not so much my reputation, it's just-- It's really hard for me to give in to things... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I, I don't take orders. Well, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's your belief system about that? What's your thought about-- Why don't you take orders from them?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I- I don't know why I don't- I just-- I can't- I can't do it. I just, I don't like authority. I'd rather just be in charged of myself than everybody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that's practical?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No! But I mean, like in school, nobody bothers me. I'm in charge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the principal and you have, uh, an agreement or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Aha!</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Wouldn't go that far. But I mean, as far as the student buddy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh!(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Nobody pushes me around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your cue...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: There's none of my cue... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: She used to have trouble with that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I used to have a lot of trouble. I didn't used to be self- confident. I used to be very quiet and lousy. And, I'm sure Mrs. Kidler can remember that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're taking a sort of... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...when I was quiet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You�re taking a- sort of a, training course or something? (in a low voice)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And, no I stay calm...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: She spent the time with me.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I spent a lot time with Mom. I... (crosstalk) The first semester in my sophomore year, I stayed home and get home schooling. And uh, I kinda, in a way forget who I was. And just, I was in charge of myself during that time. And I learned how to be in charge of everything and how to take things better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you learn to think about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Just for Mom and, I ha-- I wasn't training with a horse trainer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, and what would you do? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And I had to take his orders.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I wanna understand your belief system. How did you view the world then? That you've got the right to take charge in those situations, unless you get rebuked by someone else?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I- I don't know. I don't really know how I (chuckles) thought. I just... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you- would you think about that, a little bit? As we, after we, just you know, reconvene. I'd like you to just, to think a little bit about how- how-- What kind of uh, what we call schema, belief or thought sequence you've had about that in your life. I'm wondering how that affects the way you proceed quite now for yourself and in family.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. We'll gonna take a little break and uh, we reconvene. And uh-- When we come back, I'd like to talk about a little bit about some strategies that we might be able to use, that may be of help, okay? But I'd like you to formulate some questions. If you do, hand it for me. And any other thoughts that, you know, come in your mind. Is that okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We've just done a lot of things and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have lied! (laughs) But I got to know your family a little bit and (laughs) she's... (crosstalk) remember here.</p>

<p>(laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I- I should rather sit in the front seat throughout ... (all laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Take turns. (all laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm willing to negotiate. Okay. So how about we'll leave that for a while and see you then, okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3:Okay.</p>

<p>(audio fades)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: When not wanting to do that, huh? (sighs) Ahh, you know, you just feel authoritarian. And I don't- I don't wanna be a policeman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So, your- your, uhh, cognition, your scheme. And when I say, cognition, you understand me in thought. We're talking about cog, the word cognition comes from the Latin word "cognitio," which means to think or perceive. So, when I say cognition, I'm saying your thoughts or scheme is, being-beliefs is that, to do that, is to be authoritarian and that's, too overbearing, too rigid...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No, just the two of one, get along.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But, you know, I think, and the important thing here is that, some of that needs to be and I think, you can tamper that a little bit. So the idea is that, maybe a little bit of it, in a tampered way wouldn't be as authoritarian as you perceive and think, is a possibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, but say, in a working environment-- Well, even in a family environment, you're committed to each other... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...'cause you can't. That's your home. It's what we say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh... can't just call it quits. Maybe in a work environment, everyone kinda gets along because, well, this is-- You're committed because you have income, you provide the income, uh, but she couldn't leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm. (soft voice) So, you want to got a leave?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hah!</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Felicia left for 2 days.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: A few months...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And what was new then? (clears throat)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bahamas? Felicia? (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I wish, I wish... (crosstalk) No, I went to some friend of mine...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (crosstalk) No, when I was, I had pneumonia and, Felicia and Randy got into a... fight, (crosstalk) but ahuh...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (crosstalk) ...of course she's mad for some sort, because of...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (crosstalk) (clears throat) ...and ahh...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (crosstalk) ...be mad</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: (crosstalk) ...import a job.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Anyway, so, uhh, Felicia left for two days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm, I'm having some trouble hearing it. Would you- would you mind switching chairs with her, with Felicia?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You wanna hear what she has to say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I wanted... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh, Okay. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Oh, goody...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Goody... (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You're promoted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Oh, 'cause he used to sit at the front seat. (indistinct noise)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Hmmm... (crosstalk) No, it's not. (crosstalk) (teases) (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, God, the front seat.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Uhm, so you left?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uhh, we just got a really big fight. Hmm, Mom told me, she said that last time we had gotten a fight, she uhh, she was angry, too. And she told me, "Well, you know, last time you did this. I told you next time you did it, you're out, so, leave." So, I left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Think that surprised her?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah. I don't think they thought that I would- I would leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh! You're affected then? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I was... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did that affect them?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, uh, I don't know. I wasn't there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where did you go?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I went to my friend's house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the Bahamas?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I wish. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. No. Where was that? (crosstalk) </p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No, in Dundee.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In Dundee?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Australia? Or... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No. It's just uhh, the next city over from Newberg.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, we're here in Oregon. Okay. You we- went, what, two days?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you learn to settle down?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, because I didn't really want to move out. Because it's my family. I wanna be with my family. I worked hard for, you know, as far as academically. With my horses I had, you know, so many commitments there. And I didn't wanna do that. I just wanna live with my family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, here is an important question, are you ready?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes into your mind, to make a decision to leave? I really wanna know that. You can help me pinpoint that.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, what do you mean? I guess, they- Partly, because I was tired. I didn't want to argue with them. I knew if I stayed there, we were just gonna keep on arguing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And because, all of us were just so angry. And they had told me, they've-- I mean, we've done this before, we get into fight and say, "Okay, you're out!" And then, you know, eventually, we'll resolve it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A- and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And we-- I don't leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, but that didn't happen to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: That is happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, what was your automatic thoughts? The thoughts, (fingers snaps) that shocked right through your head, right before that...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well first, my first thought was that I didn't wanna leave. I don't know, I don't wanna leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And then, they just kept saying, "You-, you're out of here, get out of the house."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, what was your second thought?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Fine!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a reaction. What was your second thought? The first one was that, "I don't wanna leave."</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...then, they said, "Get out!"</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then, what was your thought?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I'm just gonna leave. (coughs) They told me to leave, so I leave. (coughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you said, you don't wanna leave?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: But I didn't wanna leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you deal with the conflict?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, I've- I- I've just figured that maybe, I could leave for a while. Come and then be able to talk to them later, when we're not so angry. That wasn't so fresh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Think of how it would impact them?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah. I knew it would impact them and then how it would impact me. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhh, so, it's a strategy.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No, it's not a strategy 'cause I knew eventually... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a reaction?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: It wasn't, It wasn't exactly a reaction but it was just, I knew that they wouldn't expect me to leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm. So, you left anyway?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: They told me to leave, so I did.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You takes not our... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I take, no, I do what he says...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you do obey at times. (laughs) Say, when I say... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I obey a lot.(coughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When I say it's a strategy, (coughs) (crosstalk) what I mean is that, you left because you were put in the spot. But you also knew that this gonna have a reaction and I'm wondering whether or not, part of your belief system in this family is, in order to get through something, you have to do things perfect sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it work?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I mean, I came back and it's better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where did that thinking style come from? Did you come up with that all by yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I really, really doubt that one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whom do you think that came from?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Probably, Mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Is it true? (crosstalk) Does that come from you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I'm not a leader, so I don't know. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not a leader. (laughs) She says, she got that from you.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Woah, not so much that you have to leave, but you have to do what you have to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, is that the schema in your family that you have to do what you have to do. Regardless of sometimes how it'll impact to everybody else?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, possibly. But I wouldn't say. I think, I mean schema... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Hmmm, that's good. (inaudible 00:56:56)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Yeah. That's the main thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: But it maybe like (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:56:59) things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if anything else comes up-- But it's a schema won't work against to what? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Right. (soft voice)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: When you work against the extremes. (soft voice)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you use that? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Yeah, I would say. Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You use that.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I'm sure he does, too. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about you, did you use that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: When things get to a point like, this is- this is ridiculous. Like, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: That you have to do, whatever you have to do. Problems...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Do what you have to do...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Regardless at times, on how it impacts a little.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You mean, as a reaction?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. As a- as a, well thought-out thought about... (coughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No, let's just ignore that. (laughs) (coughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Alright. (coughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well thought-out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, maybe "well" is not, the wrong word. Maybe, something you give some thoughts to, as the only way to deal with the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No, it's a tough question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay. We'll come back to it. It-- Supposed that we asked you to think about some alternatives... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that you could have use...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it possible?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah. I guess, there were alternatives before I got that heated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uhm, there were alternatives, you know, when we first started arguing. But, it's-- (indistinct sounds) I mean, I guess, I should-- I could have done, yes and just been submissive and swallowed it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that ever meant to you if you had done that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: It's just that, that some part really hard for me to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't know, it's just that, it's hard for me to es-- Put it all inside.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Wha-- Could've said? Uh-oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: We got your paper out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I get another paper. Yeah. Well, I'm getting all of that, to write things done. Thought is, "I have to leave. To leave." But the alternative is that, "Maybe I, maybe I would not have to leave." What if I didn't leave? If you didn't leave, what would have happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Oh, we probably just have fought more.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (clears throat) Not if you would've gone to your room. That was all we were asking you to do... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Oh, I was in my room!</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You were very loud about that...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: You're so angry and you should not scream of obscenity.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: But I didn't scream of obscenity. I was just screaming. (clears throat).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, if you didn't leave...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Not even one maybe quiet. I guess, it is so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would've happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: If I hadn't left?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. (soft voice)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Probably, just the same things that have been happening before... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'd fight, you said.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: (clears throat) ...so we fight...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, and if so, tell me why? What will happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, eventually, I'm gonna get tired of fighting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...but it was just one of things that... (coughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But you said, "You get tired of fighting." Oh, what would that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't know. Somebody will eventually have to give in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somebody had to give in? And of course, they did give in.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Like, have to do what the other one said. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they have had to submit.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So not leaving meant, "I had to submit." And that means to you, what?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I've really hard time doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I know. But tell me why?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I, I don't know, It's just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it mean to do what they say?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: It's a symbol of authority. (whispers)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that disturbing you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Kinda.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't know. I just have the trouble-- Mom does, too!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you had some...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Hey, wait a minute!</p>

<p>[all laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright now...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I know, that's why I learned to control... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll- we'll get there, okay? We'll get there. We- We'll credit her with this much as.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: (giggles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But my question to you is a-- You're saying to yourself, "That would be horrible." But you're really not-- You really haven't worked through context, mentally. Why that would be so terrible?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: For the way of my pride.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? Hundred percent?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What pride, all your pride means you're so little?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No but-- It's just, it's-- I'm just so strong that I can't do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You talked about yourself, as though, you have absolutely no control. But yet, time is what I have to talk to you. You sound like, you have lots of ...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I think, it depends on the situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Would it be willing- Would- would- would you be willing to consider some alternative. And maybe test that hypothesis at times. Giving it-- Seeing it if it is as bad as you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I've done it. Should I do more?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me about some of the- Well, no. Like, tell me about some of the outcome.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, usually, it ends up they're happy. But I have to do it with (inaudible 01:01:40)... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Happy?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...and I don't get happy. You know as far as like, "Well, Felice, you go clean the kitchen," or something. Well, I don't really want to clean the kitchen but that's how I get to an argument with them. I have to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And sometimes, that's the way life is. And the fact, the matter the kitchen needs to be cl- cleaned by one of you, is in-- I don't know what your rules are, about everybody pitching in, but everybody has to do their part.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See, I'm wondering whether or not, sometimes you talk to yourself into situations. Almost, you cut your nose off the spiked fence. When in fact, it may be not be as bad as you anticipate it to be. But because of some things that you tell yourself, you react without processing. I have these little sheets here. I'm gonna hand 'em out to you because I think, they maybe of use to you. If you don't feel that dirtying this... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (inaudible 01:02:26)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...then you can uhm, wipe off... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Wipe off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...any word that you spelled... (crosstalk) (paper flapping)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Dysfunctional?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [clears throat]. These are called, Daily, just uh, Functional Thought Records. Now uh, don't get too weak about the- the title because it's not to say that, you're dysfunctional thinkers but, [paper flapping] one of these th-- One of the things that this form helps us to do is to, to cut a clot out some of the ways, on which we think and act and react in circumstances in our family.</p>

<p>[coughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, if, we just sat down with Felicia. We look at the situation where she experienced some stimuli with some conflict. Had some automatic thoughts which where these thoughts that came into her head, I should believe. The emotion was upset, maybe failure or back up a little bit, so on and so forth. With the idea that she engaged in some distortion and that she look at it in this particular cases, in all or nothing thing. And probably, at some point later on, we'll gonna be talking a little bit about, what distortions are and- and what they mean. But in this particular case, when Felicia is backed against the wall, she tends to look at things as, they're all or nothing terms. I mean, if, if in fact, you might be able to find yourself doing that sometimes. Well, so if I stay, I'm giving up my pride. So therefore, I've gotta leave. It's a neither or all situation. When in fact, maybe that's kind of a distortion. Maybe, there was some time-out that could have been occurred. And then go back and negotiate. So she engages in that and that leads to, her being able to be leaving. One of the things that I wanna recommend is that, we, as a family, begin to consider some alter- alternative thought processes here. In terms of what we perceive and way out. Whether or not, there are other things that we can do. And they may be more effective. First of all, I'd like you to be able to start to challenge some of the thoughts that you have, that lead to behaviors that get us into trouble. And weigh up the evidence that suggest that, that would be the better way to respond and see if we can consider some alternative ways and implement that. Now, you took off like, for two days. I assumed that course will have uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Problem?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Now, there were some alternatives that you could've considered? And is it possible that pri-- Perhaps your pride wouldn't have been as challenged as you thought?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Would you be willing to try an experiment to see, when that comes up again, whether or not it affects you like you think it's gonna affect you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In that way, we can assume that there were some consequences for leaving, for two days.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No, it's the same consequence. Well, it was kinda strange. First, they told me to leave and they told me they never said to leave and that I was just grounded.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But then you left?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: But then, I left. And... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...then when I got back, I was grounded.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you come back on your own or did they...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I came back on my own.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...just send a search party for you. Okay, and what happened when you came back on your own?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: They just, I don't know, whenever I wake up...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She got grounded.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I got grounded.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: [coughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hence, this therapy...</p>

<p>[coughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And they... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>[clear throat][long coughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...long hair</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, this was...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uhm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got grounded.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I got grounded. And I co- come back on the conditions that, I would be grounded for a week. I wouldn't go to the winter dance for- at my school. And that I had to be uhm, like, really, really nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: House arrest.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Good behavior.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did, How, yes... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Good behavior.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did that feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're enjoying it?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I was, huh. No, I was- I was angry about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Having... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: But you we're good!</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...been grounded. 'Cause I was-- I mean, I was able to behave myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you knew that you needed to redeem yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And- and-- But how do you enjoy your punishment?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I just, I took it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But are you enjoying it?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you rather not have it?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great. Can you see the connection between that, in the thought thinking process? That if possible, if you wait for some alternatives then (coughing sounds) maybe could- could have done an alternative. Might have been uh, put words in your mouth but might have been the same. "Look, I just need some space. I gotta get out of here for a bit." Go cool down. And come back.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It may have been more effective.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Oh, what's just-- That's essentially, what I did. It was just for two days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it was for two days...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A- a- a- wa-- You know. Kind of, unauthorized, I guess. Is that fair to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: It should because she's supposed to come home the first day and she didn't. And then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...didn't arrive and then,[clear throat] she has to come home on a bus but she didn't come home on a bus then... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (murmuring)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...then, she's supposed to get dropped-off by her friend later in the evening and she did not arrive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm sure you're worried.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: This is, like, three days.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...yeah. And then-- No, it was really two.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And then- then, the next step is-- The lie is expected that night. I said, "You know come home tomorrow or uhm, go to a foster home."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Foster home.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, no. But we got... (crosstalk) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be terrible?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: But... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you tell that to Daddy? Do you know about the foster home?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...you just can't yell at them.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Me, personally?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I wouldn't wanna go. [silence]</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: How I'd like to live in one?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would it be, I mean, for her to go to foster home?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Ah I don't know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't know how to hang out (inaudible 01:07:38)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would. Can't imagine... (crosstalk) (inaudible 01:07:42)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I would... (crosstalk) (inaudible 01:07:42)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (inaudible 01:07:42) they were there.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...you know, 'cause they're not gonna take anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: You still have to do be good... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You don't know these people. It's supposed to be certified with... (whispering)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. What would it cost to employ something like this, for you and Felicia?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be the cost involved?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: To what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To- to try using something like this, where you stop and kinda analyze a little bit. About what's happening and what some of the alternatives are. You think you could do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I think the stopping part is the hardest.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The stopping part? I'm sorry?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Stopping and looking and back, taking a step back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right! Good. Good point.</p>

<p>(coughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be best for our family, in terms of facilitating? (clears throat) Oftentimes, families use disengagement, time out when they go to depart a house and just cool down a little bit. Would you think that would be something of ah, useful?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hmm. That's usually... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We would not violate that. That would mean go to your part of the house and still pop off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's the rest of the thing, I wanna do.(chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well. well it's just, pop off in your room or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh yeah, just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think of that idea?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (crosstalk)...I think I may implement that.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I think it's a good idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I think it's a good idea for everyone out here... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I think, I may implement it," it's a good point. It's that, maybe we need to agree that we would do it. And then we would start to talk a little bit about specific techniques for doing that. Uhm, one of the things that oftentimes families use is time-out sign. So that, when things are getting heated before they escalate into this emotion and thought...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and behavior, that we recognize it early. You know, if you take a snowball and you're on top of the hill, and you make a snowball that's the size of a bowling ball. And you start to roll it down the hill. Starts to gather momentum as it gets- grab up more snow, like, it get's heavier, right? Do you try to stop that high above the hill, it's easy to do. If you go back midway down, it's a little bit more difficult. And if you're all the way at the bottom, why you may get mo- mowed over by it because the magnitude, the size and the weight. Similar thing happens when we get going and round up in our family. In our interactions...</p>

<p>(coughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...where thoughts start to go. We misperceive and become emotional. And as a crescendo, that's usually not the time to intercede because things are already too momentous. They're moving.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if we do that early, then we begin to be able to identify areas where these started to heat up. We might be able to say, "Hey! I need some time out." With the understanding that, we're not gonna use that just to get out of a conversation because time out means, you take a break but you come back to it. Do you think that's something that might be uh, workable? Now, if we combine that with each of us taking a look at these sheets. And each of us beginning to take a look at the thoughts that we-- Thought statements that we- we make ourselves for... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...some call this an internal dialogue.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. We may be able to mediate some of this which may change the way we feel and behave. This is what kind of being in therapy is all about. It's to intervene with some of the thought statements and then mull about the behavioral patterns that we engaged in. Let me go back and use Felicia, as an example... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's far our intellectual level, though. Yup it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I- Intellectual but it's not avoiding the emotional aspect, though it- it wou- would try to deal with it, intellectually. Try to simmer it down so that it's manageable on an emotional-behavioral level... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: But she's getting hot already.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Time is to do it early. That's my point. So example, let's rewind the tape. If you could close your eyes and just think back a little while. Come to when you were, you know, getting aggravated, and they were challenging you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I should perceive it and they're saying, "Well, then leave!" The thought statement that went through your head was, "Fine!" Now, if I were to spread that up and really look in between, probably there was a little bit more internal dialogue going on. My guess is, that probably part of that internal dialogue was saying, "Oh yeah, what? You're challenging me? Are you talking to me?"</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "You, asking me to leave?" You got into your Robert De Niro stance.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you left! As opposed to being able to say, maybe, "To tell me to leave, is this what I really wanna do?" Let me take time out and just think about this. I don't like this. I'm aggravated but to tell me to leave, do I wanna leave?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there an alternative here? Is there something else that can be done? (someone coughs) And not only you, but I think every member of this family has a responsibility to do that, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you challenged her, you see?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's not, Mister, a good thing to do there.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, when I got to do the leaving stage, it was uh, too hot. And that's how we got to the leaving stage... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: It was just the simple getting-into-the-argument stage, I think that's where I need to start.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, so if I could rewind the tape, Randy... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Farther back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, tell me where? Tell me when to stop the tape in rewinding.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: When Marie was having pneumonia, she rolled her eyes at her mother or something, and kinda snob a little a bit... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And I think, I was coming to Marie to her rescue by getting her and she's- she's talking to the girl and she's downstairs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And I go, "Look, get back up there and tell her," you know, you apologize, you know. "Here, I'm laying down the law," right? She's not gonna respond to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: So, "Well, I tried to be there!" Okay. Well see, now we're already starting to get into an argument.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm. Right, so you- you guys try. I mean, you do a pretty good job and really making an effort. But somewhere, some things fall apart and I don't think it's bad. I think you've- you- you're pulling together pretty well, but is it- is it-- What happened between the dynamics between the two of you that- that escalated that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I think, they started fighting when- when she wouldn't do what he said and so. Then he... (murmurs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uhm... I think (inaudible 01:13:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...pick her up and drew farther to him. Something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: oh well, well, well, I'm sure... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Oh! And she was mad and- and- and so, I-- And I was, you know, choking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were choking, you were... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...choking, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...I, you know, I was trying to intervene this some... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, we're all...</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...antibiotics (inaudible 01:13:59)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: stressed out by the whole thing...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: So, right...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I think that's why it got so escalated... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's an excuse (inaudible 01:14:04)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...so badly 'cause Mom was so sick.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And when I asked him to stop, I tried to get him to stop but... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...I dunno, twelve, thirteen times I- I intervened and said "Please stop."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait a minute.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: "Randy, leave her room, leave Felicia alone."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait a minute, there's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: He'd say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...an interesting statement, "That's why it escalated- escalated because Mom was so sick."</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, no, I think that's how it started. That's why everybody was so irritable. All I done was, eating the pork chop.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: With authority.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Eat the pork chop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm missing something here.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So wha-, uh, so I got lost between the antibiotics and the pork chop... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And the pork chop, okay. (laughs)</p>

<p>(everybody laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's go back.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Felicia ate dinner... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I ate a pork chop. And for lunch and I didn't know...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We couldn't- we couldn't make dinner 'cause the pork chop...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I didn't know it was dinner. I said...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ahh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...I was sorry. Mom thought...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oww.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I gave her an attitude. I don't think I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Misperception?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Possibly, Uhm and so, dad came down first, told me to apologize and I said, "No" because I had already apologized.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: And so... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Nobody seemed to let go...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...we started arguing upstairs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He didn't he, he didn't accept that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? Do you have any idea?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: He said that, I'm the worst daughter he ever had.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No, it's not (inaudible 01:15:08)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I'm sorry I ever said that at you.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: All I do was, say I was sorry I didn't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So things got out of hand?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Misperception?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yes, (crosstalk) it got out of hand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We do that once in a while. We have the tendency to misperceive. That's another thing that we might wanna talk about, too, is sometimes clarifying because I think as a lot of families do. We misperceive things (inaudible 01:15:27). And one of the things that we might want to do is to, to utilize some clarification techniques. And we'll talk about that later when we do communication. The idea of- of making sure that we're really understanding the other and what emotional- emotion becomes involve to us. Sometimes we misunderstand each other and then we form assumptions on what we hear, what we think we hear and then we react on those assumptions and things escalate. So that's another thing that we might wanna begin to do, too, slowly. But I understand, it's a big change.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, when the time to say, "Wooh!" (murmurs) Or when? I mean first, uh. (breathes heavily)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe, maybe. Try to catch it as early as possible. When you sense some agitation, maybe that's the time to back off... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Maybe you're not allowed to do right then?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You know what? That's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I dunno maybe... </p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (inaudible 01:16:16)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, learn some alternatives. You- you could have done that or you could have maybe, back off and go back and say, "Gee, you know, your attitude is maybe a little bit... and Mom's sick..." (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and, "Come on, we're trying to uh..."</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: You, keep it a little (inaudible 01:16:33) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Somewhere a little bit, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's something for you to try. I mean, I- I know, we're all learning here.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: At times, a little bit, uh... (murmuring)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean what else... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's like, "Why couldn't you just done that?" You know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We were like... </p>

<p>CLIENT 1: All (inaudible 01:16:49) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We wouldn't wanna make the uh, sense out of you but the idea is to just at least, think a little bit more about some of the ways, in which we affect each other... </p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (clears throat)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...we're all needing to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh. Sure (in a low voice)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, Felicia needs to think about her impact on the two of you. As well as, the both you need to think about 'cause we're learning each others response systems here. The idea is to get along but in a way that had some things-- have some harmonious ways. What do you think? Do you think that's something you could try?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would the two of you be willing to- to try along with that, as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I would.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That means, close your eyes to the incident, for now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhmmm, not necessarily.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And then let, let it come back to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhmm, not close your eyes but just (someone coughs) I mean, put it on pause.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Put it on pause.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let her de-escalate because it might pressure her sometimes, Felicia's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's 'cause I have a tendency to wanna settle things and give it-- Clear it out now. Now, that's the worst thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Let me ask- ask you a little about that tendency. When you say, "I have a tendency." You- you have thoughts that must be settled now.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah. Yeah, 'cause uh, it's- it's uh, can't leave something hanging.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: It's just there...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...bugging me. It's still there, hanging. (inaudible 01:18:07) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of things-- What kind of thoughts, go through your mind about it, bugging you? What do you tell yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I wanna straighten it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I agree with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I mean... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is a difference of a half an hour or so, mean-- Make a much difference for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I think it does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think, we could try it and see?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Okay. And I... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: (crosstalk) (inaudible 01:18:34)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and maybe used that sheet to monitor some of the thoughts... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's experimental, uh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the experiment.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're gonna do a family experiment.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: So, it's the tendencies you wanna look at?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the thoughts-- And what we tell ourselves, erroneously sometimes, you say- you say to yourself, "I can't let it hang!"</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's an automatic response.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We call it automatic thought, right? "I can't let it hang!" But, what's the alternative if I don't let it hang? For like, half an hour. Gives your daughter time to simmer down a little bit. Gives you time to collect yourself then you go back and say, "Hey look, Felice, you know, Mom's not feeling so well and I really think she would feel better if..."</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "...maybe you go and give her an apology." "Well, I already gave it to Mom!" "Do it again maybe, just think about doing it again maybe, uhm, see how she feels." Now, we've got a little bit more harmony.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, you know, uhm-- Although the uh-- We have uh, a big incident or whatever, but coming back uhm, after that, we've nev-- Not just discuss or talk about her or anything because we-- So with the, basically, we had to let her...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Because I had to get well and- and I can't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: ...Then the doctor said, the stress was making me uhm, get worse.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She was kinda stress.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But do we do that kind of, as a family habit, to let things hang?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: No. Not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess you have... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: No, we had to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: But, but we had- we had to do that for this, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And now it seems...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: But no.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Generally, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, well, that's- that's good. 'Cause I think what we mean of hang, what kind of like, let them go by the wayside. And I think, we have the tendency to fall right back into that same old system.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, I got other things to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh, God!</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (laughs) I know the things that Randy uhm, and I had our trouble. Whatever, that sort of like, not to resolve things and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that so?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: And I had to. Yeah. And I had to... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She should trust.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Just, well, it's, you know, for five months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: It's not like these... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: So, I'm like going-- Well, how long... </p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She's gonna feel-- She doesn't trust me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it building? Are we getting closer to that trust?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: You mean, closer to trust? (clears throat) Well, no. These things, some things stand in the way of trust.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Like communication and truthfulness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: You can't trust what you don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Are you- you're working that out now? Apparently? At this point?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Do you feel good about the process?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I'm kinda balancing the- it all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: So, we kinda back slide a little...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. And that happens. But is it right where you could get back into that a little bit?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Trying to get together and- and actually, dealing with it. It is hard to get about, the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And sometimes when it's-- things are quiet and you know, kinda discuss things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And usually, it's late at night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And that's, that's tough for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, true but I think your marriage is uh, very important here and I think it's- really needs to be made of priority.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: That's what I say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the backbone of the family.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: No... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: If that isn't the priority, then what are we doing? If our marriage is not priority then...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Right now, I have this new job. I'm gonna do well on that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's important... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...that was very (inaudible 01:21:55) and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think these things settle down... </p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I work on to the night shift, she's on the day shift and we don't see each other really at night. And I work in night shifts. We rarely leave notes to each other on the computer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: E-mail? Or...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yes. Kind of thing and uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Kind of thing. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think, as time goes on now, and that settles down, you'll be able to-- You'll look closer to being able to spend some time together?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Well, I hope so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I bet... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think they need to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Close together? Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I get an impression sometimes that, that would really kinda make you feel good, if they were a little closer together?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, if they were close together, they wouldn't argue with each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that would mean what? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: ...which means, I wouldn't end up getting grumpy. And they wouldn't end up getting grumpy and be a lot more harmonious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess, what I hear you saying is that, sometimes the tension between them affects pretty directly on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right. Because when they have tension between them, it affects the little kids. 'Cause they get upset. They don't understand why Mom and Dad are fighting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you interpret it?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No, I just take them away from it. I usually try to redirect them into something else, you know. Go, close them in their room or take them outside.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, just feed Michelle, I think. Andy doesn't care, he just, he can play down there and then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll never know.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll never know what's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...going on to their heads, right? But it affects you, too?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah. It affects me, and I don't like it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you know, your parents strike me that, you're really committed to try to- to work on this. And I think we get on some time to better do that. What do you need from them, Felicia? From your father?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: As, what do you mean what I need?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wha-- what do you need that, the- the, to help you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I just-- I guess I need to, them to recognize my achievements.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Did gotten better about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have they recognized your achievements?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, I don't know, I just- I just like a pa- parent bad girl. So, why do something right? And it seemed like for awhile, Dad never noticed anything when I did it right, he only noticed things I did wrong. So, why can't I get any recognition for doing things right? I just get yelled at if I did something wrong and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How's that made you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: It made me angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would Mom do... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: But what's the point of trying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would Mom do the same thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No. She, she didn't do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She had... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: When she finds load in the dishwasher and...</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...all those kinds of things...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: You know, she just, "No, thanks. I appreciate that," or something. Or you know, if I do something... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: She's probably good 'cause she would do it all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Or, you know, if I- if I, uh-- From training my horses and you know, the horse finally catches something in, now can do something new that I trained it to do. Like, you know, work so hard and got me to do it myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: That's a big achievement for me. And Mom, you know, she was really proud of me for doing that but, you know, Dad's not really into horses. So, it's kinda like, "Okay, what?"</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Well, if you're all excited about it, I'll try to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What? Why do you think he does that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: He's just-- I don't know. I guess... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really question whether he's proud of you or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you ever ask him?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Ask him if he's proud of me? No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you ask?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Are you proud of me? The stuff I do?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: The stuff you did? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's what who you are. So, I think you've really come a long way since fourteen.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Your grades are up and you're doing a lot of work out there with the horses.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did Daddy answer your question?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Did I? Or not?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Okay, but is it-- In a way, yes. But in a way, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I got your picture on my toolbox.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Hey, come on. This is your daughter, huh? On the horse... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm wondering, if she doesn't just need to hear you say it.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That I'm proud of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: For what I've done good?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: You've done good.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: E- Ev- everything, in general?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No, just like-- I don't know. If I- if I do something right, (somebody coughs) Just, you know, tell me, that I did a good job.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Those things kind of, go unnoticed, I don't know why. They just, just go... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I really...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: That's what it is. Naturally, something goes wrong, you're gonna respond. (somebody coughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And hear about this... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is so vitally important for her right now, to hear you say, "I'm proud of you and I love you." I think that's very important to her. And I think that you can bring yourself to say that, at times. Not just to say for the sake of saying it, but, I'm- I'm wondering whether you really feel it inside sometimes. And I'm wondering if she knows how proud you are. Sometimes just hearing it, makes all things get to work.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Waiting for someone to speak here. Uhm, (clears throat) she has put us to the ringer last couple of years. And that issue of trust, it's kinda hard for me to (sighs) trust that she's not going to fall back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: And when I see things that are familiar. And start to ring in our heads, I get nervous. And I think it's- its- it's gonna happen again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're guarded? You're kind of, afraid. (indistinct sound)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: True, what I'm saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you think that maybe, what he might need to see from you, is a little bit more reassurance that you will be trustworthy?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: I don't really see anything that I have done. That would make him really feel that I wouldn't be trustworthy, besides this post-argument. Would that mean, too?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's a good question, was that? Will you ask him about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Have I ever done anything that would make you think, I'm gonna revert back?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Probably not. Probably not more than what I think I see. Probably- probably not. But I- I feel it. When I feel it, I remember and I just can't drop... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it possible that some of those feelings may be a little distorted...?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Less perceived?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, good. So, maybe one of the things that you might wanna do is try getting more direct information from Felicia. And then, ask her from point one, "Can I trust you?" I really wanna trust you. If Daddy answers that, could you give him a straight answer?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah, you could trust him.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We're never sure, anyway. Right? I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No guarantees and what?... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: ...and besides that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I think, it's important for Felicia to know that regardless of, some of the things that you guys- that you're still-- You're proud of her in some ways and that you- you care for her. That you'd be able to say that to her, I think that'll be important, too. As well as her being able to show you... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Uhm, she's a lot different in front of everybody. I think it's kind of important that she...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I can see it, too. (exhales) (paper flaps) Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Fine. You know, what we're talking right here, this is kind of like, the same thing that happened with Randy and I, see?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Because, there's like, there's a scene here and she wants him to say that he loves her. And she'd done anything that worked, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (clears throat) But she didn't get it, see. And says, it's the same thing I ask from Randy. �Cause Randy said that he love me, and reassure me that he's committed to having a life with me. But he said, well I, you know that he told-- he said something, "And well, I could change myself before I commit to you," or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think it would be-- I think it's a valid point you bring up that I think it would be important at some point, 'cause you try to understand why he does do that. I have a little bit of a hunch that Randy may have had some difficulties in his upbringing and he's a little guarded about that and...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: A little. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: (crosstalk) (inaudible 01:30:57) this thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm being polite.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yes, you are. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: That's very fine. But... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're guarded.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: See, but that's really hard. Because when you needed the most, if he can't give it, it's tough. It's really frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we have to understand, too, that there maybe some injury with him that really prevents him from doing it. It makes-- It maybe seemed to you like, it's stubbornness or stinginess, but I- I get the impression that he's- he's really protected because uh... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: I'm probably unwarranted, you know, maybe this experiment... (papers flapping)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, I don't understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Hmm, well, maybe- maybe-- Well like, what you're saying with Felicia, say, what, what happen if you did? To try see what happens.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You see? You know what... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Just like the wall thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. I have to tell you despite your difficulties I think you pretty need your family. And that's what I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: We haven't settled this very long. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: By living with us... (crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Oh, come on!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I don't think we're ready to take out the furniture...</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Who can argue that?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I think that you do this all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pardon me?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Last time we... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Actually, we do have people following us home like, in the grocery market.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Almost like, start following us, and trying to get on our car with us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of grocery do you buy?</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Good stuff... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Like good stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess so.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Good stuff, followed home I guess, I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Nice spirit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I hope some of this stuff is helpful to you and I hope it-- 'Cause the very least, maybe stimulated some thought and maybe if you can try that, I think it maybe effective. And then follow it up with your COUNSELOR. (pauses) Do you have any questions?</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: We have some questions... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Can I ask my questions? Uhmm.</p>

<p>(coughing sounds)</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: I think, I'm gonna do the one. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm wondering, next year you get ready to go to college. You gonna go to college?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You like to go to college?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think is gonna happen to the family when you leave?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Hmm, they'll fill that in and then it's gonna change.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Well, because my sister will be on the same position I'm in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: (crosstalk) In a way. But I think, by the time it gets around to her, I mean, it's gonna be different. Because here I am- I'm- I'm the first child, I'm the experiment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum... So, you're the pilot test?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right, right... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: The pilot test.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's second runner up?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Right. So there'll probably... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think, she wants the job?</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: No. She'd rather stay in her room of boredom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe, she will.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: But, I don't know. I think it'll be easier for her because Mom and Dad will have some experience with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: You know, we're really teenagers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And as Mom and Dad continue working and therapy themselves, I think there may be some changes. But I don't think they'll ever forget you.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Uh, I'm too loved.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: You can try and try and try. All things can happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, I appreciate you uh, coming in. And I- and I hope that uh, this helped you a little bit, you learn some things and I wish you a lot of good luck.</p>

<p>CLIENT 3: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT 1: Thanks a lot. You got me sweating.</p>

<p>(all laugh)</p>

<p>(applause)</p>

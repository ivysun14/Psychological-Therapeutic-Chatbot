<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right so I've been talking about my feeling that my being in the moment is something that I do from time to time but didn't know it was being in the moment. And some of these skills I've done once in a while. I'm now realizing that there's a name for them and so that's encouraging. And ... more recently was talking about automatic responses and how my responses ... the first time I'd seen the sheet with you I had a certain reaction that, "Yes I do all these things." But that's what having a realistic outlook is (pause) I mean that's just the way it is. And then having seen it this time (pause) I recognize that I still have this attitude that it is what I consider to be a realistic attitude. However I'm leaving room for the possibility that that isn't true.</p>

<p>And now I've found out that I didn't get the scholarship and I'm trying to ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I should have you write my notes. (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would probably freak out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm so unsure about everything. And that ... when I didn't get the Scholarship I realized that I wasn't ... my first response was it was a catastrophe, it didn't affect who I was, but then later that evening, over the past weekend I began to despair wondering what I'm going to do next? Where I'm going to land? People are talking about their summer plans and they're asking me what I'm doing; I still don't know. And then lately I've been realizing that, Yes I've seen myself in this what would consider dire positions before of uncertainty and recognizing that I don't expect things will change but I'm leaving open the possibility that they might change for the better.</p>

<p>(00:02:16)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I noticed you just used the word dire. Is that how extreme it feels now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it feel like right now to not know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like normal. (laugh) I mean, I don't think anybody really knows if you get right down to it what anything will promise. Whether if I got the Scholarship, whether it would be the experience that I expected it to be. And when I said it was a relief earlier before the recording it was a relief. Because it got to the point when I started to think that what I'd proposed to do was impossible if I wanted to remain married, you know? It was just going to take up all my time. And (pause) and so the fact that I've been, you know relieved of that burden of having to do that is in some ways a blessing. So yeah I don't know that (pause) I think this mindset that I have now which is more reasoned and forgiving is something I might change later tonight, you know? I might not feel this careless, not careless but perhaps (pause) I don't know, flaccid uncertainty about what's going to happen.</p>

<p>(00:04:10)</p>

<p>So you asked if that's the way I feel now? No. (pause) But I have to say that my medication is still not right. And I have to give some credence to that. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like it's not helping at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's helping some but the increase in the Wellbutrin, the start of the Wellbutrin, the addition of the Wellbutrin plus the increase, the 200 mg, which I've been doing for two weeks now. I go see her again next week on Thursday and I'm just not feeling like it's doing what she thought it might do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know it's important to include that factor but it's also ... I'm a little leery of putting too much weight on it. I don't know how much it's not doing or how much it is my outlook or the way I'm doing things or just the stress I'm under. I've also, you know did this sleep test and that's where I was going today, I have to get the results and they say yes I've got obstructive sleep apnea that if I sleep on my back. Well, I don't know what affect that's having. I hate sleeping on my back so ... you know? It seems like there's some ability to control that and some ability to see how much sleep I'm getting. They also deduced that I wasn't sleeping very well. Whether or not it's all the wires connected to me, I don't know, but I also know that my sleeping hasn't been good, you know for the past few weeks, you know at least. So ... (pause)</p>

<p>(00:06:17)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I think it's important to take that into account because chronic sleep deprivation has a number of, you know side affects. Ranging from difficulty concentrating, you know feeling like you respond more strongly to things that are happening you that go on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I don't know ... I mean I know it was one of those things that we talked about in DVG was this like vulnerabilities (pause) prompting event, thought, something and then actions; the consequences.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the vulnerability she put on the page where lack of sleep, stress tests whatever. Things that college students would have. But ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On a regular basis.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And you know my question was, I didn't ask it but is depression a vulnerability?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think ... you know to me it made sense. And that and I don't know how much weight I should give to the sleeping issue. But also the fact that the depression medication is affecting my sleep is also kind of a combined thing. I don't know, you know I think if I can get up each day and remember to be present a few times throughout the day and (pause) try to accept the uncertainty that really is for everyone non-negotiable. I mean nothing is certain. (pause) Then I think I'm doing okay. And then when things get better maybe my attitude will adjust, I don't know.</p>

<p>(00:08:26)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's certainly impossible to ... nobody has a life without any vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know those are just ... there are times when things are, you know fuller than others. But I think, you know looking ... be aware of that sometimes helps us even to navigate how we respond to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know is you don't know why you are responding so strongly with something it can make that harder to cope with than being aware of ... well, you know maybe I'm crying because, you know, just because I dropped my gum out because I'm really on edge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not only that but it would bring me to tears.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But knowing what's going on behind it I think does help us to put things into perspective and not to then become worried about our worry or be distressed about our distress.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Yeah and I did ask her, I said, "You know is the purpose of being mindful of these vulnerabilities and what are the purposes to able to be on guard a little bit about how we might react to something because of these vulnerabilities?" And if I know I haven't got a lot of sleep, if I know I'm stressed out I can expect to be on edge or escape to fantasy or whatever, you know? (pause) I mean instead of thinking about after the fact, why do I do that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. As soon as you can set things up also to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can plan a little bit ... you know I think it makes sense when you're really on edge to plan extra time around things because little things that go wrong ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I almost reschedule (inaudible_00:10:09). What am I doing here? I'm supposed to be here, there and then here. And I'm about to go back to Yale again, now for something else. Anyway, yeah, so ... you know it's funny that you mentioned that because, you know she had this picture of these four people waiting in line at the bank and each person had a different facial expression. Two people were like dut, dah, dut, you know no big deal. There's one teller window and two are closed and these other two people are like, you know, stressed out and ...</p>

<p>(00:10:40)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it made me think of when I went to the post office at (inaudible_00:10:44) Square and I think I put one quarter in the meter and went in and there's a long line.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not sure if it was because I didn't have anymore quarters or whatever, but I got in line and I got increasingly stressed because (pause) you know I'm going to get a ticket or something, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I think things like that, you know like you said put in a little bit more time around things. Putting a dollar in the meter if I have too in order to ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you would have been a lot more relaxed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. If I would have taken that information I would not have thought that guys behind the counter, lazy and they're on breaks and they're government workers, you know? All those stories that I crafted ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could've enjoyed your time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Knowing you had a certain amount of time on the meter or enough time to play with your phone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah, easy distraction. And so I'm also notorious for saying I'm going to be five minutes late when really I'm going to be ten minutes late. You know I kind of give ... not intentionally but it's just my default is to underestimate how late I'm going to be or how long it's going to take me without really having that much knowledge to inform me. So I do realize that things like this can make a stressful day that much more stressful. And the more I can be attentive to, A. My vulnerabilities. B. The control I have to make things easier; reschedule an appointment or you know whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What you just said at the very end there, what can you do actually to make it easier? I mean that's empowering yourself.</p>

<p>(00:12:40)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And rather than feeling like you are backed into the corner ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're a victim of your schedule.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly. Finding ways where you do have power to control the uncertainty or the stress can make it so much easier to allow yourself to be in the moment and not feel, you know geared up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got to leave, got to leave, got to leave, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think that's something very often when we feel stressed we forget to do. We forget to look at where do I actually have power to affect this in my day, in the moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you can do that it feels so much better because you're not ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel like you're subject to everything else hopefully.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or for example, you know lately I've been (pause) going by the coffee place and saying, "Oh I should get a coffee." It's like, "Well now do I really need a coffee?" You know? Because it's like that coffee is going to affect my afternoon. I'm already stressed out about the afternoon. Do I really want to add that much more tension to it? And so trying dial things back and rethink what things help me, which things don't help me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even just the original thought, "I should get a coffee." That's on that list.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The question really is, "Do I want a coffee right now?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do I want to tap into the ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, do I want, do I need? Do I really think I think better when I'm on caffeine? Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes up to a point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially before Arabic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It depends are you getting a venti. (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah exactly. So yeah.</p>

<p>(00:14:30)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I love the pro coffee research.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well. I think it's so funny because I was just talking to my wife last night about this. She got upset that her mother sent her this news report from CBN which Christian Broadcasting Network, Pat Roberson's enterprise. And it was about the benefits for Alzheimer's on coconut oil or the benefits of coconut oil to treat Alzheimer's. And it was just this fluff piece. And I was like, "Well yeah you can be upset with your mother about this but everyday we get different information about what's good for us and what's not." Two weeks ago red meat was bad for you. This week red meat is good for women in such a situation you know? It sounds like, I don't know, over (inaudible_ 00:15:15). That's a tangent. (chuckle) Anyway. So you've got one going. (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's where I am. Thirty minutes later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like actually a fairly good place to be because you're allowing yourself a little bit more skepticism in your thoughts, like whatever. You know those automatic thoughts are being a little bit more skeptical about them which is a huge step in changing them to be thoughts that are actually helpful for you, they're adaptive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Yeah. And (pause) Yeah I think the epiphany if it's even a mini one is that I do have a choice. And ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a pretty big epiphany.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In allowing yourself to make choices and to realize that you have them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well and to have allowed it. I'm waiting for the big event to follow. I mean, you know I can interpret my wife's seemingly coldness as she's upset with me or I can (pause) understand that she's exhausted and just fell asleep or whatever. And (pause) but I think I have to look at as much credence as I give that possibility about being reality. I also I think have to give equal or more credence to the vulnerability to (pause) having ... that would lead me to think such a thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it the vulnerabilities of sleep being one of them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the next step in figuring that, like what to do about that? Is there a next step following the result in the sleep study?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (pause) I don't know. Yes and no. I do not want to go for a CPAP thing every night and (pause) you know my doctor said that they got these wedge pillows that you can put under you to keep you on your side, so just try that. Okay. So that's ...</p>

<p>(00:18:07)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think it's also ... I mean that's the quality of my sleep when I go to bed. It's the when I go to bed and how long I sleep that I think is even more within my control.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When are you going to bed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Depends. It depends on if ... well, yeah. (pause) Midnight, one, maybe two. Not usually that late. By seven-thirty, eight I can, yeah. That's hard to connect the deficit to actual vulnerability.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Meaning it doesn't seem like, you know the days when there's five hours of sleep it doesn't necessarily seem worse than the days when there's seven or ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't seem obviously connected. I'm not saying it isn't or that ... but it's, I mean it might be the single most destructive, you know element in society, I don't know. But (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're right about both. Actually chronic sleep deprivation is a huge problem in our society and you're not necessarily going to see, you know on a day when you have less sleep, you're not necessarily going to see that you're going have noticed more deficits on that day or another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it's cumulative.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's especially with the time that your saying, pretty much every night you don't get quite enough sleep and some nights you less than others. But most adults need eight or nine and you're getting anywhere from like five to seven, maybe eight on you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't even sleep in on the weekends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. So the deficit is, it's more accumulative affect it's not what you're going see ups and downs each day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might notice that if you had normal sleep, normal sleep, normal sleep stop for two hours because you do an exam the next day. You're going to notice that kind of acute sleep deficit a little bit differently. But I mean I think it is something that is more under control seeing if you can dial it back or at least make it more consistent. It's almost better to do one o'clock every night than 12, 1, 2. Because your body can adjust to ... it adjusts to sleep cycles timing so how much you're used to getting. So we go (inaudible_ 00:21:01) sleep cycles throughout the night and your body ... you're going to feel most rested if you wakeup at a certain point in the cycle. And if it's irregular how long you have to sleep your body doesn't know how to adjust for that. So very often if you get woke up in the middle of the sleep cycle you're going to feel really groggy. If it's consistent your body times it so that you kind of wakeup as you're coming out of a sleep cycle as you're finishing one and then feel ... you don't have that disorientation when you wake up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I mean trying to get a little bit more consistency for yourself will probably be your first goal. You might notice a little bit of ... relief in that.</p>

<p>(00:21:43)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I'll try that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know it's hard. It's hard when you feel like you're not having enough time to do what you want to do it's really hard to stop yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah unless we just think it's a vicious cycle because my sleep deprivation causes me to (pause) you know perhaps not have my processes function as they should and then which ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then it takes longer to do things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at two o'clock in the morning I still can't fall asleep or I wakeup and I'm wide awake (inaudible _00:22:21). (pause) So what did you want to talk about?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not about me. Although there was actually was one thing that I noticed. I think this was last session or maybe it was the session before. That on the way out the door you commented on my boots. And so I wondered what that was about for you, because it's not like you to have little comments on the way out and I guess they were (pause) just for discussion in the past.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just trying to make a joke, I guess. (pause) (laugh) Well, yes ... (pause)</p>

<p>(00:23:19)</p>

<p>I guess it was a way of me saying I'm still vulnerable to that attraction. So even though I didn't bring it up during the session (pause) it's not like it didn't go without notice. I don't think I'm any less vulnerable than I was before in fact. (sigh) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is something we should make a point of addressing in session? You know not that it needs to be the focus of every session but would it be helpful to kind of keep that as part of the discussion? And not (inaudible_00:24:19) but important?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like medicine. (pause) Yeah I guess. (pause)</p>

<p>(00:25:02)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what kind of role have your fantasies been playing lately?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What kind of role?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I mean in terms of how much time you find yourself escaping into them and also how you find them affecting you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I don't enter them at all in a day. (pause) Lately which has been surprising to me. Things that nearly would have. Other times I've actually (pause) you know manufactured them for stress relief or whatever. (pause) That answer your question?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. (pause) How much time do you think you spend manufacturing? You know it's hard to quantify?</p>

<p>(00:27:13)</p>

<p>CLIENT: In a week ... twenty minutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a pretty small amount of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well I'm pretty busy. (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you know? It's times when ... I mean there's I guess what I call manufactured but then there's also like (pause) spontaneous usually is when I'm out in public, you know? But I don't manufacture these things when I'm doing something with somebody. It's when I'm by myself (pause) yeah. I think that'd be different if it were a time that is not a classic (inaudible_00:28:25). I don't know how I would act then. It might be more. Perhaps it would be. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are you now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just looking at your lips. Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:29:09)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so what are you feeling as you do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Arousal.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's think about what purpose it serves you?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) No offense but I think it's entertainment. I think it's like a past-time for me. Not with everybody, you know? I mean, I'm not saying you're special. (chuckle) But in a way you are because I think because of this intimate relationship. (pause) I can't look at people like I look at you. I mean, it's just not acceptable. I don't know if it's acceptable in here either. But (pause) but you know what I'm about. And so (pause) the fact that (pause) the fact that I can, I do choose too, I guess. Because it seems to me a choice (pause) is seems to me like it is (pause) some sort of (pause) pleasant distraction or entertainment. Entertainment is not the right word but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think distraction is quite the right word either. As you're talking about it I'm sort of pulling together some of the other themes from this session but thinking about and I don't know necessarily that they go together or how they go together. But thinking about empowerment, thinking about choice, you know think putting the action of you know looking at me, having a fantasy, noticing your reaction for yourself. How that plays into the ideas of where you have choice, where you can get empowerment, things like that. I'm wondering how that all fits together.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Again, remind me the empowerment part of this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The empowerment piece is kind of like, you know thinking about this is easier to see in examples like, giving yourself power over your reactions and power over your behaviors in situations. So like you have the choice of whether or not you're going to be anxious while you wait in line if you give yourself plenty of time on the meter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Getting power in the session, I mean often times it feels like the therapist has a lot of power, you know? I can direct conversation. You know I have the power to diagnose things or have you feel like you're either normal or not normal and one way of getting ... feeling like you have more power in the situation of getting more power is directing conversation. I can't control your mind. And that is a way of maybe making yourself more comfortable too. The same way that you feel more comfortable in line when you have power over how much time you really have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry. So what am I doing when I'm looking at you or fantasizing? Is that empowering myself? Making myself comfortable or ...</p>

<p>(00:34:50)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it could be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I don't think there's a definitive answer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I just want to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying correctly. And that's what you're suggesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I take that position because I think like you have complete control over fantasy. When you don't have complete power over an exchange where I'm an active piece. I'm not really an active piece in fantasy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have complete control over that. So that's why I think ... that's why I'm saying that's a way of getting of empowering ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I see, Kind of wrestling control from you. I see, yes, well. Could be. (pause) I don't know. I don't know. It doesn't seem right on. And I think I usually admit when things are ... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That maybe something to struggle with and figure out what feels more, what resonates more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The reason I think I don't think it's that is because it's (pause) it seems to me that it's disempowering that I'm giving myself over to things that I do have control over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:36:32)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it seems like it's a choice to (pause) I mean this is a ... maybe it's a bad example but you know if you wanted to ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Finish your thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Like you walk by the frozen yogurt place right? And you could go in there and order something that is going to be delicious, right? And sometimes you do and sometimes you don't. And when you don't you are actually making a choice to resist something that maybe you just feel you don't need or you don't want or you shouldn't want. Or you shouldn't have. And when it comes to this it seems to me like it's a breaking down into allowing myself to go into things that are exciting or in some ways ... I know entertain is not the word but thrilling might be a better word. And so (pause) I don't know does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So for you if feels more kind of like a submission, submitting to ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes submitting to ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A temptation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you said the frozen yogurt ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The idea of temptation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, something that is fun, is exciting, is you know, uplifting in a way. Depressing in another away, you know? So, yeah. (sigh)</p>

<p>(00:38:54)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think it's something you can continue to think about sort of what is the role of it? What does it mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You shouldn't ignore it. I think we need to schedule for next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I'm not going to be here next Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A least I don't think I will be. You don't have anything in the mornings do you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't. My morning is totally booked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if I get a cancellation I can let you know but for now it's booked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so you're here, I'm sorry, Tuesdays?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Monday, Tuesday, Friday. So I could meet this coming Tuesday the 27<sup>th</sup> if you want to meet next week or we can push it to the following week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know I could meet Tuesday or I could go another week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this Tuesday I have a ... I could do either a 12:30 or a 4:30. Next Tuesday I could offer you the same times and then Friday the 6<sup>th</sup> I can offer you a 12:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The 27<sup>th</sup> might seem a little too soon for me. Because I think I want to think about these things.</p>

<p>(00:40:24)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: However the 6<sup>th</sup> ... and the third you ...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tuesday the 3<sup>rd</sup> I can do a 12:30, a 2:30, or a 4:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay let's do 4:30 on the 3<sup>rd</sup>. I have class until four. And believe it or not the (inaudible_ 00:40:50) school wants me to talk to the incoming class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have no reason not to believe it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would it be easier ... I can push it to the ... I can start at five if that gives you more time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. That's fine. I mean I'm just across the road at four so it's actually convenient. So 4:30 to 5:30 on April 3<sup>rd</sup>?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will see you then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you for reminding me about this.</p>

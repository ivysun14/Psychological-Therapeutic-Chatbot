<P><B>DR:</B> So, how are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes sir.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We had our last meeting on [DATE], so that would be about six weeks ago, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes sir.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And as of that day you are on Cymbalta, Lexapro, Seroquel, Klonopin and Xanax?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes sir.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And uh, when was the last time we used Depakote?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh gosh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're also on Lamictal? Right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Beg your pardon?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are also taking Lamictal?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes sir.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so that one is... you seem to like it?  Yeah, so you are..um we changed the Lexapro to Celexa because of your co-pay. Right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, the expense of it, yes sir, uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did that help you in anyway, in terms-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think so, I think it's better.  I really do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So your Celexa now is, we changed it because of the co-pay and uh...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's only like $7.00 whereas the other was gonna be like $60.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you are taking the Celexa 40 mg right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that in place of Lexapro. It's saving quite a bit of money for you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's saving a lot.  Uh-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it's not affecting your mood any adversely is it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No sir.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. So your Cymbalta is still on 60 mg in the morning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cymbalta?  C-y-m-b-a-l-t-a?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're in the list, it..the list you have it doesn't have it there so.  Let me see the list you have.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  I don't, I don't, what, what was it you said, what was it again?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cymbalta.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't recall taking that. When did I go on that?  Do you show or? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Looking for it.  We started on [DATE], at a, actually we started it uh initially 30 mg and then [DATE] you went to 60 mg  As of January we started that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It doesn't have another name or anything to it huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah um, let me see.  It doesn't come in generic form.  How old is this list [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well it's not all that old.  [NAME OTHER] was gonna update it.  And [NAME OTHER] would know cause she puts all my medicine out, uh, on a week.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you are off of Lamictal now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We added the Cymbalta in January so you may not be taking it huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I, you know, I'd remember that name.  Don't I...Do I need to be taking it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well that depends upon how you are doing, that [INAUDIBLE] then we are off the Cymbalta, we still don't know if we need it or not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What is it for now?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's another antidepressant.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because you have the back pain, that's why we were using it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I have pain, believe me I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Since I hurt my arm and shoulder right...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're off of the Lamictal as well. You are not taking Lamictal?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are taking Seroquel 500 at bedtime.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And Klonopin 2 mg at bedtime.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the Xanax XR 3 mg in the morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now your other doctor is giving you [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is giving you Neurontin and I see the Neurontin you are taking is 300 mg one tablet twice a day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When was the last time you have seen [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I see him in the next couple weeks.  It's been about six weeks I guess.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He wanted to see me in two months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And you are also taking Percocet now or have you stopped it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Percocet</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The pain medicine?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm taking uh, I can take hydrocodone ...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, let's see it is uh, uh, hydrocodone 10/3.25.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's and you are taking how many times now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not taking it all that many times, probably three times a day or twice a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  How is your shoulder now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It hurts. I'm surprised it hadn't, but, even the other orthopedic doctor I went to before I switched over to uh...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The new doc.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh said, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] wrote a statement, two line statement said I would have limited motion in my left shoulder the rest of my life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Shoulder, Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he said that to the attorney and uh [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] on my ankle...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Should have operated.  On the x-ray it's black.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ya know what I mean? Black...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There is no contrast or anything and uh [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said, you have no ankle. You know, so I guess it's past surgery, it's ya know, so uh, anyway I hurt and I ache no matter what I take.  I can take pain pills and they numb the pain, but uh, uh, a lot of times I stay awake at night, you know I'm unable to sleep cause I hurt.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But as far as your bipolar disorder is concerned, you have bipolar disorder Type II...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, that causes it also doesn't it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well the thing is that uh if you have bipolar I and if you have trouble with the sleep, no matter what the reason is, then you probably would have been much, much more trouble. People who have real mania, if they don't sleep well I have seen that they do very poorly, but in your case uh, you are taking the Neurontin, some people believe that it helps to stabilize the mood.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now I'm bipolar what? II...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> II.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that's not as bad as bipolar I then?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well in bipolar II you have more depression than mania and in bipolar I you have more mania than depression. It's not really a bad or good, it depends upon how an individual presents. You have been mostly depressed.  I have....</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been a long time since I've had mania...well no, probably a year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have not seen any [INAUDIBLE] I have known you what three, four years now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, I have not seen any mania.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well there was one time, maybe it's two years ago doc, uh I uh, uh, [NAME OTHER] said I was manic, I didn't believe her. I was spending money right and left. I was going to go into business.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When was that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it's a couple years ago, I guess. Twenty--- two years ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And uh, uh I don't recall... whether you were my doctor then or [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Anyway, I uh, ....</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have been treating you since the year 2004, uh the first time I saw you possibly, I saw you [DATE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I thought you were my doctor then.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I might not have said anything about it uh...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't remember treating you for mania.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, well uh, [NAME OTHER] said, and I, well, I, I had to go, I had to go into the hospital with it because it was so bad.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was my doctor.  I saw you and you said you're too busy, you had too many patients.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In the hospital. Hum... I don't remember.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um hum, yeah, and uh, uh, uh, I was uh, I was spending money like it was goin out of style.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, there was this black man uh, who, uh evidently had hot electronic items you know, TV's whatever...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'd buy those right and left uh, uh, and then I'd give em away, you know, just and uh I know that's part of mania.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That what you are describing describes what mania is and that changes your definition to Type I then. And that makes me a little bit nervous [PATIENT NAME].  Because I have all along treated you as a Type II, so I really didn't mind using antidepressants, but if you have the mania what you are describing, we have to be careful and not...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do have.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not using a real mood stabilizer might become a problem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said that I was more dangerous when I was manic than when I was depressed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's typically [INAUDIBLE]. Manic people can cause havoc in a very short period of time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well he told me he said whenever it happens, he said you get a hold of me right away. And uh, so I know to do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, I didn't, you know, even [NAME OTHER] she went to my daughter's uh, uh, the uh, let's see, she went to my daughter's. I was having a hell of a bad time. She was leaving.  And uh, my daughter got involved  and they got the police out and it was another one of those ordeals where you have the helicopter and the police and everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the police take me to the hospital.  And uh, I guess I was in there eight days or nine days, something like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, bipolar...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the second time that's happened uh, the last time it happened we lived on 23rd Street and uh, I couldn't help it doc, you know...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know [PATIENT NAME]. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just happens.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm not saying that that's your fault...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's not the case.  But I might have to think though [PATIENT NAME].. is that makes me nervous because you are already on an antidepressant...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But not on a real mood stabilizer though.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I probably need to be on something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't, I don't respect Neurontin as much as a mood stabilizer. I haven't had much of luck. When are you going to go for the [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh I think it's ... it's this month, right around the middle.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  I'm going to write down the name of the medicine that if you could run it by with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] the name of the medicine is Topamax.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which kind...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You don't think you need to talk to him?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's hard for me to... he told me he uh, uh he knew my attorney ... and he says oh he says I know [NAME OTHER], said we get along real good together, said uh we're... we'll see that you're taken care of.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I will write down all I need to do if you are now taking Neurontin and that is a good medicine for the pain that you have on the shoulder and the back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Topamax pretty much does all the things that Neurontin does.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Okay. Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bu the Topamax is a much better mood stabilizer. I have better luck with it than Neurontin.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well if you'll write it down, I will put it in my bill fold</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I will write down two names.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And if he needs to get a hold of you he can.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely. I don't think he will have any problem because Topamax can do the same thing for the pain as Neurontin does.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So presently you are...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I don't have the manic as much as I used to. Now [NAME OTHER] is all the time asking me are you manic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I could tell usually when I'm manic, but uh, just like then, uh, uh, I don't know how many thousand dollars I spent doc.  I don't have any idea.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't want you to go there anymore.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I don't want to. Uh, I don't like the hospital.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But uh, I know if I have to go, I have to go.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's not the issue. Hospital we can take you there and stabilize, you know, but the financial load you put on your family.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, that, yes, that's very true and we worked hard for what we've got. You know I [INAUDIBLE] my losses and I told ya, I think before, we got a little bit of  oil interest and uh, so uh, [NAME OTHER] works her butt off...they're gonna put her on an insulin pump.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  Where is she today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She had a meeting at work. She's trying to get the part that she does, the traffic citations, she's an [DEIDENTIFIED]...she types like 120 words a minute doc.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And uh, uh, they're trying to get that so they can scan it rather than uh, uh, put it in by computer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my insurance is gonna be good. It's starts over again in July.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So she's going for a new job?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, she's been there 20 years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If they let her go they'd have to pay dearly. So...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's not gonna change your insurance right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No sir.  We got a letter on that. And even if ... even if it did, as [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] told [NAME OTHER], he says, uh, [PATIENT NAME] could take his Medicare and get a supplement and said that away, you know, the only one you'd have to worry about be you with your diabetes, so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, this is, uh if you give it to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I'm sure he will understand what I'm talking about.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. You don't need to write him a little note or anything?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nothing. That's all we do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just ask this...if he has questions he can call you?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now this would take the place of the one I'm taking now?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Correct.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, do you need any prescription today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not that I know of.  If I do I'll call [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh...[NAME OTHER] didn't say anything that I was out of anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, I'll see...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm having to see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] again.  Uh...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's wrong with your kidney?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, uh, because uh, I was wetting the bed and I was having trouble, you know, I dribble...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'd have trouble making it to the bathroom.  When uh I was driving, before these three doctors told me not to drive right now...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I'd bang into the corner of the house, the corner of the street where I live at and I couldn't control it and uh...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So when do you get to see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I don't have an appointment. He just put me on catheters and he said I'd have to catheterize myself at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Before I go to sleep, or [NAME OTHER] does one and uh, then if I have problems during the day, I use this new kind, it's disposable uh...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And lubricated and everything, so they're not too bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But uh, I do have that problem and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll see you in four weeks? And I'm going to make a copy of your most current medication list for my....</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well now I'll have [NAME OTHER] make you up one that's more current if you want, that one that you said up there I'm not taking it uh...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I don't see it here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right uh, I'll have her make up a new one...and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That is fine, but I'll keep a copy of this one just to make sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thanks [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Alright. Thank you.</p>

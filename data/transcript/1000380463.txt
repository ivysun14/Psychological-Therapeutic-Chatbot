<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT I think [inaudible at :17] being myself for two days actually. This training program is pretty much a continuance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you really start [inaudible at :33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday. That's morning and afternoon, evening. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you say? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm cutting [inaudible at 1:05]. A whole bunch of things bother me. I mean, it's what's really about the work or if it's, it just reminds me of it. One thing that I keep feeling is, well it is sort of a feeling that certainly not being respectable, I guess. Standards, not really, [inaudible at 2:41]. What I'm going to be doing isn't completely worked out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Isn't completely worked out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I never meant to, oh, you know, make my job so much larger and, mostly the people who go to the [inaudible at 3:22] are mostly college students, are coming in and setting around [inaudible at 3:33]. I don't really feel like I belong. You know, I'm a year or two older. You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Quite a bit different than they are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Different than they are, that's it. I have more experience.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are more mature than them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's it, yeah. Also I think I've, well, instead of [inaudible at 4:19] very different or. Plus, more. With college students it's another course, it's a course that's kind of a lark. A course that's kind of [inaudible at 4:43]. For me, it seems like, uh, it's a little more serious. It's getting started on something that I've waited for two years, [inaudible at 5:04] very much, like I'm getting into something worthwhile. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you are committed to it in a different way than the others?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you would like it to turn out to be something really but you are not sure if they feel the same way, the same kind of commitment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure they don't. But it certainly, I have kind of a bad feeling that I'll turn out to be, I'm not going to feel this, in the appropriate situation. So, I feel worried. What their [inaudible at 6:09].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whether that, I'm not sure that ties in with [inaudible at 6:18], what do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. I mean, [inaudible at 6:26] in other people's lives. Since then I've [inaudible at 6:34] recognizable. Professional job of some sort, [inaudible at 6:46] and. I am settling, no real [inaudible at 7:01] because they might. Well, like in college here when I was poor, I didn't have very much money but then, that was sort of a joke because nobody had very much money except for [inaudible at 7:27]. Something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, there was really no, you know, a real problem about the money because [inaudible at 7:44] and [inaudible at 7:50]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. There may be a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can't really borrow if you have no security. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm. Um hm. It sounds like in college, being in college justified to you being poor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What everyone did. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But now it feels like, you'd feel much better about yourself if you were making a better income.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel kind of [inaudible at 9:08] about this, like the rest of society. You know, fairly unbiased like claim a sort of social position. It's um. I'm not really a success by some standards and judgment. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, when I say, [inaudible at 10:00] who I am in the social context. I can't get very good feedback, I can't [inaudible at 10:03].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't get good feedback?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, like, you know, when I was in college. Who did I [inaudible at 10:14] in the social context. You know, very successful student at one of the best universities in the world. And [inaudible at 10:27], but I can't compare myself with. Points on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't reveal it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are not in a position where you give yourself points on it. Or from other people who [inaudible at 10:51] genius.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't have that kind of security of being in a firm, good position.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I also tend to be kind of critical about [inaudible at 11:54]. Probably sort of unfair, is I you know, like something will go on that's pretty, on an intellectual level. Something within the group, like a joke [inaudible at 12:29] and you know, if I've had that experience with a class in school with people, it's well, it's in the class or talk to somebody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you have no one else to talk to? It's all like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's smaller so if something, you know, something's not good, that's it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The whole thing pretty much then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and. There is also, there is also no, well, I'm comparing it again to the school situation. Uh, well, at the NYU, there were a lot of points, [inaudible at 13:39] because someone gave a bad class. Because there certainly certain people who might be successful as [inaudible at 13:56] that didn't you know. The reputation of the school or they had the feeling, or now I'm in an engagement of kind of questionable, because I've had this experience. Again because [inaudible at 14:19] kind of anchored all wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. But here you don't have that solid, that solidity. You know, like this is a good [inaudible at 14:32]. So when something starts, you doubt the whole thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess the thing is that I'm now depending on myself for much more than I have had before in a lot of ways. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hardly an, the last year, when it would be so easy to do and I've been keeping house for myself. [inaudible at 17:09].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, I guess more deeply, a kind of sense of security, has to rest a lot more on my own activity.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible at 17:52] teaching.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you saying like coming here to school you pretty much assume you are getting a good education because the school is [inaudible at 18:10] but what you do with it is what you are paying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. Not just sort of what you actually do get out of it. Find myself falling into [inaudible at 18:31] defense of that too. Being a part of, you know if I could really be studying and learning something five hours a day, [inaudible at 18:47] that's roughly what I'm trying to do. That's something that I've been trying to do for myself and it can't be taken away. And, you know, if I really, if I really teach, get a tutor, that's something solid too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I [inaudible at 19:33] in school here and teaching at [inaudible at 19:42] and carry me along.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can tell people I'm still at the NYU studying. You know, kind of go through the motions of teaching. At the school [inaudible at 20:06]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But here it's different. You can't depend on people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's kind of like last week we were talking about how if I'm open to myself and not kind of [inaudible at 21:20] different illusions and daydreams, it can be pretty tough at times, pretty intense and [inaudible at 21:35] learn a lot about yourself there. Kind of [inaudible at 21:43] if you think about it. And I guess the last couple of days has been kind of social awareness days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, like the last three weeks between [inaudible at 22:03] and my teaching job. I had [inaudible at 22:17] what kind of social position I was in, what kind of group I was in. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, the respectability of what I was doing. I wasn't only facing, being. If I was dealing with anything I was dealing with very personal problems [inaudible at 22:56]. And, you begin to think of yourself just that way. Kind of sort of registering as social is part of me too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you talking about when you say that you register socially?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you talking about things like, how, what you do that has an affect on the world or how other people place you socially?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think more of how other people place me socially.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As how I think of myself as socially clumsy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Are you feeling. I guess, you say you feel less respectable where you are. Are you also saying you feel less placed? Like, you aren't in such a neat category as you were in college?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like if someone heard that you were working with this program, as opposed to hearing that you were a student at the NYU, they might have a better idea of who you were after hearing that you were at NYU? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, better in the sense that they might think of me more highly if they know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Not necessarily be more clear about who you were but [inaudible at 25:20]. How have you felt that way, when you started teaching, thinking about that same way. I think you felt that job wasn't the kind of job that would get you as much respect as teaching in college, or something like that. Now how does this job seem to you in comparison to teaching? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'd say it's probably even lower down on the social totem pole.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So part of what you are going through right now is having to adjust to thinking of yourself in a lower way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why, want to keep things together. [inaudible at 31:12] responsible job, like teaching, and now very questionable [inaudible at 31:27]. I don't know it seems like I have a lot of things [inaudible at 31:41] and still more things that I haven't finished.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And here you are starting some more. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I feel very ashamed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ashamed you have not finished?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's some things, in grade school, that they wanted me to finish my papers and they needed that so they could do, temporary certificate. So they were in kind of a [inaudible at 32:41] because I thought I finished and so that way [inaudible at 32:54].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well in the sense that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still have contact with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean them asking you if your got your papers finished?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's that hanging over your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it's just from [inaudible at 33:13] an extension of them hanging over and. It makes me so ashamed to think that I, they trusted me and I. And I, I don't think there [inaudible at 33:39].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it won't really do any damage to anybody?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think it will. And, yet, and I was ashamed to violate their trust. They trusted me to do something and in a way took a chance on me and I let them down. One of my thoughts, I don't. You know I don't feel personally that it's, that there's, there's not a good job. It could be but I know that there are a lot of people who wouldn't think so. And, then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So like when you think of those people, does that make you ashamed in their eyes then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me feel kind of grubby to you know, not be ready to be completely open and I may do it if somebody asks me. [36:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean it makes you feel sort of bad about yourself that you would try to hide it from certain people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there also a whole set of people who would find that kind of job really exciting? I mean, I don't know what the job is like but it seems to me that there might be a lot of people too. I mean, it seems to me that what you are saying, what you are telling them is like, you are responding to a real social thing that some people would look down on but that's only like one section. There's a whole bunch of people who probably think that career is a respectable, good job to have. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. I also feel, I feel grubby in another sense too. Grubby in the sense that every time I get my hands dirty, doing something awfully mundane and boring things that are very necessary, keeping a tight budget and maybe talking to some people at the school and other. In a way I guess I feel exactly the same way about teaching.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, I guess what I'm worried about in teaching is am I doing a good job in teaching the kids. Really bothers me. How can I keep myself together to do a good job for those kids. And, I guess, you know, aside from what else you could say about them, in one way that kind of thinking, worry, is kind of [unintelligible at 41:03] in a sense, it is kind of an altruistic world. Not really, but my own self image was kind of [unintelligible at 41:13]. But it's a different worry than what I'll probably have next week. Gee, what are a lot of people thinking. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: In this job that you're in, is there some idea of how can I, I guess it's tutoring, is that what it is? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever it is. How can I do a good job with that? The thing is, it's not an important element of this job, you can't allow it to overshadow it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I only know that I get into actual tutoring, it might, I might do a lot more. These other elements are in there too. [unintelligible at 42:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you really do have to live very cheaply then. And you really do have a job that many people look down on. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess one feeling too that a lot of, I guess, he's [unintelligible at 44:58] that life is kind of nasty and short. And that there are a lot of good things that people will pay to do. I don't know, there's sort of a lot of [unintelligible at 45:27]. That's there an awful lot of worry about things that are not really concerned by the human developer, but just surviving. And I don't even [unintelligible at 45:53].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Unpleasant in doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unpleasant to me. In a way boring. It's just sort of a necessity. That is kind of a boring thing. It seems like so many of the things that I have kind of been reduced to that level. I go to work that way. Got to the point where I was trying to go to college.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So much of your time seems to be just trying to keep your head above water.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where as you were hoping a lot more, you would be able to float and then be able to do other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You really can't float too much because you are worried about being [unintelligible at 46:59].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. Um hm. But you've got to get those basic words out of the way before you can develop. The basic things. Just a minute, hang on for a minute. Let's see. Can you come in during the day? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. Again I was hoping I would know about my schedule earlier. But I don't. [unintelligible at 48:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Continuous, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the, what's early in the morning for you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking of afternoon, really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, that's possible because afternoons are a good time for me, I guess. And, if I have a Friday schedule, you know I could have some time or. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, Monday would be a good day for me. What we'll have to do is we'll have to set this up for Monday and then we will see how things work out because we are still arranging our office space. You are coming into a half-arranged place. Let me think. How about, let me just think for a moment. How I'm going to arrange everything. How is, how would 4:00 o'clock on Monday be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Possible. Would either 4:00 or 5:00 o'clock. Would 5:00 o'clock be better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, let's say 5:00 o'clock on Monday. Over at the bank building. Now downstairs I'm not sure if they have written where our offices are yet. But they are Suite 830. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the First National Bank Building on ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the Central Park Bank Building on Central Park.</p>

<p>CLIENT Right there. And 830.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I said 5:00 o'clock right? Okay. Now you will be coming rather than calling, right? Okay. If you think you are calling, we better talk about that some more because I am not yet whether we can close the doors and get the phones in them and etc., etc. So we'll talk about it if you want. Okay, I'll see you Monday at 5:00.</p>

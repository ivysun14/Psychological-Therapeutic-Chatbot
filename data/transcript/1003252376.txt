<p>This series of six transcripts features a couple, Dennis and Renee.  The following is session #2 of the six sessions.</p>

<p><b>Session Transcript</b></p>

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Dennis and Renee, welcome back. I wanted to open just - I sensed a little tension between the two of you when you came here, so I wanted to ask about that, and maybe anything you would like to say about what the last session was like for you and how things have been since then, so whoever wants to start.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: As far as the last session goes, I was feeling pretty good after it and looking forward to coming back. And this past week has been a lot of ups and downs for Renee and I, while the past is still very present with Renee and how I did not support her, even before this affair. And with her sexual child abuse, you know, I was telling her that I felt really bad that I could not be there for her more to learn and acknowledge what happened. And I was there, but I was not there learning with her. You know, I knew what happened, but I was not there for her like I should have been and many other things, so it has been rough. She has been beating me up, and deservedly so. I have done a lot of things in the past where I did not support her, and like I have always been, and should. [0:01:46]</p>

<p>So it has been really rough. I have been thinking about a lot of these things that I have done in the past, money issues and so forth, and blaming her for problems with money instead of figuring things out together and working through things together. I have said a lot of terrible things in the past, so it hurts and I cannot change that, but I sure think about it and wish I had done things differently. [0:02:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And it sounds like Renee has been angry at you a lot this week.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, she has been angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Excuse me. Have you been this repentant when she has been angry, or have you been defending yourself, or how has that been with…</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, I have been just agreeing and thinking about what she says and, you know, I am just sucking it all in, you know, because she is right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So you are feeling a lot of guilt and sort of that worthlessness that we talked about last time?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So that has been a pretty unpleasant experience, I would guess.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what has it been like for you? [0:03:01]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I have a question. Working with my therapist, I believe that he might have mentioned taking care of myself and working and focusing on what I should be doing. So my question is why am I here? I mean what is the point in being here? I am really angry, and he is right about I am really angry about a lot of the things in the past. Some of the things I disagree about what you say. Friday night you were angry back.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, I was.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So you did not suck it all in.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You are right. I did forget that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I am just really angry. I am angry about the way I was treated through the whole year that he had the affair. I am angry about the responsibility that he handed me when a lot of the responsibility in our past about money, about -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Family.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I do not know about family; I am not in touch with that. But the money thing, he handled the responsibility, and I am angry with him for doing that and I am angry at myself for taking it. So it has brought up a lot of places where I feel you have not been responsible and it does make me really angry. And to me, I think I see it really clearly, whereas before I didn't really see it clearly, and it is a pattern that was repeated in my own family. You know, if there was uncomfortableness, well, then it was Renee's problem and Renee took it. [0:04:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And so that is a pattern that is a real comfortable thing for me to do. And I had said to Dennis today that I was - and I have said this to you before - that I have never been unhappy with our financial situation, but you have, and you wanted me to do something about it. Not only were you not supportive, but you ripped me apart about it, and I am really, really angry about that. [0:05:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right, let me go back to your lead question of why are you here. Do you mean here in the session, why are you coming to work on things, because you are so angry that this is part of you thinks you should leave? Is that…</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean I just - I am trying to - the hip (ph). I was a little bit clearer about it earlier today. I just feel like if I was supposed to focus on myself and basically not worry about the marriage, then what is the purpose of me being here? I do not know that you had said that, but in therapy, you know, with the therapist that I work with, you know, I should focus on myself, take care of myself, focus on my own work, and let the marriage take care of itself. So I do not know that there is a…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A place for you here?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I do not know if that really... [0:06:13].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that is not my position. I think it is important to work with yourself, but it is also important to work with your relationship. And there is a way to work with your relationship here if you are interested in that. I asked some of these questions last time, but let me ask again, what would you like to see happen here?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: In therapy here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In these sessions, yes.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I am not sure that I can really answer anymore. I mean I am just so filled with rage. I cannot really… I feel all this rage and I feel like, “Well, why should I work on this marriage?” I worked on it. I worked on it through the affair. I worked on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He threw it away. Your choice was to throw it away, to get rid of it, to go somewhere else. You had lots of options to choose something else and you did not. [0:07:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this rage for part of you is at a point of not really wanting to try to work on the marriage, and also not wanting to come here to work on yourself because you can do that with your other therapist? Is that right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, I can understand that, and I am not here to tell you to be here. And if it does not feel right for you, that is really okay; I mean I can understand that, if it does not feel like it is the right thing to be here.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay. I would like that to just be an option.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Certainly is an option at this point.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I will stay today, but I would really like that to be an option.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I mean I would not want you to be here if you did not want to be or if it felt like the wrong thing for you. And I want to support what you said, which is you are starting to get to know more about what you want for yourself, and so I can support that. [0:08:18]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So given that you have agreed to stay for today, what shall we do? What would feel right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I want to say I am kind of open about it. That is kind of a mousy (ph) word. Well, can I just see? I will see what you say and…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, sure. I can give you some options. One would be to have the two of you - I would have the two of you talk to each other, but you would give me permission to blow the whistle when I saw different parts of you getting in the way, and ask for those parts to step back and try to keep it safe conversation, where you are both leading with what we call yourself. That would be to talk about some of the issues that you are having or some of the conflict that is in the room now. [0:09:30]</p>

<p>Another option would be for me to do some work with parts of you that you talked about while you witnessed or not. I mean if either of you feel uncomfortable doing this work in the presence of the other, it is always possible to ask the other person to leave, because I do not want you to feel - I do not want you to be vulnerable if it does not feel safe, in other words. Or to do some work with you and have Dennis leave or stay, whichever felt safe to you. So any of those are possible.</p>

<p>And this is actually kind of getting the sense; this is my style to keep asking what you would like and give you options and then have you choose and help me know what is good for you. So any thoughts about those three possibilities? Or is there really two possibilities? Do you have any thoughts? [0:10:32]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Option One.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. How would that be for you, Dennis, to talk to each other with me playing coach or referee?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Anything is fine. It would be fine with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So again, I want to ask for your permission to blow the whistle when I see parts popping up.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yup, no problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is okay with you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that okay with that angry part of you? Because when we do this kind of thing, I would like to have you speak for it but not from it. [0:11:03]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is that okay? I have that permission? Okay. Then, do you have a particular issue you want to start with? Or do you want to just start with how you are feeling right now?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That is fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be okay? Is that okay with you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, all right.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So we can go through it again, huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Then, because it is your feelings, why don't you start? And Dennis, what I would like from you while Renee is doing this is kind of just hold your own parts back for a while and put yourself in her shoes as best you can, and, you know, we will see how it goes.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay? All right. And both of you, I want you to know that I may have to blow the whistle a lot and just catch these parts, so not to take it personally. [0:12:17]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Really like that, to really show that you are, you know…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That is mainly what I am talking about, yes.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so you are on?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes. I am really angry that you chose the affair and that you did not choose other options that were available to you. And I struggle with wanting to be anywhere near you or care about this marriage or care anything about you. I am just really struggling. It is a rollercoaster ride, and right now I think I am at the top just about to, you know, dive down. So there is a lot of adrenalin and I feel real angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, good. And just check with that angry part now, see where you feel it in your body.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm. I think that it will be here, and it is here. [0:13:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, let us start here and just focus right here, and just see if there is anything more it wants you to say while you are speaking for it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Only that you would have to blip them out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, but speak for it. You know, just kind of the gist of what it wants you to say.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I just want to be - I want you to be able to see how furious I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I want you to be uncomfortable, because I am uncomfortable, and I feel like it is really unfair what you did and - hmm. This is a frustrating (ph) word: I hate you for doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, good. This certainly does, yes. We will focus right in here and see how it feels now. It feels the same, or different? [0:14:18]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, if you want to go by really tiny degrees, it might feel a little bit better, but it is still pretty tight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, let us focus down here and see what is there, see if there is anything else that needs to be said.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That is pretty angry, but there is a lot of fear in that part.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So down here is more fear.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And up here is the angry protector of the fear.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes. And the fear actually feels bigger than the angry part. The angry part is louder, but the fear is bigger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So it is good. I like doing visualization stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes, I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to speak for the fear, or should we just stay with the anger for now? [0:15:02]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. If I speak for the fear, then I become vulnerable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That is what I thought. So let us stay with the anger, all right? So just go one more time here and just see if that is everything it wants you to say for now.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, hate in big capital letters, a whole page of them. It is pretty strong. It is really strong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it really wants us to know how much it hates him for what he did.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm. And then I want to be mean and I want to lash out and I want to be - I am enraged.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this part wants to hurt him.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes. That is exactly right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really wants him to suffer big.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And focus on it again and see what would be good about that if Dennis really suffered. Why would that be good?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Why would that be good?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just see what it says. Just focus on it and ask it that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, then I would be able to see like the vulnerable parts, a real…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Intense?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this part really wants to see some vulnerability over here. [0:16:17]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. How is it feeling now in there?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: A little less. It is actually a different visual. I have like a twisted kind of a braided (ph) oil pan, but now there is like almost a hole there, like a little medallion thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. All right, good. So let me just see how Dennis is reacting to what you have said.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I want you to go ahead and respond to Renee, whatever way feels right.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I can understand why there is so much anger and hate, and there is just not much I can say. I am sorry, and I know I was wrong, and I have to accept what you are doing and try to get through it. [0:17:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, Dennis. Let me have you read your body for a second and see what you find in your body right now.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I do not know if I can do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't know how to or…</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes. It seems kind of screwy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So the part of you that thinks it is screwy, let's see if that part will step back for a second.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You have heard that before. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay? Can you read your body now?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I will try.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then, try.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you find anything?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where is the fear in your body?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I guess in here. [0:18:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it okay if we focus on that fear a little bit?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. So go ahead and zoom your attention in there.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And now let us see what that fear wants you to say for it. Or if you would rather, we can just work with it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I am just afraid of being able to say the right things and do the right things to make a difference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So stay with the fear right there, and ask what it is afraid will happen if you cannot do those things.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I will lose Renee.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So this part wants her to know how afraid it is of losing her?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe you could say that to her for it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I am really - in my heart, I am afraid of losing you and I think about that all the time. And I don't know, I am just afraid of not being able to make a difference in making the right choices and saying the right things and being here for you, although I am trying. [0:19:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this fear; it is afraid this angry part of Renee is not going to back down and that there is nothing that you are going to be able to say, or are you afraid that you do not know how to say the right thing?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. So stay with that fear in your body a little bit more, in your heart. Stay there for a little while, and just see if there is anything more coming from there, any more it wants you to say. [0:20:04]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, not for the fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. What else do you have in your body? Anything else?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-umm. I just feel ashamed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where is that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You mean more - near my stomach.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. So let's focus there for a second, is that okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And just see what the shame - if the shame is able to let you speak for it at all. Just see if there is anything it is willing to let you say.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. I am just thinking of the past, and I just feel I am so ashamed of all the years of not really being able to be there for you and support you with artwork and business and so many other things. I just think about that, and I am very ashamed because you were just trying to make a difference for us. And I could not make a difference and be there for you and support you and say the right things, so I feel very ashamed over the past. [0:21:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So let us switch the focus, Renee, and read your body and see how you are doing.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, my stomach is still really tight, so if there is a lot, still I think it is fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. How is it up here?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It is okay. [0:22:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is calmer up there?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is yours, the shame down there, that sets in your body now?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It is still there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is still there? Okay. So should we keep going, or what feels right? Okay. Do you want to respond then to what Dennis said?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I guess I - I do not know. I think that I would still be pulling (ph) out a finger (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do it. Speak for it though. [0:23:06]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Even though what you are saying is supposed to be, I don't know, nice, and that you are going to support me and you feel badly about not supporting me, I feel angry that you won't work on yourself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it is possible to speak for these parts… So you say that “There is a part of me that is angry.”</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or “This angry part thinks this.”</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So say them, like?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, if you do not mind.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And just focus on it and see what it wants you to say and then speak for it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The angry part of me is really resentful, but the ears (ph) are trying to say the right things and do the right things when I really need to hear you be accountable for not just how you reacted to me, but in the way that you didn't grow for yourself. [0:24:11]</p>

<p>I mean the angry part wants a partner, a partner who wants to go and wants to be close and wants to grow in their own way, separate. It is not that I do not - I feel like when you talk to me, the angry part thinks “I am not needy. I do not need you to feel sorry for me. I do not need you to feel… I need you to be a partner, a real partner, one that will be accountable for your actions and I will be accountable for my actions.”</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: During the anger?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: In the relationship.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I thought you meant while you were being angry.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, in the relationship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So by accountable for not growing or not being a partner, could be - any part be a little more specific about that? If Dennis were being accountable, what kind of things would he be saying? [0:25:09]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: If you were being accountable, you would - I keep losing my train of thought. It would be saying things like “Instead of focusing on you, Renee, I would have focused on myself and tried to see where my own issues were. I wouldn't have kept putting them back on you, the money issue about I was always happy with where we were with money and you were not.” And that to me, angry part feels that if you were being accountable you would say that you own that issue, that that was your issue. It is more than just being supportive of me when I was down or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then your part feels like Dennis has not owned that particular issue. [0:26:13]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-umm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, okay. Let us switch and see what you want to say to that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, not much to say. I have never been able to look at myself and deal with different issues very well, so there is not much to say. She is right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, she is right is something to say.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, you are right, but she has told me that before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So, you know, yes, she has been right, but that does not make me accountable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I do not know. I am not sure. I mean what I am hearing is your wanting Dennis to say “I am sorry that I did not do more work on myself. And it was my issue and I put it on you and I am really sorry about that.” Something like that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes. That is what you are saying, that does make a difference, and you never have said that because you never made money your issue, ever. [0:27:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I guess the question coming to you, Dennis, is do you think that money was your issue that you did put on to Renee?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes. I realize that now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It was my issue and I am sorry for putting it on you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Did that do it for you? You look skeptical.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I am skeptical because I do not know if you are telling the truth. If you are just saying that to placate me…</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You know, yes, you are right, you know, and that is that whipped puppy dog thing that just makes the anger back, you know like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay, so… [0:28:12]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I feel like there is something - I feel like there is some other feelings I mean there for you and I don't think you are [hanging around and telling them all] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know I have said plenty of wrong things in the past in regard to money and bills and stuff like that, and I accept responsibility for being a jerk about it and that is all it amounts to, you know. And I do truly feel bad for the past in doing that because we always got by and it just made more tension between us, and I am sorry for that. I know there has been a lot of money issues over the last 15 years, and I never knew how to talk about them with you, as a couple. So I just got crummy with you and I apologize for that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thanks for the apology, but I am still angry. [0:29:31]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I am sure.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean I am still angry because the focus is still - it feels like it is still on me rather than on you. To me, if you feel that that really is your issue, that money really is the issue for you, to me, I would rather hear you focus on you. Not so much about apologizing for me, but what are you going to do about… I mean it is not like the issue has gone away. If it is really yours, it is still there.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I feel I have changed quite a bit with regard to money issues, but I don't - yes, what?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But…</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That is your perception.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh. I am not as critical about money and all we are spending, how we spend our money. It doesn't matter to me that much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, Renee, you are saying that even since Dennis has been much more in this place, you have seen him react in the old way to money issues. [0:30:38]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You think I react the same way now as I did?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, much more mild about it, but the issue is still there. I have watched…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lay the issue out for me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay. To me, there are times where you either look in the checkbook or you will look at the phone bill and comment on how high the phone bill is. Please. This is a very minor thing, but the thing about the socks really irritated me. [0:31:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About the what?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Socks. I threw socks away, unmatched...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Socks. I thought you said sex so…</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, we are not going to touch that subject.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Socks. You questioned me a couple of times. I wanted to deck you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it is a sense of Dennis not trusting you with money and thinking you spend too much and him wanting to control you in a way. Is that the issue?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And so it sounds like he has always done that. And since this has happened, he still does it, but in a less critical way.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that sound right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this angry part is not going to let go until it looks like he has really let that one go. Does that sound right? Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Is that fair? [0:32:08]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, don't guess.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I do not know. I wasn't being critical about the socks in the garbage. I might not have asked the question right. I don't remember how I put it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what I want to know, Dennis, is, is there still a part of you around money that, even though you don't say it as much, still feels like you need to control Renee's spending?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. no.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Liar, liar, pants on fire.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't buy that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Nope, not one bit.</p>

<p>(Chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you are clear that you do not feel that any more.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you agree that you did do that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm. Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can see how bad that was for Renee?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To be under your thumb that way?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes. I can see some of the past that was uncalled for, some of the things I had said about money issues and comments I have made. Yes, I agree that there were plenty of times where I was a jerk about money issues. [0:33:40]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I am real pissed off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Say some more.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think that there was way more than some of the time. I think it is a way bigger issue than we have discussed here tonight about the money situation, when I worked and had my own business. And you not only - where you felt that I did not earn enough money, even though I was raising the two kids and running a business out of our home. That is really making me angry.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I understand. I just told you that I made plenty of mistakes about money issues and that was one of them. Plenty. I agree. [0:34:38]</p>



<p>THERAPIST: So what does that (inaudible at 0:34:46) feel now?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It is really tight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there is a lot in there about this issue.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right. There is a lot in there about that issue. There is a lot, and frankly, I don't believe you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't believe him?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-umm. I don't believe him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't believe that you have changed in that area.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That you have changed. I think you have a lid on it. I think because the affair is out in the open and you are worried about whether or not you are going to lose me, you are going to keep a lid on it, but I don't think it is gone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you would be happy if Dennis decided to do some work on this himself, if he decided to go inside and see what he could find about this issue?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes, that would be good. Here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here or someplace, yes. But it would be hard for you to do that since you think it is pretty much over.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So can I say something?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the matter?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think there is more to work on than a money issue right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Inside of you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, for us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you going to say, Renee?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I was going to say that our marriage almost dissolved over the money issue a few years ago, and it did not end after you went to work on it in therapy there either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, so yeah, it is still a real big, hot one for you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it were true what he is saying, that would be great, but you do not buy it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Do not buy it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if somehow, in the next three months, it really did seem different and time told that, then that would be great.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, all right. We have a lot of time left on this, but with your permission, if it is okay to do it in this context, I would like to get to know your parts a little bit better. Would that be okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you could ask that angry part to really step back for a few minutes.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then really just try to be present for Dennis when he does this. We just take a little tour inside. Will that be okay? [0:37:15]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. So I would like to have you focus back on that fear again. Is that okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is still in your heart?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And tell me how you feel toward that fear in your heart. Like do you like it, do you hate it, are you afraid of it, do you want to get rid of it, do you love it? What do you feel toward it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I feel scared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are afraid of the fear?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay, good. And what are you afraid of about the fear?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not being able to deal with it, with the different issues.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you are afraid that the fear will do what? [0:38:06]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just kind of like overtake me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So you are afraid you will be overwhelmed by the fear?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Overwhelmed, that is the word, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and then what will happen if the fear overwhelms you? What would happen?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know. I have never been in that position.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there is fear of going close to it for fear that it would overwhelm you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it were possible to get close to it without it overwhelming you and get to know it enough for it to unload some of the fear it carries, would you be interested in that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, if you want to, I can help you do that. I am good with that. I am good at helping people do that kind of thing.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take a second now and find the part of you that is afraid of the fear.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I am not sure what part of me would be afraid of the fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just find the fear of the fear.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Fear of the fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. The one who said it is afraid of you looking to be overwhelmed by the fear.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Part of my body?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, just that thought.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That thought. [0:39:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, that feeling. And ask that to step back so you are not so afraid of the fear. See if that is possible.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, the fear is stepped back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, the fear is still here, right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So ask the part that is afraid of the fear to step back.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Part that is afraid of the fear to step back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it is possible. It may not be possible.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I do not think it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So you are still afraid of the fear. [0:40:09]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. That is okay. Okay. This one who is afraid of the fear; it said it was afraid of being overwhelmed by the fear. Okay. Does it have any other fears about the fear?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I do not know. I am confused.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are not getting anything?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, that is fine, all right. Let me focus you back here again.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: On the fear?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel toward it as you focus on it now?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Confused. [0:41:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Confused about it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right, well, we are not going to get any closer to it tonight, but between now and next time or whatever, I would just like you to consider whether you would be interested in going toward that fear and maybe toward the shame in the future with us if I could guarantee that we could do it in such a way that it would not overwhelm you. And that in doing that we could unload a lot of that stuff that drives you to do these extreme things, or it has in the past, to do these extreme things like be controlling your own money, be interested in affairs, things like that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would be interested in that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, all right. And there is a specific way to do it so that you aren't (ph) overwhelmed by these parts, because I do not want that either. I am not interested in having these parts take over either. But what I am interested in is getting you close enough to them that they can show you where they got all the fear, all the shame, so that then we can unload it. How does that sound? [0:42:19]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It sounds helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? Does it sound scary as well?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. More confusing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Confusing. Okay. And also - go ahead.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I just seem like two different - going different directions from what we talked about last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Because - remind me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I just thought we would be more focusing on maybe why I would have been involved with this affair thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, right, okay. Yeah, I kind of jumped to that conclusion, but we can do that also. [0:43:04]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that is not a problem. And I would also like you to think between now and next time about whether it feels safe enough to do that internal exploration with Renee here or not.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because there are a lot of ways to look at that. If her angry part is as angry as it is tonight, it would be pretty scary to be that vulnerable in front of a part like that, I would guess.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, you are probably right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we would have to check and see how that angry part was.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: At the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the time, yes. And just check with you to see how much you could keep it from interfering or jumping on Dennis. Because I want to make sure that it is safe for anybody that does this work to. Well, you know how vulnerable you can be when you do that, so that is something else or for you to think about. [0:44:05]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another option is that you could step out for a few minutes while we did it and come back in and hear about it or whatever would feel safer, or not hear about it at all. But that is something to think about.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how are you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: My angry parts are off my neck and down my shoulders and my arms. Or standing in the back but… Barely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. You are holding them back for just that much. Is there anything that you want to say?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I guess really I have some questions about how that will work and what kind of information I will have. Because I am angry, I would not necessarily lash out at Dennis here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. [0:45:02]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I do not really - I mean (inaudible at 0:45:04) shot at you with whatever information I have, but not the whole me does not want to have a shot at you. And so I do not know... I mean yes, I would like to know what the fear is about. Yes, I would like to know if this fear is a lot. Yes I would like to know why you had the affair. But is it going to be information that I am going to like want to use?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Use to hurt him, you mean?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that is the danger, isn't it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. So if there was the possibility that that would happen, then I would be better that you were not here.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is about something I would like you to think about, if you would have some urge to use that against him at some point. Does that make sense? I mean given how much this angry part wants to hurt Dennis.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The parts that I use to hurt Dennis are the parts that I have about the affair, when he tells about the affair. I don't know that I would use - I do not know [how to] (ph) fall apart. You know, like I would not do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [0:46:13]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I will think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Think about it, yeah. Even more than not use things against him, think about if it is even possible to be empathic when he does it, to have some compassion for him while he does it, because otherwise it just won't happen very well.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that make sense?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, you led with some thoughts about not coming back, and as I said, that is always your choice. Do you have a sense about that right now?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I feel better about it, actually. I like working with learning how to talk about like the anger and the affair and not letting it overwhelm my conversation and not overwhelming both of us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there was something about that that felt better to you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That is very appealing to me. [0:47:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And learning how to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. How do you feel?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sad?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Say some more.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not sure why?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, I am sure why. Just all the past that I am getting hammered with and so just tough to absorb again and look at.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is tough to look at what you -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: How I was, at how I am, or both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Both, yeah. Yeah, that is right, it is really hard. But I do find that if it is possible to speak for these parts so that any part is not as hurtful as it maybe sometimes is outside of here. It is easier for someone like Dennis to look at himself, because he is not having to defend himself from that part all the time, which is not to say not to be angry, for you have every right to be angry. But it is important to create enough safety that he can do some work with himself. Does that make sense? [0:48:23]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I just - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is hard to do, I know, I know, yeah. Okay. You look thoughtful.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I look what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thoughtful or pensive or something.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just numb.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Numb? Okay. So I guess let me just check and see if there is anything you want to say before we stop, either of you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. What you are talking to me about seems kind of hard to absorb, looking at different parts and stuff, and looking at - just looks very confusing to me, what you are asking me to do. [0:49:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Say some more about the confusion.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just do not really see how you can look at a part like that and ask it how it is feeling and stuff. It is hard to work. It is hard to understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is hard to understand?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Is it like you do not think you could do it and anything would happen, or is it more that it is not understandable?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I guess it is just not understandable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Well, I will try to answer that quickly. You know, it is not something that came naturally to me either, but as I help people start to do it, it turns out they can talk to you; your emotions can talk to you and tell you things that you did not know about them, and your thoughts as well. And it is a way of being able to focus on them one at a time so that you are not having all this bombardment inside that makes you so confused and really hear about what one part of you feels or thinks, and people find that to be useful. And especially when they can hear the story of how whatever this part got to be the way it is, what happened in the past that made it so afraid or so ashamed. Once people can witness that, then their feelings start to change, and they do not carry all this stuff so much. They do not have to run away from it all the time. Does that make sense? [0:50:53]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Am I confusing you more?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, it makes sense. I don't know if it changes how I understand how I would look at these parts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And understand them individually. [0:51:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, if you give me permission, I can lead you into the way to do it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if there is more you need to know about the idea behind it, I am going to talk about it, to help you with the confusion.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay? Good. Well, we will see you guys next time, couple of weeks.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay, Dick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Good work.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

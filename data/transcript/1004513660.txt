<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. I am going to start. I must have missed counted sessions because I always bill Aetna for more than I think they owe you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In case I miss counted and they did. They covered one that I thought that you should pay for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You already paid for that, so I forwarded that to like a future session in March.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you had already prepaid for like a bunch in March and just credited your sort of account.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So whenever you want, whether it will be this session or the other session you will pay the co-pay but nothing else and we will just add to like your next chunk from what you paid for that one in February.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. I probably wont' today because I do not have any cash with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well you were expecting to pay, which is fine, and it doesn't really matter to me when. I just want to balance the book at some point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are very welcome. And I know that we had sort of left the topic of whether you wanted to come up with a fee that was more reasonable for you? Or be able to do more frequent sessions.</p>

<p>[00:01:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that at least for now I think financially it would be best to stay with every other week for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that at least for now. I mean I do want to do it every week because I do think that I was doing a lot of work and it was kind of, I mean I do not know it was happening very quickly. But it is also kind of nice to have it every other week, because I kind of had time to process and like think about things and sort of think things out a little better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. I guess I think for now it would be best for me if we do them every other week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. That's fine. I didn't want to push you, but I guess I wanted you to make the decision based on what felt best for you taking into account all types of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have had time to do that now. So you let me know if you change your mind at some point and know that the options are always open too that if you want to do more frequently because that feels important clinically. But you don't have the financial ability to do that, that we can discuss the fee that might help.</p>

<p>[00:02:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are very welcome. So where would you like to start with other stuff? Non-financial [indiscernible at 00:02:16] stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Oh there was a sharing thing this week or week and a half. So Phil and I were downstairs doing work and we were both writing papers and we were doing work like very well. Like we would talk and we were like 20 minutes because he doesn't think funny and then do back to work, so we were being very productive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then he started playing this song and I started going nuts because I had been up for a very, very long time and I was like having trouble focusing and I was like stressed out. But it was like in the living room area or whatever, and so I was like, well you know it is a public area so like it's not like a library. So I went upstairs, but I think I didn't say anything so it may have been like passive aggressively, I am now sure.</p>

<p>[00:03:02]</p>

<p>I didn't mean it that way but that is how he perceived it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you feeling with him going crazy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I knew like what I wanted to say, I just couldn't focus enough to do it and so usually the frustrating part is not knowing what to say. So it was like I think extra frustrating not to be able to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just wanted to finish it because I was almost done. So I went upstairs to me room and then like 10 minutes later he goes upstairs to his room and starts playing the Mandolin, which is really loud. I started crying a little bit because I was so frustrated. Because I was tired and I was also like, I want to finish this paper. Actually it was two papers, which is why I was so stressed out, and so then I like go to his door and go like (whisper) Phil. And so he didn't hear me obviously and so like I went wimped out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Testament to how loud he was playing. [chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckles] Yeah. So I like wimp out and go back to my room or whatever. But then he stopped playing and I see him leave his room and I am like, no I have to do this. I run out and I like talk to him and I am like and he says, "I know that you know like downstairs is a public area whatever and it is cool to like not be quiet, but it really upset me when you started the Mandolin 10 minutes after I went upstairs to finish doing work."</p>

<p>[00:04:30]</p>

<p>"And it would be nice if something..." What did he say? Something like, I think I sort of just trailed off. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he said that I had given him permission to play the song downstairs, which I don't doubt, I was so tired I didn't know what I was saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I was like, Oh OK. And that sort of ended that. [chuckle]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it wasn't like exactly perfect? But it felt better than just like being super angry in my room, which is what happens most of the time.</p>

<p>[00:05:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was really hard though and then I sort of; I was kind of disappointed I think at first? Because I was like, Oh I just want him to say that he was out here playing the Mandolin and I would say that I am sorry for leaving if he was offended by that and then we could hug and be happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. So that would have been perfect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [chuckles] And then because I probably didn't really bring it back to, Oh it wasn't downstairs that bothered me, it was upstairs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Upstairs because he kind of followed you up. Meaning that he followed you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that he sort of made an attempt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. And so I guess I could have brought it back and of course I played this over in my head for hours and hours, you know. Thinking what I could have said to bring it back maybe, because I think he would been like comfortable. I don't think that would have been a reasonable outcome, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With Phil, because he is very much like that. But I guess in the end usually I, just like am fuming angry and I go to my room and I like brood.</p>

<p>[00:06:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like fume and try and distract myself or something. And so I guess I was different that I talked to him about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it is very different. I mean it wasn't, you know kind of the picture perfect outcome that you would have hoped for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it is hard to get to picture perfect at a new skill.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And being able to say something to him that you feel like you were being honest with your feelings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you didn't hold it all in. And it doesn't sound like it resulted in him being really, really angry. It's not that the anger got passed back and forth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, you were able to openly acknowledge something and just sort of dissipated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he was able to say his piece back like, "Oh hey I got you gave him permission to play downstairs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and he probably didn't feel badly and you ended up feeling less badly than you would have too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds like it was a pretty good outcome.</p>

<p>[00:06:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was still really sort of hard to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course, it's really new.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and so it was like, I guess it was not just harder, it was almost like an event in my head. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I made it like this huge deal when it was just like, "Hey could you not play the Mandolin?" Like it was a big deal, but I don't know it felt like a really big deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think because it is so new and it takes a lot of courage for you to say something that open and honest with somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About what you are feeling, my guess is that it will feel less like an event and it will take a little bit less emotional energy to do something like that, the more often that you do it. Because what takes a lot of kind of motivation energy to do it is that you anticipate that it might be really bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the more times that you have toward this outcome where it is not necessarily perfect but it is also not horrendous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The less you will fear doing it.</p>

<p>[00:07:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That makes sense actually because I think later in the week I had another sort of thing with my family to see who might be moving out. I was kind of frustrated because I asked her a million times if she was staying and she said, "Yes, yes I am staying for sure, I am staying for sure."</p>

<p>And then all of a sudden she is like, "I better not say it." So I was like, Oh my God, like really sort of frustrated. And I guess I wasn't very responsive partly because I was very busy and so she is a little bit like, if she thinks over like I do. So if I don't risk [indiscernible at 00:08:29] reply it can be like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She could be making up lots of reasons why.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and so she sent me this e-mail and was like, "Hey I am really sorry if I like over [indiscernible at 00:08:37] with all these text messages. We can talk about it in person if you want to, or whatever." And I actually said, oh I am not upset, I was just a little frustrated that it came out of the blue sort of. And she was, "Oh I understand that," and I felt better.</p>

<p>I don't know, I guess that was also smaller one.</p>

<p>[00:09:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope you have the feeling like you have the freedom to do that? I think it sort of angst that you hold on to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. I think the one place that I don't know that I am ready to do it is like venting to a friend or something. Because like people vent to me all the time and I like it because it makes me feel useful and like I could vent back if I wanted to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like the other day Phil, no Julia said something like, "Oh sometimes you vent to me about Phil. But like almost rarely sort of thinking I always vent to you about my boyfriend or whatever." And even just like having that I felt like, Oh I vent to her about something like that is wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like, even though it is not really wrong like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's part of what people do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it is not like I like say really mean things about Phil.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I told her about the thing with music.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, I felt really sort of like I don't know. Sort of like that is too much.</p>

<p>[00:10:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Do you know what it was that felt so like invasive about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't invasive actually, it was more like I am crossing the written line or something. Even though, I mean I'm not really because she even said that she vents more at me than I do to her or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what feels so distasteful about it, like ooh it's wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean I have been thinking about it. I think it is just uncomfortable because I don't know, I mean. [chuckle] I am usually more in control than that. [chuckle] I think that what it is actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it felt like she had noticed you being out of control?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, venting is like I guess a loss of control? I don't know, that is what it feels like to me.</p>

<p>[00:11:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Losing control of what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My emotions? I don't know, like I feel like if I was really upset with Phil I should talk with him, or something. But, I don't know. That's weird too, because I don't want to make the huge deal about his music thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That wasn't really a huge deal. It was just like maybe because of this thing. And so, I don't know it was very strange and I couldn't really figure it out in my head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you remember what you felt like at the time that you were actually telling her about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was angry I think, or like frustrated. It's like, oh but I should have said this thing, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we could have like hugged or something. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Angry at yourself? Angry at him? It doesn't have to be either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably both. Maybe a little bit of both I would say. Equally actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is a step forward. [chuckle] I guess I figured out that maybe it is not just saying things, it is also saying them correctly or like correct.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the language things are really important to me too. I don't know, because that's like when I spend time most of my time thinking over like when I think for hours and hours. It is not like, oh yeah what could I have done to like make someone feel better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or what could have I said where it is more like the phrasing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like what word could I have better used to describe what the emotion that I was feeling?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hoping you would express yourself most.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most honestly or most accurately.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But it also, I don't know, it feels like a huge mistake if I don't use, or if I come up with like an amazing word later that wasn't, I don't know. Sort of, it's hard to describe because it is like a really intense feeling like, oh my God I shouldn't have done that. Or like really bad. Almost like embarrassment or like shame or something.</p>

<p>[00:13:03]</p>

<p>That's the wrong word to use. Don't ever use it again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder what makes it so important that it be perfect like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Because I don't have that in everyday conversation I guess. And some conversations. Like I went to the church yesterday and they have like a social hour, or something afterwards. And I was like if I come alone, didn't know anyone. I might as well try to meet someone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I met this really nice lady and we talked for a while. But like afterwards I was like, oh man I could have asked this question and this would have been good to ask her about like where she was last year. I don't know it feels really paralyzing almost.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it that you, like with yesterday's that you went back and were judging your performance? Or did you feel like you had missed something? What made you go back and review the conversation?</p>

<p>[00:14:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's more like, oh that was an interesting conversation and she seemed really nice. I wish I hadn't said this really stupid thing or like. [chuckle] Or I hadn't been awkward, or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How could you stop yourself after the, "Well that was a really good conversation, she was cool."</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckle]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we will leave it at that. How could you let yourself stop your process there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess I didn't really realize that I did this, but I guess I have done it fairly a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I never used to be, I don't know. I feel like this worrying thing is really important because I never used to like, I mean you don't like have a script for life. You know you are going to say the wrong things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like it has to be OK? Like even my professor in college used to say if you're not offending someone you're doing something wrong. So I was like, OK well not that I like want to offend people?</p>

<p>[00:15:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Inevitably I am going to have differences with people and like that has to be OK? And it is OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Is the wording thing in both languages. Does that happen in both languages?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Only in English?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I have a larger vocabulary in English. Because I studied English.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So interesting, you have more words to describe yourself in English, but you worry about using the right words more in English. I am guessing that you have more vocabulary in English? You are using words that don't describe yourself as well in Spanish more often.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What was that last part? [chuckle]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you are probably using words that are less accurately describe what you are thinking or feeling in Spanish more often than English.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you have more words in English.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You worry about it more in English. That surprises me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah I guess that's interesting. I mean sometimes I worry about how to say something to my Mom, but it is not like the same worry.</p>

<p>[00:16:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if it is about the types of conversations you are having in English versus Spanish? Because you said you only worry about this with some types of conversations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not like your everyday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I haven't really noticed what that pattern is or like which ones I do and which ones I don't. But when I am at the house like, you know meowing at the cat or something and being ridiculous with my housemates or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like obviously and even do say like something stupid or something I didn't think about something and I said something. I was like, oh I didn't mean that I meant this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. And that feels OK because you have a chance to rectify it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don't know, because I'm also thinking like I think this might be connected to like this thing. This is what I think how I came to like discover this, it just came to me. Was like I sort of started thinking of playing around of the idea of doing clinical pastoral education? Which is like I guess a clinical pastor in like a hospital and visiting patients and stuff.</p>

<p>[00:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that while I took a class called Death and Dying last semester? And I think one of my greatest fears someone in like the class had a parent that died or something. And I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to say. It was just like I really wanted to express that like I am sorry for their loss or whatever. But like I don't know. Like is it OK to hold someone's hand, or like what do I say? I'm sorry for your loss. Or like do I ask a question?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or what would I want? And so that really freaks me out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think; I guess I starting thinking about wording last semester in terms of like. Oh well like what would I say in these difficult situations or whatever?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know that it is [indiscernible at 00:17:44] I guess, I sort of realized.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [sneeze] Excuse me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bless you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I did it elsewhere too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting I think you know in what you are noticing. In some situations this is pretty common.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In those kind of significant and less often that situation's like, you know having to express your sympathy for a loss. I mean a lot of people struggle with, what do I say to this person.</p>

<p>[00:18:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know because their experience is so intense, or something you haven't necessarily experienced yourself. How do you identify?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And those are pretty, you know influential situations. And you have a lot of road to you know, if somebody is fragile there is more room to kind of be hurtful unintentionally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know it is hard to struggle with that kind of pressure?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For situations that might come up more often. You know if it only happens, you know if you are only struggling to put the perfect words on something, you know on infrequent situations then like OK. It's not going to get in your way that much on a daily basis.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you are putting that same kind of pressure on saying the perfect thing on the more everyday conversations?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is going to get in the way a bit more.</p>

<p>[00:19:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. I think that I had started also taking pauses and like thinking about things?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that's how that may have started. Being like, ok I have time. Like I have a second to sit and think about what I want to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it may have like evolved from there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think you are paying a lot more attention to what you say. Because at you a couple of times in here and we just kind of points it out how the way that you phrase something might be causing you to reflect back on yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As well and I wonder if the increased awareness of what you are saying is also made you unintentionally a little bit more detrimental from what you are saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah I guess this is separate but, I also have just been like I guess I know why I am doing this, but I know that we talked about this last time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And still doing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am still doing it. [chuckle] But like over [inaudible] I guess, like the control thing was really like a light in my head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it does so much, like it describes so much of how I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah exactly. And even I think that the behavior at home, like the really controlling behavior too? Because I think that like I don't know, once I get over. I feel like it is one or the other. Like you had pointed out last week where I didn't really know how, and I think I tried to like control myself or the other person.</p>

<p>[00:20:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate that. I don't know, I hate it. It's really embarrassing doing it, but it seems like it is one or the other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you control someone else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my little brother? Like he can't win a fight. He just can't. I will yell and like, I don't know knock on my doors really loudly and just be a horrible person and be really controlling and that's not what I want to be. That's all I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it seems to I think it is part of the same thing. Like I think it's like a controlling thing. Or like even when like I become really close friends with someone, like really close? Sometimes I do check this but I still know that I feel it. Sometimes I get like really jealous if they start hanging out with someone else like for a long time? But like really jealous and I am not a jealous person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I am...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think that you are jealous of? There is a difference between, I think what you are noticing is that it doesn't fit globally. You're not a jealous person, but you are jealous of that and that doesn't mean necessarily that you are a jealous person. But there is something in that person that you really like paying attention to someone else. Or sharing their time with someone else.</p>

<p>[00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can be jealous of that and not necessarily be a jealous person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. OK. Because I would want to do the same thing. If like I have a friend I want to have other friends to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that, I know</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That it makes sense intellectually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. So I think that's like also like trying to control people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like people's friendships, like wanting to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like really, really wanting to, but like how would I do that, you know? I wouldn't want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you do instead? What do you do when you feel really that was a time that a friend is spending with someone else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: this happened in college is actually why a friendship ended. I did realize. Maybe that's when I realized that that is what I was doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a best friend, Luke Johnson, and we were really, really close. We lived on the same hall and like in sophomore year we were on the same project. He was an RA and I was something else residentially. I mean we lived on the same floor and so we were like the sophomores in the Freshman housing thing.</p>

<p>[00:23:13]</p>

<p>And so we hung out a lot and he started hanging out with people from our Freshman hall a lot more? Like I don't know how they do Sophomore year and I started feeling really jealous and sometimes I would be like, oh thanks for inviting me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something really immature. I think that it like just grew and I think things like that just sort of like, you know piled up and then we just stopped being friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't like a fight or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We just like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine because little caught reactions like that showed that you were angry and he didn't know probably to do with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I know that, I don't know like I feel crazy when I talk about that because that's so crazy. I don't know, like who does that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Someone who feels hurt.</p>

<p>[00:24:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like that's just.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For someone who feels hurt doesn't feel safe to express that they feel hurt. That's probably what's going on. You felt hurt that he; it felt like he was choosing them over you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that hurts. And since you didn't feel safe to say, "I felt bad when you didn't include me, or when I wasn't included," to want to be my</p>

<p>It came out a different way. You expressed your hurt as anger and disappointment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I do that a lot. [chuckle]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have a little bit. It makes you feel less vulnerable. Expressing hurt and disappointment makes us really vulnerable. Because what if he responded and I doubt that this would happen, but I think the fear is what if I say I felt hurt when you didn't include me and the person says something back like, "well I didn't want to because I don't like you that much."</p>

<p>[00:25:04]</p>

<p>I think that is what the fear is, because the fear is not usually met.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think that is really interesting. That's like a thing too, the inclusion thing. It's like a big thing. I don't know why. Do I have like a huge insecurity about like not having friends or something? I don't know. [chuckle] I don't know. I mean I did this week, because I realized that I am basically only friend's with my roommates and they don't have significant others. So for two or three night it was just me and the other guy who staying in the house. And he is really like really introverted, so he just stays in his room. So it is basically me in the whole house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, I don't have friends. I want to go out and have a beer, but I don't have anyone to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have friends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Grab and go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you have friends that are currently also in relationships so they spend time with them too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and I didn't mean that, that actually wasn't a jealous thing. I was just like, oh that's interesting. When did I not have friends outside my house?</p>

<p>[00:26:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that is kind of why I went yesterday to the social hour, or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like a really healthy response to noticing that your friendships didn't feel big enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I still kind of, yeah. It's so sad I think though. I felt like, oh that sucks. [chuckle] Because divinity schools are really tight knit you know? And like Phil knows literally everyone at school. I don't know. It's weird because I used to be that person. I like ran for President in my undergrad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: it's a big shift.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and here I hardly know anyone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's so different about here? What made you respond differently?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I was really intimidated by everyone the first year, and I just stopped caring after I was like devastated by graduate school. [chuckle] And then I think after I stopped caring as much I started doing better work and was like, oh maybe I do have something to contribute. And then didn't feel so bad. Which is totally backwards way to go about it. [chuckle]</p>

<p>Because now I feel like I can have a conversation with someone and not be extremely awkward like I was. Because I came here the summer before I started school, and so I met a lot of Divinity school people and I really didn't know what to say. I was like I couldn't even have a conversation. It was so weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's something you feel a lot more secure in your footing academically now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which makes a big difference, yeah. Sort of, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of is a secure I am still trying to figure out whether or not it's like invaluable input.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, that am considering whether or not it is like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are just assuming it is definitely known?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckle]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Step in the right direction.</p>

<p>[00:28:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't know. I feel like I am sort of looking at like, I do [indiscernible at 00:28:17] stuff a lot like that's just how I think is like [indiscernible at 00:28:21] and I see like all these patterns. Like now because we talked about how and whatever. But I am like frustrated and I like I don't know what to do. There are like so many things.</p>

 

 

 

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-huh. Which one do you focus on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yeah. I mean the communication things is kind of like, OK we should work on it. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I mean I think it is hard because you do see a connection between you know the feelings that you have about your family and there are struggles in relationship with your Mom. And feelings that you have about you know past interactions with friends and what's going on with friends currently. And there so many connections, which I think is a wonderful strength actually.</p>

<p>[00:29:01]</p>

<p>I mean to be able to make those connections so quickly, is going to be really helpful to you and you know but at the same time it can also feel overwhelming because you want to work on all of them and fix all of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckle]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because they are so apparent to you when you look at it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if we kind of you know just focus in on one piece? It is not that you are not working on the other stuff, it indirectly all those other things actually get impacted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just looking at, you know paying particular attention to the language the last couple of weeks allowed you actually to affect a couple different relationships. I mean you were able to say something to Phil, you were able to say something to Julia, and if these are you know important relationships. You were able to go to the church thing by yourself and talk to a new person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of way. [chuckle]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you really did actually talk to that person.</p>

<p>[00:29:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: that wasn't a made-up discussion. I don't think. [chuckle] Maybe you didn't say exactly what you wanted to say at that perspective, but you did actually have a conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to give yourself credit for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's so weird because that was like public speaking now terrifies me, and I used to do extemporaneous speaking competitively like in the state of New Mexico. So like, I used those...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those seem very different to me, because one is a performance. Like if you are doing a public speaking event, or a debate type thing, that's performance. It's like you are on stage and you have an audience versus now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like, come up with an argument now and like debate this other person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of like a competition?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it is not a personal discussion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So and I am wondering if that's part of the difference for you. For some people the difference between them having a thing to talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Versus a person to talk with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no what I meant is like so like back in high school I could do this thing very well. And now I could even think about doing any public speaking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you would do that kind of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>[00:31:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like in college I used to have conversations like these and meet random people all the time and was pretty good at it I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Felt comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and now it is like totally this weird thing that I am terrified of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have been moving in the wrong direction now. But that's sort of where I was... it wouldn't have been a huge deal in college, it's so weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else changed between college and now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So much. Yeah. I mean a lot. Moving was really hard for me because I knew that if I go back now I still know people there and I didn't know anyone here at all when I moved here. So I spent the whole summer like not knowing anyone and it is kind of hard to meet people and then school wasn't going very well. So I was really sad.</p>

<p>[00:32:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way you shock your offense. You were so excited to go to college.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were so confident in that decision to move away from home and to go to college. Does this thing that you merely built up as a good thing that you were going to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: did you feel the same way leaving college coming here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it was half and half. It was sad to leave my friends in like Charlottesville. I knew the area very well and the people so I was sad to leave, I guess where I worked for four years. I was excited to finish my masters really quickly and then go straight into PhD work right afterwards and not be one of the 82 percent of people that drop out of the plan (ph) that's on the graph end, you know during orientation. And I was really like excited to do the work, but that was it.</p>

<p>[-:33:01]</p>

<p>I am going to be totally anti-social and live in the library and do work and nothing else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a very different expectation than what you had built for yourself. Going from high school to college, which is college to grad school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if that you know just even coming in, you know when you started meeting people in Charlottesville there was not part of you that was sad about what you left behind. You were so excited to leave.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's a different platform to stand on than the one where you are kind of conflicted and you are sort of missing that comfortable, what had become comfortable home base.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Grad school can be really intimidating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well especially....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially Yale.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [chuckle] Well especially the person that I ended up working with. I have been thinking a lot about this as well, was the person that I had been. My advisor, the person that I came here to work with ended up being really hard to work with, like she really didn't like me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she was a good advisor, but as a professor she shot down everything that I ever said, and so I was terrified to even like open my mouth in class.</p>

<p>[00:34:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just like when we would make eye contact, like I was like, I'm reading, I'm reading. I wonder why, you know taking notes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A tough introduction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really hard and I act stupid and did an independent study with her in my second semester and so after that I was like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there another reason, other than being stupid that you did that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I thought that if I survived the independent study with her, it was on Goddess which is like my thing when I came in. Then I might have what it takes to go on to PhD work despite my horrible grades this semester. So accurate failed at that, I was like I am worth nothing and what am I doing here? I even said to quit at one point and so it was really sort of like; I wasn't that I forgot how to write it was just I noticed that I didn't know how to write at all.</p>

<p>[00:35:05]</p>

<p>And so I had to relearn how to write. I asked the professor, how do you write? Tell me. [chuckle] And then the whole like PhD thing at the same time. I think this year has been more about like, OK what do I have left? And like what can I build up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually I think it has been really healthy in a way, like to like take everything that I thought I was academically down and off. And like see what I am left with? So I think it's been good, I mean I am a much better writer, but it was really hard. It was really hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow those are some very earth shattering experiences, because you are things that you thought you knew about yourself were different than what you expected.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would defend it before it was. Yeah. I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Still are, yeah.</p>

<p>[00:36:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know, but I found someone that I work with now and she is really cool and supportive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like a much better match. Because it is not necessarily that you are stupid and knew nothing, but your style really didn't fit with that professor's style. That doesn't make you worthless. It just makes you not a good fit for working with that professor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well the thing was I came to do stuff, like Hinduism and she was the only Hinduism person here and so I didn't fit with her. And I am like, I don't have no one. So that was really hard too, like what do I do if I can't do Hinduism?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I happen to discover something new.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Which is wonderful in the end. I love it, but yeah I don't know. With all of this was happening at the same time as like I guess that makes sense why I don't have a lot friends. [chuckle]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you have been working on a lot of other things and having your foundation rocked like that and having to rebuild how you think of yourself and who you think you are and how to communicate that to others. I mean those are big pieces of work.</p>

<p>[00:37:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really interesting. I think that the words thing. There's the one where I think about what I say, or whatever, that's how I write.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I think that's the same thing, because I was just doing this last night and it was a two page paper.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, it's a two page paper about nothing. You don't have to have an argument. Like just observe this place and I was like, I can't do this. Like I use to be able to do 10 pages a night in college. I was sort of psyching myself out a little bit I guess. But I was like two pages? And then when I started writing it was like, words to look at and every sentence had to be perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it is the same thing. That's interesting. Maybe it's the whole relearning how to write has really sort of crept into real life. I guess.</p>

<p>[00:38:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you talk about relearning how to write, how do you write differently now then how you wrote in college?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In college it was like, ok my ideas are there whatever [chuckles] The words might like grammar words would be like my idea is there and it is clear and move on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now every sentence has to be perfect and every word has to perfectly reflect what I am trying to say, or else like I circle it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [chuckle]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like they are like, "What do you mean?" Which makes sense because every word does mean something, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. It's interesting. It's not that you didn't know how to write before, but you didn't know how to write for graduate work. It's now that what you were doing before was no good, but clearly a different level of clarity is asked for now at this level. In this type of writing.</p>

<p>[00:39:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess if you wrote how you wrote in college for a blog, lots of people would love to read it and not see anything wrong with it. And it's not that that's bad writing, but there is a different audience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right, right. Right. But I think that like. Like I used to write and like be really confused like in college I would be like, OK well my ideas are whatever, and then what I say now is like, OK here is my jumble of ideas. What do I mean by this, like what does this mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like trying to translate that into what does it mean language, is really different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really interesting, I never thought about this so much. I think that's what it is. I think that's weird though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it mean and what does it reflect about me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because if I don't say exactly what I mean then it's going to be my marked wrong. Or misunderstood, yeah. I guess since this idea that language like adequately reflects what one is feeling, but that's not true at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well a lot of times there isn't good language to describe what we are feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Now I feel really crazy. [chuckles] Yeah. I think that's also why a lot of times I just don't talk. Like I have a lot of things, it's not that I am not listening in class; I am definitely listening. And there is a lot of going like, Oh that's really interesting but can I say like the other thing. Like, Oh I have things you like you would hear as like comments or whatever?</p>

<p>[00:40:59]</p>

<p>But I am like always like, no like I am going to say it wrong. Or when I do raise my hand, I secretly type out like a sentence of what I want to say. Or type out the question before I read it out loud or something. To make sure that it is like right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. That puts you in such a tight spot, because you know you are maybe not sharing something. Because you are afraid that it is not going to adequately reflect what you are really thinking or really feeling. But when you don't share something, whether it be in class or in a social situation, people are left complete freedom to make assumptions, or guesses about how you are thinking or reacting. It doesn't give them any shot of truly knowing who you are, or what you think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's so different than what I used to feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: you used to feel really comfortable and kind of taking a chance that they would get you. And would get what you really meant. And sometime people do. Even though our language is not a perfect medium, through which to really express ourselves. But it's the best thing we have.</p>

<p>[00:42:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and combining that with you know, excellent history with you. I mean what you say to somebody in a moment isn't the only thing that they are really basing their opinion on. They also have information from before, and they have your body language.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What you're doing right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it doesn't necessarily have to be perfect to do a good enough job to convey what you mean, or how you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you feeling in the moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I am just confused as to why this crept into real life and how that's a little messed up I think, because it is supposed to be two separate things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These academic standards on your social interactions.</p>

<p>[00:43:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I guess I do interact with a lot of smart people that I don't want to look stupid in front of maybe part of my [indiscernible at 00:43:07].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you also spend a lot of time, and your main focus now is school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's worth thinking about. Or maybe not think about it. [laughter]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me think about it sometimes. But remember to give yourself a break sometimes and let yourself be rather than think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I had a question in terms of like, I guess the future. Because I know like there is this map of this maze of things to work on. And I was wondering like how to do that. Like how could we do that long-term, because it helps me to know, or to try and see things long-term because then I like know what is coming. I don't know do you know what I mean? I don't know what to do, or how to do that.</p>

<p>[00:44:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess in my mind I think about what you came in with and have some kind of long-term goals. So I can tell you what they are in my mind and certainly reflect back and let me know if I am off base. But when you came in you kind of noticed big things were relationship with Dad, relationship with Mom and then I kind of think as your relationship to yourself. Wanting to feel more confident. Wanting to feel more secure in yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I kind of see those as the three big goals, and then the avenue toward that feeling more comfortable with yourself in relationship with your Dad. So for me that kind of means I think the biggest role of it is whether or not you give yourself permission to do what feels right for you. You are taking your own needs into account and giving yourself permission to not have a relationship if that feels good.</p>

<p>[00:45:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are kind of at that self-care piece that we talked about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: so that's kind of I guess one big thing. And when I think about your relationship with your Mom, and goals there. What really stands out for me is this kind of disjunct (ph) between feeling really close to her and how important that relationship is and how unhappy you are often with what the interactions going. You are going home and having these angry outbursts that feel so out of character for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yet they are so frequent when you actually spend time with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And find a way to get that more in line so that the relationship like they feel like you have is more accurately reflected and in the actual interactions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then with regards to yourself, I guess it's kind of wrapped up in those two things. You know giving yourself permission to really have self care, really confident about yourself, liking who you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: yeah.</p>

<p>[00:46:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then the everyday, you know the shorter term goals are kind of the behaviors that you know done repetitively will kind of get you to those places in those relationships. So less focusing on the language that you use. Using language that allows you to more freely express what you are thinking. That is going to reflect back on yourself so when you are able to not storm up to your room, and then feel badly about it and not how you acted, you are going to like yourself better. And as an easy outgrowth of that is your relationships.</p>

<p>The flow will be more smoothly in all of them. Even though you only had that one interaction with Phil, it actually impacts your relationships.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's how I see it, kind of working on the behaviors in the moment will reflect back to you kind of how your thinking and what you feel about yourself. And I think that is going to impact this other stuff. That's a really broad view, and I don't really have a timeline. I don't know. [chuckles] I don't know how many repetitions of doing something like that and how many repetitions of kind of stopping yourself from the kind of analyzing that you did post the social hour at the church is going you know. How many times do you have to do something like that and not feel badly about yourself?</p>

<p>[00:47:30]</p>

<p>To get to a place where you can say something to Mom and have her respond the way it feels good. I wish I could tell you that in 10 sessions and see this result.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there is not that much of a way to predict.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does that fit for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't asking about like length of time. I was more asking about because I guess I feel like I come and I sort of talk about what happened in the last weeks and how it's connected with what we have talked about before? But I guess it might be easier, or I guess more tired, I don't know. If maybe like there was something like, let's talk about communication this week. And like that we could do that. I don't know if that's like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you want more of a directive from me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would that be OK?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah that would be great. [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so let me, we have to find it I think. It feels OK as long as there is a balance, because the thing I fear is that I say, OK like here's something specific to talk about and it doesn't fit. And especially with your desire to be pleasing to others, I don't want you to talk about stuff because I said to, if that's not what really fits for you in the moment. Because sometimes come up that actually you know kind of trump maybe what we had thought was going to be really important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK</p>

<p>[00:49:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So finding a balance in that also gives you good practice, maybe you are being able to assert yourself if there is a mismatch between what I think is important thing to talk about and what you feel like is an important thing to talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I would be comfortable saying something like, hey like I know that we planned on talking about communication or something, but this week this thing happened and I kind of want to talk about that. I could do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we do need to stop for today, but why don't we make a deal so we are meeting in two weeks. Why don't you e-mail me like a week from now with a little bit of like this seems to be an important thing that is going on right now and then I can take from that and map it onto one of your goals for next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would that be OK? I also don't want it to be like you are doing work, like I don't feel like that would be happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so if you e-mail me at some point, you know sometime between this week and next week with anything that feels like, if there is something that feels like it was important, like an important communication with somebody or an event.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and that way I have some context for thinking about how does this fit into like what we talked this week and last week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK</p>

<p>THERAPIST: does that make sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can definitely do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. I will see you in two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are welcome.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, thanks, so how are things going for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not any better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I hear things are not going too well.  So what, what are the biggest problems that you're having?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, um, I fall asleep with the pill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I wake up to go to the bathroom and from then on, I toss most of the time and once in a while I'll fall asleep again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what time do you go to bed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About 8:30, 8:30, 9:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then what time will you wake up at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It all depends on if I go to the bathroom, uh, before I go to bed, then I probably will sleep 2 or 3 hours but if I can't go to the bathroom, then probably an hour and a half or 2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you're up at night after that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I'm up at night after that, sometimes I do fall asleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and how's your, how's your mood been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My, they've been okay, they've been the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, would you say you're depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would you say you're depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, um, and let's just go over because I'm maybe a little confused about what meds you're on, do you have a list or -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't have a list but I can tell you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I have -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, go ahead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, okay, we're still on the Effexor -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> XR 150 and, I've got 2 pages at once, uh, he's off the Abilify -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ambien you take -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Ten.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The 10, a full 10 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't break that in half?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did for a while -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But now you're not, okay, and the lithium we stopped, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We stopped and then we started.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We started, that's right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he's on the 300 a day?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that was restarted when?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, I'm going to say about a month ago, sometime around the beginning of the month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Was it that long, do you think, let's see, I saw him -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You saw him in October.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So yeah, maybe it is about -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I think we, we stopped it in October and then we started again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and we were considering Nortriptyline but did we ever do that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and that's all, do you have something else, that's all I have.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, in terms of, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> My medications.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Your medications, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, you don't look too good, that's for sure.  Um, and how's your wife doing?  Hi, this is [PHYSICIAN NAME], yeah, why don't we just do that and, yeah, let's just do that, okay, let's just do a direct admit.  I'm really busy today so maybe just keep his number, okay, thanks.  All right, sorry, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You asked me how my wife is doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's not doing any better, she still forgets quite a bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, unfortunately, that's going to get worse and, uh, now that's it winter, what do </p>

you do all day long, are you getting out, doing anything?
<p><b>PT:</b> No, that's my problem -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Both of us, we don't, we don't do much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, um, well we've been talking about a number of things for a while, I mean one is how best to treat you and, you know, the question is do you need another hospitalization and would it be good for you to go back up to [DEIDENTIFIED] like you did before and spend some time there because it sounds like it did improve a </p>
bit and then the other thing is, you know, I know your family has been talking about, to you about moving and would that be a good option so that you don't have to sit and worry about the house and obsess about things like you have been in the past and would your wife agree to that also.

<p><b>PT:</b> I know my wife would not agree to that right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you agreed, do you think she would agree?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Do you think if you told mom that, you know, you really think that it's best for you and best for them to go to assisted living, she would say no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know she would say no.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know she would say no?  What would you do if you told, what would she do if you told her that you were going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I probably wouldn't tell her that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Fair enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Fair enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's just say she did change her mind, would you agree to that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I would.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I, you know, it's hard to give up the home, I understand that but lots of times people go into an assisted living, all the details are taken care of and that just will help the 2 of you and, unfortunately, your wife's memory is going to continue to fail and, um, I do wonder if, you know, if you were, if you just were moved into a place if she wouldn't just follow, I mean what's she going to do, stay behind.  I mean sometimes what you can do is get a place, say we're going to do this temporarily, see how it goes, and you know -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That type of thing.  Um, what about being in the hospital, I mean you do look miserable.  On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 is the worst you could feel and 10 is the best you could feel, where would you say you are now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm either a 1 or a 2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I would agree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got a lot of trouble with constipation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, like, when did you last have your last bowel movement?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was thinking about that today, when I was at [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Your last bowel movement?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sure -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean that, uh, hard stool.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it, and what are you taking as a stool softener?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Those little pills, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Dulcolax or something?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, there are certainly stronger things we can give you like MiraLAX.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, he's taking that too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And he's taking a pudding, um, recipe that they, do you know what's in it dad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's 1/2 cup of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Metamucil or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Half a cup of -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Applesauce?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Applesauce and 1/2 cup of -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Prune juice?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Prune juice and 3/4 cup of -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Bran?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Bran.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, you're taking MiraLAX and Dulcolax.  What about, um, I mean there is this medicine called, um, uh, what's it called, lactulose, which I mean, it's a liquid that you drink, that's another thing but -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, part of the problem is just that, think, I mean when he does go, his stool is soft -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Correct?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, but he's not eating because he says that he's full here all the time but that when he eats he's not full, so I think he's, he really feels as though his bowels aren't working properly and therefore he doesn't want to eat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much weight have you lost, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thirty five -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, the last time he was on a scale he was 180.  He hasn't been weighed since then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We could try weighing him now.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Let's see if you lost.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't have a jacket on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, did I weigh you last time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, you did?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't remember, your memory is better than mine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, wait, wait, let it stop, okay now go on, okay, 173.4 with shoes, okay and what did you say you normally weigh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, I think, I think he was, weren't you 181 dad, when you went for your assessment, the geriatric assessment?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that was just a little while ago, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, so he's lost about 8 pounds in the last month, I'd say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, you know, I mean what do to, I mean we've tried so many different medications and I've tried a lot of my tricks, you've been on the EMSAM patch and, um, we've added the lithium, I mean we used to have Nortriptyline, you certainly, and we've done ECT on you, uh, and that, I mean that probably is my next recommendation is ECT, uh, the question is, I mean do you want it and should you have it here or somewhere else and my inclination is that my experience when you get hospitalized here is that  as soon as you're here, you want to go home and so we don't really gain anything.  When you did go up to [DEIDENTIFIED] then, because it's so far away, you're agreeable to staying and it sounds like you got a little bit better last time with that and maybe the best plan would be to consider doing that and then go straight with you and your wife into assisted living and just sort of bite the bullet and just do it, I mean that, that might just be the best thing and just say to your wife, look, we really need to do this or we need to give it a try for a month and I suppose if it doesn't work out, you can always go back but I suspect once you get in there, you'll see the advantages of having meals prepared and, you know, you don't have to worry about shoveling the driveway and taking care of the grass and fixing things around the house, which has kind  of brought you down before.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Now dad, you didn't feel as though when you went to [DEIDENTIFIED] the last time that it helped you very much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right but they felt as though it did and we, we certainly felt as though it did.  I mean, um, and [PHYSICIAN NAME] saw you in July, right after you had gotten back from [DEIDENTIFIED], um, so how do you feel about going back to [DEIDENTIFIED], um, just for a change of pace and a change of environment a little bit?  I'm not sure whether or not they'd recommend ECT or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, the ECT really didn't help me either here or there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it did help a bit but I think the trouble is that it helps you but then you keep going back to the same situation, environment and that maybe if you went into a different environment, that might make a difference, I can't say for certain but I think it'd be, I mean you guys are not getting any younger, you're what, [AGE] right now or [AGE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  They're both [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, you know, eventually you guys aren't going to be able to stay at the home and, you know, the fear is always greater than the reality, I think once you're in a different place, I suspect you'll be a lot more comfortable within it and I think your wife might be too and in some ways, this is the time to go because if she gets, you know, if you get, if you go when you're more confused, then it's confusing in terms of finding your way around and where everything is, let me just get this.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hello, hello, yes, yeah, they're coming, I think so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> If we stay -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> If we don't do anything -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can I call you back?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is that an option?  I mean is that an alternative for you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, they said they're, they might, they're bringing something up for him -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For the time being, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And possibly for us.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah but you're not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't you just [INAUDIBLE].  Bye.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I asked him whether or not it made sense just to maintain the status quo because he's not getting any better and if he stays there -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know, what's going to happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right and I was saying with your wife, if you go later, then it's going to be, she's going to be more confused about things, so you're going to kind of be stuck versus is she goes now, she's together enough that she can adapt and then as she gets more forgetful, she'll be in that familiar environment rather than moving her when she is going to have a hard time adapting.  I know it's all tough decisions but sometimes it's best to let, you know, the people around you, who you trust, kind of make those decisions, um, I certainly think your family has your best interest at heart and you look absolutely miserable, you know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's how he feels.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I mean I certainly don't want to speak for you but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So just suffering isn't going to be good, isn't going to be good.  So I would recommend going back to [DEIDENTIFIED] and then looking for an assisted living and then just maybe bite the bullet and just go.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What we could do is we could, um, while you're at [DEIDENTIFIED], we could look at a couple, 2 or 3 different locations, so that when you got back you could visit and then you could make the choice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, is your silence because you can't really make a decision at this point?  Yeah, that's why when people get like that sometimes, they say you just have to trust us and, you know, let other people make the decision for you and, you know, I think your son has, you know, your best intention at heart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know he has.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I mean in the meantime, for us, I almost wonder if we should go back to that Nortriptyline and stop the Effexor.  [INAUDIBLE].  Hi, this is [PHYSICIAN NAME], yeah, yeah, I'm with somebody right now, do you need something right, no, no, but you can see her, okay, oh, I guess I've seen her before but I really don't know, I have no records of her so, yeah, I don't even remember, I have no idea who she is, okay.  Um, I was thinking, should we taper him off the Effexor and start the Nortriptyline in the meantime, unless he's going to go right away, you know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, I think that's something we need to, we need to really talk about, um, over the course of the next few days.  Um, assuming we go that route, will you be able to, um, set it up with [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think it'd be easiest, I mean what did you do last time, didn't you just call them and -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I called -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they want our records?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think I called my physician and then he put me in touch with someone else, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you get me the name of somebody, I can give them a call, I mean but I don't think I, I think we sent them the records.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You sent them the records, you didn't make the call the first time, um, I just don't know, in terms of it would make more sense this time, because you've been seeing him since he's been back, to make the call and indicate that, uh, it would be best for him to come back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I could, do you know who is, I probably have his record.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, well and I've got them at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't you email me with that -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I can do that and let's just see what they need but I don't know if they're, I don't, to be honest, I'm not even sure how their system works but I don't think it's that hard to get people readmitted, yeah.  I don't see why that would be a problem, that's what they kind of do but I think that would make more sense because I know when you come into our inpatient unit, it's like the next day you want to go back home and since it's so close, you know -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, he wanted, I think you wanted to go back home as well when you were at [DEIDENTIFIED], didn't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but because -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I think you were looking better when you left and clearly things are not good now.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, significantly better, I mean it's like day and night between when you came home and how you are now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but I think it's my constipation [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, but that's all tied up with everything and that's why it all needs to be reevaluated, the medications and this and that and, um, and I think also maybe you look better when you, well again, I think going back to the same situation just makes you depressed again, it doesn't seem like there's anything good at home for you, so looking forward or getting that new place I think would make a big difference.  Well, all right, why don't we do that, um -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Why do we, um, we'll need, we'll need to talk a bit -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I'm thinking that over the course of the next, uh, 3, 4 days, we'll make a decision in terms of what we're going to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And then, um, I can get you that information, you know, if we decide to go that route.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, okay, and why don't we, I don't know if I have another appointment with him or with your mom -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, I think the last time you -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We were going to just split -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You didn't, yeah, we were going to do it, make an appointment after this appointment.  My mom, you had indicated that it wasn't necessary for -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You to see her this time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For a while, yeah, [DATE], yeah, this is the last appointment.  Um, my, I mean we can make something, an appointment now or maybe it would be better, with the assumption that he's going to go up there, and then we can make something when he's finishing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think that probably makes sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, in terms of changing the meds, maybe we, I mean if he's going to go up, we probably shouldn't.  If it's going to be delayed or something, we could, you know -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can call in the meds or he can restart.  I would taper the Effexor and then start the Nortriptyline at a low dose and see how we do with that but I think the situation just at home must be making him really depressed, so, all right, well I hope, that's my recommendation, that you go up there because things are not going to magically just change and then I really think it's time to, to look, during this time, is to look at the assisted living and maybe just bit the bullet and just do it while you can, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know, I was thinking the same thing that you were, in terms of, you know, looking at it like, um, where people go away for the winter for like a 3 month period of time -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Let's just see how it works and if it absolutely isn't working -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Then going back home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, I also received, this is just a general question because I know you're not going to be able to answer it, um, I just got a statement -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> For -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah and it just shows a balance forward of 135 and I see if I call this number -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because between the Medicare, as well as the health insurance that I've had, we've not had to pay anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just call her and -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> They should be -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, that's [NAME OTHER], she's really nice, she should be able to sort it all out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Very good, I figured that probably was it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'll help you with this dad, you get up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 5; Fifth Interview.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I met this — there's this girl that was up here before me, she was beaming (chucking). And I said, "Wow!"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you know she was up here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She said, "Oh, are you going up to see James?" I said, "Yeah." She goes — so I said, "Oh, yeah. How did you know?" She says, "Oh, I'm [third Sunday nights] (ph) that he, he had someone waiting." So I — she said, "He's always a great guy (chuckling)." And she was really up (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was nice. There must be some rewards in this field (ph) (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what's new (chuckling)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not too much. What's — how about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's nothing much, nothing new.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that kind of make you feel bad, like there she was beaming, and you don't come out of here beaming or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No? [inaudible] [0:01:00.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No (chuckling), it really didn't. I thought wow, no, it's great, you know. I thought I was happy for her (chuckling), she was just all beaming and everything, and I thought wow, that's nice. No, I'm not kidding you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [That's good news] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why, you don't feel like you making me beam or something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it doesn't happen that often.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean that you get, you know with a thing being so immediate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I see. M-hmm, yeah, that's true, I imagine it doesn't (chuckling). You have to work at it for, quite hard. I don't know, and that's you know like in my line of work, too, there aren't too many substantial or tangible things that you can see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things you can see right then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, that you can place your finger on and say "wow, that fit in there".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're sitting around and forcing you to have something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something to you know give you a little push and say "okay, that's great".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but that was nice you know. Of course, even sometimes a simple thank you is kind of nice you know, that just suffices. [0:01:59.2]</p>

<p>But anyway (chuckling), so what's new (chuckling)? I don't know. I had a weird experience yesterday, last night I should say (chuckling), which was, I don't know, it was really you know — at any rate, um, you know remember I, and I told you about this, uh, this guy you know who I had, you know had slept with and all this stuff, and I hadn't seen him for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the one you've had a [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...kind of [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm. I haven't you know, like, like I said, he called up and I was like really surprised to hear from him you know. And at any rate, uh, then he calls up and we're talking and all this stuff, because he was wanting to come over and all this stuff you know. So (chuckling), um, I said, "Well I don't know." And he's, "Oh, come on over" you know. So well and anyway he didn't have to twist my arm (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I did go, I went over there you know. And we were sitting around having a couple of drinks and then you know, and all the sudden he — I heard (ph) — did you ever hear of poppers before? They're, I don't know, it's, it's some kind of thing that gets you high in a sniffle. [0:03:15.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what it is, he called them poppers or something. Some kind of a thing that gets you high. And he says, "Oh, do you want to?" And I said, "No." And he goes, "Oh, you know it's like, it's really great" and all this stuff. And I said, "Forget it you know." And he says, "Oh, you know it just, just lifts you, you know and it's fantastic, you know especially while you're having sex" and all this. And I said, "You know, like, no (chuckling)." And so it turned out ultimately that you know he tried to force it upon me you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like physically force you to [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...inhale it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said, "You fool (chuckling)!" So and you, you know he's twisting my arm, you know and physically forcing it upon me. And I just said, uh, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I, you know like (chuckling) my attitude's, well I was getting scared you know because [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...— and oh, in the meantime he said, "Well do you mind if I?" And I said, "Well you know go right ahead that's your business, you know if you want to that's fine." I said, "You know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And you really don't] (ph). [0:04:06.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: "...it's just not for me." And he said, "Okay." So I mean and in the meantime he's, I guess he must have been getting higher and higher or something like that you know. And as he's getting — and obviously, I mean he starts, you know he's physically forcing this upon me. And so I (chuckling), I don't know what made me think of it or why I said it, maybe I was — I said, "I'm getting sick (chuckling)." I said, "I'm sick to my stomach." And he stops you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you were?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he did, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, were you sick to your stomach?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No (chuckling)! I wasn't you know, but I said, "I'm getting sick to my stomach." And he stops (chuckling)! You know I guess nobody wants to see him (ph) throw up all over anybody or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he said, he stops and says, "Oh, is that your excuse?" I said, "No, I'm getting sick to my stomach (chuckling)!" I said, "You'd better let me up because I'm getting sick you know (chuckling)." So he did and I left (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he was really just trying? [0:04:54.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just you know, just you know really just pinning me down and trying to force me to take this stuff. And for you know like, it was like you know I could smell it you know, but like I wasn't smelling it. You know and you have to put it up to your nose like, I guess. And I was — and so I left. And he says, "Oh," you know he's, he said something like, "Oh, I'm sorry." And I said, "Well you know that (chuckling) I'm sorry, too." I said, "You know if that's the game you want to play, you know I'll leave. Goodbye (chuckling)."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So but then I was kind of glad afterwards, because then I'd, I'll never see him you know again now [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds like, is it part of like, you'll never see him and it's kind of like you won't feel tempted?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, I won't be all tempted to see him either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, kind of like you at first didn't want to know this man.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then kind of that he persuaded you somehow (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess you were kind of feeling bad about being persuaded?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was! You know and I though to myself, oh God (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean that you wanted to have sex with him and I'm going to feel probably awful afterwards?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right (chuckling), right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it just didn't happen that way because [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...of what you were doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was kind of, it was, it really worked out kind of well afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:05:57.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I thought to myself, you know I should've thanked that man (chuckling). I really [overlapping voices] [0:06:01.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thanked him for forcing it on, and trying to force it on you [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because you probably wouldn't have liked it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then here you'd probably be sitting today feeling awful about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, I would've, I really would've you know. And I thought this, that I really should've thanked him, you know and said, "You know, really, thank you (chuckling), you just kind of straightened out the whole thing." But like I said, you know I haven't talked to him in months. You know and I was really surprised that he called, you know and I was really kind of floored that he did call. But let's say, you know I did find that like kind of sad. Afterwards I thought, you know it's kind of sad that he's you know dependent upon this, whatever it is, you know to really you know give him this high or whatever you want to call it. But it was an interesting experience, experience [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I mean nothing else (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What else is new?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, nothing much. Been into a thing, I went to a wedding or I went to a wedding with, um, this girl that used to live across the street. Tanya was pissed; I'm sure she was you know that I you know. [0:07:01.4]</p>

<p>Well she'd, you know like I have known her for really a long time. And she was going to this wedding for this, um, some girl at work was getting married you know. And I had, I knew the guy from high school. I didn't know him that well but I knew or knew of him, you know we, we'd know one another to say hello. And I knew him, he was you know the guy who this girl was marrying. And anyway, you know she invited me to go and I said, "Yes". You know and so, uh, anyway and I went. It was kind of a lousy wedding.</p>

<p>But afterwards it surprised me, well I, you know we had been drinking all night and it was about two or three o'clock (chuckling) in the morning you know. And like and she's like, you know like the, in fact I said, it was even, it was [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, you went to the wedding with the girl across the street? [inaudible at 0:07:41.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, who used to live across the street you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, but it wasn't her wedding?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't her wedding.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like it was a friend of hers who got married. But I said, I mean it surprised me, I says, "Oh, Marge I'm going to you know walk you up to the door and we'll do the whole bit." And I says, "Well at least you know, how about a kiss goodnight you know?" And Marge says, "Okay" you know, and I found myself getting aggressive and, uh, yeah, that's when she walked inside (chuckling). [0:08:03.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it really didn't, you know it didn't upset me, you know to be shut down, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know. And I thought, well you know, okay, Marge, you know (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, kind of like you got a kick out of the whole thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right (chuckling). It was a kind of a gas really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's good. I mean this didn't really, it must have made you feel good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It did, it was, it was funny, you know it really was you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, even though you could, you know get aggressive, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you could do that, and even the fact that she didn't want to be aggressed [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, she didn't (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...didn't, you know it wasn't so upsetting to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it wasn't you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wasn't like a rejection.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. But and you know a couple of hours, of course, it was a, a girl that I've known you know frankly all my life, you know and it was kind of, it was funny that, you know I, that I would be standing there with her you know, you know after growing up with her (chuckling) practically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I know] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that was, that was interesting, too (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. [Have you been seeing Sheila] (ph)? [0:08:55.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh, when did I see Tanya? Oh, I saw her Monday night. And, oh, I saw her Friday night, too. Nothing you know really spectacular you know. Um, Friday night it was — right, yeah, Friday it was kind of a drag, everyone was tired you know, I mean after working all week. Yeah, and she was falling asleep so there wasn't much there. Monday night we went to a, um, a music thing we had, [and that really] (ph) it was nice you know and we met one another there you know and that was about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know nothing has you know developed (chuckling) since then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You haven't at all talked to her about [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...any of that stuff?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I haven't talked to her you know about anything usually you know. Well Friday night we weren't alone, you know we were out with a couple of, a few other people. And then you know Monday we just sat there and listened to this music, so there really, there wasn't really much of an opportunity to talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, it was kind of like that kind of, Tanya kind of feels kind of you're just marking time or something like that? [0:09:52.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't, I don't know. She's a strange person, she really is (chuckling). She's really strange (chuckling). Like if you met her you'd probably dislike her right off the bat. You know like there would be no doubt in your mind, I mean who the, who the hell is this you know (chuckling)? And most people feel that way, you know they're just you know, "Who the hell is this (chuckling)?" She has an, an arrogant air about her, you know at first. You know but after a while you know it kind of cools off. But it's kind of bad, you know I guess. You know like when, um, I, I often — with my family and with friends you know, and if she, you know like she has this arrogant air, and they get the impression you know like she's really a bitch you know. And I don't want them to get this impression (chuckling), you know that I would be, be associating with a bitch or something like this you know. And you know they get — I'm sure you know, most people that do, you know they get this thing and you know who, "you know who's this bitch" you know. And that's you know the way they feel about her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They don't even know her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. And she's got a quick tongue (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she doesn't, she isn't afraid to say to anybody anything you know, which is that she has no tact at all (chuckling), [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...none at all. [0:11:03.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: While we were at a, well we were at a wedding and some, I, something — I had a cigarette in my hand and I don't know if I burned somebody with it or something like this, and this woman was standing, you know this ex-nun, and she's standing there and, uh, she goes "oh, do it again" you know or something like this. Or maybe I burned Tanya, I don't know. And Tanya turns around and say, "Fuck you" (chuckling) you know and I thought, oh Christ (chuckling)! Oh, I thought, oh no, right off here in the middle of the floor it's going to happen, you know (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It didn't that I remember (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you, and like you say like not much is going to happen with her, I mean [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-mm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...do you want this, I mean how do you, what are your feelings there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I don't know. I want, you know I want but I'm af- you know like, um, even talking about anything, you know like — well after, well Friday you know where there's, after you know we, we were you know driving home and stuff like that, we were alone you know and I you know I, there was kind of a lull in the conversation and stuff like that, and I felt like bringing up something you know, like the questions and all this stuff. [0:12:13.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I thought, you know I felt like bringing all this stuff up you know. And then I thought, well I don't know. Like I said, who am I to you know bring up any question like that you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it that it didn't quite feel right for where, you know the timing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not like you were [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you were driving home and there was kind of, there was a lull, but [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...there was a real feeling of closeness then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because kind of something like that feels maybe more right when there's [a lull] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean do you think, does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it does, it does. You know it was just, you know like I said, you know it was Friday and we had been out and it was, everybody was tired and (chuckling) it was kind of a lull really. I don't know, and you know like sometimes I really want to see her you know, and other times you know and I just, I don't want to see her (chuckling) you know. It's just, I don't know if you can (chuckling) — and it's just that sometimes, like I said, you know I really want to see you know, and then other times you know, oh hell, I don't even want to be bothered (chuckling). [0:13:06.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just it's kind of we- — I don't know. And then I think to myself, well if you're, if you're really, you know (chuckling) and then I thought just, if you're really in love with a person you want to be (hitting desk for emphasis) with them every moment of the day, you know (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I could never you know, like no way (chuckling) that you know I would want to be with Tanya every moment of the day you know. Maybe that's just a fallacy, too, supposed to be the American way (chuckling) and nothing else, but interesting (chuckling). I've nothing else to say (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean there's nothing else going on with you? [0:14:00.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, there's nothing else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't, you haven't been feeling much of anything or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look kind of down though you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You think so (chuckling)? I'm tired, it's been a rough day at work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you kind of look like it's like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (ph), I did and now I went up to Connor's and had a drink (chuckling) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...before I came here you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because I was just kind of sensing, you had this kind of look though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel like talking about much, you don't feel like doing much today and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I think you feel like going to sleep or sitting and watching television.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doing the kind, like I have a sense like you don't feel like you're kind of [you're over] exerted (other chuckling).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's I sleep too much and, no, I don't. I know I can sleep an awful lot you know when I, and I force myself to stay awake you know, which is really kind of lousy. I shouldn't and you know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you force yourself to stay awake? [0:14:50.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um, because I'm, I think I'm wasting time. You know (chuckling) I could be doing so many other things and there's so many other things to be done you know. And I really should you know, you know like in, ah, for a while I got in the habit of you know coming home and you know lying down for an hour, an hour and a half, you know and sleeping and I really feel great afterward but, and then going to bed at night, of course, was a very, it was a sleep but it was a very restless sleep. And so I'd just, and I'd keep, you know force myself to, to stay awake until it's time to go to bed so I wouldn't be [inaudible at 0:15:24.5] I woke up a couple of, oh, the week before last or something like that I had gone to bed, and when I took a nap and then gone to bed that night and I woke up and I had bruises all over my arm. I said, what the hell is this! You know, I don't know. And I thought well you know this has got to stop (chuckling). So I don't — I could you know very easily, but I'd, I'm trying not to (chuckling), which is much better though. You know you just, you really don't need that much sleep, and you can you know more or less gear your body towards you know a good seven or eight hours is fine, it should be adequate enough (chuckling). [0:16:03.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so consciously (ph) you're not kind of feeling like much into anything?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No (chuckling), no. Like I said, just kind of you know like at this time of the year it's getting kind of down on all this with teaching and stuff you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of meaning you've got it [figured out] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, (chuckling) I'm ready to quit, hang it up. You know like at the beginning of the year you're all gung-ho [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of excited, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and exuberant and excited and really getting started and all this stuff, and the kids are the same way and, but you know like there's only six weeks left (chuckling) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kind of like a shoring (ph) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...task to get through though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Getting there, you know what I mean, and everybody [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like when you were a kid in school, only six more weeks left, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right (chuckling), [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...right, you're done with it. That's the same thing with all the teachers though, you know we all feel the same. And it's like you know, like during the beginning of the year everybody's arriving you know 15 minutes early to get all their work done or something like this, at the end of it nobody gets there on time anymore (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:17:00.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like everybody's just down, down, but it'll be over soon (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then what will you do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um, yeah, what do I do (chuckling)? I really don't have a job and I don't know if I'm real interested in finding one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean a job for the summer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And you know like it's, like for the last two years I never worked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what did you do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I went and lied on the beach all day, it was fantastic (chuckling). But it was really nice you know and I wasn't, I read a lot you know and I wasn't bored you know. And then I, you know I took off to California and you know to, spent about three weeks on a trip, three or four weeks on a trip, and then lied on the beach in New York for the rest of the time. After a while it did get, you know to the point where I, you know I had to get away, so then I'd just take off you know. And so it's kind of nice, I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And just kind of finding somewhere relaxing [is a habit] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm. And just you know at night you go around you know, go places and see people you haven't seen in a long time and stuff like that (chuckling). [0:18:03.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to wake up early in the morning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right (chuckling). Yeah, right, you just come out with a fantastic tan (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're kind of thinking that's what you'll do for this summer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably, probably. There's, um, this teacher who is the, is a principal now who I know, she's looking for people you know to work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean teach summer school?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, which is really surprising because there really aren't that many jobs. But, um, and I have thought about it, but I'd, I'd really enjoy just teaching one month and then going away for another because I can suffice with one month of rest and relaxation, but they don't work it that way, you teach [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...both months or you don't teach at all, so. And I, you know like you, after you teach all summer you just kind of hate to and you don't, you know like in you're like then September you're back doing the same thing [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know and it's, really it gets to be kind of a drag, and there isn't any, there isn't any you know spark to go back (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:19:00.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's a nice way of life, very poor but (chuckling), you need to cut corners but it's worth it (chuckling). Mm, what's that building they're building next door? I mean you know not just [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's called the International Studies Building.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [I know] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It'll have departments that you know study other nations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, well that could be nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are they going to take over this building?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, this building, it just connects through this building.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I see, I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Hey, stuff can add up] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are they going, they're going to stop this program in June?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At the end of June, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why, they have no money?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, there's not enough money to, to fund this place as it's very expensive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's kind of lousy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of just been a shortage of government funds you know which [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...usually runs a lot of the university.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm. So it'll just be devoted to class study, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, class study in [inaudible] [overlapping voices] [0:20:08.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know whatever [inaudible]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's kind of sad. Now where will people go (chuckling), to a professional psychiatrist? Now you're a professional aren't you, you've done it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I've done it for a couple of years here, but I won't have my Ph.D. until the end of the summer though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you're writing your [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right (other chuckling). So I don't know when you're called a professional [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's professional (chuckling), paper doesn't mean anything to me (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Maybe it is you know] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's a formality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a ritual.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really. It's kind of sad. And so many, I mean you know I know a number of people who are just, all they have to do is write a paper you know and they're finished (chuckling), but they just can't. You know they're just, I don't know what it is, they just can't get started or they start it and they can't get through or [overlapping voices] [0:21:04.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know they're in the midst of and they're really having a hell of a time and it's sad (chuckling). Ph.D.'s about paper (chuckling). Well I think it, yeah, it's a farce. I'm trying to think of something, I don't even know what else to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kind of sense like you really feel like a blank today (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that you know I really don't know what else to tell you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sometimes you know people feel that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Especially when you're down, just kind of [feeling it] (ph) to end.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh (chuckling), really, really (chuckling). When we're talking about you know, um, to walk down the street you know, and like a number of teachers that I with are you know left on the soft (ph), and they say you know it's so, they're so, it's so cold you know, I mean you know the people within the northern (ph), coming up north you know and you know making, you know walking down the street and saying, "Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello, how are you?" You know and some of these people looking at you as if you're really strange.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's just like, there isn't that here for you? [0:22:03.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's not here. I said that it's really kind of funny to do. Actually as I'd, I did it one morning. And you know I was just walking down the street and saying, "Hello. Hello." And all these people just kind of stand back and [stare at you like this] (ph) (chuckling). But this one that I, this one woman was walking out of the building, you know she was a very elderly person, I said, "Good morning, how are you?" She says, "Fine, how are you?" And I thought well really that's kind of nice (chuckling) you know. It was really kind of nice (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well and kind of like that to be acting friendly and being responded was nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, being responded to. But like the thing is that I made it a point, like if they didn't, you know I thought to myself, you know a lot of people are just going to say, you know they're just going to ignore you or give you some queer look or something like that you know. But it's, and you have to get to the point where it's not going to bother you, or at least me you know. If they're going to be insulted or ignore you or something like that you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, it's kind of like you can look at it like it's their loss or something, if [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...they're going to be so cold.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, it's, it's, it's funny though, it really is (chuckling). But that's why I think a lot of people, they're afraid you know, afraid of other people and [overlapping voices] [0:23:06.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, well they kind of lose (ph), kind of initiating (ph) themselves [inaudible]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm. It just it's such a [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, in view of people, like that they're not going to be nice to you, so you know when they are that they don't know how to react.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, that's the argument. They don't, you know like they're very, they live in fear and they're very [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...afraid of what you know people might do and stuff like. And, of course, they were saying like, some of the women were saying like "if you went down the street and said hello to everyone you saw, I mean" she said, "You know you'd be running down the street before you knew it because there would be you know some, some guy chasing (chuckling) you down the street you know. You know he'd probably think that you were some kind of a prostitute or something you know walking down the street, just because you said hello. You know so it's kind of difficult (chuckling) to have (ph) them." I said, "Yeah, I guess I can see your point (chuckling)." But you know I, I found that it's kind of, it's kind of a gas to do (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. [0:24:00.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even when like if someone's there waiting on you or something like that, you know they'll say, "May I help you?" And just to say hello, you know they'll stand up and they'll say "oh, hi" you know (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's just kind of different courtesies and niceties that just really aren't a part of life for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh-uh, they're not. They're just you know like everyone's just [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like being a person instead of being a machine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, m-hmm. And no one would, you know like sitting on the bus or a train or something like that, or sitting next to one, no one will ever speak to one another.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know they're just, no one says anything to one another. I think it's really kind of sad you know that so every, everybody maintains their distance or lives within their little shell and that's it (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. And kind of like you'd give a lot to be living in a place where people [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...really could respond to each other. And you may get like wait, if you're shy, it's okay, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but if just people would be friendly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm. You know they'd say "hello" and I'd say "oh, hello, how are you" you know (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like there wouldn't be barriers and walls erected (ph) [overlapping voices] [0:24:57.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, m-hmm, that's the truth, that is, really (chuckling). I think everybody would get along much better anyway. I mean just to, if you, if you strike up a 2-minute conversation you have, you've left with more than you came with you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, yeah, it's just kind of a nice thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know and just at least you know you met this person, you know and you may talk about the weather or something like that, but you know it's really, it's a lot nicer than just sitting there and saying nothing to anybody, but a little (chuckling) psychology (chuckling). And it's like also about maintaining your cool you know. If you ever see, if a person who comes up to you is really mad or excited or you know really, and just you know kind of sit there and agree with them and, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and be very calm and cool and just put them down right then and there (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of a different thing, it's not to be in response to the person but to be a cool person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, m-hmm, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not to have any kind of really nice mood but just because you have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm (chuckling), and they go away feeling much better anyway (chuckling). You know they're just, you know they feel, well that wasn't so bad (chuckling). [0:26:06.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You just meet, you know just go along with them you know and just maintain your cool and never get excited, which is, I find it difficult at times. Of course I imagine everybody does (chuckling). Interesting study though (chuckling), like so many others (chuckling). Write your paper on it (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of really feel blank?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, really, nothing to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you know I mean if, you know it's okay to say nothing or it's okay, like if you feel like you know you just really don't feel like telling me anything important then that's okay, too, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know (chuckling), don't think I have. [0:27:02.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You and those kinds of things sometimes happen [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you know I realize that this, just they're not into anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm reading (ph) like just nothing happened and you're not feeling very much of anything presently that, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know sometimes people sit, sometimes people read (ph) (other chuckling). So whatever you think, if you want to sit and see if anything comes to you, that's fine. If you want to go, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's you know a waste of time (chuckling). I just really, you know and I just you know like I've thought to myself you know about my whole problems and everything else and it's really, it's kind of nice, I've been being able to rationalize much better now [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...lately you know. And you know like it's getting to the, to the point where I'm understanding myself, all right, it's either you do it or nothing is going to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, kind of like saying, coming to the point of realizing now it's my problems [overlapping voices] [0:27:57.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...our (ph) problem, and I guess specifically you're talking about sex?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, that, yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's my problem and you know it's I'm the one who's going to do something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if I want to do something, then I should do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. You know it's just [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it doesn't get solved just by sitting and doing nothing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, m-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've done that too long already.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the truth (chuckling), that's the truth really, really (chuckling). But I've, you know I've really, I've thought about it you know. But like I said, you know like I've, you know I — I don't know, I've just felt different about the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I know] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know there's just a different feeling about the whole thing. You know like and I'm, maybe I am less afraid of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's I'm less afraid of [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I get a sense that, just from the first time I saw you that you were far more afraid of the [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...of you know having sex with younger women. It's kind of like I kind of sense you, it's still scary but just kind of feels more like down the road ahead of you [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you'll get there. [0:28:59.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. I mean you know I can see it, it's there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, there in the realm of possibilities.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, it's there, you know which is a lot better (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, it's a whole different story (other chuckling).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really (chuckling), [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it's a lot better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you know I think it can happen and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's kind of a faith in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, that's true. But, of course, believing and doing something about it is a different story, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess that's what you're saying is like, well I feel pretty good about it and I realize I can do something [regarding it] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, but doing something about it (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But how do I do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess in a way just kissing that girl good night was, had just a little flavor of, I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's — it did, it really did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It really did you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's kind of like, I can take this step you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right. And that you know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I think being] (ph) just a sexual person, be aggressive [with it] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, right. You know and not being shot down (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was, yeah, it did, it was you know, it was kind of nice (chuckling). But, yeah, that's a, I just, you know like I said, I, I know now and just to do something about it (chuckling). [0:30:02.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you, how do you think, I mean this way of doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I don't know, becoming more aggressive, you know that's the only thing, that's what I have to do, you know I have to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which with respect to Tanya?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And you know at this point, yes, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or maybe later in [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...respect to every other woman you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's kind of like it doesn't feel impossible to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not at all (chuckling), not at all. But, like I said, just to do (chuckling), that will be interesting. You know like, but you know like I'm not, like I'm, there's kind of an anticipation about it now, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like the even looking forward to it, you know this, there's not a thing, you know like I don't want to sort of fit (ph) you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like I want to and I'm looking forward [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...to an exciting time, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and I know it's going to come and I [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...ready (ph) for it. [0:30:59.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, you know. But it's just I don't know if you know like — and then you then I thought to myself, you know I don't want to, it's kind of like going about a way of being aggressive, you don't want to be pushy (chuckling) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to come on like a steamroller?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't want to do that, you know you don't want to be pushy or anything like that, and that's you know a thing that I thought about, too, you know. And it's even like, like last Friday, like I said, just seeing Tanya [in on] (ph). You know I, I noticed that she was tired and everything else like that. You know and I thought, well, and like I said, you know I thought you know we could discuss things or do, you know make love or something like that you know. But I thought you know I didn't want to be pushy you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't the [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...the best time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...appropriate time, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't really at that time (chuckling). But I did think about it (chuckling) you know but, just not nice. I don't know if I'd, of course then, I didn't, then I thought to myself, I, you know I wasn't, I, and like when I kissed that girl, I had been drinking. I thought, you know was that it? You know or like just because I had been drinking this liquid courage or something like that you know. [0:32:14.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now was it that, do it to me, now (ph), or [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...is it something real inside of me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right (chuckling). That you know was a question in my mind, too (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I know] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know that it was or not. Of course I've found that, I mean like in a lot of, in a lot of people you know have talked and you find them being, most people are more aggressive after they've had been drinking, and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they're less inhibited?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, they you know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's why a lot of people you know have a drink, why it's a social, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know it's a social relaxer in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So many people are just, become very uninhibited.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right (other chuckling).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can understand it you know. And if it's, and it's really and in a way it's kind of beneficial and to that, and to that point you know. [0:33:09.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you kind of seem a little unsure about recognizing that it does have benefits?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's not that but it's supposed to be evil or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right (chuckling). Because you know it's kind of beneficial in that, but it's sad in another way you know like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sad that people just can't live [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...openly without it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. You know and to feel they can't express themselves or be the, be what they want to be without it you know. But, of course, I've found myself, you know like I said, I don't know if you know I kissed that girl because I had been drinking you know and become less inhibited, or if I would kiss her if it were under any different circumstances, that we were not at a wedding and drinking and stuff like that. I don't know, well at any rate it's better than nothing (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know you were kind of like wondering if it was because you were drinking or if it's you in a, well lead the way. It's not you know [overlapping voices] [0:34:00.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...if it's the drinking helped, it still comes from somewhere (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right, too, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's there inside you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, that's it (chuckling). Well I guess I had [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you may be inhibiting it, it works (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know a lot of the times when it's there to be tapped [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you want tap it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm (chuckling). Because I've found that even, um, sex isn't, can be, can un-inhibit people. You know like you'd, you'd say a lot more you know, like even talking with, you know while making love with Tanya and talking with her, you know like a lot, a lot was said within that short time, a hell of a lot more than you like just sitting you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like the physical closeness makes you feel and lets you say intimate things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. You know it's really, it's a very strange feeling. You know like a lot of, you know the things that are said you know and the questions that are asked and stuff like that. [0:35:00.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And did you like it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I did, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it was kind of good to feel like you had [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is, it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...closeness, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was a good feeling. And I found that you know was, it was interesting (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah. Kind of swing (ph), even though you were together that way, kind of saying things that you just don't when you just hang around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, m-hmm, m-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like the relationship on a whole different level, in a way, that you're much more intimate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was (chuckling), it really was. Um, it's a hot night. What else happened (chuckling)? My sister announced that she was pregnant again (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was nice. It turned out that she said she went, she went to the doctor and the doctor says, "Oh, what do you want a girl or a boy?" And she goes, "Well it doesn't really matter." And she said, "I'm prepared for a girl." And you know she has a little girl now and you know she goes, "Yeah, it would kind of you know be nice economically," said "but if you had a boy you could quit (chuckling)." [0:36:05.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could quit?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Having children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm, and I said, "Right (chuckling)."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But and I said, "Well did you ask how many children he has?" And she goes, "No (chuckling)." Well it's interesting, it's interesting, my younger sister came home for the day. She's madly in love with an art student [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know. And that's that you know and there's a, it's a weird kind of relationship that I have with her, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How old is she?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's, um, she'll be 20 next month you know. And like, um, when my brother was in the service and my sister had married, and it was just her and I who were home you know. And she was like the [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The youngest at home?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, my younger sister and I. And it was you know she was going through high school you know and all these big changes in her life and [overlapping voices] [0:36:54.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...big problems and all this stuff you know. And you know there was a lot of things that you know she told me you know and all this stuff. And you know I sensed you know my mom really gets kind of uptight about the whole thing, because she won't come running to mother you know and she just you know and all this stuff. Even when I said you know and, as we were sitting around after my sister left and I said, "Oh, Debbie's got a new bow, you know she's madly in love." And my mother says "oh" you know (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she says, "You know" [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably the kind of upset that she comes to her brother instead of her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, she was, I mean she was really kind of, I thought. But you know I told her one time I said, "You know it's just this, I don't know" I said "I don't know why or you know" and I says "but at least she comes to somebody you know".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, it's kind of, it's you know look, it may not be satisfying for her but [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's nice that she's sharing that with someone in the family.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it kind of probably feels good for you [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It does, it really does. You know it's nice you know, but you know I just didn't, didn't want (chuckling) to say to my mother you know that you know. But and I think it's kind of a different, it's a different situation. You know my mother was a, is the one you know, like she was the one and she's, was the one who would lay down the law and things like this. She was the one who said "you know you don't do this, you don't do that" you know, and you just [overlapping voices] [0:38:07.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, but you don't come to her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...come to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know you just don't come to her you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She might lay down a law, and what is she coming to her with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right (chuckling), right, that's it, that's it, too. You know wherever I was, she more or less just sit there and listen and that's about the size of it you know, so but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're kind of close with your younger sister?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was, yeah, I'm really kind of close with her. I was, I was much closer with my older sister when I was younger, but as I got older I was much closer, and much closer with my older sister while I was younger. Now I'm closer with my youngest sister you know. And we don't, I don't see her that often you know, being away at school and all that stuff, but, uh [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is she away at school?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. She goes to nursing, nursing school, you know and she'll be out in a year. But, uh, she's wild, completely different than me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, and how?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's another thing that, that kind of breaks us up within the family, our views about things. [0:39:04.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, my oldest sister is only two and a half years older than I am but she's very conservative you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Like how] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just you know like pro-establishment and all this stuff you know and stuff like that. And my brother is the same way and he's younger than I am. You know but he's getting, since he's gone away to school and since he's gotten out of the service he can't, you know leaning more towards the left every day (chuckling). But, um, and, of course, you know my youngest sister, you know so she was brought up within the era you know. Oh, she was in high school during all of the big hassles around the city and the big hassles around the country and everything else you know. She was, I mean just there you know and discussing it in high school and stuff like that you know. [0:39:56.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was really kind of [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So kind of whereas it hit, it's hitting your younger brother later.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it hit her really young. That's very true of high school kids these days.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, it is. It was, you know at that point, you know she was really in it. And I in, you know kind of in college and out of college at that point, you know and then I was in it, too. And, uh, but he was more, he was in the service and stuff like that you know and he was just kind of out of it. And, of course, I [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He was in something else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. He was in something. Yeah, he was in Vietnam, he was there (chuckling)! And you know he was you know really you know, oh, he was kind of gung-ho at first you know and all this stuff. He'd learn though (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It didn't take him long, it really didn't. And my sister, my brother-in-law's, he's a, you know he works every day as a, like a welder or something like that you know. It's a good job you know but it's completely out of the realm of what we do you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it's kind of like the, like you feel really like a sense that you are quite bit distant from your older sister [overlapping voices] [0:41:05.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...just in the way of life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, you know and she lives out in suburbia and has children and it's a very different like. Oh, her and my brother-in-law, I mean you know they, they still hang around with people you know who are, who they met in grammar school and stuff like this you know, and you know that they never leave their people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They never change, [really don't even know] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Never change at all, you know the same stuff. And I'm not really knocking it, you know if that's what they want to do, fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like in a sense you're not knocking it. If it's okay for them then [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...so you can accept it for them but it's not, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Gosh!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...not the way you'd want to live.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really, that's the truth in fact (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kind of like, I guess when you're saying your youngest sister, like she's kind of wild or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. She's, she's very exuberant, and she never sits down. You know just the minute she comes into the house you know it's like you know the whole place just picks up, you know she's there. You know and it's, it's really kind of nice, it really is you know. [0:42:04.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, she's brought a lot to you, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just a lot of life you know and she's [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[by that, diamonds] (ph) you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. She never, never sits down or anything you know, she's always completely on the go you know. And she's very uninhibited you know about whatever she does, I mean she does it (chuckling), which is kind of nice, too (chuckling), [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...really kind of nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I remember you saying like you'd like to be less inhibited.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would, I really would you know. And so I, I, um, I've, I've done a lot of goofy things you know and, uh, but, and there are points you know like your, you get kind of embarrassed. You know like if you (chuckling), if somebody's with you and does a goofy thing you know you're really like the teaching at the school, Katie, Tanya's best friend you know, a really good friend of mine, she student taught at the school and she says, "Well Christ, you know you actually walk around this building as if you didn't even know me you know." And I did! And I told her, I said, "I feel that I really do Katie" and I says "I'm sorry but I don't know why you know." And she says, "You know you" she's "why are you so goddamn pompous you know?" And, and you know, and what did she say, it wasn't, there's a word she used, I don't know whether it's professional or something, I don't know what it was. And you know she, she, she [overlapping voices] [0:43:24.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Someone who doesn't do goofy things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, someone who doesn't do goofy things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what it was you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why, you know it was like as if I were embarrassed to have Katie there you know like, because Katie does a hell of a lot of goofy things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean really asinine (chuckling) things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, kind of like when you're in your working day?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's my working day you know and I'm a different person there [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know. You know a different person there you know and she, oh, she just does the crazies things you know. But, no, the last time, oh, she came down here to visit and she's, "Well this is you know" she says "I can't take anymore of this crap here." So that she's, she was chasing me around this, around the school, and now picture this (chuckling), chasing me around the school and trying to goose me you know. And I said, "For Christ sake Katie let me alone (chuckling)!" I said, "There are going to be children in this building." "I don't care (chuckling)." And [overlapping voices] [0:44:17.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She could just [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...go right out and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...she's the type that walks in with, um, you know like there is a certain type of dress you're supposed to always be in you know when you're in the school, and she walks in and she's looking like shit you know, really looking bad. And you know, oh, just really looking bad you know and just, oh, Christ you know. And then you think, and then the first thing that pops in your mind is, okay, what are the other teachers going to think? You know this is a friend of mine you know and the way she looks. And it really infuriates me that I feel that I, you know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're a, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that I'm embarrassed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's a reflection on you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd like just to, you know kind of like you really are concerned about what they think about you, and they might think bad of you because you're friendly with her. [0:45:00.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I, and if, yeah, right, this is it. And the thing is I really like the people that I work with you know. You know a few of the people at work and they're really close friends, and I'd you know, and then I'm thinking, and then I think, well you know I should just say hell with them, you know this is another friend of mine you know and really a good friend. And I should just say, well if you don't like it, fuck it, I don't care, you know but I can't you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you'd really like to just kind of, you know what you're feeling and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and not be so concerned about what other people think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh. And even, well Katie's got a big mouth and you know she, oh, she can be sitting around at the, at you know in the lounge or something and she'd start up with these stories and [inaudible at 0:45:43.0] to her, "Shut your mouth!"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you wanted to have the ground swallow you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right (chuckling), you know just shut up you know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And really, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...about these things that we had [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...kind of like, you're really going embarrassed me here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, embarrassed you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you can do them and really have a good time doing them but then you [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...can't feel like you can really own up to them [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh (chuckling)!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in the eyes of other people because you're not sure. You know you like them, [overlapping voices] [0:46:01.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but what are [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but what are they going to think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...they going to think, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you kind of feel inhibited.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, that's a bit true because you know there's a lot of crazy things and I just think, oh, you know just shut up (chuckling)! And she'll just keep right on going you know, and I think, oh, you didn't you know and then, oh, Christ (chuckling). Yeah, and just done some really crazy things you know, crazy things. And she used to threaten me you know, you know in having, she used to have photographs you know and says, "All right, if you don't treat me nice I'm going to bring the pictures around you know (chuckling)." And I'd say, "Okay, I'll treat you nice."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It frightened you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really (chuckling), but she's just you know more or less kidding.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well yeah, well okay, but really you can't help what other people think of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean and I guess what you're saying [it's over really soon] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's sad, it really is, and I shouldn't, I really shouldn't. You know just [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you could kind of just say "hey, I did this thing" and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...maybe not brag about this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know like if she's going around saying what you did, okay, you can just kind of be sitting there. [0:47:02.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, m-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like maybe you wouldn't want to boast about it or talk about it [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or anything else, it wouldn't be so, you know a bad thing if people heard what you do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it's hardly ever (chuckling) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you'd feel kind of good [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: They would think I was crazy, I mean really it's just. Well, oh, one, just one you know thing. I was coming back from Chicago one time and they all met me at the airport. And it was the first day of May and they had a, oh, what do they call it, um, you know a May Day or whatever, you know I don't know what it is. Anyway, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, a Maypole?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a Maypole, and they, you know they made a lei. I mean you know we're adults (chuckling)! And they made a lei out of bubblegum, you know and they're greeting me at the airport. And then they had this, they put a thing on this one girl's head and then they had the strings and they're doing this Maypole, now we're in the middle of the airport you know (chuckling), and I thought, oh, Christ! You know and it was, it was fun while we were doing it, it was really rather funny. [0:47:59.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you too were worried about what the people were thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And you know and if Jean comes, pops up and says all these strange things that we had done. And it was really, you know I just, you know I don't know why I should be. I really shouldn't be. I should just say [inaudible 0:48:11.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd really kind of like to be able to do things without [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...catching hell about it [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: M-hmm, m-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...from people for it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is that maybe, and I know that they, these people are the people who she's telling it, would never even think of doing these things you know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and they just wouldn't understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know what you mean. It's kind of that they might be more like your sister or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. You know they think "you know who is this ass" you know. You know and I just, you know and then, of course, I should just say, well if you think I'm an ass I don't care you know" but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then you can't quite say that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, I can't quite say that (chuckling).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well our time's about up.</p>

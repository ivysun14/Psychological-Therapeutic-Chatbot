<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] was just telling me that she has been treated for depression and has not, by another psychiatrist, and has not responded to that treatment.  Let's see, how long have you been depressed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's been, I've been seeing this doctor for about, since 2005.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and have you been seen as an outpatient, were you in the hospital?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> An outpatient.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Outpatient, okay.  What all have you had?  What kind of symptoms have you had?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Feeling very sad, no energy, I have a lot of anxiety, weak - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No interests.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to put that down between us because you have a very low, a very soft voice, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So no interests?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's sleep, how's sleep?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sleep is not good.  Um, I sleep and then I wake up during the night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How many times to wake up in a night?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Usually around two or three.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Two to three, okay.  Okay, any suicidal thoughts?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever tried suicide?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I've thought about it before though but not -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, okay, I was looking through this questionnaire and I was noticing, okay, you've got several, I was looking at, I see that your thoughts never, your brain never shuts off, is it going all the time?  Okay.  And you panic, your mind gets full of thoughts, you're distractible, you lose your train of thought, your brain starts going at night when you lay down, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It continually goes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  You get real anxious and you sort of lose control of what you're saying and doing, all right.  You have emotional numbing, so you can't feel exactly what you feel like.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you're easily startled?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you have sensory hypersensitivity at noises and smells and sounds, you get [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  You feel sad, no energy, you're irritated easily, you lose control of your temper, you have mood shifts which means you go from happy to sad in a real short period of time.  You're nervous without a reason and your hands and feet are cold.  They were not that cold today.  They're a little red but not too cold, okay. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They feel cold.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They feel cold.  You have night sweats, okay, and I see that you've, this is for the mood disorders questionnaire, you have three things there that you checked, one is that thoughts raced and she's highly distractible and has started a fight by being so mad.  All right.  I'm going to look at this because there's a history of things, of question in the family, mom, dad, sisters have all had depression.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And you've been depressed for how many years?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's been a long time, um -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I saw you some years ago didn't I?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> About nine, nine years ago?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Probably about nine years ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay, um, what diagnosis did I give you back then?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Bipolar.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It was bipolar, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not depressed, it's bipolar, I mean I'm not - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're wide open, you just - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He didn't, he told me I was just severely depressed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, but your mind races, you're irritable, you're anxious all the time, you can't sleep at night, I bet you have mood swings.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have ups and downs.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How long do they last?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not very long. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you rapid cycle, you'll be up for a couple of days and down a couple of days?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or up for a week and down for a week?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't last a week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't last a week, so it's a few days, all right, so you'll feel better then you feel worse, you'll feel better, what about, are you still having your periods?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Did you used to have PMS?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Never had that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay, um, that does it pretty much.  In looking at you, I see you have eye cracking signs which means as your eyes move, they don't move smoothly, they sort of duh, duh, dah, duh, dah, they sort of move in sort of a jerky movement.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What's that?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's eye tracking abnormalities, you can see it in some people with bipolar.  Ta dah, whatever that means, it just means that your nervous system doesn't flow right, okay.  All right, let's look at [INAUDIBLE].  You've been on a bunch of medicines I'm sure.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.   This is what I'm on right now, I mean this is what he gave me, I brought them with me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you get some improvement with it when you started out?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, these things, these are horrible, they don't make me, they put me to sleep but they don't keep me asleep and they make me feel groggy and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't like that feeling.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see what else you've got.  Okay, you're on Provigil too.  All right, so you're on Cymbalta 60, Diazepam one twice a day, Trazodone 100, one half to one at bedtime, okay, and Provigil 200 mg samples.  Has the Provigil done anything for you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It gives me, I mean it, it gives me a little bit of energy but it's, I can't afford it really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it costs too much.  Okay, what about medical problems, anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have, yeah, I have some medical problems but I don't go to the doctor for it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, what kind of medical problems?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My neck, I have, it's constant pain in it but I've basically learned how to live with that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Has anybody ever told you what's wrong with it? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A bulging disc and a crushed disc I believe.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How'd you get that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, years ago my ex boyfriend, I think this is how I got it, choked me till I passed out and ever since then my neck's been bad. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I hope you've learned how to pick better boyfriends.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want one.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, okay, does it go down your arms or cause anything like your arms to go to sleep?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It feels like my arms, you know, get numb - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Tingly and stuff but like I said, I 'm used to it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have any loss of strength in your arms?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, pretty much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can't afford to get it fixed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If I remember, the last time I'd been to the doctor, they said that surgery wouldn't enhance it.  They used to put, I went to get needles put in my neck from the pain center.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But that didn't last but maybe a couple weeks if it lasted that long, it didn't last for me.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever done physical therapy?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I think I did, we did do some.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you tend to stay tense all the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you find yourself tightening your neck muscles and tightening up your jaw or hurt your teeth?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Probably my jaw, I don't know about my neck.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get on guard a lot and feel tight and tense all over?  Okay.  Okay, that may do something to you.  Now let's see, what other kind of medical problems do you have?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just aches, I guess normal old age aches and pains.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And how old are you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE], okay, still working?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When did you quit working?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Back about 2000, I haven't worked since 2005.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What happened, too depressed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just couldn't do it.  I couldn't stay in one spot, I couldn't concentrate, I couldn't focus, they wouldn't, my kids took over - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Are you on disability?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.  But I have filed for disability and I just went to a, not just but last month I think it was, I went to get evaluated.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I can do that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Someone in [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right, anything run in your family?  Anything else?  You have aches and pains, you have the neck, any other kind of problems you have?  No?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I've got pains in my chest.  I get pains in my chest, I don't know what that's from. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When does that happen?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's usually there every day and it feels like a burning type feeling and it goes up underneath the pit of my arm.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Does it get worse with exertion, moving around, working, this kind of stuff?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I really don't do too much of anything so I don't - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Anything make it better?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's something else I've just learned how to live with.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's not made worse by exercise, no?  Okay, what operations have you had?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Cesarean section and bunions.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Have your kids got anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah, I believe they do.  They have, [NAME OTHER] has been diagnosed, I think you seen [NAME OTHER] too, I'm not even sure about that, he's ADHD.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER], my oldest daughter, she's something too but she won't go to the doctor, she needs to.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER], she's got really bad, she's up and down, she's got really bad, she's got a bad, I would call it a bad attitude.  She could be sweet and nice and then the next thing you know, she's chewing your head off.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, has ups and downs.  Okay, do you have any allergies to medications?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you had any bad reactions to medications?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I can't take Vicodin or, well I won't take Vicodin, or there's another one, Lortab, they make me freak out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's a freak out?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, just panic, I get real bad panic, worse.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does it make your mind race more?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay, bipolar people, often times when you have pain, a pain medicine like that, it'll wind them up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't like it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right, um, any hallucinations, hear anybody call your name, that kind of stuff?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.  No delusions.  You're really sort of quiet, clean, tired looking, okay, able to smile, speech is sparse, memory is intact, intellect is intact, answer is short to questions.  I suspect though if I try to get you to talk about something for a long period of time, you'd have trouble doing it.  You might get lost in what you're saying, am I right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, because you're real distracted.  Do you have trouble staying on task or anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Can you read?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.  I mean I can but I don't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You've got a steel block in there, you can't get it in your head?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh, I don't understand it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If you tell me something it's better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, you can do the oral learning but not visual learning.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that goes along with this too.  All right, have you ever been on Lamictal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Lamictal, no, okay.  How about Trileptal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Depakote?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Depakote.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, when did you take Depakote?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Some time last year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What'd it do?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think it did anything to me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What about Lithium?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've been on Lithium many years ago, you had me on Lithium and Zoloft together, that did it real good for me but then this doctor put me on it and it didn't, it didn't do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Okay.  [INAUDIBLE] which ones have hurt you, which ones have helped you, which ones are you able to tolerate, which ones you aren't able to tolerate.    Let's name some, did Zoloft help before?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How about Prozac?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Ever taken it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It didn't help?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Bad side effects.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's the bad side effect?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think I was having bad thoughts with that one.  It didn't make me feel any better, I remember that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, how about Paxil?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Paxil didn't make me feel any better either.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How about Effexor?  Don't remember that one?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  How about Tegretol?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't remember that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Trileptal.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I never heard of it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Never heard of it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Topamax?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No history of seizures or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Migraine headaches?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  Okay and you're feeling good all the time, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, no worse.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  All right, so functionally what you've got is, you've got sadness and emptiness and loneliness and irritability and poor concentration, poor ability to read and comprehend things, understand things, cognitively you do well listening to them.  You have cycling somewhat.  You're over stimulated internally which you don't look like it on the outside and I'd like to try you on something called Lamictal, okay, and that like everything else is expensive as the dickens but you can get it, you can, beings you don't have insurance, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can get it from, you can get it from [DEIDENTIFIED], okay, it's cheaper than they have here and it's going to be going on generic before it's over with, in about six months or so.  And you go up on it, go slow, I can give you some samples and you can go up.  I think these other things will help you once you get through that [INAUDIBLE].  All right, right now I don't think anything is going to help you sleep a lot.  I mean I can give you something that'll put you to sleep but it's [INAUDIBLE], okay, and if I can get your mind slowed down and make you not feel so on guard, you know, and overstimulated internally, your mind racing and irritable and all that kind of stuff, then you'll probably be able to sleep better.  It'll take a little time to do it though because [INAUDIBLE] Lamictal, we can move slowly and the reason I like Lamictal is because it doesn't cause weight gain and doesn't mess with a lot of medicines and I can increase the dose pretty well without sedating you, okay, and some people need to go on real high doses of medicine.  Now it doesn't work right now, you have to go up to a certain level, maybe 100, maybe 200, maybe 400, maybe even 600 mg but you go up very slowly.  As you go up, then that turns off that extra energy that you've got and you sort of find yourself sort of slowing down internally and then that'll allow the antidepressant to work.  If I can stop the cycles, you know, I think you're overstimulated and that's messing up all your regulatory systems, okay, and if I turn that off then things will begin to fall in back to normal and you'll begin to heal inside your head and your nervous system, your whole body, this is really a body disorder and it'll just take a little time to get there.  I might give you some Zoloft because it's cheap, it's generic and all that kind of stuff and what you're on so far is generic - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So I'd like to stick to that and then the Lamictal can be the thing that costs you money but right now you'll get a long acting form.  Are you on disability or something like that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Am I what?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get on disability?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is that, I mean is there nothing to take in place of that expensive one?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This one?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Lamictal, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, Lamictal.  Not really.  I can give you some samples, it'll help, okay.  For right now take, because you have to go 25 mg for two weeks, then you go to 50, then you go to 75 or 100 mg and 100 mg a day should help you but that'll take about six weeks.  You can get that from a [DEIDENTIFIED] pharmacy by that time and it'll cost about $40 a month, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, $113 for a three months' supply and then you can just keep on going with it.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, sounds good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  This is probably going to take about three months to get you fixed, okay.  Once I get your mind slowed down, okay, now Lamictal has, is not, everything has warts, you know, all the medicines you have pluses and minuses and this kind of stuff.  You don't have any rashes or anything like that so, and no psoriasis or anything like that, right, okay, so Lamictal will cause a rash in some people, okay, and the rash looks like poison ivy and poison oak, have you ever had that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Little red dots kind of stuff, starts off usually and sort of spread together and then they get itchy and burning and all that kind of stuff.  This is what that rash looks like most of the time.  Sometimes you can get a diffuse rash like, you know, just on your skin kind of stuff.  Sometimes you get little red things that just pop up on your body and those sort of look like a streak kind of rash.  You can also get like a flu like syndrome, body aches and all this kind of stuff, joint aches and this kind of stuff, if you get that, you have to stop it.  If you get any of these kind of rashes like that.  Now if you have little red spots like that, no big deal but this is something, these will be things that you, you don't worry is that it or is that not it, you'll say my Lord look at that, okay.  If you stop the medicine it'll be gone in about, you know, like three days.  Okay, when they first used this stuff, they used too much of it and they used it with medicines that wouldn't let it get out of the body.  They used it with Depakote and they gave people about 300 mg of it to treat seizure disorders and it caused some mess in some people who were having a rash because the medicine got too high in their body, they gave them toxic doses essentially and it couldn't get out because of the Depakote they were taking with it.  They had some messes with that, people died, but since we've been using it by itself and gradually going up, there have been really no real major problems that I'm aware of.  You know, if you get the rash, it's a gradual kind of thing, stop it and it'll go away.  All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And that's it.  I'll fix you up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, so if I get a rash, if I get a little bit of spots that's good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If it gets worse, you know, if you get, if you get, if you're sure about it looking like a bad rash, if it looks like an angry rash, you need to stop it.   [INAUDIBLE] we've got to get that extra energy out of [INAUDIBLE].  Okay, that's it.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Do I have to fill out papers for that, to get the medicine from [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to give you a prescription and you'll have to go online to do it.  And I'll need to see you back in about a month, okay.  We'll cut this off. </p>

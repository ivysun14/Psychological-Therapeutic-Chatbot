<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

 
<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, from missing a session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we need to stop for today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the 26th all right? The next session here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's nasty out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is. Makes you think winter is coming.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think this is going to do. So it's been very - a little crazy I guess, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Work and at home-everywhere. We're about to close on this building-so it's been a little nuts. But let's hope it's working out, I guess. But it's been very - at work it's been a little bit pressing. I might have a problem with one of the guys. It's just pretty irritating. But I guess things are going okay. It's been - you know, nothing -</p>

<p> COUNSELOR: You sound a little stressed out, though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am a little bit. I'm thinking, "Man, I am stressed out." I came - [head down] (ph) - Yeah, we were supposed to close on the building tomorrow, but it seems like the owner is not really ready. She's not ready-she's got a lot of stuff to clear out still.</p>

<p>So we thought about postponing it, and I actually-rather fortunately-called the bank. I had just moved money between accounts, and - the most money I had ever seen in my account-in my checking account, which is - it's just all going to go away. But this is kind of crazy.</p>

<p>Probably - it's funny-you end up trading all the money that you've saved up to go into hock-you know? But - well anyway, so it turned out that the bank takes like two weeks to - it was from another bank, you know? We were moving money from one bank to another, and it takes like two weeks. [2:42]</p>

<p>And I don't know-I'm not nearly probably as stressed out as Karen is. She's really - but she's been much more involved in everything, and taking care of everything. And so - but it's a little hard, I guess. I feel a little stressed from work, so I come home and she's stressed from this.</p>

<p>Then I kind of - we're starting to deal with it there too, you know. I know that she's feeling a lot of stuff sometimes. She's - I mean, we're different personalities in some ways. She's very I guess much more sensitive and I'm more like kind of laid back about (inaudible at 3:43). So typically say, "There's no sense worrying about it now," or whatever. But I knew that this all was coming and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it's okay, let me check in with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you feeling right now? I sort of have a sense like you're struggling a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am struggling a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying to decide what to talk about or where you're at.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's sort of like that. I mean, it's sort of like unwinding. I've just been like going - because I guess today I was-because Lucas was out. And he's been out for three days in a row and so this other guy Bob is, you know, been picking up for him. And I have - and I have to kind of - well, I had to call him for one, and say, "Look, I know you threw back out. You know, you've got to," I said, "and you have to go to the doctor and stuff like that."</p>

<p>But three days out of work is really pretty - it's a lot. And especially in view of the fact that he's been out a lot in the last few months. But I can't really deal with it. I'm going to have to - I saved - I didn't want to go through a whole thing on the phone. I need to talk to him in person.</p>

<p>So - and then, of course, just before I left, people are calling up and saying, "Oh there's a problem with this or a problem with that." And I have to deal with them (ph). So I don't know. I just felt like that (ph). I'm catching up with myself, you know, kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like catching your breath. [5:37]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, kind of, you know. I mean on my way over here, usually I'm kind of thinking ahead to the - you know, but I was thinking of - I was more like, "Well what do I do about this or what do I do about - how am I going to fix this, how am I going to trace the problems in what's going on?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're just sort of like preoccupied with everything that's happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, kind of. Very much. But it's all a little bit more jumbled, I guess, than -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I think this isn't the first time, though, that it's felt like this. To me, it seems like that sometimes -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, certainly not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like in the beginning when we were sort of starting our sessions. I think it often feels like it takes you a little while sort of to transition from like the outside world to the way you and I work together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's true. I mean there are times, I think, when I feel more focused or - definitely times when I feel more focused, where there's something that I really feel -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you want to talk about right away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To (ph) address, you know? And then sometimes like - I don't know. Well it's like today-I feel scattered. I feel pretty scattered. And I don't know-so it's like - yeah, it's like catching my breath in a way, and kind of stopping.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you also feel like pressured to like stop being scattered and sort of like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well in some - yeah. I mean, otherwise, if I could - I mean in some ways, yeah. If I just kept on kind of thinking - or just being I don't know, shot gun-it wouldn't be - you know -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wouldn't be productive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wouldn't be as productive. So I do feel a certain kind of pressure there. I can't deny that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like therapy time, sort of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean it does - being here has its, you know-I guess has a certain - lays over a certain structure, or lays over a certain - I mean, I don't know if it could be any other way. I don't know how you feel about - or how you - or if that's, you know. I mean, ideally, I could just kind of walk in here and it would be I guess in some sense the same or - [8:42]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure I understand. Tell me -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I don't know. Well either that in some sense that - I don't know that I have formulated. It's not that I would have formulated something and walked in here with it, but that that's something - .</p>

<p>It's hard to-that's - you know, I guess if I went through life or went through my days just thinking what's on my priority list as far as myself emotionally and whatever. And always carried that around, you know, with that in mind in some sense, and walked in here with that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would that be different if you walked in here like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't - well, yeah-I mean I don't know. It's kind of idle (ph) because even-I guess that's what I mean, though, in terms of carrying it in here. But if I had like, I guess, more of a finger on my pulse all the time, perhaps. And I don't know, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So let me see if I understand what you're saying. It sound like what you're saying-part of what you've been trying to work on together with me in here is to have a little bit more of a finger on where you're at and what's happening to you and what you're experiencing. And where do you want to be going in your life and in relationships and that kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ideally, I would like to have that occurring not just in here, but really everywhere-ubiquitously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I think we talked last time about part of what you said that you might miss when our sessions end is sort of like the fact that this is like a lamp post, in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is and that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like there's some structure to the fact that we're meeting each week for you to sort of take this time that you're putting aside to do exactly that-to check in with yourself in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is time you use that's your time where we talk about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As opposed to the latest sort of crisis that happened at work.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) True.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right? Or - [11:17]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I do talk about it, but in a different way-or I think about it in a different way. But it's not like I'm caught up in it; it's like I'm stepping back in some sense. But yeah, that will be hard. I guess I - you know I mentioned the thought of maybe that I should like kind of continue to do it with myself, or set aside some time for myself-which, you know, I think is a great idea. I'm skeptical if I'm going to do it, but (chuckles) -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I have that sense, too. That it would be really hard for you to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it would be. And I don't know - it's like I - I don't know. It's so hard to - it's like it's easy for me to give myself over to the world, but harder for me to give it over to myself. Or recognize - well first of all, recognize that I need the time; and then second of all to make the demand on the world-if it's a demand, or whatever. Take the time so I - (inaudible at 12:40) Karen, I get half an hour.</p>

<p>And then - and not do things-I mean I do have - it's not that I always have something to do, I mean, but yeah. The tendency is that I go home, maybe, and if I have a spare hour or whatever-well, if Ginger is asleep, then turn on the TV or something-lose myself in that. But I mean, I don't know. I thought maybe I should keep a journal-something else I've been notoriously bad at.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The other thought I'm having as you're talking is-we haven't talked about it in a while, but we talked quite a bit earlier on in our work together. About the struggle you have inside yourself, where part of you very much wanted to come to the therapy and get the help you were looking to get and to make changes in your life that you wanted to change.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's another part of you that was rebellious about like having to be here and having to be here on a certain day and at a certain time. And sort of like the structure of it-you sort of bristled against a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm wondering if that's part of what happens to you when you sort of say to yourself, you know, "I'm going to write in my journal every night, or I'm going to put an hour aside every - " [14:14]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Week or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That there's a - it's hard for you to sort of like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's hard for me to feel like-and I said this before to you-that I would be doing something for myself. It always has to be - I mean still, even now, I feel - I don't - when I think about the feeling coming in here, it's changed. It has changed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There isn't that rebellious -</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Not as much. You know, sometimes yeah. It's like, "Oh I wish I could get this other thing done before I have to leave work," or something like that. But it's not like, you know - it's really -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Damn. Why is he making me come now?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Why do I have to come now?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that there's a significant alteration there, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it's interesting-it sounds to me where you're going now a little bit is the direction I have. When you said that if you were going to set time aside, the first thing you would have to do is recognize that you need it. And the second step would be to like actually implement it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make the people in your life sort of give it to you. Just take what steps you need to take. And it's interesting to me that when you said that you need it, that another phrase you could have used was that you deserved it. You know-but you didn't. You sort of - for whatever reason, you didn't use - phrase it that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I think maybe one of the reasons - well of course - well, there are a few things. I mean, one is that on some level I mean-and perhaps I've gotten largely past that here but-on some level it's like I'm working on myself.</p>

<p>But the word is "working." So "work." You know, it's like it means, oh I'm expending a certain amount of energy or whatever. I have to examine things; I have to look at them and I have to - you know, there's -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's effort for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's effort. It's so much easier to turn on the tube, you know, and just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Escape for a little while.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Read a book or whatever. It's just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Well I think that there's something - you know, the other thing that is coming to my mind as we're talking now, too is that I sort of feel that we should be careful to not set things up the way we're talking. So that when we are finished in the time we have together, that if you don't do one of these things, then you're going to feel bad about not doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Yeah, yeah. [17:07]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean like, you know, "Oh I was supposed to keep a journal," or "I was supposed to put an hour aside each week." That would - and now that if you end up not doing that, to like feel bad about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's a nice observation. And it definitely is something that I would be - that's - yeah, it is something I guess to be careful about. But it's kind of a catch 22, though, in that sense. You know, I mean it's just - I mean is it an expectation I raise within myself just so I can fling it away when the time comes-or doesn't come?</p>

<p>How do I really - I mean, yeah-the question is how do I find that? To be able to find the - sort of recognize the need to check in with myself. Which I'm kind of doing a little bit. You know, I do it a little bit more just, I think, on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>But it's still not - it's a little different from here, I mean, in the sense that I may be examining things a little bit differently, but at the same time there's not - well those are all like the details of my daily day-to-day that I'm looking at and not like kind of the overall. It would be nice to have that. Just look over what's gone on in the last week or the last even day.</p>

<p>And I always - but it's always such an easy thing to put off and not do-and not probably even let myself remember that I - that this is something I would like to do. [19:38]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's a conundrum. There is - I mean it is - I guess I'll have a six-month hiatus, so that's the time period that I would - for the study, right? So it's also not the end of the world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's true. Another thought I'm having-tell me if this fits, too-is that maybe part of what we're talking about when you were thinking about, "Well what am I going to do when the therapy ends?" To keep the process going-to keep the therapy going in a way, even though it's over.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So even though you and I won't be meeting anymore, when you sort of talk about if maybe if I wrote in a journal or set aside an hour each week or - that there's a [sense that you] (ph) want to sort of keep making progress.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But ideally, I should be able to make it be the same as our weekly appointment, you know-at least. Or just - and actually, it's even better because I won't be bound by holidays or whatever. You know, I won't be - so -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I missed the holiday point.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, just that even if I go away, I can still do it for an hour - spend that hour. So it's better in the sense that if -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If we couldn't meet -</p>

<p>PATIENT: If we couldn't meet for - right. So I won't have that restriction unless I made an appointment with myself previously. (chuckles) So yeah, in that sense, by all means it should be - and it's something, you know, I can say right now-yeah, I would like to do that. [22:12]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is - I think it's a complicated issue because part of - when two people are done working together, part of what we hope to take away from that is seeing things in a new way, or experiencing yourself in a new way, or being in the world in a way that's a little shifted from before you started. And that's something you sort of have with you all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. That doesn't mean you don't feel like you sort of get kind of engulfed by all the details of your daily like. I mean, to deal with all the crises that happen at work and all the responsibilities of fatherhood and husband and mortgages. And the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>It's sort of like all the things, you know-adulthood - you know, all the responsibilities of adulthood. But that seems like you're also saying you have a sense of - that you see things a little differently, even when you are sort of caught up in dealing with all the pressures of your daily life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think I do see things somewhat differently. To what degree, it's kind of hard to say. And in certain situations, I'm much more aware of it than in others. And it's hard for me even to say why. And I agree with you there, that it's - I would like to know that I've carried it through.</p>

<p>But I think that, at the same time, I've been carrying things over - or bringing them from here-and that I could continue to do that. And I think I will, but at the same time, I think that there's certain something more that has to happen than just - in order to progress even more, you know? That there's - and whether I would - you know, I don't know if I could find it myself-or maybe not. That path is -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yet to be traveled. [24:54]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So when I - yeah - say that, like taking the - setting aside time or writing or whatever, and just - that I think that's - I need the - somehow I think I need that extra whatever - kick or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Structure to it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Structure to it-more than just - I - it's hard to say if I've - I think I have taken away - I look at things a little bit differently since we started. But then it's like - I don't know how you would express it-Zeno's paradox or something? You're always halfway there. You know, you go halfway and you're halfway there; you go halfway and you're halfway there. Well I'm always like halfway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like there's still farther to go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though you keep going.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can go infinitely being halfway there-even though you're getting closer and closer to something. I don't even know - I know it's a never-ending process. It's not finite by any means.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's I think where maybe the artificialness of the fact that we're ending after a certain number of sessions sort of has that feeling to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah, it does. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like are you any more ready to end today than you were three times ago? Or three times from now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah, I don't know. I certainly know my life isn't going to fall apart, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have that suspicion as well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But at the same time - well (a) I'll miss it, and (b) I would like to kind of maintain that. And the question to myself - that I put to myself is, "Well, can I maintain it myself?" Maintain - and six months probably will go like that anyway. But I kind of think, "Well yeah." After six months I'll think, "Gee, what happened to those six months?" It's not a lot, but maybe kind of a lot and kind of not much at all. You know, a lot of events maybe, but - [27:47]</p>

<p>But it's the kind of thing - I mean, it's a kind of rhetorical question I guess. Would we all be better off if we just set aside some time for ourselves and kind of looked over - well, that's probably true for just about everybody I think. But I guess easier said than done. Am I making sense?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sound like - another way to talk about the struggle is part of you does feel like some things are different than before we did this work together. And the part of you - there's another voice inside that is maybe the voice of a doubt a little bit. You know, well - "Is it enough change? Is the change going to stick around? Can I keep changing?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Am I going to backslide? What does it mean to backslide? I don't even know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. There's just some uneasiness about it, it sounds like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's also funny to be - I mean it is artificial and it's funny-it's not like falling off a cliff, but it's like - but now it's - in itself that there's a certain irony, or I don't what you would say. But it's like become an issue or become something that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That we're spending time talking about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And it's just funny that way. Because it is. I mean, it is something I think that - you know, it has an impact; whereas perhaps before, I'd be thinking about like, "Well, we're just going to continue talking about the things we - "</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel a little frustrated that we're sort of spending time talking about the fact that it's ending? That we're spending a lot of time talking about that? [30:25]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I feel frustrated by it, no. I mean it's just - but it's a bit like the worm that eats its own tail in a sense, you know? So it's kind of funny that way. And I wonder what kind of resonance that has for me; because I think about other - aside from it being just therapy is stopping-three more sessions.</p>

<p>And the difference that all - it is there, so I'm not really frustrated by talking about it; although I'm frustrated - I'm more frustrated perhaps in the sense that, "Yeah, it is going to end." And I can talk to you about it now, but then I won't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not changing the fact that it's ending?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And then I won't be able to talk with you about it. So if there's frustration, I guess it's more in that sense, though. So that makes it a little more difficult. And it does - I guess there is a - you know, of course, if it wasn't ending, we wouldn't be talking about it. So - on the other hand also, so -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So in that sense, perhaps yeah-I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's sort of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's imposing - it is imposing something on our relationship for sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Absolutely. It's definitely true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But part of me thinks it -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I think I know what you're - you know, I - that you're - I almost - I feel like I know you're about to say -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think I'm about to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That it isn't an end in a sense-that there is a continuation. Well, there's a continuation in my life, and a continuation of the processes that we go through. And certainly, you as a person won't be there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there is a certain element of support that you give me. [33:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'll have to either find - I'll have to find somewhere else-within myself or wherever. But at the same time, it's something that I'm carrying through, however (ph)-hopefully carrying through for myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it feels good to me to hear you say that part of your feeling in working with me is that you find it supportive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I do. I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I appreciate that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I appreciate the support. (chuckles) But -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think you sort of have hit on something-that we're not just talking about the goals for therapy that you're going to try continue to try to work on and how you could incorporate a way in which to continue to make progress on that because the therapy is ending. But in a way, our relationship is ending, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know-so that - yeah, we're two people who have gotten to know each other and have feeling about each other. And that is stopping, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When the therapy is over.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Well definitely stopping and - well as much as - well I've said before, you know, it's a bit of a mix, you know? It's like - from the beginning I said that it was hard to relate, in a sense, because person-to-person, on a - like (ph) help with this professional relationship has been started (ph) from day one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I do feel like - yeah, there's something more to it or something that kind of is there in parallel with that. They both exist. And I don't think I've completely gotten around to feeling like this is just like us hanging out and having, you know - or that's gotten around the kind of feeling that, yeah, there is a certain kind of professional aspect to it, and everything else.</p>

<p>But still - and I guess part of - I feel frustrated at times that - I mean I guess I still feel frustrated at times that, you know, I wish I could know you better or be - establish a relationship on another basis.</p>

<p>I also know that that, to a certain extent, is counterproductive to - you know, in the realistic scheme of things, it's counterproductive to what we're doing. here. And in fact, you have constraints - it is a constraint. But it's a constraint that I knew about when I walked in here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think you-again, I'm really impressed with how well you are articulating, I think, a really key aspect of what's happening between you and me. And that is that there are sort of things happening in parallel-that more than one thing can be true at the same time.</p>

<p>That you can - even though it's a special kind of relationship-because of this professional aspect of it and it has goals and it has a certain purpose and a certain way in which we work because of that-that well, we're still two people. Right? So people end up having a relationship-even if it's kind of funny in this odd kind of professional -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It could a workplace or it could be wherever. But it doesn't - [36:51]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So both of those things are true. And also can be true that even though part of you realizes or feels that - the very fact that this relationship is special in some way, helps it achieve the goal. But at the same time still wishing part of you could still wish that it could be more another way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's accurate I think. Yeah. And you know, the funny thing about it is, is sometimes you have to be careful about what you wish for-because you may get it, right? And to a certain extent, if our relationship changed, it would be a different relationship. I wouldn't, perhaps, say - which is to say I might enjoy being - let's say if we were just like friends, I would probably enjoy your company, but I would be missing the Josh that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you've gotten to know in this room?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In this room. Yeah. It would be a different thing. So -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think there's truth to that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So if you could just clone yourself and then -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you could have two of me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Exactly. Right. But -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know there's another level to think about, though, too-that's just coming to mind now-in that you also get to take away from our work together sort of like the memories and feelings about the time we've spent together.</p>

<p>So it's not just that you take forward from when therapy end the knowledge and insights and different way of feeling about yourself in the world that we have sort of tried to work on together. But that you also take away, you know, the memories and thoughts and feelings about our relationship, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, undoubtedly. And I don't know if it's kosher to even speak about now, but you know, it wouldn't surprise me if six months from now, or whatever, that I picked up the phone and called you or something and said, "Maybe we could continue." I don't know if you can entertain that possibility or you can make an official statement about it, but - at this point, but - [39:36]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the statement I can make is that you're welcome to call.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I think, you know, as you have a clear sense about, the idea is to sort of give the six-month period of time to sort of see what happens.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And as that sort of - the idea behind - one of the ideas behind this kind of work-you know, this way of working is to like sort of have a focused period of time when you're in the therapy, and then see what happens for a period of time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's sort of part of what -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a classic kind of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try to understand about how it works, what to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Short-term therapy and whether it's effective. Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And that somebody is going to call you six months from now to touch base with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh I have no doubt. I'll get a stack of forms to fill out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More things to fill out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I have no doubt about it. Yeah. It's funny. I hadn't thought much about it before-about the camera and [you there] (ph) and stuff. Now as it's kind of drawing to a close, I kind of find myself thinking about it a little bit, too, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well just - of course wondering who's going to see it. It's - I have friends in the field, you know, of course. So I do-I always wondered. I guess stranger things have happened, you know? And I think about it-I guess I'll live. But other people have said to me, "I don't know how you can do that." You know, there's going to be a library of video tapes and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you sort of felt the cameras as a presence most of the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No, actually not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like been - you sort of like tuned out about it most of the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Most of the time, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But more recently, you started -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah-I don't know if it's been that prevalent, but I just thought about it -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now and maybe - I don't know-earlier; a little earlier on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And also when you sort of asked me this thing of whether I could make an official statement on camera.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There, of course, I am like - yeah-aware of it there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean there is - it does - it adds something. It is sort of different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To sort of have the sense of like this observation of some kind. [42:27]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's better than having 50 people looking through a glass window, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a sense that at some points it may have made you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pull back?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little more reluctant to sort of go into certain things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think so, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't think so, really. But it's - I guess-but it is there. I mean, it may be in - not occupy - I tune it out pretty much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's not zero?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it's not zero. So like I say, when I say something that's - I remember it, you know? So - it's hard to say. I mean, I guess it's - I don't think it's a significant degree, though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think, just as a piece of information as far as - you know, when you said you have friends who are in the field-you meant mental health professionals or psychologist?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We certainly take confidentiality seriously.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though it is a research project and we sort of are taping it because that's part of the research protocol. Sort of, you know, helping - trying to understand what is it that's helpful to people-what works and what doesn't work, as well. But the tapes sort of stay here within this research group. And the only people who will see them would be people in the research group here. So it's not sort of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah-disseminated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I mean, it might be - you know, if there was a collaboration of another research group somewhere, there might be some exchanging of sort of data.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I realize that. But even if any of those people did happen to see it anyway, I respect them, certainly, enough to know that they would take it professionally. No, I'm not afraid of it appearing on prime time or whatever. (chuckles) But -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would definitely be disconcerting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it might be a little bit. But I don't know. And of course I said before, I'm curious-and this is not a question that I expect you to answer at all - [45:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there's a certain curiosity that I have about how you feel that it - or how - it what ways it's changed your approach or -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we only have like a couple minutes left today. And I certainly would be open to talking about it more next time, too. But let me ask you if you have any sense of like how I might do -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether you've been evasive in any way or anything like that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No-anything. Like have you had a sense of how I might be with you differently because we're in this research project?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think you would be differently. It wouldn't be different. If it was open-ended, of course, it would be different-just because it would be open-ended as opposed to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah, that would definitely be a significant difference.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But aside from that, the other - well the questionnaires I find kind of interesting. And I guess I would assume that for each one I fill out, you're probably filling something out, too. But - you don't have to tell me. But -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, there's sort of an interesting - even in the fact of the way you're sort of phrasing it. Like, you know, "You don't have to tell me." Like you're sort of asking me -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I know-I am. And it's one of those - yeah, there's (inaudible at 46:59) that I'm being -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That in itself is perhaps sort of like the camera. Like it's not there a lot, but maybe it is sort of in the background a little bit. Like, you know, we're filling out forms and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, your questions are like-well how might I be different with you? What forms am I filling out? There's sort of like there's this whole sort of other aspect to this that's like in the background that doesn't sort of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there is that aspect. And the forms actually kind of frame - not when I'm in here, necessarily, but when I walk out and I fill that out, it frames things in a certain way. There's no - I think, you know - because just by virtue of the kinds of questions that are asked, or whatever.</p>

<p>One of the questions is, "Did you experience any problem or tension with your therapist during the session?" You know? And I have to think about it. I think about problem - what does problem mean? What does tension mean? You know? If I felt personally tense, well it's not my - you know what I'm saying? But it also - it does - I mean, it's good that I fill it out afterwards. I guess it post-exposes me to think about -[48:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Certain aspects of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Certain aspect of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way we are together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Of the way we are. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Well we do need to stop for today. But I do have an openness to talk about it-not sort of like this thing we're not allowed to talk about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, I know. But I guess you'll tell me if you can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely. Okay.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: [It feels] (ph) like a buzzing inside of my head. I've had a cold for the past week and so now I feel congested. And so I just feel like there's that post-cold feeling and also forming today, something that was kind of like the spirits were droning. I can't hear crap [in my ears.] (ph) (pause) </p>

<p>Yea, so it feels like a blah day. It's one of those days where I just thought, "I don't want to come here. I don't want to go to class." I just don't have much ambition. I just feel like sleeping. [00:00:59] (pause) So I'm here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't want to come. What—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't want to come here or go to class or I just—and relax. (pause) Relax and (inaudible at 00:01:14) So I don't know. I'm here.</p>

<p>The whole thing with Barbara was resolved. It turns out she was—it was a guessing game, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. So, she was mad because she actually went out to dinner but she thinks we never go out. And since I went to the concert, I couldn't go out. And it was sort of a last minute thing anyway. So, I didn't fight it. I thought, "Well, if that's what it is." And she seems to have been dissatisfied with me being on the futon for two or three nights. I forget how many, but whatever. (inaudible at 00:02:11) if that seems to have been my pants (ph) then. [00:02:14] </p>

<p>So I still feel part of time, now I don't feel much anything then. But of time, I feel like—well, I'm not sure if dissatisfactory and I kind of miss the little room because of it. It was like I'm having a little studio apartment (chuckling) where I deserve to be away for a bit. So then I thought, "Oh, it's over and I just have to go back." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Move back into the old place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's done. It's done. So rather than protract it though and then have it escalate. It's sort of saying, "Well, it's not really solved." I just thought, "Well, I'll just remember this." (pause) Not in a grudge way. Not in a not-forgive way. [00:03:00] But just sort of notched away as (pause) a trigger and a reaction and her (pause) interpretation of events, I guess. And just be mindful. </p>

<p>So when we had another—this was like a week later, or was it this weekend? I don't know, Saturday originally (ph). She wanted the air conditioner out of the bedroom. So, she was gone and I was guided (ph). Took the air conditioner out, set it on some stools in the kitchen because I need her help actually navigating down the spiral staircase to get to the basement so I don't fall over. So [made it] (ph) at the end to make sure my feet don't, because if I can't see my feet with the air conditioner in my hands. [00:04:01] </p>

<p>Anyway, so getting down there and somehow there was a contretemps and I'm like,—but minor—"All right, all right, let's just nip this in the bud. You are mad at me for some reason. Let's not have it escalate. Just tell me what it is right now. And I will tell you why I'm mad at you. And let's just be very clear about this so it doesn't escalate." I forget why she was mad at me. And I forget why I was mad at her. But—anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it would (ph) clear the air?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It cleared the air. And she's mad at other things but she takes it out on me which—and I'm always very careful. It's like you just can't generalize. You can't take something out there and put it on me. You can't fight and start speaking globally. Like, "We never do anything. (pause) Never do anything." [00:05:04] And in the course of a month, we went and saw a show and then we saw "The Tempest." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, that's why I kind of recall you guys going—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, that's like that's—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crosstalk) (pause) Anyway, so things are amicable now and, in a sense, that's good. (pause) But I'm—(pause) I don't know. It's like I see things have been differently now and just because of that experience it's fine. I'm looking for things beneath the surface more than usual. (crosstalk) (inaudible at 00:06:00) prevent her going off the end. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you make of our talk last week and me bringing up the whole kind of—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, well I think it's absolutely accurate. I think that's all underneath the surface and yet—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, though, that's very real, all of it. But she seems quite happy and just sort of pin it on looking forward to going out and then us not going out. And then being mad and then saying, "We never go out."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, anyway. So it's like, "All right, well, we'll try to go out more." Even though like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea, right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm thinking, "All right. That's fine." I will try to correct her [on this sort of stuff] (ph) (inaudible at 00:07:07).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yea, yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. Today she's off with this woman named Kimberly (sp) who's visiting from Wales and staying with Stephanie. Stephanie is in meltdown mode because she was head over heels for this guy and they'd been seeing each other non-stop for four months. And then she broke up with him which is unusual because she usually gets broken up with. That's sort of the rule. It's like she burns people out. She's so into it. And she's outgoing so it's like she just talks, and talks, and talks and you'll see everybody (ph) getting exhausted. </p>

<p>But apparently this guy is—she found him passed out on his boat because he was drinking. And apparently he's been in rehab five times. So she's like, "I can't deal with someone who is a veteran (ph) alcoholic." [00:08:02] So she's sad, teary, teary, teary and so says Barbara because they went out on Friday night. And Kimberly (sp) is staying there for a month. And so then Kimberly (sp) is upset because Stephanie is not being a good host, because Stephanie is sad. So Barbara is just sort of looking at babysitting Kimberly (sp) so she can get out of the house. So (inaudible at 00:08:34) Barbara I told her, "She's doing it because it's fun." (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Picking up the slack.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Picking up the slack. Anyway, so I went and picked her up at noon from Stephanie's. They're back. They took off. [00:09:01] So today has been a total waste. It's what I feel. It's like, I woke up, I did some math but I was feeling kind of foggy. It's a nice day. I thought, (inaudible at 00:09:11) being a nice day but I haven't been working out, I think, because I've been sick. So I've sort of gotten in a routine of going to the gym. So that feeling of, normally you go to the gym and no matter how day has been going you feel that satisfaction of having a pretty good life for a half an hour and lift your weights, or something like that. And there's a routine, right? You know what you're going to do when you go to the gym because there's like a—when you go six days a week, you have a system, right? So today is the chest, or the triceps, or it's the back, or I'm biking today, or I'm jogging today or anyway. So I feel out of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, it's Katie's birthday. So yesterday we went and found a present. [00:10:02] And so then it had to be wrapped up and mailed. And so then you wrap this thing up and that's no big deal. But even that's even sort of like out of the usual, it's like, "I have to wrap this thing and take it to the post office." It's like, "I don't want to wrap it. I don't want to go to the post office. But it has to be done." </p>

<p>So, I feel like I haven't studied. I haven't done much of anything. Patriot's lost visibly (ph). That probably affects me in some way because usually you can count on—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:10:40) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:10:41) (pause) It's like (inaudible at 00:10:47) on the fourth quarter. The secondary is really that mad, are you kidding me? It's weird. I mean, it's strange to see a team not being the best for the first time in ten years. [00:11:02] (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking, though, that you—the place that felt the best would be home, or bed or something like that. Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know. It's not that I want to be home necessarily. I don't know. I guess so, but then I'm bad if you're home especially if it's nice really nice out. And I didn't want to be in bed, I just wanted to be—I don't know what I want. I simply want to have energy is what I want and I got plenty of sleep last night. So I'm chalking some of this up to just getting over a cold and being sort of laid up from that but—(pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. [00:12:02] (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: So my mom's birthday is this week. Katie's birthday is next week. So I got mom a card and that's already sent. And I did that Thursday or Friday. So that's fine. I'm sending Katie's thing today and that's good so that will arrive there well over her birthday. But there's that feeling of like, "But it didn't get my mom anything." I usually don't. I just send her a card. But then I was like, "But Katie is getting a present. But she's turning 18. Boy, that's a bummer. So I could shoot my mom something." Only like, it's too late unless that I go to Katie's alone and have it sent today. So there's a feeling of just like, "Huh. That's wrong (ph). I didn't get my mom anything." [00:13:09] Why don't I ever get them anything? I just get them cards. Get them some (ph) at Christmas when I go back. I don't know. So there's a feeling of like, "I'm never there for their birthdays, ever." (pause) I don't know if it's like the effort. Sort of, if you're there, it seems like a natural thing to do, right? They're there, so I'm just like, "I'm going to get something." But you live far away, it's like everything takes forethought because you have to send it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: As opposed to being spontaneous or genuine. Or, I mean it sounds funny. Of course it's genuine but—I'm never there for birthday cake or on the day, never, right? So while this sending things is always like, "Well, it's doing the right thing." Even though you don't feel it's time, you sort of have to feel it ahead of time. [00:14:08] You have to be feeling their birthdays a week before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. (pause) I guess I don't like going to the post office. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, I don't know why that is. I mean, I just I—(pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's an important thing, though to look at it. Because what's coming to mind is actually it's like the times that you talked about. The days you feel less up for coming in are actually days that I find when you're sort of more tired or feeling a bit off or maybe down in some way. [00:15:05] And I wonder if this is the case today too. But I was thinking in some way you feel like you don't have the right energy for this. And I was thinking that sometimes you feel like when we follow that out, there's something about you feeling that it would be a drag on me too. That in some way you would think, "Hey what are we doing here with this time and you're not putting in the effort or energy or something." And just like hearing that threat and like, "I can't come up with the right energy or kind of the feeling to come up with the birthday, the gift, or the card. I'm not in that mood. I don't want to do it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's interesting, yea, because here the point is I'm coming to talk. Whereas if this were not even today, then I would think, "Well, I really don't have to talk to anybody." [00:16:04] And as long as I'm pleasant enough to Barbara and do what I need to do—I mean, making couscous or whatever for dinner or something like that. (pause) (inaudible at 00:16:26) So then I can just slow down. I can do math more slowly. I can just listen to sports radio. I can sort of think to myself, "Well, it's one of those days. It's OK." </p>

<p>Well coming here, there's this sense of like, "Well, OK, whether I want to or not, I have to somehow think about something." And yea, I'm aware of the fact that it's sort of—I mean, it's taking place in real time. You're here. [00:17:01] So it's not like you can sort of fast forward. And sort of think to myself, "Well, this is boring but let's just get to the interesting part." Or just that sort of whole thing and then (inaudible at 00:17:15) more energy. Next time I'm fine. Now, it's in real time. So there's a sense of like, "Well, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm not really bringing much to the table. I'm boring myself." Like, I'm just—(pause) So—(pause) </p>

<p>Here's what I'm saying, "So if I had to go to class, I would just sort of sit there and think, "Well, I'm not totally engaged right now." I'll just sort of sit and whatever happens to stick in my brain, it'll stick. And I'll try to write down a few notes just so I have a memory of what's going on. [00:18:01] And then I'll just read it tomorrow when I'm feeling more energetic. I'll figure it out then because you can't knock a class. You can't not come here, right? I mean so it's really—but about here, I can't sit in the back of class because I'm sitting on this couch. (pause) And I mean, if you were lecturing I would just sit and listen to it and respond to it. But it's like, I have to lecture myself. I'm doing the talking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know—and if I had to teach today, I would get together because I have something—it's like that's actually a trigger for being happy because I enjoy it. I never "not" enjoy it because I like connecting with people in that way. [00:19:04] It's an opportunity to connect and I know I do it well. People are always really impressed and happy and they often will say, "This is the best class we've ever had." And that makes me feel good, right? So I forget, last week? I don't know. I was teaching. This woman, she was like, "You're so good. You're so good. You're such a good teacher. This is just absolutely the best class." She goes, "I really feel like I learned not just about this, but just how to think about things." And I thought, "Wow." I mean, that's amazing if all you're doing is teaching CPR, right? That someone actually feels like they learned how to think differently. So anyway, that feels good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. [00:19:59] </p>

<p>CLIENT: So if I feel like for doing that I can rise to the occasion because I know what I'm doing. And I have a track record for having success at it. Whereas here, I feel like, "Well, it's new every time, in a way I suppose, because it's whatever is popping in my brain." (pause) And math—it's something like, it's never easy. Even though I studied ahead and I know what he's going to talk about tonight. I've already done (chuckling) I've already worked ahead two chapters. I know what he's going to. I get it. I'm still prepared for the fact that I'm going to be sitting there going there going, "Huh?" even though I already know it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm like, "Oh brother." It's like I'm not being mad at feeling of two hours of like, I get it. I'm just sitting there. [00:21:07] (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're either (ph) sitting there and—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean with a group of people who also already know it. Not because they studied ahead but because they teach math. I mean they have degrees in mathematics, right? So, it's like, "All right, so I'm the guy who is—I don't have the math background in it." I keep putting myself in these classes where I'm trying to learn more. Half of my class is engineers. So they already have in them, from deep down, this math bias and this math training, which is fine. [00:22:00] That's good but it means I can't sort of show up there and like, "All right, I know a little bit more." Or somehow I always like I'm the one who is playing catch up because intellectually—I mean other people in the class really do know more—that's a fact—figuring out math. And there's a reason I didn't math earlier on. And there's a reason that they did do math. So I feel like, "OK, so I'm in a class with math people and I'm not a math person. And yet, I want to do math for some reason." </p>

<p>So I do well and I'm motivated and I do math my own way. And some homework is always three times as long because I write them out in longhand. And I write paragraphs for something other people could just write in a simple sort of math statement. I explain it. So feel like, "OK, so I'm the verbal person doing mathematics." [00:23:02] So I have kind of pictures and I just don't see a math statement as being all satisfactory. Well like, "It's true, I get it." But just to write it down doesn't help me or doesn't help the person who's trying to learn it. I'm teaching a class, it's on the board as if I am teaching a class how to do all the work. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was giving many examples: It could be done this way, it could be done that way. And my teacher is like, "You've got to be more concise." And I'm like, "Well, I can't because I'm teaching it to myself (chuckling) and then I'm redoing it as if I was teaching to somebody else."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea, yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not happy just doing it out just efficiently and in symbols. (pause) It's like every step and the logic has to be explained. Anyway—(pause) [00:24:00] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it does seem that what you're pursuing is—I was thinking in both the math and then teaching—that you're stewing away a feeling kind of—I mean good, feeling good. As you said, what kind of rallies you about if you were teaching a class today would be that you're going to walk out of there feeling like, "God, yea I feel exactly what, in one way, I want to feel. Good about myself, feeling I'm doing something right." </p>

<p>And yea, sometimes if the math class will let you have—well, you want to have that feeling in the math class sometimes. And I was also thinking, though, that last time you were here we were talking about some way—I mean I think we got pretty deep into it—some way in which you feel like you are not doing that at all with Barbara. [00:25:07] Some way in which we were talking about the whole, how much are you providing and all that stuff. And it makes you feel the exact opposite of that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. It does. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the energy, I was imagining too, which is still with it. That's a—(pause for two minutes) </p>

<p>CLIENT: [00:26:56w] Last week—because it popped into my head—I'm thinking (pause) well, there's a distinction, right? When I'm teaching, I'm actually out there in the world taking knowledge and verbalizing it. And when I'm doing math, I'm confronted with my own way of thinking. And it's entirely interior. And yet every Saturday, Carrie, Sarah (sp) and I meet, and we usually meet from like nine to four. So it's a full day at the science center and we just go through our homework even though we've already done it. And we just go through it. And I write every problem on the board, right? And so when you're on your own, when you get bored, where you start losing interests, you just stop and do something different. [00:28:06] When you're with a group and it just goes on and on, well it takes energy to just sort of see how they go about doing things and it takes energy to actually being with people. And also I feel like when I'm on my own, I'm doing the reading, I'm doing the thinking, I'm doing problems, I'm sort of crafting things. But now I'm doing it there and I find it really valuable because it's a good thing to do. You verbalize the stuff. But there's a sense of it too, of just like, "If I were on my own and they weren't here I would just stop and do something different." But they're there so what that means is there are periods of time where I'm just sort of like not fully with it. And they're working. And I'm sure it must happen from that I'm much more into it than they're less into it. [00:28:58] </p>

<p>But when I'm not fully into it, then it becomes me more as a sort of observer. And it's easier to get confused when they're writing a proof on the board because I'm not fully committed to it. And then there's that feeling of like, "I did this problem. I know how to do it. But right now I don't know how to do it. I'm watching Sarah (sp) write it up on the board. And I don't get it because I'm losing interest and I'm tired about thinking about mathematics. I'm tired of talking about math." Anyway, so there's that interior feeling of doing stuff and there's the (inaudible at 00:29:41) the public with people. And it goes on and on and you're in a small room. They have a chalk board instead of a dry erase board. There's something unpleasant in some way about chalk. [00:29:59] Even though it's a great color of chalk because I believe in colors on the board but dry erase is better. (pause) </p>

<p>And I'm thinking about Whole Foods yesterday. I went to Whole Foods—there's this woman at the gym what I've always taken notice of because she's really attractive and she's really good. She's a really good athlete and she's just there. (pause) So she's just in great shape, really attractive and she has this thing that she does. And you can tell that she must have been an athlete or is an athlete. I don't know. She's like 25. </p>

<p>So yesterday, Whole Foods. She's not wearing her tights and her running top. Instead she's wearing her glasses. I know she needed glasses. She's wearing glasses and she's wearing these—right, which are this sort of this maroon sweatpants. And she's wearing a cast, one of those walking boots on one leg. [00:31:12] So it basically includes a sweatshirt and she has her grocery cart full vegetables and fruit and so forth. And I expect nothing less. Of course you have fruit, vegetables. It would have surprised me greatly if she had Oreos in there, so whatever—foods and so forth. </p>

<p>So I noticed that and but I'm with Barbara. Normally I would be very social and like, "Oh, nice chin, what happened?" But I was deliberately not making eye contact or saying anything to her. I've never spoken with her. It's like be around whole foods and you have to recognize each other because we are always at the gym at the same time. Anyways, so I'm aware of—so that's sort of like in your life, outer world thing. [00:32:01] Like, I'm not—I mean, Barbara has no idea who this person is because Barbara often has no clue who people are which is amazing to me but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, what did you say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Barbara often has no idea who people are. And in the sense of she just doesn't recognize people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, like if she was in the same situation, she wouldn't recognize that person from the gym? Is that what you mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Well, she must recognize this person because she's also there but somehow Barbara is just—or she just didn't say anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, Barbara goes too. Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, yea, yea. No, no, so this woman, whoever she is, is often at the gym when I'm at the gym. And sometimes that means when Barbara and I are also at the gym. So what I'm saying is that Barbara is likely to recognize this person or should.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just as easily as you would. [00:33:00] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Just as easily.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got it. But she wouldn't—</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. (chuckling) OK, got it. Yea, interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm like—but I can't like—that's just going to create weirdness if I'm like, "Hey." So I'm like, "Oh brother." So I have to like go around Whole Foods pretending I don't know this person. And I'm thinking—and I know she knows who I am because I'm a pleasant enough guy and I'm there and we're sharing the same space—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —eight hours a week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it—what if you said, "Hi," or what's the fantasy of what would happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because Barbara is like she's always on a mission, right? And so things are often (ph), they just seem like a distraction. And she often finds me being social or something, as like, "Who's that?" or just being neighbors. Like, I know everybody on the street. [00:33:58] And she's—so I talk about this person or that person and she goes, "Oh." Or I wave at somebody and she goes, "Who's that?" Like she's in her own little world and I don't know if she cares to be connected with that many people around us whether they are at gym or on the street. Anyway, so there's that, thinking mystery woman and there you go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because to her she'd be like, "Who are you talking to?" that kind of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. Not in a judging sort of way. Just genuinely like, "Who is this person?" It's like, "I just don't want to feel like dealing with that. If I'm by myself, easy, easy, just start talking."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's that. (pause) I don't know. What else is going on? I mean, I guess there's sort of like things are just sort of odd. [00:35:10] Like going to the post office is odd. Being at Whole Foods with the mystery woman is odd. Having to talk about every Saturday and going in and out of math consciousness is sort of like—I don't know. And just getting going to class and feeling not on, the need to get tires for the car and tires aren't cheap. I just learned that. But you hear these sayings, right? If you listen to sports radio, you know all about NT and Town Tires because they advertise a lot, right? And NT has this thing, "Buy three, get four," and Town Tires, "We won't be beat," right? [00:36:03] So it's sort of like you got wait for the NT sale where you buy two, get four, right? (inaudible at 00:36:09) would that be because they do that on some occasion. </p>

<p>So I go to Mercedes because I get a brake light, so that's 12 bucks which is well spent at that dealership because they're very nice and they actually will put it in for you. Unlike the other one, Mercedes- it's like they have to drive the car back and they charge you for a half hour of labor. It's like, "Give me a break." But this place is fantastic. You drive in, offer you coffee, you buy the bulb, some guy in a white coat, "No problem Mr. Lionel (sp), hop in." Free. It's very nice. </p>

<p>So, how now much are tires? And it was like nine twenty. [00:37:03] I'm like, "You've got to be kidding me." So I said, "All right, well thanks." So on the way back, you go down that drag. And so I'm driving along and there's an NT. I go into the NT. So this is Friday. Friday? I don't want to say Friday, Friday. So I go into NT, they're busy. I'm sitting in the car. I'm doing my math waiting for the guy to come out. He comes out. He goes, "Do you need new tires?" And I said, "Yep." So I get out of the car. So he goes, "Yep." He goes, "Pretty old. You don't see the air in." And I thought, "That's pretty funny." So then he's looking around me and he goes, "Well." He goes, "I'll tell you, Mercedes and Michelin, a match made in heaven." He goes, "You need to get Michelins. You had Michelins, you need to get Michelins." I said, "All right, fine." [00:38:00] He goes, "We don't have these. They don't make them anymore. But now there's a new version of this which is better. They're called the Michelin Primacy." I said, "All right, very good." I don't know anything about tires. All right, fine, whatever. So we go in, da, da, da, da, da. He prints this whole thing out, 870 dollars. And I'm looking at it: 12 dollar disposal fee, 15 dollar installation fee, each tire is worth 160 dollars. And I'm like, "Your [ad that's on the radio] (ph) because this is the weekend. You buy two, you get four." And I'm like, "This is 50 less than Mercedes." I mean, what's the big savings, right? </p>

<p>I didn't say this to him. I wasn't feeling like being confrontational. I just sort of thought, "Well, oh well. Whatever, if that's what he says it is that's what it is." And I said, "Well, all right. So I said, "Just schedule it for tomorrow morning. [00:38:59] And I said, "What time what time do you want me to be here?" He said, "Seven." I said, "All right, fine, seven." [00:39:02] All the while, realizing it's like, I'm probably going to cancel this because—but whatever, at least it's there. It's set, which I cancelled. </p>

<p>Go down the road, one block, get to BJ's. Go into BJ's, they have a tire center. Go in, sit down, it said Michelin Primacy. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 650. I'm like, "What?" They said, "(inaudible at 00:39:29)" and I said, "Well, what about an alignment?" because the guy at NT said it's an extra 150 bucks and apparently the front of the two tires are towed in a bit, whatever that means. I mean, I know it means but I'm not sure why they are. I'm not sure why things would have gotten out of alignment. I think it's hard to do that even though it drives funny. </p>

<p>So he goes, "Yea, we don't do the alignment here but at Stone they do and that's an extra 100 dollars." And I said, "OK." I said, "Great." So driving down the road, do, do, do, do, do, do, thinking, "Hm," and irritated with NT thinking, "Why are they charging 200 dollars more for one." [00:40:09] </p>

<p>So now I went on thinking, "What a racket," and kind of irritated. Got to have two tires done and I have to have new tires. So I'm driving along, I'm thinking, "Well, I'll go to the Greek market on the way home. Buy some mizithra," because I like that Greek cheese on pasta. So I'm planning on going to the Greek market and then as I'm pulling in to the Greek market, I notice something right next to it. It's says, "Tires." And I'm thinking, "Well, that will be nice because why would I want to go to BJ's or Mercedes or NT, these massive companies. I can go to an independent, right, operator. Support the local economy." So I talk to the guy at Tires. [00:40:59] And I said, "I need four Primacy tires." And he goes, "OK." And he said, "That's 640." I said, "All right." And then I said, "And I also need to get an alignment. So what would that run?" And he goes, "No, no." He goes, "You come here and get the tires and I'll just do that." So then, "All right. Perfect." And I thought, "There you go, local guy," so, anyway.</p>

<p>So that's on my mind, thinking, "OK, I've got to get tires. There's no clear cut price or rationale as to why tires cost what they cost." And then I'm thinking, "But then so I'm likely to support the local guy and yet the local guy had one of these crew cuts like state troopers have? Like nearly bald with a little bit of tuff, a little of hair right there and he has tattoos. [00:42:03] And I'm thinking, "But the local guy might be some like (pause) Romney supporting Neo-Nazi because (inaudible at 00:42:19) that long. I'm like, "He's the local guy. Maybe I don't like the local guy." So then I'm thinking, "Well, maybe I should go to somebody in the area so they have the right politics. So I'm supporting a business that actually I'm happy for them to have the money." (pause) </p>

<p>Anyway, so I'm driving around in my car thinking, "I know that it needs new tires—so urgent," but before the winter hits, for sure. I'm thinking, "I'm not happy about having to buy tires." And then the guy at NT is saying, "You can get the Michelins." [00:43:06] He goes, "[That should be] (ph) and it just rides really well." He goes, "But you can get the BF Goodrich or Bridgestone." I forget what it is. He goes, "You know it is 50 dollars less per tire." He goes, "You'll notice it in the ride." And I'm like, "I don't know if I notice it at all." I have no idea. I mean, in Formula 1 you notice the tires. And it changes per lap and that's a big part of the strategy. Yea, tires matter in a Formula 1 car but I thinking, "On my car, really?" I mean, I'm not being—would I notice if I didn't have Michelins? I don't know. And he goes, "There the same company." He goes, "You can think of them in terms of Toyota versus Lexus." He goes, "Michelin is the Lexus and Bridgestone is the Toyota."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, say that again. The what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just all one company apparently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bridgestone and Michelin, or BF Goodrich. I forget what. It's a "B" tire. [00:44:06] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of those (inaudible at 00:44:06).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so if the Michelin is the Lexus, then the other is the Toyota.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway, so part of me just sort of feels like it's just another thing that I don't know about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I don't have the experience knowing about tires. And I feel like I should know about tires but I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because when I bought tires in the past, I don't even remember it. I would just go to a mechanic that I always went to and he'd say, "You need new tires." And I'm like, "All right, fine. I need new tires." And on the old Volvo it was like, gee, I probably only had to buy tires once in my life. I don't know. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it put you in this kind of state where you're like, "I don't know who to go to listen to. I don't know whatever..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. [00:45:01] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: "...trust to hear, who am I taking advice from." All this kind of—and feeling yourself, I guess in some way, out of sorts because you don't know. You don't know that material yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, yea, I don't know it. I don't know about tread, I don't know about brand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know about when you check the one line and print off prices and it shows up. So when they say, "This is what it costs, this is what I want it done for," because this thing is irritating. So after I found out that, in fact, I could get for 640 dollars four new tires and an alignment through Mr. Crew Cut at Tires, I then later in the day called NT. And said, "I had an appointment for seven in the morning. But I'm going to cancel that because I am surprised. I was shopping around and three other people said you could do it for 650 or less." And they said, "Oh, we beat any price. Just come on in and we'll do it for that price." [00:46:03] And I said, "But what's the advantage? Why should I come to you? I came to you and you saw me as a mark and said 850. So sure, you mark up and you will do it for 650 but why would I want to come to you?" He goes, "Well, we'll do it for 650." And I said, "Yea, but what's the advantage? What do you offer that all these other people don't?" So I'm getting like this thing, this "They don't care, right? They're NT, right? They sell gazillions of tires per year. But sort of like why is it there's two different prices. It's like, "We charge this, but oh, if you see some better deals somewhere else, then fine."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like, come on. It's like—I don't know. Maybe in the rest of the world, in bazaars in Africa for instance, it's all about bartering, right? And making a deal and driving the price down and that's what you do. [00:47:00] But here, I guess, I'm used to the price is the price. And all of a sudden here, it's sort of like, well, it seems very flexible when it comes to tires which seems like, well, they're a product like anything else. It's not like you can go into Nordstrom's and say, "Well, I really like this shirt but here, I'll give you 15 bucks for it." Anyway, it's peculiar to me. And also I don't feel like I have the knowledge to even begin trying to—(pause) I feel like I don't have the upper hand. Saying like, "No, not good enough."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, I know, yea, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't know what their bottom line is. I mean, maybe there's someone who will do it 550, it's like I don't know what their mark-up is. And bottom line is I don't want to spend anything on it but I don't want to be driving around with tires that aren't going to work in the winter time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. [00:48:08] Yea, but I know there's something about this kind of story I think is really important, because it seems to me like it's getting at another dimension of this issue of what it's like to not—I was thinking about the matter of like what it feel like when you're kind of not—when you don't know something in math and what kind of feeling comes over you, if you're struggling to get something or understand something. And it seems to me like knowing something in math has meant a lot to you in terms of it can be an aspect or test (ph) of your intellect. [00:49:05] But it seems to me like there's also something about you wondering—it can make you feel kind of vulnerable, I mean, in a subtle way. Like, "Yea, I could job (ph), they could screw my over, I could get hosed. There might be a much better deal out there somewhere." (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's a sense too, as you're talking, I'm thinking about this too. Thinking there's a right way to do something, right? And there's a right way when a receiver is running down the right sideline. And if you're a quarterback, you turn your head so you're not called for pass interference. [00:50:00] And I'm like, "How do they not know this? I'm not fast enough to play corner." But I'm thinking if I were fast enough, I would turn my head. Because it seems it has to be clear—it has to be obvious in some way—if you're that talented to know when the receiver is about to catch the ball because you have a fraction of a second. When the person does that, just turn and do that as well. Just mimic it. (chuckling) I'm thinking, "Why is it that the Patriots secondary?" It's like, it really does. It's like they're learning disabled in some way. And I feel like, "Oh yes that's strange." It's like every other quarterback in the NFL turns their head. Why don't the Patriot's turn their head? It's like, "How odd."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What's going on here? And I can't understand it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like, and again I don't know football, but—so I was thinking, "OK, I don't know the price of tires and I don't understand why these quarterbacks don't turn their head." [00:51:09] And why safeties are five yards from where they should be. It's like they've been playing football their entire lives and how is it that McCourty doesn't turn his head. It's like they wait for their receiver to catch the ball and then they try to get the ball away and tackle him. It's like they practice and practice and practice, practice. I mean, am I missing something? I mean am I? I mean it can't be that hard? You run fast, you look at their hips, and you know where they're going to turn. That takes talent. But if you're right with the receiver, step for step, turn your head. (chuckling) </p>

<p>And I'm thinking, "What am I missing in this (inaudible at 00:52:00) equation?" Because I mean, I must be missing something because I'm sure it either is far more complicated or there's something deliberate in the coaching. Saying, "Well, it's (inaudible at 00:52:13) on occasion but this, in the long term, is better if they just try to keep up." Given the talent that they have, it's better to just run fast and keep up with them than try to turn and get faked out for the long pass and yet, Seattle yesterday, what seven big plays, 20 yards or more. And somehow that and tires are the same level for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They can—I don't have all the information.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have all the information about tires. I don't have all the information about what the hell Belichick is doing with corner if they can't play corner when they're drafted in the first or second rounds. [00:53:01] They don't keep Carol (ph). It's the people in the fifth and sixth round and they do admirably, so yea. (pause) Yea. It's just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're not doing their job right or something. Is that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And there has to be an explanation. There has to be, right now, for why tire companies do what they do and it's not transparent. There must be some rationale, in terms of coaching, why they aren't doing what they need to do or Belichick is scratching his head as well. It's like, "I keep telling them to turn their head. They won't their head." But it seems to me that when Belichick says turn your head, then you turn your head because he's intolerant of people not doing their job. So I'm thinking, "What's happening here?" [00:54:01] It's such a glaring error. So get him off. </p>

<p>Tire people know what they're doing. Belichick knows what he's doing. Who am I, right? I'm not a tire guy. I'm not a football player. Who am I to criticize? I'm just on the outside. I'm not there at practices. I don't know. I don't know. There must be some logic in this. Like in playing chess, you can sacrifice pawns periodically for ultimately winning. Maybe in the long term, that sixteen game season, he's teaching them how to play. And for right now, the first half of the season, just keep up the receivers. Second half of the season, we'll deal with the turning your head issue. I don't know. Maybe it's the whole teaching thing. I don't know. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:54:53) Yea. I know we've got to stop in a minute. But I don't know why but the—I'll just say it because it's just in the air for me but like—might expand on this in some way. [00:55:06] But I was thinking about your dad and always in my image of him the way you've described him. It's not the complete story of your father but there's an element of your father that is always doing the thing he's supposed to be doing. Always doing the thing in a certain kind of sense that he knows what he's doing. He's doing it the right way. </p>

<p>And I was just thinking about that as an important kind of reference point for you and what it means to be a man in some way, I think. But I also think about the fact that some way he kept a learning disability, kind of a possible learning disability, in the shadows. And you've mentioned, sometimes, him sort of saying like—you sort of noting—sometimes he says a lot of things he claims to know but doesn't, you sort of wonder, "He doesn't seem to know anything about this particular matter." [00:56:07] </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then you discover later that, in fact, he's right. It's like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean, sometimes stories. Like a personal memory or something family stuff or friends of families.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:56:19) exaggerated (ph). But in terms of factual stuff, sometimes I feel like, "What the hell are you talking about?" I don't say that but I'm like, "Oh brother." And then evidently go on it and looking it up and I'm like, "How in the hell did he know that?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That he would end up knowing—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. That he's right more often than not. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea. (pause) [00:57:01] </p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I mentioned last time, for puzzle-y card things or playing Solitaire—which I have never played until last time I went out for Christmas because they were into it. And so I thought, "Well, actually I guess I'll learn how to play." So I actually got a Solitaire program on the Mac. I'm sitting there and thinking, "I don't know what's so great about this. Really this is not exciting." But then I started realizing that I couldn't win all the time. I just sort of thought, "Well, as long you're relatively intelligent you usually win." And then I'm realizing that it like, "No, usually you don't." And then I'm watching my dad and I'm noticing it's like he has like a 37 percent winning percentage. And meanwhile I'm down like eight. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're down what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like eight. (crosstalk) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Eight percent. [00:58:02] </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm thinking, "What am I missing?" And so he's watching me play. He's like, "No, no." And he goes, "That, that, that, that." Really? So my mom and dad have this like thing where they keep track. And my mom, who I think is like the brains of the operation, she's like way behind him percentage wise. I'm like, my dad is like is weird savant when it comes to (crosstalk) playing cards. Where does this come from? Like (crosstalk) there's something meditated about just sort of remembering, remembering, remembering. Remember where—OK last year there was a fish there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just look at a bunch of water. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a big river. It's a big—Colorado River is really long and yet within ten feet, it's another fish there. It's like this notch away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it's like he spends a lot of time just sort of meditating on things perhaps that I don't. [00:59:02] And we see him, he's just sort of off tinkering in the garage or staring watching NASCAR, cars go round, cars go round, cars go round. And he gets mad at Hendrick Motorsports or what Junior is up to or—he knows all of this stuff NASCAR and I was like, "Oh my goodness." Although I watch it because it's engrained in me, but I might (ph) fast forward it. Just for the yellows and wrecks and pit stops and then watch the last 20 laps just to know what's happening. And I find it boring and yet I'll call in. He'll know what's going on with the Patriots. How he knows, I don't know. (pause) And we'll talk Formula 1 so it's not like he's races but he knows what's going on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm just like when I'm around, he's not sitting at the computer all the time. [01:00:01] It's like where is getting all of this information?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crosstalk) He doesn't have a feed channel. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. I don't mean this literally but it's almost like he'd know about tires. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes, absolutely. No he'd definitely know about tires. Now I've not talked to him about it yet. And absolutely he'd know about tires. And I don't talk to him about it because I feel like I'll become very aware of the fact that he knows about tires and I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right, yea, yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I also like it's a moot point because I got to buy Michelin Primacy tires because that's what everyone says to buy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, right. But then it kind of might lead you to feel like there's something kind of for me that meant that I'm missing that kind of thing that my dad has. And that makes me more vulnerable person in the world in some really basic sense, I guess, like he—yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or he might just say, "Oh, just find the best deal you can find, doesn't matter. You just got the same tires, right?" [01:01:01] And then it's sort of like, "Huh." Like he sort of just accepts that reality because how many tires has he bought in his life, a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And me, I'm sort of like, "Well, that's a bummer." I mean, you just kind of find the best deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And feeling like, "Yea. The best deal." I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's simple.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I'm just used to things costing what they cost. You want an iPhone? Costs that amount no matter where you go which is that's what it cost. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You can look for sales (pause) about things you understand: shoes, and shirts, and whatever, computers. Macs don't go on sale. But tires, I don't know. Who knows? [01:02:01] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Do I have to get them rotated? I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like my car. The back pressure is different from the front pressure. It's like, "Are there different tires?" There are different tires. Front and back are different, whatever. I don't know why but there it is. (pause) Maybe you don't get Michelins and you'll notice, really? Anything has got to be better than what I have because they're well, you know. NT says, "You see the air and there's something in it," which is true. Like racing slits, that's one. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So Monday and then you'll figure out the next Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. All right, good enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, all right then. [01:03:01] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good to see you. Yes. </p>

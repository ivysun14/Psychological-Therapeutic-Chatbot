<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How'd you handle, um, [NAME OTHER]'s death?  Or how are you handling it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were starting to get a bit close to him too, though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] hospital for, uh, [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, because biopsy or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I'm not sure.  His body wasn't, uh, not processing calcium or over processing or something like that.  He was going to have those removed or altered in some fashion.  He was put in the hospital.  He went in a couple days before because he had a really bad upset stomach so he, kind of routine for a guy like [NAME OTHER], you know.  I get a phone call 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning, and it's a pastor with the [DEIDENTIFIED].  [NAME OTHER] has passed away, or maybe passed on.  I'm thinking [INAUDIBLE] I'm dreaming, cause I just, you know, the phone call woke me up [INAUDIBLE].  But then I talked to my mom, "he's gone"—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was she at the hospital?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  She works a whole lot in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I jump in a taxi and, you know, go see him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wasn't unexpected, I guess, just timing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it can happen anytime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was a nice guy though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he was.  [INAUDIBLE] to die on St.  Patrick's Day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good or bad?  I don't know.  Bad he died.  Maybe, uh, you superstitious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not as much as your mom?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, like if there were 13 cups on the counter, I probably wouldn't pick up the [INAUDIBLE], but, uh, just, just a little.  I don't know why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anyhow, you've struggled with depression, you know, for some time.  We kind of struggled trying to figure out how to help and get better and all, and what do think?  Where are you at now with the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it's getting better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not better, but [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So kind of rate it on a 0 to 10, 10 the happiest a person could be, 0 the saddest.  You're about a?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Six, 7.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Six, 7?  What do ya, what do you think you were a year ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know.  You, you seem to be gradually kind of coming up.  What about functioning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How so?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In terms of doing what you want to do, leading a normal life as you would define it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Think this is where you kind of planned to be at this point in your life?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  Some things that I really didn't have control over, like [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like [INAUDIBLE] just kind of happen—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, nothing I have very little or no control over, and that kind [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what do you have control over?  Yeah.  It's interesting you put it that way, that didn't have control over [NAME OTHER] dying or, you know, mom's dealings.  Of course you don't, because you don't have control over anything other than yourself.  We tried sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At least I know you have with your mom, tried to take care of things for her and help her so she's happy, and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were worrying about her.  When you make decision about yourself, you consider her first, how, how that's going to impart her and, but she has to make her own choices, as you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She does?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes without thinking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, uh, I remember, this was not that long ago, she was hell bent on getting a motorcycle and riding off into the sunset with [NAME OTHER].  And, you know, that's fine if, if you plan it out, financial backing and stuff like that, but she, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See you, you have consistently sounded like the parent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know if you don't think you necessarily act the role so much as you think the role.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess I get that from my dad, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Care, I mean, your mom's a caretaker, that's for sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She looks after people.  That's how she got with [NAME OTHER] to begin with, and then, but your statement right there sounds like a parent.  "Well, that's great.  He wants to", you know, like you.  "Oh, that's cool, honey.  You want to get on a motorcycle and get a girlfriend and travel the country.  How you going to pay for it?"  You know, "Oh, yeah, I didn't think of that."  But you're telling your mother.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  She told, then she brings up, [INAUDIBLE].  I'm thinking, "Yes, I know."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"I'm [AGE].  I can do what I want to do."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"I'm a grown woman," blah, blah, blah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  That's what I hear from [AGE].  "I'm an adult.  I don't have to answer to you."  Who, who's picking up the tab?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you don't have [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've been so, you've always been very logical in that regard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, 'cause it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Prepare—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For what may.  You do a lot of that, don't ya, in your head?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  I, I like to think about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like when she said that, the first thing that popped into my head was money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about when you make decisions, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How so?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You, you kind of go through a process that's difficult trying to decide whether you do A or B kind of thing, whatever it is, kind of waffle or look at the pros and cons.  You do that pretty extensively?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, sometimes over extensively.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Take a poll, see what other people think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and even after you make a decision, then doubt it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I have second guessed—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  "Maybe that's not great.  Maybe I'll just hedge on this one".</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do that all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that's what causes your mom frustration at times, 'cause you don't make decisions or you don't stick to them because you have doubts and don't want something bad to happen, don't want to make a mistake.  You're going to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no.  [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course we all do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We don't like it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Can't help it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You can learn from them.  Hopefully, not do it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If you're smart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Twice, 3, 4 times like so many do.  What do you do with your time these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, we're working on [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's why I was asking ya.  Is she on the phone out there with her business or your business?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Both our business.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What about dad?  I thought he was going to help.  He ever come through with that money he said he'd give ya—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course, you probably never really bugged him about it much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I, I don't want to, but it's, it's kind of like, uh, 'cause I'll, I'll go to his house [INAUDIBLE] you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but you've, you've never like, "Dad, you said you'd give me this money."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've brought it up maybe a couple times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I bet you never did directly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I think I did a couple, like, well when I would be, I would be like, uh, well, what he would do is, uh, I'd get a report cards, and he'd give me the copy of it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or write down, or pull out 1—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], "Hey, you had this report card [INAUDIBLE]?"  You know, "Oh yeah, I got that 1", but he wouldn't take the hint.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He didn't have to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean no hinting how he knew.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he all ready knew this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That he promised you X dollars, that he owed you X dollars—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he's not delivering on X dollars.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And he's not delivering on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See, that's a big problem that I have with my dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Conflict?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't want it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that is just, you know, if you, if you push it, he'll just walk out like a [INAUDIBLE], then, you know, won't talk to anybody, won't do nothing.  He'll be—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He'll be a business man, but it's, it's just kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you going to get the money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hate to say it, but it's in the will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, but I'm saying though that if you sit down with him, 1 on 1, and say here's the facts.  Are you, are you going to live up to what you said?  And he may shut down subsequently, but are you going to get the money if you do this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  What's he going to say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you've never done this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He'll bring up bills—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excuses for not giving it to ya, but, but the bottom line is you're not going to get it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably not.  I might.  He, he has surprised me before—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, uh, when we agreed on this, I got a report card.  I got 8 A's.  The next report card, I got 9 A's, which is 17.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] react and behave like a mature adult, but if he doesn't, that's his choice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, 1 time he handed me $1000 for good grades [INAUDIBLE] just cash, "Here."  I'm not saying he will do that, but it is a possibility.  He has been known—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But as a, an adult who's facing choices and responsibilities and, you know, needing to buy things and make plans, somebody that comes along with no money or $1000, that doesn't help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It doesn't help you.  You can't plan.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, some stuff, you know, I know [INAUDIBLE] some money, like a radiator in his car, you know, had a leak in it.  He had to get that fixed really soon, and that, that's fine.  That's, you know, emergency expense type stuff, but he's buying stuff like, you know, extra guitars—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  We're just talking about what he told you he would do—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And holding him accountable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just seeing that, "Okay, I believe ya, you know."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But his debts are irrelevant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I told him, you know, he knows that [INAUDIBLE] the debt he has first, and like, you know, I, I'm not going to charge him interest, you know, lower his credit score or something like that, you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You would never do this to him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, he'd hang my ass out to dry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It wouldn't matter.  You wouldn't do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not who you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I learned to pay it off quick and get it over with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I'm saying, if you promised your dad something, you'd give it, you'd deliver.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You, you wouldn't have lame excuses.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I don't know why, but you're right, I wouldn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  So why does he get off the hook?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  He's finally happy, finally happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  For once in his life, or maybe not once but a few times in his life, he just put himself before anybody else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's not happy because he's buying toys.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, he's happy because he's his own boss.  He does exactly what he wants to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And for some how.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He has his own house, own car.  He doesn't have to buy groceries for a [AGE] kid.  It's fine, you know, that's fine for the weekend, a few weeks, whatever, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, why isn't he accountable and responsible?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because no one holds him accountable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You can't hold him accountable, you really can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know.  Maybe you're right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You could try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Certainly won't if you don't try, and you, 'cause you don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You could try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you concerned that if you were to have this kind of talk with him and get it settled, that he would, uh, want his getting quiet and withdraw, and he's going to cut you off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that a possibility, though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a possibility, but I don't think he'd do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not thinking, thinking you may not do it, and probably won't, there's a difference in, for instance, uh, your mother.  If you had this kind of conflict with your mother, you know she would not cut you off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She can get angry—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you know she'll be there, and [INAUDIBLE] dad stands is, I understand that.  When'd you last see him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I went up there for a weekend not too terribly long ago.  I went, wait, I went up there [INAUDIBLE] before that.  It was a, right after the bike week at [DEIDENTIFIED], 'cause I remember talking to 1 of the coworkers at the restaurant that he plays at.  Her and her husband had just gotten back from biker week at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, he rides a bike, your dad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's got a little PT Cruiser and is happy, but it was right after [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You been anywhere this summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I went to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Me and mom and [NAME OTHER] went.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Good time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  We stayed for 2 day, or 3 days, 2 nights.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, you know, we stayed all on the beach [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What'd you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got sunburned like nobody's business.  I mean, I got about as red as that fire truck there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you, did you leave your, uh, gothic dress at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't dress like this on purpose.  It just kind of happens.  I pulled out a shirt or a pair of pants—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I was just wondering.  You wear black to the beach too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't really care.  I mean, black is black, white is white.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's awfully hot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't bother me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You getting out very much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Girlfriend or friend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just a friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No romantic interest?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not with her.  Well, you know, we're brother and sister practically, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Any romantic interest anywhere?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kind of working on 1?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] option.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is she local?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your age?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not too much younger?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  No, [INAUDIBLE].  I like people in my own ballpark.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you going to do—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't have a car, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I understand.  I didn't know.  Are you, uh, what are you planning for the fall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going to try, depending on the car, depending on if we move or not.  If we could, you know, move really [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some recruiters?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sell the house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How'd she get the house?  The house, did dad take care of that yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, uh if I get a car, which is, it seems like we're on the last steps, and there's 1 more little tiny thing that has to be done, and then we do that, and there's 1 more delay, just dah, dah, dah, but get a car.  I'm probably just going to wait for a while, or at least work like 2, 3 days a week, build up some money [INAUDIBLE].  I tried to enroll—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I applied for FAFSA.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Put your financial aid statement in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Put it in, and then the whole PIN number, got the whole PIN number, you know, my dad sat down and did it last year.  Gathered it, you know, like just to make sure that everything was done right.  [INAUDIBLE] checked it, all this other crap, and, uh, sent it in to the place.  Never heard from them.  We got, the way it looked, we got the confirmation saying yes, we have received the application and stuff like that.  [DEIDENTIFIED], I think I've enrolled there twice under 2 different names.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	First as [PATIENT NAME]; then as [PATIENT NAME], 'cause I got 2 emails, 1 to [PATIENT NAME], you know, [PATIENT NAME], you know, 2 different confirmation numbers and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER]'s looking to sell the house, and you're looking to move where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About 100 yards that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you going to stay in town?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we got to get [DEIDENTIFIED] straight.  Now, is that really something you want to do?  You ready to go to school?  Take all those kind of classes that you hate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, I stunk at math.  If I can just get through the hard math, then I'll be okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you going to study?</p>

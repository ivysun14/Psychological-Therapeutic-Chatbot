<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right, let me find your chart.  Ah, here it is.  Okay, so I saw you on [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have something to give you.  I can give it to you at the end.  It's something for, well, how old is your son?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's [AGE], he'll be [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.  You have one son?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One son and two daughters.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Well, I think this is most likely for a son.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Let me see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wanted to bring it more around the time of [DATE] and I couldn't see you then.  And they were out of these.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is so adorable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What a lovely book.  Lemony Snicket, that's the, uh, I like Lemony Snicket.  That's the, uh, series of unfortunate events.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, how great.  Oh, this is great, I'm going to read it with him.  The girls too, I'll read it with the girls.  But it says a Christmas story.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They call it that, but that's what makes it a joke too.  They say also Christmas story.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A Christmas story for Jewish people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, mainly they're talking about, you know, what happens on Hanukah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, oh, that's lovely.  Thanks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the [INAUDIBLE] has to do with an imitation of what happens when they try the locket.  They put it down there, you know, make all that noise and that's so funny.  So, anyway, I put it in here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you very much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It even has a napkin [INAUDIBLE] cover it up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I won't even take it out of this one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The thing is that they were out of it for quite a while because it was a very big seller.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's such a popular, yeah, wow, it's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I found a way to get it but then I didn't see you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, let's, um, let's do our work and then we'll do the chatting stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But first, you know, we've got work to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I saw you [DATE].  You restarted the Lexapro three weeks before that.  So let's say around Thanksgiving you had restarted the Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And I take 5, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just take 5 now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mood had lifted.  Anxiety was much lower.  You're not suicidal, not hopeless or helpless, your sleep and appetite were fine, self esteem was fine, but even so at that point we decided to add the [INAUDIBLE] again, right?  Our good old friend that no one knows what it is except [DEIDENTIFIED].  Okay, so how have you been in these two months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mood wise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mood wise.  I guess I'm kind of up and down.  And it depends, what really it depends on a good deal of the time is how my work is going.  And I realize that my own, my self esteem is always connected to my work.  And it could be whether my work is going—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Too connected.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Too connected.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In a way, yes.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'd be nice to have a bit of a more stable core.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  But sometimes I really do have a stable core.  And I don't know where it comes from.  I don't know whether it comes from talks you and I have, which I think is a big part of it, you know, 'cause it makes me think about what am I depending on, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  It's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That, you know, that's stupid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm okay despite what the world throws at me.  I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I mean, the personality theorists talk about that being a very early childhood challenge.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, trust or whatever, it's very deep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, it is, very.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so your mood's been up and down and you're highly, what we say, narcissistically vulnerable.  Right, you're?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hate that word, but yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a bad word.  I'm not calling you a narcissist.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know you're not, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the narcissistic defenses are the ones that are so highly sensitive.  [INAUDIBLE] so sensitive to the narcissistic injuries, the narcissistic gratifications that the world throws at us, then, you know, and I mean wouldn't it be nice if we could all be like Einstein who didn't care what the world threw at him.  He knew he was okay.  But, you know, and everyone has it to some degree or more or less.  It's nice to have less of it than more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, 'cause you're not then so dependent upon something that's really so, you know, it's so, uh, weightless.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and it's almost irrelevant.  It makes you fragile.  It makes your self esteem fragile and dependent when it shouldn't be, especially someone who's the stature that you are.  Now of course when I say this, it'll be a narcissistic gratification and I don't even want you to feel good about narcissistic, you know, I'm asking you to be resistant to both sides.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the narcissistic gratifications and to the narcissistic injury and to own a solid sense of who you are separate from them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's really the key to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The key is to not feel so good when they give you all these accolades that you're the greatest.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even though it's nice to feel so good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's nice, but you can't, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That you feel so good means that you're going to feel horrible when you have the narcissistic injury.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What you want to do is be a little less narcissistically vulnerable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And I should, you know, what I try to aim for is that core place that kind of stays tough and it doesn't wobble around so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you ever found that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's, it's so complicated to answer that because I, uh, sometimes when things happen a lot and they happen in a quality of what feeds it, means a lot to me.  But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That doesn't make sense to me.  What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, see, like if somebody says that you're the best therapist I ever saw and then they say something that denies that I'm the best therapist they ever saw and then I figure they're lying to me, you know, and why are they trying to make, [INAUDIBLE].  What do they need out of me?  Then I think why are they giving me this, you know, bologna.  And I haven't yet, I hadn't yet, um, settled on what it takes for me to feel kind of solid, you know, and where I don't have to keep feeding myself more, more, and more and more.  Like for instance, it's, uh, sometimes, you know, when people call me and want me to do something, they want me to, they want to see me for therapy, but the therapy involves a way of working or something to do, that I'm really not prepared at this time in my life to do it.  It needs to be something I can do like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you mean, take on new patients?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Or certain kinds of patients.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  So you screen a little?  Your threshold for taking on a patient's a little high?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because, well, especially you, your kind of treatment, you get really in there with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, uh, intensive process.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Interesting thing that the kind of people that I get in some ways they're more valuable in a way than a lot of other kinds of patients because I know that there are so few people who know how to work with them and help them in the proper way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I had this one experience where it must have been about six months ago and, um, uh, a person called me, said they wanted to see me.  They came with two friends who are very well known people in the gender field.  These two women were a disgrace and calling him him though—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was a her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was a, well, he wanted to be a her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyway, the thing there happened was he came, at this moment we're calling him he when I talk about him, but he, I really believe that he's a she.  And he came with these two women who were also hims who are shes.  And they're very smart, the two women who came with.  And they, he told me that he's, he got married, he got married to a woman who's a woman and that they had a very good relationship and then they got, and they lived together for about five years.  And then they, um, and then they had a baby.  And I said how did you have the baby?  And they said, you know, they adopted the baby or he said, well, [INAUDIBLE] way so that the woman, the he who is a she—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The woman who is divorcing, too many [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So and what they came to see me for was the person who was a, um, who is really a gender female and that was born a male, it's a very, very fine kind of, she's a very, very fine kind of person.  And, um, she really didn't have so much ire against the person who's a wife.  But she had a lot of beefs against him.  And what happened was they had been married ten years and the first five were good, and, you know, they were normal people to each other.  But also before they got married they were wonderful female, a wonderful female couple.  And that's where the husband had his experience with being an acceptable female.  Anyway, so then the wife, she decided, what happened to her is she got diabetes after they got married.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm losing the, where this came from.  What was the reason we're talking about this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wanted to tell you why, what I felt bad about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause they wanted me, they came to me and what they wanted was somebody, 'cause she is suing, she is suing him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, so you realized this was going to be a complicated.  Now how'd you get this much of the story?  You saw them one time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I saw, yeah.  And the person who was a natural man but wants to live as a female and they're up for divorce.  And the wife who became blind and diabetic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, and he was, the husband was actually nice to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, she said I don't want to live in this house.  He said, well, you can't, you don't have to leave here, you know.  And he was very nice, very decent about things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So but she didn't want to.  She wanted to make a lot of trouble for him, so that he, see—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She couldn't accept him as a woman?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Couldn't accept him as a woman and couldn't accept the fact that if he lived more as a woman he was going to make less money on his job.  And he was a very, very good worker on his job.  He was a machinist.  He was making a lot of money.  And then when he decided to live as a female, the job wasn't easy anymore because all the people who worked on the job made fun of him and, uh, and he—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you decided that this is more than you were willing to take on at this point?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, what they, no, what, almost, almost, that's the thing.  So what, when the wife got a lawyer and she said that what she had to do is have somebody who knows how to write a paper that will say, see, they were trying to accuse him of being a fake gender person so that he didn't have to give her anything.  And he didn't want, that wasn't what he wanted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Is that true though, that if you're a gender person you don't have to give alimony?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it wasn't, but if he was a true gender person they would think that he could get it because what he was doing, I mean, he was claiming that the fact that he was making less money was true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So and what she was trying to prove that he's not, he's not making—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's just lazy and he's, uh, calling it gender.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yes, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so they wanted somebody who knows a lot—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you didn't want to be that person?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You didn't want to be that person?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], no, I like doing that.  And I wrote the letter.  I wrote the letter to verify that he's a he.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is a true gender person?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, and that's what I intended to do for him only.  And then I gave it to the lawyer he had and she thought the letter was terrific and she had to give it to them and they had a hearing.  And then she kind of got the, I don't guess you want to come and be in the, you know, in, uh, you know, in court.  I said no.  I said, I did that a lot of times and it's very hard to do when you don't feel, you know, keen effort.  And I said I don't want to do that.  But I will, I wrote a, you know, a thing for him.  I feel I'm taking good care of him.  And I liked him.  He's a very nice person.  He, she, whatever.  And then they got there at his first hearing, she couldn't get somebody who would go to court for him.  And then she calls me up and she says he has to be in court in three days and we've got to do this for him.  I said I can't, I really can't do it.  I don't have the strength for it, and also they [INAUDIBLE] four hours out of town and he'll be in the courthouse probably, that's two hours out of town, and I can't do it.  I've done it before and I know that it's a hard job, but I didn't mind it as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.  Well, maybe you weren't that attached to this person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I was, but I also knew that this is not for me, that's part of it.  I mean, what I have done [INAUDIBLE] and probably I was more of it than anyone they could find.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So but then she said but you got to do it, you got to do it.  He'll be in court two days, three days.  And I was very upset with her.  And I said, you should have told me.  I said, you didn't tell me that this was going to, I'm the only one who could do it.  And so from the wife's point of view I, you know, [INAUDIBLE], I felt bad for the person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, I felt maybe I should have been more clear that I was not going to go to court.  And then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you will be in the future now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you'll be up front about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, listen, I don't think you should feel so bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I did feel—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a lot to ask someone to do.  It's a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know it is 'cause I've done it before and I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can see you charge a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, does he have a lot of money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  He doesn't have a lot of money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I mean, when lawyers do things like that they just charge a fortune.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	His lawyer, you know, [INAUDIBLE], I said what did your lawyer say?  And he said to me, he said, I don't know, I can't talk to her?  Why can't you talk to her?  She, every time I call her, she charges him by the minute.  And I said, she's a bitch, you know, that's a terrible way to do it.  Yeah, that's terrible.  I said, what would happen if I called her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He would get charged.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what he said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He would get charged for the call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He said even if I didn't make the call, he didn't make the call, she would charge him for my call.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyway, so that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, listen.  I got my work to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you sleeping okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I am sleeping okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your energy like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's up and down because actually when I'm taking some kind of thing like the, um [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And one time I didn't have any [INAUDIBLE] and I took those—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Provigil?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I can't get the Provigil 'cause it costs so much money now.  Here I bought those kind of coffee things that you can buy in the drugstore.  And they work fine.  I mean, I don't want to take them every day, but they do work because they're pure coffee.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Caffeine pills.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hm?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Caffeine pills.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what they are.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, are you exercising at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I go to this physiotherapy place and I do that.  And, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you suicidal in any way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you helpless or hopeless?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, that's a good question because sometimes, I'm never hopeless, never, that's one thing.  But I feel helpless a lot of times because I have arthritis and some things I can't control.  And my husband is being really great about that because he left his job because he had been there for twelve years and he said he just didn't want to work there anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he said now that he didn't have to go to this job every day, he would take me wherever I need to go.  I used to take taxis everywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, so that, you know, but it's, I don't like to depend on him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You guys getting along nicely?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we do, amazingly.  I mean, we get, sometimes we get kind of edgy because he likes his way a lot and I don't mind giving it to him because I think he's usually very fair and he's very giving.  But sometimes he's very, um, he's very, um, what's the word, I want to say like a prima dona, but then we made up, we have never really gone to sleep mad.  And that was very good.  And, um, but I don't know.  I feel that all my [INAUDIBLE] comes out when I'm feeling the way I'm feeling and he's home and all of that because when he used to go to work every day all day it was, anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, when I see you last time we had pushed the Lexapro up to 10.  Then you went back down to 5?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I never left 5.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You stayed at 5.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Correct.  And I feel so far that it's been enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Five's enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And 10 may make you a little too flat?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, a little too, yeah, that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hold on a second, let me see what that is.  Okay, thank you.  Sorry about that.  Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll tell you one interesting thing that I did.  There's a women who goes to shul with me and she's a teacher at the, [INAUDIBLE], she's terrific and a very, very good friend.  And she also does, uh, the tarot cards.  You know what they are?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she said—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm not much of a believer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, you can believe what you want about it because you read into it, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So anyway she said to me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She did your reading, she did a reading for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she said to me did you ever have tarot cards read?  And I said, no, and she said, I said do you do them?  And she said yes I do.  And she said if you want I'll read them for you.  And so we made this plan and I met her in the morning after we came out of shul and we sat in the restaurant there and it was just she and me, and, um, and she put out all these cards.  And so she said you know how they work.  And she told me what you do, so on and so forth.  And then she said to me, um, what do you think you most want to know?  And I said, well, I said, the thing I feel the most troubled with, I said, it's the whole idea of dying.  That's the thing that scares me the most.  And it scares me the most because I know there's nothing I can do about it except try to live a good life and I get a lot out of going to shul.  And I go to shul every morning.  I try hard not to miss any at all.  And, um, I said but, you know, I still can't work with the whole notion of I don't know what, you know, what I'll die from.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is what you told her when she said what do you want to know about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How did she respond?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She said, oh okay.  You know, she treated it like this is something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  That's [INAUDIBLE], that's what we have to work with, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So then we went through a lot of the things that they use.  Did you ever see one working?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're terrific.  And if you [INAUDIBLE] they know what to read into it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And anyway so they had names on the major pieces.  And then they had things that too hard to explain it because I don't know it yet well enough to tell you about it, but I, uh, I've only had it done once.  And she's very good I know because she, well, she's just really good.  So at the end of it I said what do you think I could get out of this?  You know, when you see what I was talking about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What I named and when I said this and that, she said, well, she said when you first, when we first started you said that you were, the thing you were most scared about and most concerned with is about dying.  And she said, you know, to a great extent we have no control over dying.  I mean, sometimes you think you have because what you're concentrating on is only what you're thinking about in your head and you don't know where it's going to come from.  So and then she said at the end what do you think you got out of this?  I said to her, well, I said, what I realize, I said, from what I got out of this was that I need to concentrate on my work because when I concentrate on my work, it's something that I can control and then I realize that the more I work and the more I enjoy my work and the more I do good work, the more I live on after I die.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So it's funny.  You tell me everything you said and nothing that she said really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I can't tell you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fine, but that's what I'm more interested in.  I really don't care what she said, I care about your insight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, that's what I did tell her.  That's what she asked me.  See, to really know what she does, she, because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's less interesting to me.  What you told me is interesting to me, her part of it is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well, her part of it at this stage in my working in it is not so interesting to tell someone else because it's what you do when you're putting out the, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER], you know, she recovered from her—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Is she in remission?  She's all, she's okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's all finished.  Not only in remission.  She [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's a miracle.  It's an absolute miracle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It really is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hm?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And her doctor said that's it, fine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, fine.  In three months she has to go back and they will keep touch with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, they'll keep an eye on things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And in some ways it did her a lot of, I don't know whether to say it did her a lot of good, because then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe it humbled her a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it did.  It did because it made her more, a nicer person, more thoughtful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You didn't tell her that, did you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you tell her that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You going to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you going to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so, yes.  I am going to tell her.  But it means, you know, it means opening a big jar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You better be ready for, uh, [INAUDIBLE] conversation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I am ready for that.  And I think that I spent too much time avoiding her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Um, but anyway, but, you know, she's been doing [INAUDIBLE] and she took it up the way she takes up anything.  She has been doing a lot of volunteer work for Obama.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And, you know, she would go out on the street and standing and talk with the [INAUDIBLE] getting things—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  So she's a big Obama, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, fan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Obama mama.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and last weekend they went to Virginia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He blew out Virginia.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, that's right.  And they got the most votes and everything from Virginia and she was so thrilled that she was there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's a grassroots, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is a wonderful thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you in favor of him, you like Obama?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Right from the start.  I was the first one in my whole group.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you liked, not everyone wants him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  And I liked him from the start.  And everybody would say, well, you know, I don't know, kind of like him, but somehow I don't trust him.  And I said to the first group that said that to me, I said, can you tell me anybody, anybody who is running for president that you can trust?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	McCain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can trust McCain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't trust anybody who's a Republican first of all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  That's not a fair, that's almost racist of you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a bit of bigot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The X, right next to the X.  Um, you know what bothers me about Obama?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that he's my age, you know.  He's like mid forties.  He's too young.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the only thing is, you see, I think that if he lives through this I, my fear is that he will get assassinated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because he's black.  And because they did that to someone like, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was a long time ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Doesn't matter.  I mean, they had that viciousness against blacks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the, and all the Kennedys and the Kennedys in politics were not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, well, that's interesting.  I kind of like McCain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't, I really don't get interested in many non—Democrats.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you're a good [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And because I'm Jewish.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.  There's Democrat and left of Democrat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the truth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And one more.  That X also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Should I put—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can just scribble it.  No, you can just scribble it.  No one cares.  They don't read it.  In fact, what I don't like about it is that it takes away the anonymity by it so that's why I usually have people just scribble it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I don't care about that part of it anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right, well, listen, as far as our choices go, I don't think I want to increase your dose, but if you felt you needed a little bit more of the Lexapro you certainly could use more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Well, the thing I also don't know, I don't really know how to take it so that you get the ultimate benefit.  You know, they say on the thing that you can take it anytime of the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, doesn't matter when.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And yet there must be, you know, some time that is better for some people than others.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, it doesn't matter.  It's not like Valium or an aspirin, it works in long term kind of way.  I have some 30, 30 of them for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What is that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's your medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.  Lexapro?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Let me just—</p>

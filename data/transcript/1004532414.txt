<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) (pause) (sigh) So the spring concert was so exciting. I couldn't even see my kid. Ya know they were on the floor (pause)...whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He knows I was there so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I get credit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It screws up my whole day cuz Jess (clears throat) first she asked me yesterday to pick up...if I could pick up Ian from school and I was like no, cuz we're having a visitor's day at E&G, and I went back to the office and I got zero work done and, um, thinking oh I could get it done today, this afternoon. And then last night she was like can you pick up Ian? So...I had to pick him up at 2:30. So gives me a short period of time to get some stuff done but I have like three titles done today, and I've...only one of em's done and I just started one a half hour ago. (pause) I don't know (pause). Jess's driving me crazy. [00:01:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With the kid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just...now she...ya know...at first she wants to switch him. Now...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 'kay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...she wants to keep him at where he is. You know it's like every day it's different. Because they had like a little family coffee, you know where like six sets of parents show up and...saying how it's the only school in Plymouth that has a science fair. So now all of a sudden Jess's like wow, they are doing these special things, you know just...I just keep quiet. She just can't make a decision and stick with it. (pause) Think officially we've gone a year without paying the mortgage (pause) which, um, they called me asking me for more documents and I just am no longer (pause) I just can't deal with it, ya know? Supposed to...the lease for her..., the Plymouth house is in Jess's name and since she's not on the loan they want it in my name, so Jess's...I haven't even told Jess she has to do this but now she's got to go and get a lease in my name...[00:03:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (clears throat) I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...with all the tenants signing it. And, um they want a copy of the lease, which I don't know where that is (pause) and then proof of the payments of the Plymouth rents which I should have cuz Jess gave me um (pause) her bank statements so I could do the IRS stuff, which I haven't done, kind of half-assed on getting information to my CPA for taxes and (pause) I don't know it's just (pause)...I just feel beaten. I'm not, not making any traction with anything ya know, just (pause)...it seems like I'm um, the more I try to move forward the more I go backwards, ya know. (pause) I mean I've got...she said...she goes and she buys flowers for the house after calling me a week earlier about how she's gonna have no place to live. She's now spending money on flowers...[00:04:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to plant in the ground. Ya know it's like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know...and I bet they're gonna just sit there on the table and never get planted, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and die...um...and they're all like, ya know, beginning of the spring daffodils, those little purple things, ya know, things that come up ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and are usually dead by now, so I don't know (pause). Whatever happens with that house, her parents need to step up and lend her some money or...I know her brother's got an equity line with nothin' on it but ya know...I could care less what happens to the house, ya know, but I just...it's too big a deal to her. I have no idea where I'm gonna live, ya know (pause). She has no communication whatsoever with the mortgage company on the short sale so who knows when that's gonna happen. [00:05:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and um (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is the condo?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The condo, yeah. Which as soon as we sell that, there goes the money...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to pay for my rent. I'm already once again a month behind cuz I didn't have any work. Finally had that closing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good. [00:05:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and um....they e-mailed me late yesterday to change something and um...these fucking...these lenders are the same. They have no fucking clue what they're doing. There's a third page of the settlement statement now which compares the numbers that were given to you up front in the good faith estimate and the numbers as they are on the settlement statement. Well, it just happens that every once in a while the numbers change from what they have in their closing instructions for the settlement statement to what, you know...like they were a dollar off on title insurance. So I put the number that's on the settlement statement, not the number that's in the closing instructions and without fail they always correct it and say you have to follow the instructions and it's like, you let me change the fee and ya know...you're...you're obedience to the closing instruction is causing a, ya know, RESPA violation, which they can get fined for ya know. [00:07:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have my paper trail...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They wanted it that way, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just...the only reason I was late yesterday was to make that change and I e-mailed her back this morning and she's gone...she's not in today...and then she gives an e-mail address that's wrong for the person who's covering for her so that got kicked back to me. [00:07:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like every little thing ya know just...just takes more effort than it should have to take (pause). I have soccer practice tonight, soccer game tomorrow, then I gotta go finish those two titles, then there's the fundraiser for the farm (pause). I like laid down in bed at like 7:30 last night and fell asleep just exhausted. I was on like a mini eating binge where they um...there was a group training in Pembroke and they had all these sandwiches so I ate like five sandwiches and then came home and I had cheese left over from the...we had a board staff potluck at the farm so I bought this cheese, so I had a bunch of cheese, and then yesterday at the E&G visitor day they got a bunch of sandwiches and nobody ate sandwiches so I ate like three, ya know, wraps. Then I get back to the office and there's still two more sandwiches left so I ate two more sandwiches, came home and ate more cheese, just (pause)...normally I don't get anything any more at the restaurant but I got a scone because I'm dying of hunger (pause) [00:09:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (clears throat) (pause) Dying of hunger eh? [00:09:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (chuckles). (pause) Just starving. And I was doing so good, too, losing weight and eating right and then (pause) I don't know just...everything's just so (pause)...it's become...ya know the...it's like everything's is like a chore, ya know. I was in the office on Wednesday for the whole day and so it's like I put in a full day of work for the first time in quite some time and it was just drivin' me nuts. I mean, ya know, it's just (pause) the phones ringin' and people are e-mailing me, I'm tryin' to get stuff done. Just trying to figure out what I don't have to do that I can procrastinate on like these titles, then I realized that one of 'em...they all were due today, and one of 'em is...I had to go to Walpole. So I went to Walpole yesterday morning, then drove all the way out to Wareham and then to Pembroke and then back to Andover and that's why I was so fuckin' tired. Spent all day in the car and when I was in the car I was eatin' sandwiches...oh yeah and I went and I had breakfast, um, shitty breakfast at Burger King yesterday and McDonald's...I went to McDonald's after my closing, um, Wednesday night, so I've just been (pause)...I keep wondering to myself if that falafel place over there...if they take credit cards? [00:11:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Falafel place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like Falafel Corner or...it's right there on, um, on the corner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) the falafel place on the corner.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's what it's called, Falafel Corner or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's the burrito place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's next to...it's a couple door's down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. It's like across the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Across from the garage. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ian is sleeping over tonight and Jess wants me to give him a bath because he's going to be out on the grass playing soccer. I said I don't want to give the kid a fuckin' bath, ya know? My tub's dirty. Just put bug spray on the kid. She doesn't want to put the bug spray on though because it has DEET and so she's got some other stuff, ya know, that probably doesn't get rid of ticks, ya know, it's like...[ ]0:13:07.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a shower?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. I guess he could take a shower. It's just ridiculous. It's like, ya know, I've got my own fuckin' life without getting Lyme disease, ya know. So she got it. I don't know how she got it or why she got it or, ya know, but she got it, ya know. I've been bitten by ticks before. They have to be on for 24 hours to get Lyme disease...just...she's just a fuckin' crazy woman, ya know. She makes everything extra difficult. Changes her mind on everything, emotionally unstable about these fuckin', ya know the house and the short sale and ya know like (pause)...I don't know. She's just drivin' me nuts. I'd like to have...I just want to pick up and move somewhere else but I can't because of my kids, ya know? Well, I could but then I'd never see my kids. (pause) It's not like I would be giving anything up, ya know, job-wise or anything like that, ya know. I'm makin' so little money. [00:14:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think, uh...I think the notion of you starving actually covers a lot of ground.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (snorts)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) from hunger, money, consideration from Jess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that? Croquette?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From Jess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, from Jess, yeah. (pause) The other day I was just freakin' out. I don't remember what day it was, but I was just freakin' out and...I had no one to call so I called her and left a message and...she called ba...she never brought up, ya know, any concern about what I said in the message or, ya know that I was freakin' out or anything like that, ya know. (pause) And her view of me is probably like I'm just doing absolutely nothing with my life and she's doin' all the work and I'm doin' nuthin and she's got the kids and...I don't know. It's always been that way where I've gotten no credit for anything that I do, ya know. (pause) Ya know there's obvious signs of real estate's pickin' up but I'm not...I don't seem to be benefiting from it, ya know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you like feel hungry - or something - pretty much all the time? [00:17:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: All the time, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm always hungry. Even my stomach hurts when I'm full...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Still hungry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I've eaten too much. I'm still hungry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm hungry right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hungry just thinking about it. (pause) I think, um, (pause)...I think...ya know it's not just about what's not in your stomach, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's what in my head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which can't be cured.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, not yet. (pause) I think, um, (pause)...yeah I think you're always making it clear to the people around, I mean including me, certainly including Jess...what you're missing, what you don't have enough of, what you need and I think you probably feel like we really have no idea at some level like how...how much this affects you. (pause) How hungry? How empty? How wanting you are? [00:20:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In my stomach.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's definitely joining the conversation. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) People actually showed up for our visitor's day....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and it seemed like people are going to be joining, so that's one less source of stress for the moment. And having that closing helps a little bit...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good. [00:20:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but, um...I don't know Jess's getting new clients. She seems busy. I have a new client meeting on Monday and who knows what, ya know what that's going to turn into, but it's just...it's not enough, it's never enough...[00:21:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know. I need fucking closings and, um, (pause) I don't know what to do to get more, ya know. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I think you're always stuck in this (pause), well actually let me back up a little bit. So (clears throat) see...I have an idea, although maybe this is wrong, that you're so frustrated and so upset about how bad things have been and how things aren't working out—which they're not—that it's hard to think about what you could be doing different and it's certainly hard to be motivated and together enough to do things. So there's like a kind of almost a bootstrapping problem with where if things would get better you'd feel a little better and then you could do more stuff but that's not happening and it's hard to make it start happening because until things get better it's really hard to feel like doing stuff or being able to think about what stuff you might even do. Like it's sort of a chicken-egg thing or something. [00:23:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it seem that way to you? Or is it just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: To some degree...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I'm not sayin' it's obvious or easy what to do, like I...I...I know it would be difficult. (pause) [00:24:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean part of me feels like I should be somewhat proactive about changing things, but the other part of me is just...I can't do it, ya know. I can't exercise, I can't eat right, I can't, ya know, I don't know. I just can't seem to do the things I need to do. Full well knowing that they'd make me feel better...or supposedly feel better, ya know. I don't know what I can do professionally to get more business (pause) [00:25:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Prior you had been trying to go to Chamber events and reach out a little more and stuff like that. Is that fallen off or was it as productive as you'd hoped or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there hasn't really been a Chamber coffee, ya know. It was after work stuff and Wednesday I got up early and did a presentation at the bank, the guy I met...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...at the Chamber...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is the bank thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There was six people there, two of which work for the Chamber so they were there as some kind of a, ya know, support the Chamber of Business kind of thing and, um, ya know...I don't know if you've ever given a talk and you can just tell in the people's eyes that you're not connecting with them in any sort of way, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:26:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and, um, just really weren't any probing questions or (pause) not a lot...you know I don't want to say it was a waste of time but (pause) no one was takin'...ya know I put my cards and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: my stuff out and it didn't seem like anybody took my card. I printed up a sort of summary of what I was talkin' about on letterhead and at the end I had all my contact information so...no one's contacted me, but, ya know...if E&G would start growing more and sending more business to the mortgage guy and the realtor that would be more for me, ya know, and that's been part of the slow, ya know, slowness is that, ya know, there's fuckin' ten people in the group, ya know. Another person just left and it's like there's nobody, ya know, nobody to refer business, ya know? And, um, each person that joins the group, ya know the referrals go up exponentially so just by sheer statistics I would be getting more, ya know, refinances and ya know stuff like that...[00:28:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um (sighs). I don't know. We'll see how many [inaudible 00:28:20] like 11 people show up and, um, (pause) I feel like the clock's run out on me to some degree, though, ya know. It's like I'm so far into debt with the fuckin' IRS and the DOR and I haven't made a mortgage payment in a year, ya know, and that's based on last modifications. Like what are they gonna do this time, ya know? I mean, I've been doing this thing for months now and it's just...they call me back with the same questions, they...[00:29:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know it's like they, they just want the stupiest stuff and it's like it's never gonna go through and, ya know, we're not gonna be able to come up with half of what we owe to get on a payment plan with them and still it's a, ya know, forty-three hundred dollars a month, ya know, mortgage payment which Jess can't afford...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know. I can't afford my fourteen hundred dollar a month rent, ya know? It's just...if business was to take off tomorrow I'd still be in the whole, ya know? (pause) I mean I've just so many fuckin' expenses to keep the office going, ya know...practice insurance, ya know rent, fuckin' web site. Ya know I got to renew my license, ya know, by the end of the month. I got to get the fuckin' dog an indestructible cage, um...health insurance. Ya know that's almost fifteen hundred bucks a month. It's like, ya know, it's just...it's never ending. (pause) It doesn't matter what and how successful and how many new clients Jess gets. That's, that's not money that's comin' to me. Ya know and her paying...actually paying her five hundred bucks a month...paying her car insurance and her life insurance and ya know things she doesn't care about but she should...[00:31:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And riding around a lot with the kids so I assume so she can work mostly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like next week I've got to take Ian to the fuckin' camp three mornings and watch Lucille one morning...I mean why is there no day care during vacation because I mean...what's the point of day care if they, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's just...(pause) [00:32:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ian is stayin' over tonight. I have no food for the kid, so we got to out to eat or...I mean I got like two hot dogs, no buns, no vegetables that he would eat, and all I've got is like salad stuff and cheese...a lot of cheese. (pause) He hasn't slept over in a few weeks so it's like, ya know, Jess gives me the opportunity to back out but like, ya know...somehow, somehow I'm gonna get screwed somewhere along the line if I don't pitch in, ya know? "Well, he was supposed to take 'em every Friday night and he wasn't doin' it." [00:33:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want help thinkin' this through with like, what to do or...what to do with him or how to deal with the food or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I dunno know. I mean I...I'm...I'm just in a (sigh) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you...like...uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I dunno. I could stop off and pick up some fuckin' hot dog buns and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...some frozen broccoli, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but like everything it just seems like one more chore, ya know. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it is one more chore. In other words, um, (pause) it's not the going out of your way I don't think to go to the store and probably even the cost of the buns and the broccoli that's the problem. It's how overwhelmed and pissed off you are about having one thing added to your to-do list isn't it? [00:34:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel burdened having him come over and then, ya know, I'm ordered to give him a bath, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. (pause) Well, so then...what do you actually think about his anticipated level of cleanliness...I mean is the bath about his being clean or is the bath about the ticks?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's about the ticks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think there's any chance you could get a tick from playing soccer on a field in Plymouth?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey, who knows? I just really don't care, ya know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So yeah, I mean you're problem there is like with...again it's with uh...with ya know how bossed around you want to feel by Jess and...how much you want to avoid a confrontation with her about it. (pause)...I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I dunno. (pause) These are my only pair of jeans that aren't mine. (pause) [00:37:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not tryin' to get any things about like what you could be doing about the food and the bathroom and that, like taking our time to make you feel bad about it...and it's not hard to see how awful and stressful and demanding and stagnant things are for you, but it does seem to me that a lot of the sort of...I don't want to call it small stuff cuz it's not small stuff - like day-to-day stuff is a better way to say it—is more about dealing with how awful things feel and having to confront that than with like the realities themselves and I don't mean to say that makes it any easier. It's just a different problem, ya know? [00:38:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything seems like it's a problem. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't actually think you have that many problems. I think you have a few big ones and they filter into everything. Ya know what I'm sayin', like money is a problem but as I talked about, it's a problem that comes up every five minutes when you think about something you have to pay or something you owe or something you're gonna owe or a bill that you get or, ya know, business that's not coming in. Ya know what I mean? Like (pause) I think when you get real overwhelmed it feels like five thousand different things. [00:39:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I dunno. It just seems like there's just stuff that I, ya know...I should've done that I haven't done yet, that I think about it and ya know it's like I gotta go to the fuckin' Target and get stuff. I've gotta get my fuckin' tickets. I've gotta get the cage. I've gotta...I got all these things I've gotta do and it's like, ya know...[00:40:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and you don't have a moment of peace and it's hard to think about adding things to your to-do list when every moment whether you're busy doin' somethin' or not busy doin' somethin' you're feeling crushed by all your responsibilities and, um, totally stressed out. I mean, I don't in a sense think you actually ever have a break. Not because you don't have time where you're not doing stuff but because whether you're doing stuff or not you're feeling totally overwhelmed. (pause) [00:41:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what do I do? Do any of your patients get better?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) No...no none at all...that's how I stay in business (chuckles). Um, (chuckles)...yeah there's nothing you can do but it's not all bad news Cameron. Like (chuckles) it's, it's dealing with...it's, ya know...a lot of these problems are emotional problems so I think if you look away from that and get focused on the sort of concrete aspects of them...the reality...the external reality of them. (pause) I think, um, I think I'm getting a bit of a better handle on it in a way where I will be able to give you a harder time about it, which (chuckles) I think will be helpful but not any fun. (pause) And this takes...this takes a while, in case that wasn't clear. [00:43:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm. I got that impression. [00:43:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) [00:44:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) (pause) [00:45:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop now. [00:45:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to reschedule next Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) Friday (pause) Okay...next Friday the 20th. Alright, um...maybe Thursday at 9:15? [00:46:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I've got a parent...yeah I'm parenting in the morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. You won't be done by then? [00:46:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Ian has to be at the thing at 9. I'm not sure which day I'm supposed to watch Lucille.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Um...do you know...I could do... ya know know I could like 10:15 on Friday instead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, she probably won't be back from court...Jess has court...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I, um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I may be able to do somethin' on Thursday afternoon at 4:30 but I'm not sure. I may get a cancellation then but I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's okay. If that happens let me know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I may...um...and I may just have somethin' else open up, which I'll tell ya if it happens or...when we meet on Tuesday.</p>

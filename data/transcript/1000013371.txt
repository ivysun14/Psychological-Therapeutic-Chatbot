<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, I was kind of concerned if you'd come in this week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why? (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because we had a tough session last time I thought.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I... I didn't really think it was that tough. I saw your expression towards the end. I thought that I might have said something that upset you or it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me. Tell me what you saw.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Only when I said that I got to know if this is going to work. I think that you took it a little bit personally. It wasn't meant like that. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah. Well, I thought it was... like I said, it was a tough session for, yeah, not just that piece, but it was a little bit even longer than that. So, what did you think my reaction was to what you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I... I don't know if you took it like it just... it's your... not work... I don't think you're working or... I just meant that like this approach may not work, or like I'm... I'm trying to make it work, but you're saying that it's still not working. So, I don't know what to do about it. I think that's basically my point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, is... is that what you kind of got from the session last week? Did it feel like that; like I was kind of saying that this wasn't working, or do you [kind of think] (ph)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's what I said, and then when I said that, I think you're a little bit chucked (ph), or it may not chucked but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Talk to me more about it. I... I... I'm... I'd like to talk about last session. I think it's really important for us to talk about it. So, whatever your thoughts were about what went on, or what you read from me, what you were feeling about what I was thinking. All of the above. Pick one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean that's just... that's basically it. I mean, I didn't think it was that bad, I mean, and then when I said I don't think it' going to work, I got... it wasn't meant that you're doing a bad job. It was that therapy... this method of therapy in general, because sometimes when you ask me how I feel, it's just sometimes there really is something that I don't mind talking about, I guess, and others I do, and that was one of them I just didn't. So, I... I didn't want to lie and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, is there... is there a difference between when you mind talking about something and you don't? I mean that... that kind of makes me feel like there's stuff going... that you do have some kind of feelings about what's going on and maybe you just don't want to talk about it. Is that... [2:30]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just think certain subjects, of course, are... they're going to be difficult for me to talk about, but what I was telling you about my mother is not one of those that's hard to talk about, to tell anybody. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So... well, I guess, what made you say then... what... what part of it felt like it wasn't working right or... or you weren't... it wasn't working?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think that you were asking for an emotion that I just didn't have on that particular, I guess, subject; not in general but... and I didn't know what to say, and I think that maybe you thought that... that I should have and I shouldn't on, I guess, the subject you were talking about and it just... it wasn't there. And I don't think it's something that I... I buried, because I just... I don't... I don't think about it, and so by me trying to... I mean, certain things, yes of course, I'm going to have emotions, but that particular thing, no, and if I should then I don't know what. I have no idea [is the long story] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, when you were... when I asked you how you felt and you were feeling like... or you said that to me, "I don't have any feeling." I forget exactly what you said but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said fine, but I did feel fine about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Okay. So, when you said that "fine" and then I kind of questioned you more about it, what did you think about that? I mean, what... what were you... where was that left... had did that make you feel or how was that like... what was that experience like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just like trying to reach for emotions that it just... I felt fine about it. I mean, there wasn't another way for me to feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, did you feel like you... you were trying, but there wasn't anything there, or was there...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't even trying, because I don't think there was anything for me to try for. I mean, I... it wasn't a subject that I... maybe at a different time... like maybe in general I just didn't have anything. There was nothing for me to talk about. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, what wasn't I getting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's... because I'm just looking at that one instance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's important too and I think it's important to look at. So, what wasn't I getting about your experience at that moment or... yeah? [04:59]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that I... I just did something that I really don't care about. I mean, it's... of course I care about my mother, but I guess that what we're talking about is something that... it's not like weighing me down or it's not something that I think it's an issue in my life. I mean, it's... it's in general like what we talked about before. There's things where... and there are issues when I'm with her, but when I'm away from her it's not, and I think I... I kind of forget. Like looking back I forget exactly what... like in what context that was pulled from.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Define you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I had asked you what your experience was of... of telling me all about your mom and about Thanksgiving and that whole thing. I mean, it was kind of real question about all that stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it doesn't really bother me, because like I said at the same time it's kind of like you in a way already know. This is like telling somebody... like I told my friends about my Thanksgiving and I was laughing about it because they know and they... then we were all laughing. You know my background, so it wasn't hard for me. I mean, I think that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, did it feel like I wasn't understanding or I was asking for something that... I'm wondering like what... what thoughts were going through your head when I was asking you for more, but yet you were feeling like there wasn't any more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just thought that maybe that you think there's supposed to be and I just... I'm... I'm not going to lie and just comes a big drama that's not there, and I just didn't... just didn't know what to say and I... and I think that my... my... my answer was what I thought was the correct one and how I felt at the time and I didn't think you interpreted it as an answer you wanted more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, I wanted more from you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...than... than was there probably.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. [7:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, if you can put your thoughts in that moment... well, make... you're going to have to kind of make them up, but if you can make up thoughts that you would have been having at that moment right now and say them out loud for me, could you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I... I say that out loud. I mean, I said that out loud. See, this is not working.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. No, I'm saying exactly... exactly. So... so, I said to you, "How was it telling me about your mom just then?", and you said, "Fine.", right? And I said, "Well...", I'm making this up, "...fine. There's a lot of people who might feel otherwise. For a lot of people that wouldn't be fine. Tell me your thoughts at that moment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If... if you were to tell me this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. So, we just... I just kind of re...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...enacted our conversation. If someone else was peeking into your brain right now, tell me what that person would be hearing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That... basically, that she's okay with the situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. So, put it into a thought for me. I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or she or whatever you feel for more comfortable with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hey, I'm so trying to get this right. If I was digging into my brain and I would...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...say what's... what's the conversation and I said, "Fine". What you think that I would be hearing from the outside?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles) This is complicated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Imagine there's someone outside of you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. ...and they're kind of listening to what's going on in your mind while I'm saying... asking you to say more about "fine", or more about your experience when you're feeling like there is no more to say. Can you kind of just maybe say out loud some of the thoughts you were having? Have that person say out loud some of the thoughts that you may have been having last week when I was asking you to give more, but there... you felt like there wasn't anymore to give.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, you're feeling like I just didn't want to talk about it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that your thought or is that what you're asking me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I... I guess that would be my thoughts, but also like I... like leading up to it, it wasn't something that was just like hard for me to tell you, and I think if I would have noticed that it being hard for me, like a sensitive topic then, of course, they're going to have difficulty and they're going to have more explanation behind it. [9:44]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it wasn't really that difficult for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, your thought might have been, "For some people this might be difficult...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but for me it's not".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. She's okay with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's okay with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What of your other thoughts right then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's just trying... I mean, that's not the case. It may be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just a sec.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That you're closing the door, I guess?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Explain that a little.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be... because you told me that I tend to close the door. That's why I stuck that in there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't want to go any further, or that she doesn't want to go any further with this conversation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She doesn't want to go any further. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's not how I meant it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not how you meant which one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I said "fine".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You may have meant it that way, or you didn't mean it that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I didn't mean it that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, where did that... that thought come from?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's just what... how I contain it; how somebody who was here would read my...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, everything sits fine with you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, yeah. Let's try to... because I think that's where we come to, but let's stick with your own thoughts...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what actually your own thoughts were versus someone's observation of you that you were...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...maybe closing the door. Is that one of the thoughts like, "For some people that might be hard, but for me it's not."?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I should have elaborated on it, but I didn't. I didn't say that. I just said it was fine because that's just... because it was a direct question. So, I was trying to for once answer it directly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I tried to answer your question directly for once and you're not happy with my answer."?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That could have been I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. How about thoughts about me? [11:37]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like there was thoughts about you in terms of... my thoughts about you or your thoughts about me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At that moment, your thoughts about me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't thinking about you. I was thinking about why don't I... I mean, I was trying to think... I was still thinking about me, not that I always think about me, but I was thinking about me and like why I don't have any feelings about why it wasn't hard for me to tell you what I did, because it wasn't really a deep subject for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's why I'm thinking, "Well, that's... it was fine for me telling you.", and I was thinking more about what you wanted... what else you wanted, which I didn't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So, "What does she want from me?". Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just making the more direct kind of thoughts and, "Why can't I come up with feelings like she wants me to?". Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was also thinking of, "Sometimes there aren't any feelings". I mean, some... I wasn't thinking that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Sometimes, Lady, there just aren't any feelings." (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (laughs). Yeah, like this is one case where I didn't think that, because you weren't asking me about how I felt in terms of about my mother. It was how... if it was difficult for me to talk about it, and that was a totally different case. In that sense, no it wasn't, but yes. I mean, there obviously I spent an hour talking about issues that I have or like issues that are going on with my mother. So, that... the whole... that right there is different than talking about it. [13:25]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, "Ask me a different question and I can give you a better answer."? (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can give you what you're looking for?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I... I actually didn't have that in there. You said that before, "Like what are you looking for? Like what do you want from me"? Tell me it's not putting words in your mouth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's... that's great. Because, I mean, [I thought mine was the perfectly] (ph) (inaudible at 13:50), since my answer obviously wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, if... the thought could have been, "It feels like I just gave you the wrong answer."?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. But... but I still think that... I thought that my answer was right and there was like... like end... like nothing else should go on about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it's... it's more of not judging or thinking about what your answer was; more about what your thoughts were in that moment of, because I think a lot... people have a lot of really... have a lot of thoughts that go by so fast when those kind of moments are going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, we're just kind of throwing around possibilities of thoughts that were going on around that time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But kind of like, "That's my answer, but you're not satisfied with it.", or, "I feel like I'm giving you the wrong answer right now"?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's more of, "That's the answer and you're not satisfied with it and I don't know what else... other answer I could possibly give you". So, that's what I was thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it goes back to that, "Like what do you want from me?".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, because I answered honestly and I didn't know how... So, it's more of, I guess, what...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like, "I'm wondering. Let me know if this is weak. I'm not doing this right.", based on my... my making you feel like, "What does she want from me?", and... and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wait, I'm not doing this right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm saying in terms of your...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes like maybe I wasn't... yeah, maybe I'm not answering the question the way you want it, but in this case "no", because I understood the question and it wasn't hard for me. We talked about it. And I think some things are; some things aren't and I don't know how it got so blown... (chuckles) blown out, because it's kind of like... I mean, it's a question that could have been answered, but you went on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Explain that. Which part of it got blown out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it... it's something that... like when I answered "fine" last week, I never thought that we'd be talking about it today. And so after it got into I just thought I was giving you an answer, and it wasn't like in her plans, or it wasn't something that was meant to... for somebody (inaudible at 16:26]. It was just an honest answer and I think it was just misinterpreted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think versus talking about that answer I think we're kind of talking about... at least in my... my view of what we're doing right now is kind of talking about what was going in both of our minds when those words were being exchanged. So, not really the exact words; what exact... the words that were exchanged, but kind of what it felt like to be in the room together, in terms of like what our... our minds were thinking as we were sitting there saying those things... saying those words. So, the words were real simple. Right? We... we didn't have too much of a big conversation about it but... Yeah, it sounds like a lot potentially was going on in both of our minds in that moment, which I think led up to the end of... I mean, you're saying the statement like, "This is not working.", and then my being concerned that maybe you wouldn't come back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no. I would never not come back, but I was just thinking like it's just... from that one thing. The reason I said that because I was supposed to have an answer and it just wasn't there, and I don't... it's... I think it was kind of just one certain instance and it's not going to be like an in general type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let me... we can... well, we can always do one of two things. Do we want to talk... because we talked a lot about the thoughts that were going on in your brain, but I'd like to also talk about... if you'd want to, we can... I'd like to hear your perception of what... what was going on for me as well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but I'd also like to get back to this session too. But you tell me. You can... you can select if you'd like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I thought you were going to tell me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. (chuckles) Which one would you like to do? I was... I was posing that. It is a question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay. You can tell me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Do you want to give me your thoughts first on just what you thought was going on for me? I'll do it first, then you can tell me. How's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I was thinking, as I mull it again reconstructing just like I think we were with you, "How do I access her?", like, "How do I get to that emotional stuff that I thought she wanted to talk about?".</p>

<p>Separate thought. That, "I'm not sure when I can judge when the wall that we talk about goes up and when it's just something that there's not more to talk about". So, like when the wall goes up, there is more to talk about, but there's a wall there so we... we're not going to talk about, because it's... there's that wall between... between us talking about it. But then at other times, there's just nothing there. There's not... there's nothing more there to talk about and I'm not sure how to judge which one is which. Those are two big ones I think.</p>

<p>Any ones that you think you can add or you were wondering if they were going on? [19:58]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's basically... it covers most of it; maybe all of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm pretty good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, very good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you're pretty good at figuring out my thoughts. Tell me what you thought my thoughts were that... that kind of overlapped with those.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's about the same thing. That you took basically my comment; like you said, "There's a wall going up.", and you won't sure if that was the case or not. I think you did a very good job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of summarizing what you said? I think that's what she said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, of... of like how that's what I basically thought how you took it and I can see why but... Now what do you want me to say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, if there's... if there's any other thoughts, you can let me know them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's from you or for me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Both. I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Well, for me, it's like if you get to a spot like that, you can ask me and I'll give you an honest answer, and that's what I was doing and I don't think you were taking it as an honest answer, or you were just curious and I... I had nothing else to tell. I mean, because there wasn't anything there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I was having a thought as you were saying that which I would like to share. My thought was that I misunderstood you at that moment. I misunderstood. Like I said before, I couldn't tell the difference. I misunderstood the moment that there wasn't anything else there for the moment that a wall goes up and there is some other stuff there. And I... I... I think your suggestions are a good one that I could ask you. So, is this like? Is this is a moment that that wall is going up, or is it really there's nothing else there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's nothing else there...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...in terms of that... that, yes. That was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So, if that... that... great. In vivo practice. Good. What... I'm... I'm wondering on your end what are your ideas about what you can say to me if for some reason I've had a head injury and I don't remember to do that? What could you say to me that would help me know that as well; that I'm going too far or that I'm asking you stuff and there's just not anything there? [22:35]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can say there really isn't anything there or... and if there's something there, if... if I don't want to talk about, then I'll say I don't want to talk about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, and then if I... I would let you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So, you either say something like, "There's nothing else there. Leave me alone."</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Leave me alone.", but it's kind of like when you're being asked a question, you're... you can't make up an answer. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's fine, "I can't make up an answer to what you're asking me. I don't want to make up an answer to what you're asking me. There's nothing else there." That sounds... What would you want my response to be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I mean, that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, just move on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, if you had a... if you have questions the... other questions on the subject, you can press on, but if you... the way you... I guess, the way you ask a question... like that was the way... the way it was asked was just about like very straightforward and, I mean, there's other way... of course, there's other questions you could have asked along that subject that would have been... that had feelings that go with it. So, if you wanted to stay on the topic, I'm fine, but just ask another question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like your past feelings about stuff going on with your mom? I think you mentioned that before, and in the past you've had feelings, but just about that particular situation telling me about that thing right then. Did I get that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's... I'm trying to think of the question. No, I think that the issues with my mother now are more recent, because I don't think I remember her being so loud. So, I don't think that was a past... that... that issue was a past issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think I was asking you about how your feeling... what your experience was in the moment and like if I had asked you about your experience a week prior when you were with your mom. Maybe your feelings would have been different. [24:58]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I... I thought we asked a... I don't really feel like it's tying in, but I guess that's the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So, after telling me the whole thing, I asked what your experience was in the room about telling me all those things, but if I had asked you, "How was it being with your mom at Thanksgiving dinner? How was it being in... " - I forgot what store you were in. - "and your mom being really loud?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. No, I haven't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, that might have accessed a lot?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, that... that... that's what I'm asking. So, is that kind of what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I had asked you other questions like those, then you would have had more to say about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So, I... I feel comfortable asking you the question if you feel comfortable on the other hand responding to the question, as well as also letting me know if I haven't picked up on that I've gone too far or that I'm asking about stuff that there is no more to ask about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that seem all right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And do you mind then if I ask you about that other question I had (chuckles), which was about the statement that you said before you left, which was about, "Maybe this is not working." Right, or maybe... how did you say it exactly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I just felt under... or it's not working or it's not going to work for me. That was in response sort of like trying to create an [uncertain dilemma] (ph). It had... there was nothing to talk... that wasn't an issue, but if you had asked other questions then I wouldn't have said that. I thought that you... like that one question was like the basis of... like my... you thought that I was resisting to that one question, but that wasn't the case. [26:49]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, you thought that one question was the beginning of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, like you were... like I needed to have an answer to that one question and it's just not there, and if it has to be then... I can't have questions... I can't answer for everything, and it's just not going to work if I do, because I'm not going to sit here and lie to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mind if I put a thought to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "She's really annoying me right now harping on this question."</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I didn't think that you were annoy... annoying me. I just felt that... I think with anybody there's things that... you can't like put an emotion too or you just... it doesn't like bother you to talk about something. There's other things that you are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I'm saying your experience of... of me asking you all those question... asking you the question... I guess I'm just wondering what the thought could be that goes with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What... what do you want?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'm... I'm...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like there is stuff... like there isn't anything. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stop it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I don't... it wasn't really annoying me, but I was like trying to come up with an answer that's just not there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can imagine that being unnerving. [28:17]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't like irritated by it, but I just... I knew I had to supply an answer. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so what do you think brought you to say the... to actually say that before you left?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think you really wanted an answer and I just couldn't give it to you, and that's what I wound up...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, before I thought... before I leave here, I want her to... to... to kind of hear what I'm thinking or hear... hear this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just thought... I didn't... I didn't feel like I wanted to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Again, this is just a thought of what could have been going on at the moment and it's just... just reconstructing. It's not... doesn't have to be exactly true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're not doing a recording. This won't be published or anything like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What... you tell... maybe you can help me out of... of what a thought could have been in saying that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess confusion. Like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it wasn't a stop sign. It was just like a dead end. There wasn't anyplace to go with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, I'm really confused now about what was supposed to be... what I'm supposed to be doing in here and what this is all supposed to be about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just... again, tell me if I'm... I'm adding a question from... a statement from before, "I feel like I'm not doing this right.", or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I was trying to... it felt like I was trying to find an emotion for something that... but [it's so I don't know how to bring an emotion] (ph) for...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And what other... what other thoughts do you think go with that statement?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's how... that's the only thoughts that... that were behind that statement and that might be interpreted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) Or I'm sure that... I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd love to hear it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe it... you just... I mean...</p>

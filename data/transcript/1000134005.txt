<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 8, September 14th. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fire away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep. And we're booked on our usual 7:30, but we usually begin 10 minutes late.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, my little crisis was passed reasonably well. I went to the one party.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you pass it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't pass it very well at all, I failed it. But it was gotten through with a great deal of embarrassment I will say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Let's talk, stop talking about it and start talking about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Well, I got through a miserable day. I barely got through it at all. I went Friday to the company party alone and that was passed off without difficulty. (inaudible - 0:00:56.3) picks up the blind date for Saturday night and there was, exactly as I feared, there was much telephoning around and conversations and teeth gnashing, at least on my part, and so I had a blind date. And we went to the party -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, wait a second. What happened about you, did you tell your mother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I told her I wasn't going to go, that I didn't have a date and that I didn't want to go without a date.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did that, how did that feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That felt bad, you know, but it was something I had to say, I didn't have any alternative at that point. And I said -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had made that decision -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I made that decision -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - (inaudible - 0:01:35.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and then that I wasn't going to go with a blind date and, of course, I did go. And the reason why I did go with a blind date is because well, my brother was (inaudible - 0:01:43.6) and he prevailed. He said you have to go to this party, that's all there is to it, just a bad scene. If you don't and, you know, I can fix you up. So I just didn't have the wherewithal to say no I'm not going and really make a big stink about it with him too. So in due course I was fixed up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It felt, it felt easier to go along with him then to -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - increase the confrontation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And it was pretty late notice and it was possible he wouldn't be able to fix me up anyway, that was like Thursday night. In fact he fixed, I think I was fixed up on Friday night not on Thursday night. Thursday night, yeah because it did it very quickly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you felt?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt like a schlep.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:02:32.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It depicts how you feel pretty well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. So and it was -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Rather rough band-aid, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. So we went to the party and it was exactly as I thought it would be, the girl did not know and she's very pretty but she was young and I wasn't there, she was like 22 and she had a little  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you felt out of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she had a little group of friends -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and I was annoyed at the situation where I was forced to try and (inaudible - 0:03:06.3) myself with a bunch of people that I would much rather remain a little bit aloof from, and that made it awkward on my part.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Besides that I was (inaudible - 0:03:16.7) and I was -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that made it from go from bad to worse.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I had to (inaudible - 0:03:20.6) myself with these people and they were very bright, breezy people and I was a bit of a bore. You know, when you, when you go out with a blind date you're very, you have to be very bland generally speaking and so I was very bland (inaudible - 0:03:33.8) and she wasn't interested and I wasn't especially interested in what I was saying just we passed it off, she and I fairly reasonably well until the latter part of the evening. And we sat with this, not with her group, and she was annoyed with that and was a little bit quite I think. Which not only was she a terribly vivacious girl anyway, but she wasn't sitting with her group so she was either more estranged and it was obvious they didn't know her when I finally sat down at the table with all these other people of whom I was frightened of this exact situation occurring.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was like your nightmare coming true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know what's going to happen and it did happen. And they knew that it was a blind date and I passed that off just breezily in some fashion or the other and they accepted that on the surface anyway. Although I'm certain down below -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And are you sure it was accepted on the surface?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did I accept it? No I was entirely rejecting it and I thought I gave a fairly good performance as far as that goes. But I mean I was entirely rejecting the entire yeah, right, I was entirely rejecting the evening completely. And it just wasn't any fun for me at all, it was a thing that I had to do a ritual that I had to go through to conserve the sensational ambitions of my mother. But this is very ironic it's sort of a (inaudible - 0:04:53.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tongue and cheek err, err, err.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm really angry or resentful of that (inaudible - 0:05:00.2). And it's ironic  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't sound.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hum?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't sound very angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I am I think, I guess I sound ironic because I was just don't want to be any (inaudible - 0:05:16.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm mocking myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - need your dignity  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - to get angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And so I'm mocking my own anger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:05:23.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hum?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you really believe that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That it's beneath my dignity? Not exactly that it's beneath my dignity, I believe that I shouldn't be angry at her for doing what, or being what she is and she can't help  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's still really pissed you off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it pissed me off and why it pisses me off is in the ironic aspect of this, is that she's doing this in order to build herself up, of course, number one and give her something to do and so on. But she's really doing it out of family ambition and to make our name ... I mean the party wasn't even so much for (inaudible - 0:05:57.0) and kind of special people or someone is known and there's a lot of wealthy people over there and she was doing it to introduce her children to this (inaudible - 0:06:04.0) which she has been doing this for many years along this vein and it has been fairly successful at least in reducing. The ironic part of it at least for me though is that it just doesn't work, you know, because I was forced into a situation where I came off very badly. And that has consistently happened when I have been involved in her planning, you know, been drawn into the (inaudible - 0:06:23.4). I don't come off especially well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that kind of situation just doesn't show you off very well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I'm not adequate to the situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not that kind of person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I am, no, at least I don't I'm not I just don't do well in it, you know, I don't appear with some ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would like to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would like to, to a certain extent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To gain the interest here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But when did I</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:06:46.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would that I could play it well but I cannot. But the (inaudible - 0:06:48.6) ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're still trying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What else, you don't know what else to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, there is nothing else to do. And (inaudible - 0:06:56.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, and I wouldn't go along with there's nothing else to do but you decided that there is nothing else to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And that's the irony of it to me is in fact a lot of and I depicted a lot of the, you know, in a certain way I'm, and this is really peculiar to say and maybe it is not even true, but in a certain way I'm jealous of her involvement in all of this because I think that when I was younger I think that I suffered as a result of it, not so much now. The consequences are apparent now and I do in fact blame a lot of my difficulties upon her temperament, you know. And that's what's ironic about it to me is that this whole thing, her involvement surpass, somewhere back there I was in trouble and something had gone right it would have been alright with me, but that point was passed and it was ignored by my family and by my mother and father and I (inaudible - 0:07:57.4) it and angry about it and resentful of it because I think that they owe me something more then that. And I just could go on ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And here they are (inaudible - 0:08:06.9) growing it and helping you make a fool of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And putting me in a position where I do make a fool of myself, yeah. So that really strikes me strongly that aspect of it. Now that's just as it relates to me, as it relates to the rest of my family I don't know. I think my bother enjoys it thoroughly because he does well at it and my two sisters enjoy it because they enjoy it. The one sister of whom I admire the most is much more critical and tongue and cheek about the entire affair. She recognizes it for what it is, it's not a very substantial thing and she sees the humor in a certain way of the parents being so engrossed in this kind of activity, social climbing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you would like to be able to have that same kind of  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - tongue and cheek attitude, but you just.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just to sort of indulge her, indulge her in her whims that type of attitude.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No you're more of (inaudible - 0:09:05.2), I mean you would like to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would like to be different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:09:07.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I would like to have the, I would like  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No matter if it weren't for you, it's a matter of (inaudible - 0:09:12.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I mean to say that it's a matter of I would like to have my ideal person, my ideal self have the attitude of finally resolving mommy's little whims and it being mildly amusing to me and not especially important, one way or the other, which is something (inaudible - 0:09:32.3). But I would like to have an attitude but unfortunately I don't have it because I haven't, I don't know why I really don't have an attitude, I'm not secure enough to have an attitude, I suppose that's the reason for it. Well, in any event and this was kind of a little classical (inaudible - 0:09:56.1) of the way I feel about (inaudible - 0:09:59.9), when I just sat over (inaudible - 0:10:02.3) kind of sums up for me the way I feel about her, their activities, I really resent it inside of me, I think that they, there was a gross error made (inaudible - 0:10:12.5). A lot of my credit  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who they are  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: - flailing around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - being social climbers and then what would be more important to you is to be able to really communicate with somebody and ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible - 0:10:22.8) and it's too late now but like when I was 17 or something of that kind of nature it could have been something where all of this won't, I won't have to be here speaking with you about it. So I blame them for that in retrospect, and I think it follows through to I blame, in a broader way, I think that my entire family really, because they haven't been sufficiently grounded in some of the essentials I'm not going to be able to fulfill my mother's fantasy of their success because the only one, there's only one of us graduated from college, none of us have a special skill, like a lawyer or a doctor or something like that's concrete to build on, for a woman that wants her family to be well established in upper middle class society as something of a dynasty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like a pipe dream.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because it was so badly handled on her part and I blame it rightfully or wrong, I blame it on her from the point of view of certain essentials and if you're going to play that game there are certain building blocks that you first (inaudible - 0:11:27.0) the children and those were not ever (inaudible - 0:11:29.4). The family style is much more irresponsibility and (inaudible - 0:11:36.7) rather then something more silent. So she's building a sandcastle and it's foolish of her to have done that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And usually that means crumbling sand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's unfortunate because in some ways as a result my own career could crack up in a normal and complete failure. My brothers could very easily, it's a very touch and go kind of a scene and it would be very unfortunately funny not to have that happen after all her pretentious. She comes from  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would also be nice to get rid of that (inaudible - 0:12:11.3). It would also be the final screw that you could ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just desserts, you know. If I really feel that way, I hope I don't, I don't know. Maybe I feel it would be appropriate I mean I would like to avoid it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would like to avoid it for your own self.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For my own self, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it would be nice to be able to launch that at her somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the final proof of her short sighted, that's right that would be gratifying if that were able to happen. And in some ways maybe I do  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:12:40.2) something that, it sounds like that's something that she better take you better look at.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, maybe I do. In fact, probably I do feel that way, the occasional obsession with failure and all that might stem from that and I can say look at this drek that I am, you know your son, and here is what, a botch you made of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:13:04.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. So then I could present that to you on a platter and maybe some of my motivation does spring from that. If it does I feel almost like (inaudible - 0:13:20.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I agree but it's not getting you where you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In terms of a successful career. So I suggest we spend some time working through that motivation (inaudible - 0:13:35.2) motivation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's a good possibly that it is yeah. I recognize over ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How, how else did you get out your anger at your mother without making a wreck out of your own life?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I can't think of anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well, starting think of ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Nothing appears to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Occurred (inaudible - 0:14:04.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Occur. Drawing a blank.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Once you (inaudible - 0:14:15.3) to go to her and tell her that that's a very inappropriate thing (inaudible - 0:14:20.8). It's a very inappropriate thing to do to show off her children like that when she hasn't (inaudible - 0:14:26.2) the manners, the whole wanting to do that goes with it, to start out with. And that she's showing you the failures (inaudible - 0:14:36.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: More attention result doing that then I can imagine her becoming a hippy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would serve no purpose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, it wouldn't? I mean what if it serves a purpose of your not becoming a wreck?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wouldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That was my self-indulging myself by taking time to ask you as that was an irrelevant (inaudible - 0:15:09.0). I didn't really need to ask you that, let's go on with this game. What else could you do? I want you to come up with five old things that you could, ways that you get out your anger to your mother without wrecking your own career as you would?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sorry, I'm drawing a blank.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really drawing a blank. I mean, I think it's self-evident that if I could think of something perhaps I would have done it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think in one way ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's going on? What are you feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't get the name of the character.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're getting uncomfortable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a habitual mode of mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what happens when you get uncomfortable you rush very fast and (inaudible - 0:16:11.8) a lot faster and faster and faster to get off whatever is happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's fairly normal kind of  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - (inaudible - 0:16:20.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. May be fairly normal but I'm not sure it's the most effective in here. I think it's best to go through that uncomfortable thing and find out what those feelings are that are happening right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And work through them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a little bit like  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, let me yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let me say that I think one of the ways that that could be take a more positive approach would be one thing I recognize I think over the weekend when I was home and I was on vacation too last week (inaudible - 0:16:59.2), were seeing that their life and mine it really seems that they are not going to change and I'm not going to change in some respects in terms of my attitude and outlook, and noticing that it's really almost irrelevant for me to even get upset at the way they act or react to things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it, they're the way they're and after all they are 65, and I'm the way I'm and I'm 28, you know, there's nothing else that I can do. One thing that I could do ideally or fantastically as it were would be to entirely leave town and go to Los Angeles (inaudible - 0:17:44.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's one thing that you could do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And blow them off entirely. In a certain sense I tried that in Washington and it didn't work. I simply couldn't get a job that would (inaudible - 0:17:55.7) maybe I didn't try very hard either I don't know. I tried that three or four years ago when I was a lot worse maybe then I am even now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that would be, that's something that really occurs to me the pointlessness of my, even thinking about in a certain way my resentment of it, I just resolve to close the door and I'm going to try and live my own life in some why, which I'm trying to do and I'm not having an enormous amount of success with. So maybe you're right maybe I should close the door and I should (inaudible - 0:18:32.0). Apart from moving away, I don't see how I, I mean would the point be to communicate my anger somewhat to them? Let them know how I (inaudible - 0:18:46.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What purpose would that serve?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I was saying, I wasn't saying that that's what you do, that that's what you should do, I would like you to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was just saying that I would like you to think of some other ways to handle your anger, if you're very locked into handling in this way right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And one way to unlock you is to get some alternatives.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I'm saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, one way would be to express it to your mother. The second way would be to have it published in a paper. My mother is a schmuck.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Funnier then the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I take pen in hand with the heavy part to inform you that lady (inaudible - 0:19:35.3) is such a marvelous creature.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Go on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is in reality, that's very good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, continue. Is in reality what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the one way that I could do it that I think that I could do it a little bit when I was in high school was and it turned into a negative thing with my rebellion and aspect of things (inaudible - 0:19:56.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, just do what you're doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it is, yeah, you're right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Let's come up with another way of (inaudible - 0:20:02.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: The one way that I did it when I was in high school, one of the forms that it took, it wasn't entirely negative was to be somewhat outspoken in my political beliefs and in fact write, I did write letters (inaudible - 0:20:14.3) my mother though. Letters to the editor that were highly sarcastic and really great fun to write. I'll never forget writing, they were quite good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, that's not going (inaudible - 0:20:27.3)  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: But alright.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - that's enough.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright. But something at that time, for example, I could write letters to the editor (inaudible - 0:20:38.0) or something about some political issue and take the diametrically opposite path that they would take and in fact hold up all of their values to ridicule. That would give me a big kick, that would be fun (inaudible - 0:20:55.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm glad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be one way to do it. It would be a lot of fun and that way I could, I could write too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What's going on now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The other way, of course, would be to throw out the game entirely and drop out the way that I meant and not prepared to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would you do dropping out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean to go to work for kind of (inaudible - 0:21:27.5) go to work for this or with some church organization or (inaudible - 0:21:32.2). I think I'm too ramped up to the point in the mind game to do that. That was a way that I use to fantasize the, I use to think about it anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of getting out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe the motivation for it was (inaudible - 0:21:54.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Another way, how about another way of seeing a tremendous success.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I was thinking or I was going to say or that you were, that would be great if I could do that right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And get it, oh, oh. Be a tremendous success but do it your own way and still not be in her game (inaudible - 0:22:20.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean that's probably the way to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not saying that, I'm not suggesting that you go out and do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, I'm just talking it around. I don't know why I don't think that's feasible but I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know when you talked along this line before this was what the kind of attitude that you had about the establishment, a serious problem. Well, get out and not have to take orders from somebody else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which they play in the game.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in a sense you're telling employers (inaudible - 0:22:58.6) a boss.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it doesn't seem feasible with your mother.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No because she would be too proud of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can you tell a mother (inaudible - 0:23:15.2)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no I really won't though it's like  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really won't what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see in my line I think becoming a great success is and under any, under any terms seems to validate rather then invalidate her approach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it really does demand being a failure?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the way I think about it, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My god.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wash my hands of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really gotten, you really</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:23:43.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh? You really, no wonder you're going to be a failure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think I'll be a great success just to show you and then I'll endow your institution here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:23:59.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, I don't know, obviously I'm very conflicted about it. I get, I think I get a deal of emotional satisfaction from saying look at this to her, look at the failure that I am, but I don't get a great feeling of gratification from contemplating myself, you know, for myself as a failure, I just do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To demonstrate to her that the awfulness of it. I would be very unhappy as a failure  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: - but I would in some way get, you know, I would in some way get.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the (inaudible - 0:24:34.6) you are in right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It satisfies revenge  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and it satisfies (inaudible - 0:24:45.7) but where does that leave you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where does that leave me, yeah (inaudible - 0:24:47.7) or dead or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Non-existent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And hurting from being invisible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. And hating her all the more for it, it wouldn't really solve anything certainly. And so I'm very screwed up. I mean I can almost when you talk about emotions I can almost feel it, visualize the enormously strong currents are going through me that I see some of it and they're very conflicting (inaudible - 0:25:22.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you go into that a little bit more for me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's just a metaphor, I mean that I just they're like rip things, rip tides like that and then something else a very strong and constricting the other way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are those things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean when I talk about the gutter aspect of it and the way to get into it, it makes me feel like in a certain way the enormous gratification I would get out of it and then the other way the hatred I would have for her, for myself, for everyone if I did these kind of failures.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you're locked into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But on the other hand there's a certain gratification there but there's also, I mean, turn right in on itself like that and rip tides or cords or whatever they are, ties that bind or something I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that really bother you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:26:25.8). It's funny I think, I remember when I was younger and a girl I use to go out with use to criticize me all the time for being too attached to my family and she was probably right and it has finally turned out to be kind of a very sick thing for me anyway, I mean I'm not saying the (inaudible - 0:26:44.2) family are. My particular way of doing it has turned out to be very reverse and maybe she was right. And I think, in fact I use to want my family in front of her to keep my distance from her, she was that person that resented it. I remember one time I don't know want to go into old stories.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:27:10.5), I really, I really can't afford to have you go into a story about that period.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright. (inaudible - 0:27:15.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At $21 an hour I still believe responsible that you get something out of it. I want you to do something with me. I'm just going to ask you a couple of questions and I'm going to keep asking and I want you to come up with an answer to each one. I don't know how it's going to work but I have an idea about it. And it might be a good idea to focus on your mother.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Several times, or quite a bit of the time, not all the time (inaudible - 0:27:54.8). In fact all the time (inaudible - 0:28:00.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're changing the rules.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think. Okay. I'm going to ask you a simply question, two simply questions, what could you do to help a mother? (inaudible - 0:28:19.0) some thing that you could do to help your mother whether it would be scrape the kitchen floor or be a success or whatever? And the second question would be what could a mother do to help you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have to give several responses?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And actually go through it in cycles.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is this suppose to be, you want me to think about it carefully?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My responses are going to be very (inaudible - 0:28:44.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well, then think about it. What could you do to help a mother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be affectionate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you. What could a mother do to help you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:29:30.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you. What could you do to help a mother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Admire her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What could a mother do to help you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be supportive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you. What could you do to help a mother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:30:12.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:30:23.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Being interested in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What could a mother do to help you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be understanding.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you. What could you do  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Especially non-verbally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - what could you do to help a mother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: One could  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I could.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could give her pride.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you. What could a mother do to help you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: School me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In who and how I should be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you. What did you get it out of it? What's going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm thinking that I, that my response especially with regard to the pride thing (inaudible - 0:32:45.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of what? (inaudible - 0:32:52.3) is what you say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's contradictory.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe it goes along with it, I don't know what it does. It seems to me I have an enormous a dependency sometimes (inaudible - 0:33:23.8) relationship, it's a very child like and (inaudible - 0:33:33.7). And really just very, very child like, not the kind of well, obviously there's a very mature (inaudible - 0:33:54.00 response.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wasn't thinking about mature, I was just thinking about (inaudible - 0:34:02.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:34:03.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You seemed moved.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hum?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seemed moved.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am I feel very badly about my I think maybe I'm thinking how badly it is, how bad it is of me to have this reaction to some woman that really in a way kind of helped, help herself. So demanding, covering ways that she's not or unable to form.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Again, it seems like your want and desire are at cross purposes. Her wanting to show you off and you just wanting the attention, is what I'm hearing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that's right, I think that's right. I think I feel in a way short changed and yet I do love her in some ways and I don't want to feel that way. And it turns into a rage.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible - 0:35:32.4) holding not to punch but hold yourself back and getting (inaudible - 0:35:39.8). I think that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:35:52.1). I think that it's almost in some ways I feel insulted by the shallowness of what I see, the shallowness of her reaction to (inaudible - 0:36:06.7) the rest of her children almost using it as a pawn in her own, playing her own game and I resent that. And yet at the same time I don't want to resent that or her, I just want to accept her for the way she is and leave it go at that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible - 0:36:31.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I think it's a valid kind of thing to feel resentful for though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I agree, I think (inaudible - 0:36:50.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why my own particular personal feelings are as strong as that, I don't know if it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, what particular feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, my particular feeling apparently over (inaudible - 0:37:05.8) and just the whole thing we have just been talking about. Wherein the rest of my family apparently (inaudible - 0:37:12.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't care to talk about the rest of your family and that way I don't have to go into therapy with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no you're not but at the same time something that I should pick up (inaudible - 0:37:24.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but I think you would be in a much better position to think about the rest of your family's reaction to your mother, not just your own reaction and action to your mother's (inaudible - 0:37:36.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think you're doing too much of that in terms of gauging yourself in terms of the way and the patterns that by the rest of your ability to  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's easier.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - living up to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Patterns for them I mean it's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I just said you could be even more (inaudible - 0:37:56.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just said you could be really successful in your own life, because you are you and you can come up with something unique to who you are and your relationship to who your mother is and that's a totally different thing, either of your sisters have got going or your bother. I use to do that with my family too, kept thinking about them ... well, the rest of my cousins related to Uncle Davey in such and such a way and why can't I, therefore, I should. (inaudible - 0:38:39.8). And I finally worked on it on a level of what were my feelings and worked through a lot of them and now I really don't have, I don't have any need to compare my feelings with those of my family, because I'm sure that they're okay and I don't need to compare them to find out that they're okay. And that's the kind of thing that I could see, you should be working towards (inaudible - 0:39:14.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem very sad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am very sad, it's a preposterous thing to have (inaudible - 0:39:35.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is it so preposterous?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you see ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's very difficult, it's very difficult to talk, these things are not especially and forgive me for probably sounding like  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - superficial thing to say but it's difficult to talk about these things when because they're (inaudible - 0:40:07.2) undignified at best. And I think I see what we're talking about and somewhat depressing thing. I guess that's the way it is. It just surprises me that (inaudible - 0:40:57.3) like that. And so trying to keep with my, you know it's funny you can deal with these things and you don't think about them very much but they're very close to the surface because we've been talking about them tonight (inaudible - 0:41:17.5). One of the great things that you keeps you going is to ignore them and work around them as though they weren't there because they go out in the football field or be bright and airy and be clear, and clearly defined. Nothing wrong with me coach, put me in. And it's kind of superficial I suppose (inaudible - 0:41:57.3). I think I recognize these things in myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But when I hear you speaking of them, an outside party, third party or whatever, maybe it's good because it brings up the extremity of the thing a little bit more (inaudible - 0:42:24.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like we go through a thing quite often, if I get particularly close to your areas of (inaudible - 0:42:39.6) that really hurt or are wrong, a lot of things going on as a result that you have one of two reactions. Either you get sad like you are now or you get very mad and close that off, alright it's time to go and I notice you looking at the clock again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:43:07.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's time to go, and I'm, you and I have different views of what therapy is about  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and that is something that (inaudible - 0:43:19.1), whose rules are we going to play here. I'm (inaudible - 0:43:24.9) play my rules because it's my game and I know that I can help you with that according to my rules. But you're very much at conflict with that because it's not dignified. The one thing I'm not is probably dignified or the way that I approach psychological problems. And frankly if you're really going to get into psychological problems there ain't nothing dignified about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No there ain't, no there ain't. And that, I'm not trying to cop out, I don't think (inaudible - 0:44:19.0). I just, you know, have a certain (inaudible - 0:44:22.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I also feel very sad when we get to this point and it feels like so much has happened, so much could happen and so much could change, it would be better for you but you're still hanging onto the dignified thing and it's hard for me to know where to go. If you insist on bringing that with, it definitely waters down the game that we can play. I also have been sitting here realizing what I really (inaudible - 0:45:18.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm sure you feel that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if we had another hour which way would we proceed? You don't know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which way would we, would you like to sit here for another hour?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which way would we, if we had another hour?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would like to go into (inaudible - 0:45:44.9) the side part of it and really go into this. Or just the thing of being, just where you're at now is a really great place to do therapy. But that's what I would like to do, where are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I would like to do that, I would like to do that too but it's very difficult for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would it be easier for you (inaudible - 0:46:26.6) and I keep bringing it up as a possibility, would it be easier for you if we had a two hour session for awhile?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The hour is my great escape hatch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know I'm very frightened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's completely unknown in my country and I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't whether I, I don't know what, I really don't know what else there is to say in some ways either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's really something about that because when you are best things and you quit dodging, you know, you say there's nothing else to say and that's the best time. You really get into your feelings that are getting in touch with them and getting a look at them and get to the point where you're going to be able to do something about them. Picking out which feelings you want and not being the victim. I mean that's why you're running, I think that has a lot to do with why you're running scared. You feel victim, you feel very victimized and then you're being subject to something and you're not in charge and not responsible and on a whole another level you are really in control and you just thought for one and want to say how it goes. And you really are on another level and when you found that you are capable of handling those feelings, but scared inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm, yeah, I'm afraid to even to I think to</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Doing all right, survived vacation.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How was it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was pretty good.  The drive was stressful.  We usually try to do a fourteen hour drive from here to the east coast, [DEIDENTIFIED] through the night, mostly through the night, so we had to revive the mini van a few days before we set off for the trip.  We couldn't get the mini van to start and it had some problem with the electrical system.  I managed to reboot by disconnecting the battery and charging it off line, charging the battery and that seemed to do the trick so we had to jump start it and got it running, ran it for a few days, the air conditioning was out and it was ninety five degrees.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh no.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So we were definitely happy to be driving at night.  I just have this problem with [NAME OTHER] likes to do an early morning drive part of it, so I drive through the night</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And she sleeps?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Eight hours, nine hours, she sleeps and then she wakes up, has a cup of coffee and by that time I really should not be driving, I'm too tired, I'm dozing off and she just, after a while, she just drives not very well, tends to try to pass people, you know</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you can't sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's going seventy.  I know, I mean I get worried.  She ran someone off, completely off the road this time because she went to pass them and she pulled back across and she hadn't cleared them yet and, fortunately, they had a wide shoulder.  I hear this honking, look back and see this car clear off the highway, they didn't get to the shoulder, I mean off the road but they were on a wide shoulder, paved shoulder and, you know, we had just gone through road construction.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Were you asleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I wasn't asleep at that point.  I heard that, it's like okay, I'm awake and then she goes into, well it was my fault because I made her nervous.  I'm like oh come on, you're the driver, this is a terrible example to set for the kids, you know, there's nothing going on</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Were they scared?  Were the kids scared?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That one shook them up a little bit.  The one that happened before where she cut off some gal and the gal was honking at us, I wasn't sure what had happened that time.  It seemed actually like the gal, the other gal was going fairly fast and so when [NAME OTHER] pulled out, she didn't see her coming up in the other lane because it looked like the gal was still approaching us as she was honking, so I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She gets distracted is what happens, she thinks about other things and she's not focused on the road.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's something but she's, you know, in denial about it and I got through it and [NAME OTHER] actually drove two hours of the, it was actually sixteen hours because we hit terrible traffic the [DEIDENTIFIED] area but that was another story.  She drove two hours there and three hours back, so you know, she was proud of her accomplishment</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And she did a better job</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Frankly.  I mean she was more aware.  She was more intensely involved.  She wanted to do a good job.  She knew she was on, you know, a stage so to speak and so she was very focused on it and wasn't aggressive and that was the thing that bothered me with [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] just gets aggressive and riding in a little sports car, she doesn't have perfect visibility and well, whatever, we got through that, it was her family's reunion, you know, so that's just fine, I had a good time, the girls had a good time.  We were in a hotel room right on the beach, on the boardwalk in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You stayed in a hotel?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, so we had a suite, it was a two bedroom suite and the rest of the sides of the family had rooms near us, one bedroom suites.  Their kids are all younger, [NAME OTHER]'s grandparents, so they didn't have anybody.  So everyone had a great time for a week and the drive back was not as eventful fortunately and [NAME OTHER] is getting ready to leave for a week and a half, she's starting traveling again, so she's taking this week of to prepare for the trip so that's, fortunately, thanks for the problem with my, I forgot the two o'clock appointment.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where is she, [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's downstairs on our patio which is kind of hidden from the rest of the house on a hammock with her laptop working away on a poster that she's going to be presenting at this conference she's going to.  In addition to a talk on a paper that she's already written I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really, where is it going to be presented?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] area.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that's nice.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She'll be there ten days in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Saturday through the next Sunday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Labor day weekend she's going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.  So I'm busy trying to get all the little things out of the way because last weekend was just trying to catch up on sleep.  I was really kind of sleep deprived, unfortunately, coming back from the trip because as soon as we got home, unpacking and getting ready, because we went back to work the day after we had driven through the night so we were</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you take some time off?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Went right back to work and frankly I should have taken some time off because Monday was kind of okay but Tuesday and Wednesday I was just</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tired?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mentally, by noon Tuesday, mentally I just conked out.  I was tired, I wasn't being very productive and I'll work a little bit this weekend.  I finally got a program I can use at home that allows me to do some of my work at home now so I was going to do a little bit of work tomorrow on that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is work pressured now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not as much pressure as it has been, not as much as in the past, one of the annoying things that I'm kind of dealing with is that there has been this problem, it was a pet project of the division head and I'd been on a couple times to get out of it, almost impossible, one person quit, another person, I basically, you know, practically have to break down and then beg to get off of it because of the depression I had which wasn't because of this but it wasn't helping either so it's just emotional trap type of project.  I mean everyone was fighting with everyone and I tried to bring some kind of management to it and some people accepted it and it didn't stick so now for the third time, of all the things that I was going to be working on with this new project manager office, it's back to the same project, why, because it needs to be saved and so rather than work on what we said we were going to be working on when I took this new position, I'm back working on the same stuff again, trying to get the people to clean up their act and finish it and so that's been a little bit.  It's more been a demotivator, it's not really be something that's been high pressure, it's just</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you know that's time limited. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's time limited, it's going to, this piece is supposed to end whatever this situation is at the end of the calendar year.  However, I was also, what I thought were time limited situations with this project in the past, the project division head, the division head says, you haven't reached my level of success, keep going, get another three months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I suspect that might happen again, that's what happened before and I just said no, I can't and I'm not going to do that again because it's not really me who's doing it but it's me who's trying to organize the tasks, manage the project because the project managers who are there can't do it.  We hope they'll teach them how to do it but they're, we don't have enough authority over them to be able to do that so, fortunately, I've paired up with someone who's a little bit more experienced with these people and that person came to the wrong conclusion that, you know, he wanted me to teach these people, let's just get this done, get this over with, she's just as sick of it as well because she's been involved with it for several years and has pretty much the same opinion that at some point you just get a poisoned atmosphere and it's time to end that project and start up another one, maybe doing something similar but it's distinct and has it's own history, it's own people, it's own, you know, and you can kind of start fresh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's in the same position, ready to move on?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I mean she's actually a senior manger in the division so she has more experience with the experiment that this deals with and she has a management role that has nothing to do with this project but she was brought in to try to get these people involved and get them going because she knows the details of the experiment, I know some of the details of project management and the computing part, the software element behind this project and she wants to go back to the new position she took when she was to be the assistant leader of [DEIDENTIFIED] within the computing division and that's new</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which division?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Computing division.  They're trying to bring a new type of colluder [INAUDIBLE] and it's been delayed by another five years, it doesn't, it's not clear that it'll ever happen.  There's always somebody trying to develop a new</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I read in the paper there was some project that they were looking into that would make it more, but I didn't</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Project X is what they call it, just to be sort of catchy and they, the assistant director at the laboratory gave a big presentation yesterday about this and I didn't go, I was trying to clean up some stuff because I had a very long design meeting with this project, a three hour design meeting and was trying to collect my notes from it to produce some hard copy from it and what I understood from my new supervisor and another person that went, the net result is they're trying to make the laboratory the natural choice for this new colluder, they want to do the R&D to support the colluder but the reality is the cost estimate for the colluder has risen such that they don't think they can scale it down anymore and have it make sense.  I mean at some point you can't just make things smaller because there's no point in doing it if it's only twice as large as the current thing and the other thing is that they pushed it out in time by five years so they wouldn't even break ground on it until two thousand and fifteen.  Eight years down the road, so this is kind of far out there, especially kind of where I am in my career and</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It wouldn't benefit you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, it was benefit indirectly in the sense that if the laboratory thinks there's a chance, they'll continue to keep people hired, keep people active, keep money flowing, however, if this thing were cancelled in two years, they would be scrambling to try to understand what to do with the people and they would downsize, they'd have to because there's no point.  They understand that, they're trying to</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So this would protect from the downsizing.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what we're hoping, is to drum up this project X where unlike almost all past projects, this wouldn't be something with a definite deliverable like a new accelerator, it would be something like maybe a new accelerator, so it's very weak and they're trying to drum it up to sell it better but yeah, it is</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sell it to the government?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sell it to the government, the [DEIDENTIFIED] government is willing to put up ten billion, eight billion or ten billion but it's not clear whether or not they want it to be in [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED].  If we had it in the [DEIDENTIFIED], it seems like they would be open to having it in the [DEIDENTIFIED] but they would understandably want to have half control and it's not clear that you'd be able to get ten billion dollars out of congress and tell them, oh by the way, half the senior management is going to be [DEIDENTIFIED] and we have to negotiate with the [DEIDENTIFIED] government, that doesn't usually work.  It didn't work with the SSC, the [DEIDENTIFIED] colluder that fell apart just as I was looking for a job and so, you know, it's not clear, it's not at all sure that it'll happen, they'll be some research and development money that'll flow into the lab for it an this project X is trying to give a name to that, that sort of quasi, maybe it'll be able to meet one condition, the goal clearly, the connection is that they want to make the lab a natural choice by getting it ready to be the idle city host and by that time, after the experience they had with the [DEIDENTIFIED] where they tried to build everything from scratch, I think they'll be more realistic to just building the infrastructure, the people, the support services, I mean they lost 100 million to a billion dollars just by itself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just building the laboratory from scratch, they have to have a fire service, personnel services, buildings for people, basic networking, all this other stuff.  They tried to build it from scratch and it fell apart.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED], that's right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] and this also was budget cutting season and it was easy to throw out this big scientific thing when they found out they were spending fifty thousand dollars a month on plants or something like this, it's very extravagant, the guy who was leading it</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's not here, that was in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That was in [DEIDENTIFIED] and it got cancelled long ago.  That was when I was first looking for a professional position, this was the early ninties. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that still closed down now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh it's long since closed down and it, you know, the funny thing was for us, ironic thing really, it cost almost as much to close it down because they promised to pay everyone for a year while they looked for a job, as it would have cost to just complete it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really, wow. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was unfortunate but they had made contractural arrangements with all sorts of contractors, companies, academic people, scientific researchers and their deal was they were going to spend at the same level for at least a year, to allow all these companies to shift their business because they weren't going to get the second year of the contract or the third year, whatever it was, and so all these people who flooded the job market trying to look for a job but they were still being paid so they could work for people for free and [DEIDENTIFIED] had hired ahead thinking there was this great gravy train coming</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Gravy train, there's this, you know, all sorts of grants were going to come to these universities so they could hire people</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because of these people?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because of the, yeah, so they hired up, then the thing got cancelled, then there was no grants coming for these people and the state universities couldn't fire them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did they get jobs?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Most did, not all, most did, some came back to the lab, very few actually came back to the lab.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Here?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Most who went tried to get a job in academics in some university somewhere, many did, not all did, many of them got jobs with the European accelerator, the new one's going to be turning on in a couple of years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The LHC, that's the one that they're supporting at [DEIDENTIFIED] but it's sited in [DEIDENTIFIED] so it's, no way of knowing whether or not the laboratory is going to expand, contract, stay the same, they're going to turn off in two years, certainly part of it will contract because they won't have the operations personnel actually operating the accelerator anymore and that's a good portion of the budget.  My job is safe but I'm starting my last class in a week so I'm hoping to get that done then sort of test the waters</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> By December it would be done.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two months, so September, October, it'll be done Halloween, I'll be graduated [DATE], one way or the other.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then you'll start looking elsewhere?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I have a couple of options, one of them is to stick it out where I am and I've been trying to get a little bit more motivated because even if I decide to move on, I need to kind of get myself to work at a higher level, I've kind of slacked off which it's been hard to stay motivated because there's been a lot of, a lot of nonsense about being directed by the division head again to do things that just aren't productive but, anyway, the other option is to, you know, look for something in the area and see if, you know, I can combine the scientific degree with the business degree and get something that would make a jump worthwhile even though [DEIDENTIFIED] isn't quite as good in employment options as it used to be, it still is pretty good in terms of it's retirement so if I could stick it out till [AGE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have to be [AGE] to be eligible?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For early retirement I think, yeah, not for, I don't know what the standard retirement is but whenever they go through their annual budget cycle it's how many people do they need to early retire this year kind of thing.  The average age there is [AGE], it's quite high and </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So if you leave before that, you'll give up some retirement money?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no, if I leave before that then the new job probably wouldn't have as good a retirement program, whatever I paid in, whatever I have now with [DEIDENTIFIED], I can still keep.  So for instance, I still have [DEIDENTIFIED] from when I was a post doctorate researcher with [DEIDENTIFIED], I still have that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] has stock or they're</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] is the combine life insurance, mutual fund retirement type company, it's mostly for academics, medical professionals.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Through the government or through [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's through [DEIDENTIFIED].  [DEIDENTIFIED] is operated by a contractor so it's not directly, I'm not directly a US government employee; I'm actually an employee of the contractor.  It's just like most of the people who work like at [DEIDENTIFIED], they're an employee of [DEIDENTIFIED] or</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's actually a private position, a private company.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a private company, yes.  It has to operate according to government rules, there are some benefits.  It is a government laboratory so I can get some government benefits from private businesses but that's only if they choose to.  I can't whip out a government, I'm not technically a federal employee for instance, so if I go to [DEIDENTIFIED] and try to get a computer, I'd have to go through a laboratory program, I couldn't go directly and say hey, I'm a federal employee, here's my E number</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I didn't realize, so there's nobody that's actually a federal employee.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, there are some federal employees over there.  The DOE office, for instance, which oversees the laboratory, those people are directly laboratory employees but the idea behind all the national laboratory systems is that they've been out of contract to operate and maintain the laboratory to somebody.  Many of the southwest laboratories have been in the news.  The problems are they're operated by the [DEIDENTIFIED] system.  This particular one is operated by just a conglomeration of universities that got together. [DEIDENTIFIED] is the same thing.  They call it FRA, [DEIDENTIFIED].  From what I understand from my father who sees the same sort of thing in astronomy, once you get an experiment or a facility that's officially large, then you sort of incorporate informally and have that association to maintain the contract to operate it with, they actually hold the contract with the government and if the government doesn't like them, it reviews every five years or so and usually it's a fairly easy process to get renewed.  In the case of [DEIDENTIFIED] and a few of the top secret labs in the southwest, there have been problems with secrets leaking out and some bad personnel policies, one of those, they actually brought up for renewal with the intent to tell the [DEIDENTIFIED] system that they weren't going to be considered for renewal, they were going to give it to somebody else no matter what because there's just too many problems.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So they renegotiate the yearly contracts essentially?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Five year I think is the term with the idea that not every five years do you get intense investigation, maybe every other time you are intensely investigated and checked out.  For the most part, this is handled all very professionally [INAUDIBLE] this time, they really raised the professional level, it was quite well done from what I've learned from the MBA program, it was very good overall corporate level type, executive planning for the laboratory, whereas in the past it's been done kind of sloppily, it was just a professor up there, here's how I'm going to do my research.  That doesn't work for a three thousand employee company that's got federal funds and funds coming from, you know, twenty different countries from around the world.  One of the changes that's happened over ten years is that this is no longer an island, it's, you know, a place that has to work with all sorts of other universities and laboratories and just can't rest on what's good enough for the local people, you have to think about what you can use elsewhere to market it elsewhere.  So there was some other possibilities too but I don't know how long they'll be once this division has gone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Possibilities where?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh for employment.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At the lab, not somewhere else.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This will be at the [DEIDENTIFIED] so the third possibility is to just wait until this division head leaves, there will likely be a reorganization again and if this position, the new position that I took just doesn't work out or if I just don't find that it's quite the right thing for me then request a transfer or something but I've been moving too many times horizontally and kind of getting worried that I'm not going to, well there's not going to be any opportunities for improvement in my income, there just isn't</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But they do give you salary increases yearly or is it pretty much fixed?  Cost of living, [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They don't guarantee any cost of living, the reality is you get something like that if you're a good employee.  If you're a great employee, you get maybe one or two percent  more than the cost of living, it's not much.  There was a time when I was getting raises and promotions every year, every couple of years, every two years.  I looked back into my record and sure enough, every year to every two years and I just hit a glass seal, there wasn't anything more, part of the problem was because [NAME OTHER] was also in that same promotion chain, advancement chain as I was in and people frankly preferred her over me despite the fact that I had qualifications that she lacked.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why would that make them prefer her?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She, frankly, played the game of telling people yes</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I played, unfortunately, I didn't realize at the time, the realistic person and they didn't like being told they couldn't do everything instantly so they wanted her to be the leader of this group and me be the lackey who kept things real and unfortunately that went on for a couple of years till I just got sick of it and said no, I want out and I was given out.  I moved to another area where I had some advancement possibilities but then this division head decided that she didn't like our product, it was succeeding at the expense of her favorite product and so she moved me to another position that was sort of between two products, working on both of them and it was a double job and I just couldn't do it.  The first product had all sorts of problems, I wasn't able to address the problems.  I had lost several Christmas vacations where I was literally glued to my laptop trying to figure out what was going on, you know, trying to hold the leaders and twiddle the knobs trying to make the thing work twelve hours a day throughout the entire vacation.  Meanwhile, [NAME OTHER] was happily moving on to the new LXT experiment, she had duel roles that people would ask her could you please to this instead of telling her we need this done by and, you know, I don't know whether it was because they, one person joked that they preferred her company frankly, they'd rather talk with her because she's an attractive female than talk with another guy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it's not just that, also she knows what to say, I mean she thinks about what she says before she says it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And a lot of what she says isn't just based on how she feels but it's based on what she thinks people want to hear.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's good at that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she's had blow ups and problems and issues and people just wash that under the rug whereas</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh she has</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, oh she's had a couple of meltdowns screaming at her supervisor type things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I didn't know that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, she did this to me several times too.  One time, I just got out of my office and started walking away and she was screaming me across the, following me across the parking lot screaming at me and I'm trying to like, you know, when you calm down we'll talk about this, you know</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What was that about?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't care, I might have been wrong, I don't care, she was going nuts about something.  It was something we were disagreeing about at work and she didn't feel like I was supporting her.  At that point, she was to defact her boss but because they were trying to play a game by not admitting that they made her my boss.  She wasn't really specified as my boss, so you know I gave my opinion on it.  I thought it was perfectly reasonable acceptable opinion that I thought that some certain way of doing something was not the best way of doing things, that something else would be and I explained my reasons and she couldn't, she's very weak technically frankly and she couldn't debate it because all she could do was repeat what someone had told her as their opinion.  I pointed out that, yeah, that opinion is coming from people that we've had problems with at work repeatedly.  This person is supposed to be an expert in this language, he comes over, I've written a whole bunch of stuff, he couldn't even figure out, the first problem he ran into, he couldn't figure it out for weeks and, you know, so it was some small reward that that particular argument which went on in at least two different places and it was mostly because she felt very insecure.  I said, no, it was because she couldn't argue, she didn't have any information or way of judgment and, you know, I've spent a lot of time trying to become technically skilled, she didn't bother, she went to [DEIDENTIFIED].  She doesn't read computer magazines, she doesn't read books, she's only read one book I think in the last five years that has anything to do with work and I gave it to her to try to force her to be better with what she was going and in the end, it turned out I was right and they were wrong, no surprise to me but it didn't matter because by that time all they even remembered was I was the [INAUDIBLE] who did it, the immovable employee who didn't accommodate the boss, never mind the fact that the boss was being hysterical twice and she was, yeah, I was in a meeting with someone who was our project lead, he's got a very high level, her project leader as well and she just became hysterical again, you know, the same kind of pattern, just completely irrational, hysterical, you know, you can say look I really disagree with this and I need, I need to break her and we'll talk about it tomorrow if you don't mind because I really don't agree with you.  She's yelling and screaming and calling him names and stuff like this and I'm just sitting there like, you know, I disagree with him too but he is the project leader and all we need to do is make sure that everyone understands that this decision came from him, if it goes bad, he gets the blame, if it goes good, he gets the credit, I'm happy.  No that wasn't good enough and the guy afterwards just sort of patted me on the back and said I really feel for you, I just never realized you were that strong but I just couldn't live with someone like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She hasn't had a hysterical episode; oh it's been about six months, a year</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not at home either?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not at home either.  She has had some at home too but just, there's no point in talking to her, she'll insist black is white.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When she's like that, sometimes you like her to take these trips.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

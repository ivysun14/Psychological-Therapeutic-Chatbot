<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible – 00:49] it didn’t [inaudible – 01:00]. [Pause.] You know when I said the thing about how I stopped seeing you, I might talk less about stuff?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he doesn’t like to hear that. That was like really complicated and it’s not at all what I man. But I don’t know what I mean. I think my stopping seeing you and my talking to Jeremy about stuff aren’t really that related. I think what’s bothering me is the difference between me and Jeremy. And somehow that feels like sometimes it feels like that will go away when you away, but I don’t think that’s true at all. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[03:30]</p>

<p>Like somehow that’s easier to come to, like an easier place to come to instead of a much harder place which is dealing with the differences than those or like waiting and hoping for Jeremy to come to some kind of content with his past that helps him. [Pause.]</p>

<p>He’s really like so ripe for it. I see it like 9 million times a day. [Pause.]</p>

<p>His struggles are really…I have a lot of pain for him, now in different ways than I had before because he’s…like he’s trying to figure out if he can do well as a musician. And that, like a performing jazz musician in music production. Like making electronic music tracks with lots of real recorded audio also. And then possibly that is really a get-all to becoming a DJ. He’s really really talented, but he, his whole life, has had trouble executing and finishing tasks. And it’s like no different now, but it’s like really really different hurting him because there’s nothing else to blame now. It’s not the wrong subject in college. It’s not the wrong deadline. He’s not like paralyzed by anxiety, like in a general way. He can’t finish his projects. And he sort of knows a lot about it. He knows a lot about the process. He can talk about how perfectionism just stalls him in his tracks and he can’t pay attention to the bigger picture of what he really wants. </p>

<p>[07:48]</p>

<p>He has like no sense of how long things take and he missed a couple of deadlines for submitting a track to a friend’s record company. And that sort of brought up a lot of harsh realities.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.. [Pause.]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s got this like really intense self, like undercurrent. [Pause.] And now like his day job makes him sad many days. But it’s like better than any job he’s had. And that often feeds back and negatively impacts each other. </p>

<p>But Jeremy is like so passionate. He like maybe half of the days of the last month, come home from work at like 5:30 and like do whatever he does, start working on music around 9:00, stay up until 3:00 or 4:00 and go to work the next day at 7:00. 7:30. Like half of the days. Fifteen days last month. That’s such an intense way of being. It screams like dedication or whatever, calling, obsession, fun, interests; he loves it. He’s like totally…he doesn’t love that schedule, but he’s very happy to be working on music when he does. There are all these little bumps that trip him up. He’s…I feel like he could see himself differently and that would help.</p>

<p>[11:03]</p>

<p>He’s also got a major hang up about like needing to provide income. That gets in the way of the music after he leaves too. [Pause.]</p>

<p>Anyway, these are the things that feel ripe for looking at. And it comes up a lot, obviously. I see a lot and I feel bothered by the distance between us. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [Pause.]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he’s a complex relationship with all the things like, really scared about the idea of having children. All the shame about not working good in his day job, good in his music. How is he ever going to make any money? He wants to make a lot of money. How long do you…? [Pause.] He worries. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[14:26]</p>

<p>But what I say is really really really true. His mom often says the fastest thing that Jeremy has ever done was get born. His dad often says Jeremy has taken two speeds; slow and reverse. It’s really true. He started like…to start to accept the second one. He made up this mantra for himself when he’s having difficult times. Chew slow. [Pause.] Which is a really nice thing to accept. [Pause.] </p>

<p>[23:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m not sure why…a little bit [inaudible – 23:29]. I just think that…you guess it’s really hard not to want to… [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I imagine a lot because [inaudible – 25:36] both very painful. And I think, probably also makes you very anxious or uncomfortable to see him struggle in the way you’re talking about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like the only time that I remember being very very anxious in college. It’s the only times Jeremy was really struggling which was like I don’t know it didn’t seem as often. It was the same like sense of he’s helpless. He’s in like this cycle that feels like it’s going nowhere with repeating painful patterns. In school, it was way worse for a variety of reasons. And then it’s like I’m helpless. It’s really hard to feel positive about anything. And then college, I would be like not be able to see if he had like woken up in the early afternoon. Feel a sense of like of emptiness and loss and fear when…</p>

<p>Thursday nights, actually, I remember throughout the entire time, he had, he always had stuff to do on Friday, just for like this really painful time. Because like Friday was the beginning of the weekend. It’s always been a hard transition for me. And then like Jeremy wouldn’t be available and he’s probably be sitting in his chair like paralyzed by anxiety and like not start his whatever it was until the wee hours of the morning. And then like not finish it. That happened week after week after week, year after year after year. </p>

<p>[28:41]</p>

<p>Yeah, I didn’t really know like what it was that I was feeling, I would cry a lot. Yeah, it does make me anxious and uncomfortable. It has for a while. Things are a little different. I feel like there are a lot more down all the time when he’s struggling, but I do feel like a sense of impatience and pain. It’s painful. Plus I sort of felt like I had to come to terms; I had to sort of make like a commitment to not to change for me to marry him. So I like sort of did that, with them out loud in that. I don’t know, like what that was, but it was something. It changed the way that I relate to his struggle. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[30:15]</p>

<p>But that sort of thing is not, it’s a nice thing to think about to say, but it’s different. It’s a long journey of really accepting change. [Pause]</p>

<p>And my parents get wrapped in to it too because they were not like so pleased. I mean my mom wasn’t pleased for a lot of reasons, but she even like when we decided that we wanted to get married, she would say, like that has a lot of problems. It’s going to be really hard. You have to be prepared for none of them to change. I’m not sure if that, like what other ways would have been more helpful for her. I don’t know. It seems like there are other ways to say something like that or other ways to deal with… [Pause.]</p>

<p>My mom has this fear that I saved Ben; like his parents are really lucky that I came along.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is an infuriating view. Basically, when she told me that story that she was saying to my dad, like, so I’m saying like Allison saved Jeremy, and my dad looked at her and he was like, Jeremy saved Allison. Yeah, lately it’s been really…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s much better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Neither of them is good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But lately it’s been…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The last one is less infuriating, especially the way your dad meant it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it’s true. I think over the course of a lifetime we, one of us is saving the other one. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I have a sense that he didn’t necessarily 100% mean exactly that, but he was correcting…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yes, my dad totally…but Jeremy kind of has that view too. Like everybody is just kind of crazy about this. He kind of will say, sometimes I feel as like to me, it helps to think about like times when I really achieved something that I cared a lot about. When I asked Jeremy about that, the only thing that he’s ever achieved, like the biggest and best achievement was me. It’s really like nothing else. I dig a little and there’s a little bit more in his life that he considers important and significant. I think he really views his life that way. It doesn’t make me feel that great, especially because I don’t view our relationship like that. I have so many people who are so important to me in such an intense way and they come and go, and like that’s always going to be a part…one of the most meaningful parts of my life. I don’t have that same good review about anybody. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[37:04]</p>

<p>I think it makes me kind of sad. Because that’s how he views his life so far. [Pause.] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible – 39:23] I know you had…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let’s talk more on Monday. But I, I’m pretty sure I have a mid-morning time on Wednesday. I also have, I know I’ll have a 4:30 time on Wednesday. That’s pretty much…but I have to go through it this weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, if they have anything like before 8:30 on Tuesday…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tuesday before 8:30?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like before 8:15 on Tuesday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. That, I probably won’t. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible – 40:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let me know if you think of any.</p>

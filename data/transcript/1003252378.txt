<p>This series of six transcripts features a couple, Dennis and Renee.  The following is session #4 of the six sessions.</p>

<p><b>Session Transcript</b></p>

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are we doing this time?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm ready to talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to start?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I actually have a list of things I'd like to talk about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: One of them is, the last time we met, I feel that you were kind of sounding patronizing to me. So that's the first thing that I needed to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'm sorry that whatever I said made you feel that way, but I'd like to hear what it was. [0:00:41.9]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It was the way that you approached me when we were discussing, or you were discussing something with Dennis and I had gotten angry. And when you asked me — I think it was something about how you perceived my pain, and so I felt that it was done in a patronizing way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't remember what it was I said?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Something just around that, you know, something similar to that I perceived that you didn't hear my pain, something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you perceived that I didn't hear your pain?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that my response is what?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Or just the way that you asked me that, I guess, would be what kind of triggered that for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I asked you if you thought I didn't perceive your pain?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that question felt condescending to you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you tell me more about what felt condescending about it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. I just — I don't know that I can tell you more than that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay. Well, I certainly didn't intend to make you feel that way at all. So I'm really sorry that I did.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Is there any more to that or…</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't think so, but thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, very welcome. I really would never want to make you feel that way.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thanks. The things that I want to address tonight would be how to talk to our kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: About what's happened and what is happening. I think that there's concern — I don't think that there is concern from both of them about what's happening in our relationship, and I'm not really sure whether they know what happened or suspect or whatever. So I'd like to know how to talk to with them. [0:03:27.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that sound okay to you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said there was a list, is that a complete list?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to complete it, or should we jump off (inaudible at 0:03:43.6)?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well no, we can complete it and then we'll make sure that we can cover all of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'd like to discuss the non-money issue that you have, and the money issue that I have. And also I'd like to know once we're done here I believe we only have one more session.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Two more.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Two more, so I'd kind of like to have a picture of what that might look like after we're done here of what would be the next step, or how to get a sense of direction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, sure.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay, list complete.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Any on yours?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, that gives us plenty to cover tonight I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before we launch into going through the list, let me just do a little check on where you guys — how it feels in your relationship with what's happening lately in the last two weeks.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I feel pretty uncomfortable right now. My stomach is really hurting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right now, here? [0:04:56.8]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I've been just hurt and angry. Thanksgiving was nice and I think we did some nice things over that weekend, but we got into the non-money issue, and that kind of really puts me back way down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So things were good until you hit that issue, and since then it's been sort of the way it feels now?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that sound right to you as well?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Given that that was the issue that set you back, do you want to start with that one, or would you want to do the kids (inaudible at 0:05:43.7)?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean I'm kind of open as long as we can cover the kids in there somewhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tonight?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, then we better start with the kids.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before — you'd like to talk to each other I guess, does that sound right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Let's (inaudible at 0:06:02.7) whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before we do that, why don't we just see what your stomach is trying to tell you, would that be okay?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just so, I'd like to have you start in a better place than you're in.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'd like to be in a better place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So before we do that, let me just see if we're clean with the exchange we had earlier with your feeling condescended by me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think I am because I think you really are sincere. So I think I'm okay with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then let's go ahead and see what we can find about this and your stomach; are you ready?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So go ahead and focus down in there.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a sense of it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel toward that part of your stomach?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: How do I feel toward it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Maybe impatient.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel impatient toward it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it possible to get the impatience to step back for a second? [0:07:20.5]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how do you feel toward it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Still impatient, doesn't really want take a…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The impatience won't step back?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Doesn't really — it's like when I hear that word then it just tenses up more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you hear the word “impatience?”</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your stomach tenses up more?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay. Do you know what this part is in your stomach?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think I just completed a conversation with his sister. And I found out that she knows about what happened, and we had a conversation. I haven't talked to her in a few months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's a result of that conversation?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, let's try again and see if the impatient part will step back for a second.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now how do you feel toward this part of your stomach?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Probably more tender.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So from that place of tenderness why don't you just see what it wants you to know about itself?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's terrified.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's terrified?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would it be okay if we tried to help it with its terror?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you see it or just sense it at this point?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Sense it. [0:09:01.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So go ahead and focus on it. And again, you still feel tender toward it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a way you could show it that you feel tender toward it and you care about it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Maybe if I breathe deeply and sort of hold my breath that would be helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somehow inside there just convey to it that you feel caring toward it, and tell me how it reacts.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's slightly relaxed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: A little.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could we just stay with it for a while? Just showing the caring for a little while more?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It seems kind of overwhelming actually. It's like even if I try to be tender and nurturing toward it, it's seems very big.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Starts to overwhelm you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, so maybe ask it not to overwhelm you as you get closer to it, and see if it's willing to not overwhelm you so that we can help it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It says okay? So see how close you can get to it without being overwhelmed by it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How close are you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: In the palm of my hand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is it reacting to being there?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And the color is — I mean, like now I can see it, so the color is better but the pain is still there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So could you just hold it for a while in a loving way until it seems to really start to trust that you care about it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's feeling a little better now. We could do some more with it and help it unload a lot of the fear if you wanted to right now. Or we could go back to the conversation.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I feel a little bit pressed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About the conversation?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I think those are really important things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I would have you do though, Rene, is see if while we talk you can hold this part and also, is there a way you can commit to returning to it sometime?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And helping it heal, so maybe you could tell it that. [0:12:20.8]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did it respond to that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay with it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how is your stomach now?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? You sense a difference?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: A little sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the sadness about, can you talk about it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Some of my reactions to Rene in the last few days that I've not supported her, or just haven't been there for her like I should have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're feeling some regrets about that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah, I sure am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And have you told Rene that you feel this way?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I've told her I was sorry and (inaudible at 0:13:24.2) time together I tell her that I wish we had more time together so I can be there for her, and connect so to speak. I haven't been there for her for a few days, and it's upsetting to her and to me too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And I have a hard time recognizing things that I say and/or things that I don't do. I really need to concentrate on being there for her, and just loving her and helping her through this pain and grief that she's going through.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Dennis told you he was sorry?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're still feeling some — did you feel like Rene could hear that or not?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, I think she heard it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's not so much her not accepting your apology as it is just feeling sad that you weren't able to do what you wanted to do? [0:14:49.9]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. And this pain that she has is long term, and that saddens me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The pain about the affair?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay. All right, so you're still feeling remorse (inaudible at 0:15:10.3)?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Guilt, okay, and sadness. Given you're feeling that way are you still up for talking about the kids?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how to handle them?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why don't we start by having you guys talk, and again, if you give me permission to blow the whistle at times and when I see parts popping up, it's okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And let's just see what happens when you start talking about it. So go ahead, Rene, the top of your list.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm just really — there's a couple of things I'm really concerned about. How the kids are reacting to what's happening and basically, the living arrangements. And that's got to be on their mind a lot. And part of it is how I feel about containing the secret. It's really hard for me to keep secrets, although they know secrets because of my past. Although I don't want them to be hurt, I think like they've already been hurt.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I don't really know what to say or how to say it. I don't know what's too much information and what's too little.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:16:49.9) is I don't think that telling them what happened is a good idea. I'm not sure what to tell them as far as what we're working on, and maybe they can help us there. I do think it's a good idea to let them know that we are working on our marriage, and also to let them know, I'm not sure in what way, that there has been a problem. So I don't really know how to put that to them. [0:17:41.9]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I don't either. I just feel like (inaudible at 0:17:46.0).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It could be very devastating if we're not careful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you going to say, Rene, you feel like you're a good judge (inaudible at 0:17:51.9)?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Of what to tell them and what not to tell them because (inaudible at 0:17:58.3) make such an issue of keeping secrets. It's really hard, there's a part of me that was real resentful as soon as you said not to tell them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just now?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It just reacts right away, you know, and then on the other hand, those are my children and…</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Don't want to hurt them.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, I don't want to hurt them, but I do know that they're already hurting. And I don't know how much you've tried talking to them, but I know I have talked to them, and I know that they're both concerned about divorce. You know, Evan's attitude is that it's just a matter of time.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And he kind of hands that down to Max, and then Max has been acting out a little bit. You know, the tantrum that he was having Saturday, I think that was part of it, and he's been real stubborn, and just digging in his heels and that hasn't happened for a long time. And he usually is the barometer for what's — at least for what's happening for me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they know that you're working on your marriage?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. We have said that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they do know that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. And they know that we love them, and I told that to both of them this morning that we're working on the marriage, and no matter what happens then we still both love them, that won't change. [0:19:23.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when they ask about divorce, how have you responded?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's something that we're not considering. I think I've said not considering, but that we are working in therapy to take care of some of the issues that we have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you haven't had conversations about this stuff with them or you have?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Minimally, I've discussed with them that we are having some problems in our marriage, but we still love each other and we're going to try to work things out. And I told the same thing that we'll always love them, and we'll always be there for them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did they respond to you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know, just fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, Rene, because it sounds like you've already, at least between the two of you, already said as much as you had said about we're having trouble, and we're working on it. So is the dilemma for you whether to go into the details of what the trouble is in this part of you that hates secrets? That's what the dilemma is for you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah (inaudible at 0:20:46.7). And I think — I know I've asked you to talk to the kids because my reactions are much stronger than yours are. You're usually the calmer one, and so that I remember there was a Sunday — and (inaudible at 0:21:03.7) Sundays can be that way. But on Sunday when I was really uptight and you were really calm, and I was really angry that the kids would think that it would be me who was the problem in the marriage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it, I understand.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And he looks perfectly fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And (inaudible at 0:21:27.1) mom, she's a nut.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get it. In the whole sequence after you found out and all the fights you had about that, excuse me, is it likely they overheard the content or just knew that you were fighting?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. It's interesting that — I mean, it's possible that they could have heard some of it along the way. Probably the first few times they weren't there at all, so they didn't hear it then, but they may have heard other conversations. I know Max asked me today, because I was really angry with you on the phone. And Max said, “What were you saying about your needs aren't being taken care of, but yours are?” And so he asked me a little bit about that. And also, my concern is that right when it came out that Evan did that book report, and it happened that one of the articles that he made a newspaper for the book report. And one of the articles was — the headline was, “Mayor is caught with another woman.” And so that, you know, alarms me, and he's probably — I think both of our kids are intuitive. And so that — I mean, I asked him was that, I said, “Gosh, you know, can you put that in the newspaper?” And he goes, “Oh, yeah, we can do that.” And I said, “Well, was that a part of the book because I would be…” and he said, “Oh, no,” he goes, “but it's a good story, isn't it?” So those kind of things, you know, are just like little flags for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And let's talk about — both of you mentioned you didn't want to hurt them. Let's just talk about your thoughts about how telling them more details would hurt them. How would you think they'd react? [0:23:26.4]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The specific details?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not specific details, but if you said the general scenario, Dennis had a relationship with another woman and…</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, they…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Found out?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It would hurt them terribly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Say some more.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think that they're just too young of boys to be hearing that happened with their dad and mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it would hurt in their sense of their image of you, and you as somebody they can trust and stuff like that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, and also it would hurt themselves, it hurt themselves. I think they would be devastated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's say some more about that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just think they would be crushed. They'd be, you know, like sad and gosh, how could you do that to mom?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think, that's how I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about you, Rene?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I got a little bit confused. I thought I knew what I would respond. I don't know if I agree with that. I mean, yes, it would crush them, but basically, to me they seem pretty crushed already. And they already are thinking that we're going to get divorced. And the other thing is that I see a whole line of your family and my family keeping secrets that are really — get played out anyway. I mean, in your family it gets played out, and my family it got played out, and they didn't talk about it. And they weren't upfront about it, and still got played out. I'm wondering if our children would have a better chance of not doing this if we told the truth. Evan knows a little bit about — Max doesn't because he was younger. I mean, he knows that my parents didn't take care of me, and that's as far as I went with Max because he hasn't asked anymore questions. But Evan knew that some of what happened wasn't appropriate. So he knows more but not real specific. And actually, sometimes Evan's mad at me for that. And he's mad because we don't have a relationship with a grandparent that he would like to have a relationship with. So that's difficult to deal with. But I don't know, I mean, I certainly would not want this repeated again. I would not want my boys to do this. And if they don't have — I don't know, if it's swept under the rug, then what?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And you're feeling that we pass down to them?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know, it sure is…</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You think by them knowing what happened, there'd be less of a chance of them having the same problem in the future when they're older?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Maybe if they knew the truth then they could deal with the truth. They could look at us as human beings that make mistakes, and that struggle to keep a relationship going rather than they know something is wrong, but they don't know what's wrong. [0:27:07.1]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that — I like the way you're talking by the way. I think that there are parts of each of you that we might want to try and clear out so that — if I were in your shoes, there would be parts of me that really wouldn't want my kids to see me that way. And would lobby to not tell, not as much out of concern for them, as concern for their image of me and how I would feel. You follow what I'm saying?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so, I heard a sort of similar thing from you that you're worried they'll get the idea that it was really your fault, and Dennis is the good guy. And I think if we can separate those parts it will be easier to come to some kind of decision about it. Do you follow what I'm saying?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that make sense to you, Dennis?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. When you say separate that part that concerns me about what they would know about me, what do you mean separate us like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ask it to step back.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If both of you go in for a second and find those parts; just find that voice and say…</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not a good idea?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or not (inaudible at 0:28:38.9) necessarily not a good idea, but the one that's worried about…</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: My image</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You looking bad, and the one that's worried about you looking bad. And just ask them to step back and let you — the two of you try and figure this out for a second.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I'm not sure where (inaudible at 0:29:03.1) see any differently though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you would continue.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: To me it seems like — I mean, I know that you said that that's hard stuff to back, but to me it feels like it might still be there. And you're worried about what the kids will think about you. [0:29:39.4]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think I'm more worried about what it could do to them.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think about how I was as a kid, and where I would be or where I could have been had the truth been told and acknowledged. And then of course not just left there, but that you could see a process going on that, yes, people are working on it, and I think I could have come further a lot faster. I don't think it would have taken me to my, whatever, mid thirties or whatever to address some of the things that I needed to address.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Well, I wouldn't have a problem discussing it with them, but I'm not sure where we would start.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I would start — because we haven't really discussed anything with them as a family, the four of us, so I would start there with both of us being present.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I don't know, I think I would just reiterate what we said, that we love them and, you know, that we know that we've told them that, you know, we're in therapy and we're trying to work on things in our marriage. And that they must be wondering, you know, why the sleeping arrangements are different, and why there's so much tension in our house, and why it's so difficult. And we want to make sure that they know it's not them. I mean, because I think that kids know — I mean, that's their world is that they feel it's their fault. It's something they did or something they could change.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I think everything you said makes total sense. But to interject what happened, does that still have to happen in your view?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I still feel like it shouldn't be a part of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, Dennis, if you were to inject at that point, why don't you — Rene took us up to this point.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't you pick up at that point and say what you might say.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: To the boys?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, my goodness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just give it a try.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I thoroughly agree with everything Rene said to that point. After that I have a hard time thinking about what to say, and/or if I even want to say that anything about an affair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's just take it for a second as if you agreed to do this. We haven't gotten to that point yet, but just as if you'd agreed to do this, and your boys are sitting here, and you've agreed to be the one to say it to them, why don't you just go ahead and see what comes out of your mouth. [0:33:25.4]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know what to say. It's just something I just can't blurt out right now, it's just too hard for me to even think about what to tell them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I have not a problem telling them about that I hurt their mom, and I did tell them that. I told them I've hurt their mommy, and what's happened was my fault. I have told them that. And I've also told them that we're working together and healing our marriage, and they've accepted that. Taking it further than that, I have a hard time thinking about what I could say about the affair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you know Dennis had said that much?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I asked him to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, why don't we stay with that scenario, and Rene, you take the lead in telling them, and just see how it feels to hear her telling them right now.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's hard to tell. I guess I would say to them that what happened was — I'd remind them of the conversation that you had that…</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I hurt you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, that you hurt me and the reason for the hurt was that you started a relationship with another woman, and you didn't tell me. And it was over period of time, and finally what happened was she called to let me know that. And now we're trying to see if we can rebuild our marriage, and if I can trust you again. And it takes a lot of work for both of us. It takes a lot of time and there are a lot of struggles, and if they have any questions they can ask us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did that feel to each of you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: As good as it could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:36:57.2) say more than that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And it's just hard for me to say that to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did it feel to you to say it to them?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Very hard.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just want to — I hope that — I want to make sure that we're not going to hurt these kids by telling them this. That's my main concern.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As it should be, yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Can it hurt the kids?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's what you guys are figuring out, you know these kids. I never met them.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. You feel it won't hurt them, huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't say that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I (inaudible at 0:37:44.9) say they are already hurting. For me, I know that to have more information is helpful. I can put things — I can understand them. I can put them in place.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I agree, for a nine-year-old that might be a little different.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, he's very intuitive.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I'm not (inaudible at 0:38:22.1). I'm not sure this is good timing for this right now. It might be, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's bad about the timing?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Their ages.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I think Evan would, you know, be okay with it. Maybe not okay, but, you know, he would act okay with it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know if he would act okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No? I think he would handle it like he handles most things. He would accept it and not really want to know anything. He's kind of like me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, it could be a teaching moment.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It could be a moment that you reveal some of your own feelings, so that he knows that you have some of those feelings, you know, and that it's okay to have feelings, and it's human to make mistakes. I don't know, I think Evan would be mad. [0:39:47.1]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, it's very possible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would be mad at Dennis?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think he could be mad at both of us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would he be mad at you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think maybe he might be disgusted that I would stay, and why would I put up with that? That to me is kind of (inaudible at 0:40:25.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Black and white guy?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, kind of a teenage expression just to know where he is. He is kind of like you. Just (inaudible at 0:40:42.5) or do say that (inaudible at 0:40:46.2) people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we don't have a lot of time left. So let me just get a reading on how things are feeling on this issue now. First, how has the conversation felt?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think the conversation was good. I think it's good that we did it, and I think it's good that we did it here. And I don't know that we would have been able to separate it out ourselves.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How has it felt to you to talk about it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I agree, I felt good talking about it or listening to Rene put it like she did. Really, she put it very well.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And I don't think you could have done it any better. You know, if you're going to tell the boys, it would be a good way to tell them. So, you know, I'm still a little nervous about telling them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you both are.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I'm definitely nervous, but I know that this was going to go on for a lot longer than — and it's not just going to be like a small glitch in our life. It's not going to be just a couple of months, this is going to go on for a long time. And I don't see it like miraculously resolving itself like in a short period of time. And so I think that could create more anxiety for them.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: If they didn't know what it was about?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean, I hope we don't have to tell them tomorrow. I don't know. We could wait and see, but I just think that it could cause a lot more — that underneath that restless, that not knowing about what's going on, I don't understand. They have a lot of private conversations and, you know, it's tense, they have different sleeping arrangements. And that's not going to be resolved quickly.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think the not trusting you isn't going to be resolved easily, and I think they'll sense that. That's just my feeling. [0:43:09.9]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop in a few minutes. But it sounds like you're still quite nervous about the idea — and the effect it could have, but you're open to the possibility of telling them?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes, I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're, it sounds like leaning toward telling them, but still a little worried about what it might do to them, does that sound right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel okay if we don't figure it out tonight and kind of wrap up like that? Well, I thought you did a really nice job tonight with a real touchy topic, and you both hung in there real well.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You didn't blow the whistle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't have to blow the whistle. I didn't see parts popping out. So this was an easy one for me. How's the…</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It still hurts, but I still have it in my hands, so…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Doing the breathing and the white light kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, good.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It seems to help a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, and I'm also glad you told me how you felt about what I'd said because I never would intentionally hurt you, but I could do it by accident. So I'm glad to have the opportunity to let you know it wasn't intentional.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thanks, I feel a lot less angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you really? Good. So, any last words about tonight?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anything for you, Rene?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Just wondering the direction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The direction from here?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Let me think about that, and maybe we can talk some more about that next time.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Is the money thing that you mentioned ongoing, or have you talked it through, or is it still keeping you pretty upset?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's still got you pretty upset. Well, maybe we could catch that one too next time. Okay?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you next time.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My pleasure.</p>

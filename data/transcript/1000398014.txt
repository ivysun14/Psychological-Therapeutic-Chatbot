<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, the first thing I thought is what's been on and off my mind since yesterday, and that is what you suggested might have happened to me about coming into my parents' room when they were having intercourse.  And uhm, mm, then I immediately started thinking about money, and uhm, (Sigh) well, thinking about the fact that I haven't paid the last bill you gave me.</p>

<p>A, and it's almost as if uhm, (Stomach growls) I don't, uhm, (Sniff), I mean, i, it's not that it's not due, because I guess it was due, probably really, at the first of the month.  Although I've been paying them lately at the last of the month.  Uhm, but it was as if, the way I was thinking of it, that there was another one after it, and so that I was behind even in the way I'm paying them now.  And uhm, (Sigh) and then, and then I just began thinking of the way the budget's working out, and uhm, just the feeling that I don't have enough money.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, I mean, the two must be connected, because the way I went from one to another, but the only thing I get a real feeling about, is this feeling of money, and not handling it.  Uhm, because when I think about the budget, I'm thinking about the fact that well, m—, m—, I mean, I have a bad attitude there, I suppose, in that we worked out possible amounts for different types of things, like food, or uhm, paying you, or uhm, my carfare, and uhm, things that I have to get at the drugstore, and cleaning, and stuff.  All the things I have to spend money on, on a weekly or monthly basis.  And uhm, and as soon as we did that, then I became, it was almost like I became rigid, that well that's exactly how the money had to be.  And MSCZ kept saying, well, it's only to kind of help as a guideline.  And then, the whole idea is to know where your money does go, and to know what money you have to work with.</p>

<p>And I just uhm, (Sigh) have trouble with that, because it's, I get rigid about, well then, after we've set up these certain limits to the amounts for different things, that it has to be that way, and uhm, and yet on the other hand, I'm, I think I'm really continuing to spend money as I used to.  I'm probably being more careful, and I have more of an awareness of what there is, but uhm, I'm not trying, I don't know, somehow, I spend what I have on immediate things.  And so I'm not being careful enough to make sure I have amounts, like for clothes, that uhm, because I've charged some things.</p>

<p>And instead of saving out money each month to be able to pay the charge, I'll spend what I have for the month, and then suddenly, there are these bills coming in for the charge that, I really haven't laid the money away.  And uhm, (Sniff) I don't know, a—, a—, I mean, this isn't something I've felt just now, and I am feeling it just now, but uhm, I keep thinking th, that it must be fairly simple to be able to sit down and know what I have, and work out wh—, how I can spend it.  But I just can't seem to do it, and I always keep having this feeling that I can sit down and work it out.  Uhm, but then, whenever I try to, it always ends up sort of my checking to make sure that I haven't s—, like uhm, overdrawn on my account, or I don't know, somehow, that I'm covering what I have to pay immediately, and, and, and I, I just can't seem to plan ahead with it.</p>

<p>And uhm, (Silence) well, I don't, I mean, I've talked about money before, and how it means more to me than just as money per se.  And uhm, and so I'm sure probably this is just part of all that.  But I, I, I still can't think straight about it, and uhm, all, all I keep thinking is, my attitude seems to be that once I get worried enough, uhm, I can go to MSCZ and say I just have to have more money, and that s, somehow from somewhere, he'll produce more money.  When I know in fact, that for him to give me more money, it means have to shift around the ways we're spending money.  And that it will come away from something else that we've already worked out.  And —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Is that really true?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  What?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What you just said?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  That I know it?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   No, that that's really your only option?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean, to get more money?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, well, no, its ov—, I didn't think of this until you asked that, but uhm, 2 things immediately came to my mind.  One was, I could stop coming here, which maybe is behind this, I don't know.  And the other is that, uhm, well, an—, an—, on that same level, sometimes MSCZ's talked about when he stops, because he's feeling nearer to it, and uhm, in—, in—, I mean, not that he'd stop because of that.  But in that vein of when he does, then it would mean more money but uhm, because usually we've thought of it as, well, by then, FSO would start school, so it would kind of immediately go to something else.  But uhm, then the other things was, that I could have a job th, that gave me more money.  But I don't know that, I mean, that was sort of a second thought.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, the, I think the next thing I thought of, er, uhm, and somehow, when I start thinking about the rabbit and uhm, just this feeling I've had lately about it, that well, I mean, sometimes I think I've even had it exactly the same way about FSO, but that there's this rabbit at school — and right now, he's in my room — and he needs something that I'm not giving to him.  A, and I think he really does seem to need something that he's not getting.  And it might be just exercise, because he isn't let out that often, yet.  But uhm, (Sigh) I, I think that I'm thinking of it more as needing more attention and handling, loving affection, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>And uhm, and then, and then, somehow I got on to thinking about uhm, FLMZ, and a question that was sort of dropped, that I let drop, because it seemed as if people didn't really want to follow it, follow up on it at all.  But just now, I was thinking of it again, as something I needed.  And that was, I had asked at some point, if something couldn't be worked out, so that FLMZ had some time to give me after the children left.  Because as things are arranged, she doesn't.  And I didn't know whether something might be able to be worked out.  Uhm, (Sigh) and Mrs BBF hadn't said flatly no.  I mean, she was considering it, but then the whole thing was dropped.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>(Sniff) Well, I don't know how I got to thinking about this, but uhm, I started thinking about the fact the children uhm, painted paper that we'd put around a structure so, sort of becomes a tepee.  And uhm, they really, and then they got involved in making all sorts of other things that they could wear when they play in the tepee.  And, some of which I encouraged them to think about, and others that they thought of themselves, and uhm, somebody came in and asked at one point whether they'd been talking about Indians a lot lately.  And I said no, that it was something that I had uhm, introduced to them, kind of in connection with Thanksgiving, but as sort of a study of Indians, anyway.</p>

<p>And uhm, and then, I was just thinking about how I haven't really picked up — except maybe our studying pets, which I plan to do anyway — interests that they are themselves expressing.  And then I was thinking, well, they don't seem to be too much, expressing anything strong enough that could be picked up yet.  And I don't know, I, I guess I've been wondering if it's my lack of skill at doing it, or whether they really just aren't yet.</p>

<p>And then, anyway, then I started thinking about this boy MTRZ, who's kind of strange.  And uhm, I think I mentioned him y—, maybe yesterday, I don't know.  But I have a conference with his parents tomorrow.  And uh, (Sigh) I just feel something is not right there, but I don't know what it is, and whether he's really disturbed, or if he's just uhm, reacting to certain pressures, that if the pressures are removed, he'd be okay, almost immediately.</p>

<p>And uhm, and then, I was just thinking that lately he's, or in fact, whenever he's done drawings, I think he always does very, sort of strange drawings.  In my eyes, too, because I've rarely seen a child do them like this, where they're all just lots of lines, all going along kind of intricately interwoven.  Uhm, if he does something that's representational, it's always done in a very elongated way, and sort of blocks uhm, at a time.  And, and very much i, in a line form too.</p>

<p>And then today he was, some of them were decorating the inside of the tepee, and I had said that, because of what it was on, and so forth, we couldn't paint the inside.  But they could put things up inside.  And he just quickly whipped off 2 uhm, drawings, sort of stick figure types, very, quite immature, but still free, of Ind—, 2 Indian boys.  And uh, I mean, it was just so unlike what he's been doing before, and he didn't hesitate, he didn't say, I don't know what to do, I don't know how to start.  Uhm, (Sigh), so I, I, I, I don't know, I was just thinking about that, and I don't know quite what to make of it.  (Pause, Sniff)</p>

<p>Because then I think, w—, the next thing I think is that uhm, (Sigh) as I know his mother better, or as I hear more about the background that the school knows in connection with MTRZ, I, I just feel more and more strongly that unless one of us by chance hits upon something that uhm, affects his parents, so that they seem to understand, or I don't know, i—, i—, I just don't feel that we can really help the situation as it is right now, unless by chance we do, unless by some accident.  Uhm, and that things might just build up until MTRZ really explodes, or uhm, in some way becomes obviously so bad, or so disturbed, or, or else maybe we're all wrong about it.  But I think he's tending to be disturbed, but uhm, it's hard, I don't know, I just don't feel I can really know.</p>

<p>And uhm, so i—, w—, so anyway, I was just thinking I guess, that with this attitude, I don't know why I think about him, a, and then I'm thinking well, here I am avoiding thinking about myself.  And uhm, well, I guess mainly yet, what we were talking about yesterday.</p>

<p>And yet, when I wasn't here, I kept, I mean, I wasn't thinking about it all the time, but it kept coming into my mind, and uhm, always the way I was thinking about it yesterday, in that it would make sense if it had happened.  But then I uhm, I resist in someh—, somehow I'm resisting thinking it happened, uh, almost like well, it would be too uhm, well, it would make too much sense, or, or that it would just be too, everything would fit in too nicely.</p>

<p>And uh, well then also, I, I guess I was thinking last night that one time MSCZ said to me that Dr XBF, his analyst, had thought he must have seen something.  And this was a long, a long time ago.  I mean, several years ago.  Uhm, and it was in connection with the fact that — I don't know what problems, MSCZ didn't go into the details of it.  I think it was just a new thought to him and he happened to mention it to me.  And uhm, he had shared a bedroom, I mean, the whole family shared a bedroom until they moved to the country.  And they didn't move to the country until he was, well I forget how old, but uhm, well, old enough, anyway, so if he saw something, h, he'd been very impressionable.  And uhm, (Sniff) i—, I don't know, whether it was 4 or 6 or what.  But, I mean, several years, anyway, of sharing a bedroom with his parents.</p>

<p>And uh, (Sigh) so, so I think when, when I was thinking about this at home last night, I kept kind of thinking, well uhm, w—, (Sigh) I don't know exactly how, except sort of, maybe I didn't want to think, well, this has happened to me, like it's probably happened to many people.  And that I'm just like everybody else.  Or uhm, (Pause) well, I don't know, I just, I feel sort of confused when I think about it now.  Uhm — (Sigh, Pause)</p>

<p>Because it seems like I, I've sort of switched around from the way I was thinking yesterday, in that when you first suggested it, I thought immediately that it would make sense, but I also felt uhm, that I couldn't believe it unless I could remember it actually happened, happening.  And, and yet I also felt it would be, would have been a dramatic enough experience, or strong enough experience, whatever, so that it would explain so many things.</p>

<p>And uhm, now it's almost as if I'm thinking that would be so ordinary, because it probably has happened to a lot of people, and it isn't dramatic enough.  Or maybe just simply it isn't unique enough to me.  But uhm, (Pause) I don't know why I just feel this, but I, I just started feeling, well, you're laughing at me, because I'm so involved in wanting it to be, whatever has happened to me, to be something very dramatic and unique to me.  And then, if I start thinking of your laughing at me, then I feel angry.  Or maybe I just want to feel angry.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   That's curious, that you think I was laughing right now.  It must mean something.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh, Pause) Well, I don't know, except it was I think, in connection with my saying I wanted what had happened to me to be unique to me.  And uhm, I don't know, almost as if I was thinking of your thinking, well, everybody wants to be different, but we aren't.  Everybody's really the same, or uhm, I mean, now, when I think of it, then I, then I immediately think of uhm, well, my parents tried so hard to have everything equal, and treat us all the same.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Oh.  Ah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence)  Well, I don't know, it's almost as if I, I'm feeling a whole n—, I don't know, a long time of people being amused at my attempts to somehow be different, be me.  Only then, it wouldn't be exactly me, because I'd be trying so hard to be different.  And uhm, I was thinking of something that occurred to me recently, anyway, of uhm, the way I used to use sports, and play sports at school.  Because FYC didn't, and FNA didn't.  And, I mean, mainly FYC, because of course, at that point, I couldn't really compare to FNA.  But then, she didn't either, so that was always an area that satisfied me, in high school.  Even though I wasn't really that good.  I wasn't terrible, so I could always make the teams, but I wasn't really that good.</p>

<p>And uhm, and then I was thinking one time too, about, just my interest in horseback riding, and so forth.  And uhm, perhaps again, I really had an interest, I don't know.  But again, it was my interest, and then, then, eventually, FNA got interested.  And I always was annoyed at that.</p>

<p>But uhm, but then also I started thinking about this boy MTRZ again.  Because the one thing I felt, and something I was told recently about what he did, I interpreted it this way too.  He had, he's been going to hockey games with his parents.  And I guess the first one this year that he went to, when they played The Star Spangled Banner, and everybody stood, he wouldn't.  And his parents were furious at him, of course they kept saying, you have to stand, but they didn't want to have to actually drag him up and make a scene.  And he wouldn't.  So then afterwards, they told him he could never go to another one, unless he promised to stand up.  And uhm, and then afterwards, he did.</p>

<p>And, when I hear—, they think of it as, he's just not minding.  And if you're s—, hard enough on him, he'll mind.  And I thought of it immediately, well, he was trying to be different.  If everybody's standing, then he'll sit, because then that distinguishes him as different from others, and as what he is.  In a sort of false way, but still.  I don't know, I immediately interpreted it that way, and it just seems like maybe it really is that.  I, I see his whole problem all connected with that.  And uhm, but maybe it's because of my own way of seeing things, just because of my own, I don't know, drives about myself, or something.  But uhm, (Pause) because then I, I also was just thinking how I did become different in me, in that I was the one who stood out as being so unpleasant, in the family, within the family.  I don't know that outsiders knew, unless my parents would tell them.</p>

<p>But uhm, (Pause) but I don't know why I get onto thinking about that, in connection with having seen my parents, if I did.  (Pause) The one thing that makes me think I might have, other than the fact that everything would make sense, is just because I have such a strong feeling against imagining them making love.  Actually, I mean, trying to visualize it.  And I have a similar feeling about MLWZ and FHF.  I remember now thinking about MLWZ and FHF at the end, yesterday.</p>

<p>And uhm, and yet I, I suppose I have uhm, well, I think of it more, because I sometimes try to think of other couples in that way.  And it's sort of a strange curiosity almost, that I can't just accept other couples make love, and that I don't have to try to visualize them in my mind.  And, and then it's almost like a curiosity, that I want to seem them, so I can believe it.  Or uhm (Pause) —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Who, for instance?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I mean, I know that I've thought about uhm, FNI and MW sometimes —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) I thought so.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  — and been unable to think of it.  And other people too, but uhm, I suppose more often, FNI and MW.  Uhm, (Sigh) —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, what have you imagined?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I'm not too sure, because I, I think of it more in terms that I find it hard to imagine.  Uhm, because usually, FNI's driving MW crazy (Laughs), which is sort of similar, again, to my parents, except FNI's a bit stronger in controlling situations, and bossing MW around.  But uhm, (Sigh) and MW doesn't seek it.  And my mother would be much more tactful about controlling things, if she were.  And then, my father was always seeking things, advice, or how do we go here, or what to we do here?  And then my mother would take over.  Whereas, MW doesn't, and FNI takes over, then MW goes, furious.  Uhm, so I don't know, I, I mean, that might be an excuse to pretend I can't imagine, but uhm, — 
  
ANALYST:   Well, if you try, what do you conjure up?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I get mixed up with what I know, and then uhm, I guess what I would feel about it, that must, would be part of my imagining.  Because I think I imagine uhm, MW, sort of pretending that it's not happening, but being involved enough so he's actually making love with FNI.  And that FNI would be the one really involved and being passionate.</p>

<p>But then, uhm, I don't know if I mentioned this at the time, but I found it disturbing when FNI told me this, because it indicated MW being much more involved, or taking part, or I don't know, something, then I would want to imagine.  Uhm, and that was in connection with when she was having, well, it was 2 times.  One was when she got pregnant with MYDN.  And one of the things that made her think she was pregnant, was because MW said he couldn't find any sign of the IUD.  And uhm, then the other things was when she was having trouble with her cervix, and all, and MW — or, there was some other time, anyway — when MW, obviously, was looking at her body and, and noticing or feeling it and noticing.  And uhm, being involved in a way that I just didn't even want to think of him as being involved.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I don't know, except it just reminds me of the same kind of attitude I've had with my father.  That it seems like with MW, and again with my father, that I don't want to think of MW as being uhm, that involved with FNI, or uhm, (Sniff) that interested in making love, I guess, especially, with her, or my father with my mother.   Uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>And then I, I wonder well, wondering if it would be wishful thinking that, well, especially now with my father, I've kind of gotten on to him.  And uhm, thinking about what you said yesterday, on why I came to the table with my slip on.  Uhm, if I had sort of wishful thoughts that, if it were me and not my mother, then he would be much more involved, and I don't know, passionate, or I don't know, just anyway, more involved than I want to think of him.</p>

<p>I don't know, but then, then, I sort of felt mixed up, in that, if I had this feeling of uhm, what was going on between my parents, of something violent, and my mother being attacked, and uh (Sigh) I mean then, I th, th, thinking well, why would I come to the table with my slip on, as a means of offering myself to my father?  Or just think of it anyway?  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm thinking about the rabbit again, and this feeling that I'm not giving it enough affection, or I don't know, the kind of handling it needs to feel happy.  (Laughs) And I think like, I keep looking at the rabbit, thinking he's sick, because I, because I, essentially what I'm looking at him and thinking, is that he's uhm, unhappy, because he isn't being loved enough, or getting enough attention.  And uhm, (Sigh) —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Which of course, was exactly what you were feeling about your father.  You wanted to be first among equals.  You wanted to be regarded specially, not the same as FYC and FNA.  You wanted to be different and special.  You felt the same lack that you feel the rabbit does now.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, I don't know, I uhm, I suppose it's all coming from thinking, well, the way I became special again is to be, was to be unpleasant, and pick fights, and everything.  Because then, my father had to notice me, and I was different from the others.  And, and then I was just thinking again, but the, it was almost a protestation, or something.  I don't know, th—, but the bunny is so sweet and nice, in a way.  I mean he, he, there's hardly any interaction, but uhm, (Sigh) I don't know, just sort of thinking, well, he's so sweet and nice and rabbitlike, in a, in a nice sort of soft and cuddly way.  And so he should be loved, is almost the way I'm thinking.</p>

<p>And uhm, and then I thought of a girl whose mother came in yesterday for a conference, and who, who was then talking about possibly having caused her to be slower to develop emotionally, because she herself, the mother wanted to be doing other things, and didn't know it at the time.  And, and it's only recently that she's found this out about herself.  And so sh, she was restless and unhappy, and didn't know the source, and probably did not give her child what she needed exactly, either.  And uhm, I don't know, I was thinking w—, her child, who's, who's a sweet child, but she is very quiet and reserved, or else she'll become extremely overexcited and silly, and unnatural, in the, in the way she kinds of lets go of her feelings.</p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, then thinking, just, almost as if, well I in turn, because I was feeling sort of guilty about this child during the conference, in that she's so quiet and withdrawn often, and I know she's unhappy in the classroom right now.  But I don't really know how much we can do as teachers.  We do try, and FLMZ's been very good.  But I was feeling kind of guilty, in that, because she's not noisily demanding something, my inclination is often to not think about her needs too, as equal to the ones who are being so noisy and demanding, and aggressive and unpleasant.  And that I give more time to the children who are that way, and so of course, it's often boys, because they often have a, they often express things in a louder, more aggressive way.</p>

<p>And uhm, but there is one girl who has been, and just thinking that I, I, I react to that, rather than to the quiet, sweet, withdrawn ones.  (Pause) Because then the next thing that a—, I guess I was thinking well, why would I do it, unless I feel sympathetic because I had taken the role of being loud, and argumentative and unpleasant.  But then I, and then I also was thinking well, FNA was the quiet, sweet, withdrawn one.  Not exactly withdrawn, but she was thought of as a young child, as being shy and quiet and reserved, and timid, and uhm  (Silence) —</p>

<p>Well, I don't know why I'm having trouble with this.  Because in a way, well, at least I think of one, I think it would be an aspect of it.  But I'm thinking again of wanting to be different and special to my father.  And yet then, my coming to him, in effect, saying here I am, in my slip, uhm, if I already had this feeling about uhm, (Sigh) what had happened between my parents, and it being something violent, and uhm, (Sigh) well, where, where, anyway, well, my mother was sort of being attacked, I guess.  And uhm, I, I, I can think of it as, well that would MSCZ, I guess, that I would think of defining how special I was to my father.  But uhm, then I'd really be special.</p>

<p>But I keep having trouble thinking, well, if I had such horrible thoughts about it, then how could I ever think of my father that way, or 
approach him.  Well, except then I remembered your pointing out that my doing it at the dinner table when it would be so unacceptable, I was safe.  Uhm, (Sigh, Pause) —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.

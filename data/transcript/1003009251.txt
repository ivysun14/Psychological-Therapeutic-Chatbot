<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that is all we need to do with that.  So what did you tell [NAME OTHER]?  How, how did you, you tell her you were doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, kind of okay.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And what is, uh, the hold up here?  What is the problem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, uh, I was working at the same place I've worked for last year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, those IRS forms or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And the, um, got my, my food stamps went way down.  And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because your income went up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Went up.  And also they raised my rent by $47.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Was this section 8 or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I moved into my own apartment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, they did all that because I was working part time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I wasn't making any money because the, uh, calls were low.  So even though they scheduled me for hours, when I would sign in, they would tell me to get off because the calls were running low.  So half the time, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wasn't getting any extra money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see what you're saying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And all that happened to me so I've gotten very, very depressed.  [CRYING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Well, were you able to go back to them and tell them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now, yeah, no because it didn't matter to them because I was working.  But in March, they finally let me go, you know, because it's seasonal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So this is a pattern, though, that you've gone through before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But I was living at home, so it didn't make any difference.  I was living with my parents.  But now, since they let me go in March, everything is going back to normal.  I needed my food stamps [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm having a hard time breathing.  And I just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, why are you having a hard time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I went through pulmonary function tests, um, last week and I don't have the results yet.  But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you don't have any new medicine for that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not yet because they don't know what is wrong with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So they don't have you on steroids or anything of that nature, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, not yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If that is what I need.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we need to be careful if they do that because, um, we can sometimes see, um, mood changes with steroid medicines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  Um, and so sometimes people with steroids can, uh, can get depressed and sometimes they go the other way and they get anxious and restless and manicy.  Hopefully, you know, you won't need it.  But if you do need it, um, we also need to be careful, uh, the power cord isn't here.  We also need to be careful if you need it, but they don't put you on, you know, too much of it because it also seems to be a dose related phenomenon.  So as you go up in the dose, you sometimes find, you know, more side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and, [PATIENT NAME], in the past, I've had you fill out a rating scale -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For me, and so I think, if I can find one, uh, what I'd like to do is document at least where you're at today.  You've seen this before.  This is a, um, Beck, it's called a Beck Inventory.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  And I'm going to get the power cord.  That, the reference range is over the last 2 weeks.  All right.  We're working on getting the cord.  I'll be right in [PATIENT NAME].  Does that form look familiar?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  I lot of people do, but it, it is actually useful.  They've got some sort of a metric on there that can measure how you're doing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Let's see.  So the VNS, though, is not causing any problems, as far as you can tell?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not that I know of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes?</p>

NR: 
She says that you say it's charged.
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>

NR: 
[INAUDIBLE] charge that we have to look up the cord.
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  We'll you see the cord part that is missing is this part right here.  It's something like those from the wall into there.</p>

NR: 
Huh.  And it was [INAUDIBLE].
<p><b>DR:</b> And this part is here.</p>

NR: 
And it's for sure not in [INAUDIBLE]?  Not even the side pocket or anything?
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think so.</p>

NR: 
Because I can't imagine it's not [INAUDIBLE].  Okay.  Well I'll check my cabinet [INAUDIBLE].
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So, if, if it's wasn't for the finances and work related stuff, [PATIENT NAME], what do you think, uh, how do you think you'd be doing here?  Let's hold that up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I'm sorry.  Um, well, because of, um, I don't know if everything is related to, uh, debt or my health either.  Um, I mean, I don't know, you know, my shortness of breath or if I'm just generally falling apart.  My head, it hurts constantly now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, this type of, uh, headache that you've had, is it something you've experienced before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Is it a migraine, migraine headache?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, sometimes it develops into a migraine, but not always.  But it's constantly there now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Have you taken any, uh, migraine medicine for that in the past?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Imitrex used to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But then it stopped working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It stopped -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And now they won't let me take it, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because of my heart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are they worried about with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, well, I tend to have high blood pressure -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So the heart -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I've had a heart murmur.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you taking blood pressure medicine now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take Maxzide, I um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about the cholesterol?  You still on that lovastatin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any other medicines that are new since we last met?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, I'm going to do 1 more thing here and we'll be done with this.  All right, so the Maxzide, what, yeah, the Maxzide, so you've been on that for a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did, did, uh, [NAME OTHER] check your blood pressure today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she did.  It, it was good.  It was like 117/69 or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.  Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it, it, oh, did they?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, did they?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's been under control for a long time now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're lucky.  One's, uh, that has been able to balance that.  Yeah, it looks good.  Okay.  How old are you, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE].  All right.  How are things with your sister?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where is she living now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She lives in [DEIDENTIFIED].  And my parents are doing good, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They, uh, right now they're in Tennessee on their way to Florida.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They are having a family reunion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  You're not going to go though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My sister and I never go to those things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?  Why not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, actually we are not that interested in -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, I think they'll be here maybe the year after next.  [LAUGHING].  That is enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, so you can see them right, so you don't miss out on all of it, but.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, well, with your medical stuff here, did they do, uh, pulmonary function test?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, I mean, sorry, did they do a chest x-ray?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, she did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, did they give you the results of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then they said, um, to call them when I get home -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Today and see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because obviously, I mean, breathing issues are closely related to anxiety problems, and they kind of drive each other.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you're not breathing well, and then, you know, you start to have anxiety as you were earlier here, you know, it's, it's, it can make it more of a problem.  Are you seeing [NAME OTHER] at all for counseling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I haven't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I guess she thought I was doing well enough -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That I didn't need necessarily need it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, maybe that is true at the time, but, um, certainly you can benefit from gain, gaining some, you know, skills and techniques to get your anxiety back under control.  And the medicine is 1 part of it, but having, you know, some, uh, confidence that you're not dying and that, you know, you're going to be okay and that you'll get through this is reassuring.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And breathing techniques and these kinds of things, [NAME OTHER] can go over with you, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, so, I, I think that these, uh, emesis are sneaky, and they fluctuate, and there are times when you feel more anxious than others.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, times when your mood will be, you know, um, more, uh, tense or more depressed than others as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I also have a new puppy that is tearing my house apart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, good for you.  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I, I do recall last time your dog had died.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, that is always a tough life experience to go through.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I still miss her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because she was so wonderful.  Now I've got this new puppy that is just outrageous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She is real cute.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She'll settle down I will hope.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, uh, what kind of dog?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's a Multshi.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She, she, uh, uh, part Maltese.  Her father was Maltese and her mother was a Shitzu.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So she's real cute.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  That is fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's got the Maltese face and a Shitzu rear end.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It wiggles real cute.  But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hello.  So, um, a smaller dog.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She weighs 12 pounds right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, uh, which is twice the size of my other one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  My, my, uh, the one that passed away was, uh, uh, full blooded Maltese.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she only weighed 6 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  But she lived for a while, right, 14 or 15 or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fourteen years, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See, I remember these things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that is pretty good.  But it is tough.  It's hard to lose an animal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We have, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Real tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I lived in California, we had 4 cats.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And 3 of them had passed away, but the little black one is still alive, and I talked to [NAME OTHER], you know frequently -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She, she's 19 now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Unbelievable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And she -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Geeze.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She weighs 6 pounds and she's a little feisty and she's still -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is a little scary to think that they can live that long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To think about it, 19 years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  But, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's a cutest little thing, that little black one.  But all the cats that, that we had before had been abandoned.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I, I took them in every time -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] went on a business trip and he came home and we had a new cat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that right?  [LAUGHING].  It's easy to do, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They, they walk, walk around, they're cute and look at you like please take me in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I know.  But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, don't be doing that, you've got enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, going on.  Your -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, no, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Puppy and everything else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it does sound that things have started to settle down a bit other, I mean, in regards to, your finances are improved from the situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we've got to figure out why you're not breathing so well, and then, are you smoking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I quit in '90.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I, I want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know I still want to, but every day of my life -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that is pretty bizarre, isn't it, uh, that many years later?  You hear that stuff, people, you know, they finish a project and they look for their cigarettes and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  You know what?  I still have the open pack -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From the day I quit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Geez.  That is impressive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I kept it, um, initially -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just to know that they were there if I ever wanted one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I just have never thrown it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because it, it's always been better to me to have them there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, yeah, you know, run out -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, buy a pack.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which, you know, which made the temptation to smoke if I wanted it, it was right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I never picked it up after I quit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, look, [PATIENT NAME], do you want to look into some changes with your medicine, or do you think, uh, maybe a visit first with [NAME OTHER], uh, would make, uh, more sense, uh, at this point before we start, uh, changing things around?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know.  A change of the medicine might help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been on the ones I'm on for so long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you're right.  I'm looking at that.  There is certainly, uh, a few, uh, medications that you haven't been on.  And -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's time for refills for all my medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  How is your, what insurance company are you using?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm on Medicaid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The only one I don't want to change is Topamax, and that is really important.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, um, why don't we see what happens switching your Effexor over to a new, uh, a medicine called Pristiq.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pristiq has been around since like, I don't know, last May, I don't know, for about a year.  It's made by Wyeth, which is the same company that makes Effexor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a more potent in a sense, uh, version of, of Effexor, so it's somewhere between 50 and 100 mg should do what, what 375 of this Effexor's doing for you.  It's kind of a cleaned up version with a smoother delivery system, so fewer side effects, better tolerability, less blood pressure risks.  So those are some advantages.  But there, there is no given, you know, 1 simple formula to do this, everybody is a little bit different.  Um, generally, you're kind of a cross taper works the best.  So I would suggest we lower the, uh, Effexor to 150 mg for 7 days and then we take it down to 75 mg for 7 days and then we'll stop it.  At the same time, let's add 50 mg Pristiq for, uh, 7 days and then just take you up to the 100 mg dose and we'll see.  I'm going to give you samples.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we'll go talk to the nurse about this and see what happens with it.  But I've had some good, good results with it.  And we'll add Pristiq.  Okay?  We'll see what happens with it.  We'll leave the VNS where it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, we'll, I'm, in the meantime -</p>

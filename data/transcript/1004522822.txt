<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is a problem. Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. So last time I was here on...when...almost two weeks ago?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was a Monday maybe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So did I tell you that - first of all, Franklin got a new job?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, terrific.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great, congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a really good - thanks, a really good one, too. He interviewed on Monday. They called him on Friday. He interviewed on Monday of this week. They called him back on Wednesday and said we want you to come back for a second interview. (inaudible at 00:45) for the second interview after work on Thursday, yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yesterday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he got in. They were like, "Oh, well, we said second interview, but we really just want to offer you the job."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's doing Customer Service Help Desk, but that he was thinking maybe that wasn't going to work out. But he applied for this (inaudible at 1:01) it's not through full benefits, 42 hours a week, two of which are automatic overtime, higher pay, half off the transit pass, but it's one stop away from our house in Framingham, so he can just bike there. Just awesome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great, that's fantastic. [01:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we're really happy about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's starting on April 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know if I had told you that I applied for a job, another job that I saw up on the University website?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, there was just the one that you mentioned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there was the one that I applied for that got us whole with the nine month plan. And even if we don't get with that one, we're looking and we're going to get...then - okay, that went offline.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was like, whatever, still they didn't hear from them, whatever. And we had decided...okay look we're going to stay here now. Then just because I had been checking every week or so just in case anything came up on from the University. And so I was just checking like keyword events, just to see, but maybe I shouldn't have been. Because then there was one for Director of Public Affairs for the same department that I had applied for PA Manager and that was the position above it. And I was like, "Well, oh, they must be doing some shifting in that department." It's through the advancement division. And the PA - no, PA Management - well, whatever, PA Management Office of the University Advancement and Development Office. So I'd be doing development. And so anyway, I ended up applying...oh, whatever maybe I'll apply, it doesn't hurt to get my name in the pool. Really not thinking that they'd call me at all. I'm coordinator...my - it's coordinator, why would they answer a director position? Well, low and behold, they've called me. And it's crazy. First of all, because it's like, "Wow."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations. [02:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's great. It's nerve-wracking on the other hand because - so here's the deal. So yesterday I get this mysterious number on my cell...on my phone. I'm on the phone at work, I see the number. I see my cell phone buzzing. I'm like, "Oh, shit. Oh my God, that's them." But I don't want to get too excited about it, I'm like, "Let me see if they leave a message."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I Googled the number to see if it will tell me where it is. Because it didn't match the number of the woman at the University, it's a cell phone. So I'm like, oh well, it just could be a corporate...it could be a something about a bill. I don't know what. I don't know, whatever. So let me see if they leave a message, if they don't leave a message I'll call back and say I got your number. So I call back and low and behold it's this woman's cell phone. The woman who would be if...who's the senior director PA management -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - or develop whatever, person who would be my boss if I got the job. So I'm like, "Shit, well, now I have to...I have to leave a message." So I was messaging, "Oh, this is Trina Goldbloom about this number, I have a missed call on my cell phone. I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [03:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: oh, I imagine" - oh, because literally maybe 20 minutes before she called, I had sent an e-mail, this was a week after I had originally applied yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow. I follow, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "What following up? Are you interviewing? I'd love to hear more about the position, da da da." So I leave this message saying I'm at work, so it's not the best time to speak via phone, but I'd love to exchange another phone call or e-mail to discuss a better time to hear more about whatever. Then I don't hear anything back and this is all day yesterday. This phone call happened at one. So I'm like, what the hell? Did she call? And then I called my mother. And my mother - first of all, my mother's reaction is - well, my mother and Franklin are both - I'm like, I'm shocked that they called me. I can't - and they're like, "Well, I'm not." My mom is like, "That's kind of why I was a little bit cautious when you applied for it because honestly I figured they would call you." But I really didn't think so. It says - it shows what we think about of ourselves as opposed to what other see, but anyway. [04:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I guess I present myself well in my cover letter or - I don't know what.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would seem so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm like, "I don't understand. Why does this woman call me to play with my emotions? I want her to call back." And so I come into work, I still haven't heard anything. I sit down with Betty, my office maid, who's...she's the only one knows at my job that I've been...this whole university thing. And that's because she's my office maid and also because she's from there and she wants to go back and so she kind of understands the whole thing. And so I'm literally...she sits down, we have our coffee, we're about to just start our gossip chatter whatever. I'm like, "Yeah." And she's like, "Oh, still nothing? And I was like, "Yeah, still nothing."</p>

<p>And I opened my phone, and there's an e-mail from the woman. And I'm like, "Oh shit, she just e-mailed me." And she said, "Thank you for your note. We are interviewing for the Director of PA position now in hopes to fill it quickly. Please, let us know when you will be here and available for an interview. Please, advise." I was like, "Well, shit." So this got me confused on a couple of levels. First of all, could I afford to possibly go to for an interview for a job that I might not even get? Is that worth the investment?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [05:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do we even have the money? Will it put us back in - because right now we're sitting very comfortably because of the tax refund and leaving it and having a little cushion. It's very nice. So that would be the cushion gone. If they're looking to fill it quickly, do I just go for the interview anyway just for the experience? Even though when they ask me when can I start, I - I'm not going to burn my bridges here. I just - I'm not going to do it. So to leave them hanging at mid semester...well, not mid semester, but it's potentially in April before Advisory Committee, the biggest event of the year, before this thing in Seattle. We've already bought my tickets. I mean, the trip is only $350 the trip I'm sure it would be a huge hit. But I just don't feel right about that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. [06:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: - on a personal level. And I read an article when I was going through this - this is why I e-mailed you, "Can we meet earlier?" because I was freaking out. Franklin wasn't awake, he's been home sleeping, sick, dead. This is an article on making tough career choices. And it outlined you have to weigh your options. If you don't feel right about something, then that probably means it isn't. You know what I mean? And I just don't feel right about leaving them in the lurch. It doesn't - I want to have a connection here when I...eventually if I need it. I don't want to burn bridges.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So what's the soonest you'd go? [07:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, so the soonest I could even get there for an interview - well, but then - oh, that I could go? End of May. I mean, after Advisory Committee so maybe mid May, but that would mean that this whole trip, they would expect the money on me for the ticket which potentially I could offer to reimburse because I kind of feel bad. We're still a nonprofit; we don't have that much money. And I...if possibly reimburse until they - or pay for the name change on the ticket and somebody else could go in my place. The hotel only needs 24 hours to cancel, so that I'm not too worried about so I prepaid (inaudible at 07:37). So potentially mid May after Advisory Committee. And the thing is even these people I feel like they might understand and see my...understand my level of commitment in terms of the job and understand that I wouldn't want to leave before this huge event that has to do with all of our donors and works with development when this job is - I mean, you never know. Maybe they'll make them say, "No, we don't want you." Which would suck because that would be the only reason they wouldn't want me. But I'm jumping ahead of myself. Because honestly, I don't even know. So then I - and this part - because then the other thing is Franklin now has got this really great job. I'm like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [08:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's - I don't want to be selfish. And the way that he framed it was, "If we could afford for you to go down for the interview, then go ahead and do it. And then we'll deal with what happens if you do get the job offer." He's like, "Honestly, yeah, we are in a really good position to stay here right now. But to the same extent if this has something to do with your career goals, and you getting ahead in your career, and a dream that you have had and that I more recently shared with you about moving there, then I support you and I'm behind you 100 percent no matter what." And then I told him I felt bad, and I was being selfish. And then he joked and he's like, "Well, you're always selfish, so it's no big deal." And I was - and this is g-chat. And I'm like, "What?" He's like, "I'm kidding, calm down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is - you can be selfish, Trina, if you want to. This is appropriate." I'm like, "Okay, fine." Anyway, so I then told him that honestly the only way that I could afford it is if my dad gives me the money which would then beg his input. Which I was a little bit nervous about because I thought it could go either way. Well, no, actually I thought it could only go one way. And I thought the only way it would go was, "No, don't spend money on an interview. You probably won't get it. Don't rush to move there. You have a good job here. Stay at MIT. MIT, MIT, MIT, extension school, blah, blah, blah." That's what I was really expecting. So at first, I talked to my mom. And she's like, "Well, I knew they'd want to interview - " she's like, "Well, now, Franklin's job - okay. Let's think about the interview thing. I think it would be...I think I agree. I do think it would be good experience anyway to interview for this position." So then I'm like, "All right, I have to call Daddy." So I call him and I guess my mom had already filled him in that I applied and that I had already gotten a call back. But no reply yet. And so he was like, "Okay, yeah, so they're very exciting." And I was like, "Wait, exciting? I've never even heard that from him." So he is gung-ho, go for it. "I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the rental car. I'll pay for the ticket." [09:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, how nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I wasn't even - and he said borrow the money. I was like, "I will need the - I don't have the money." Like aahhh (sp?) "No problem, no problem." Sometimes he just shocks me. I mean - but his reaction was exactly how an...how a parent to an adult woman should behave. And it's really very infrequent that he treats me like that. So I took it. So he said...so he basically said, "I think that, Trina, I think that even if it's just for the interview, even if they're turned off when they ask you when you can start and you say "X" date because I agree you don't...you shouldn't burn bridges. You shouldn't leave them in the lurch." Even though I'm sure that my job will understand, "Wow, that's a great opportunity for you." Especially my manager because she's the Director of Humanities Department.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [10:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think they would understand it's a great opportunity. But I don't think that they would be pleased if I really leave before...at least before Advisory Committee which is May 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>. But I don't know. We want to fill it quick...in hopes of filling it quickly, I don't know what that's relative...relative to this month because...or relative to the usual university hiring time which can be six months. So I don't know. You know what I mean? Because now we're already...it's April...we're almost in April.</p>

<p>So I started with an e-mail back. Well, at first I e-mailed back earlier in the day, an hour...an hour after or an hour and a half after they originally sent the e-mail saying that, "Thank you so much for your blah, blah, blah. I'd love to interview. I need to look at my schedule. Please, I'll get back to you." And I didn't get response. Replied after saying the soonest week day that I would be available to be there would be Friday, March 27<sup>th</sup>. Because quite frankly, we have events every day. There's just no way I can take another day off. March 27<sup>th</sup>, I conveniently already have off. So that would work. I said or...I said or if that's...if you like...the only soonest date that I could get there would be the 24<sup>th</sup> or 25<sup>th</sup> if we could do a weekend interview. Or if we need to do sooner than I don't know if you - I worded it obviously not the way that I'm wording it right now. I offered a scape (ph) interview. And I haven't heard back yet.</p>

<p>So either they're just scheduling a ton of interviews which I don't think they're scheduling a ton. I've been through this process. You don't want to interview a lot of people, you want to get a handful of the best picks of the bunch and interview them. So that's why I'm really in...happy that they're choosing to interview me. Because honestly, I'm sure a lot of people applied for this job. I just haven't heard back. So I'm hoping that they're not turned off by my not available. But in my whole cover letter, e-mail thing, I phrased it as relocating there, presently still working at this position here. So that they know that I'm still living here. They know that I haven't relocated yet. So they have to kind of understand that I need - I don't know. What? [12:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds exciting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's super exciting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it's fine. She's...you know how it is -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [13:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I'm sure from being on the other side of it. But it's sort of like different timelines.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For her, one minute passes where she's got 15 things she's supposed to be doing, and she just sort of hasn't gotten around yet to getting back to you. And for you, two weeks passes. Because, "Oh my God. You have (ph) her 10 minutes ago and haven't heard back from her."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. No, you're right. You're right. And I mean, think about it. She called me yesterday, probably got distracted with whatever else she's doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then didn't get a chance to e-mail me back until today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. I'm totally speculating here, but two months isn't a very long time. I mean, if they're really excited about you unless they have some really specific need, I can't imagine that the difference between somebody who could start in -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - two or three weeks versus somebody who was going to start in eight weeks -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. The right candidate is the right candidate. [14:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and make that much of a difference. Sure. And obviously they'd be hoping you'd work there for a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the University offers employees 100 percent tuition remission.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they have a graduate program in Communications of (inaudible at 14:21) Public Relations. Hello, I can still complete my -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - goals of getting a masters. And I need something more applicable. And so it's very exciting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds very exciting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just going to try not to jump ahead of myself in terms of, well, what if I get the job offer because we're not at that point yet. And if my dad is willing to invest in this as a possible just opportunity...I mean, he's also looking at it like, "I think this is great for you, Trina, also on a networking level in terms of events -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - people in the higher ed field. And getting contacts for when you may be more ready to move there because you want to, not just because the job presents itself."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he also like (inaudible at 15:09) tonight kind of way of looking at it. And he's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interview practice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And its interview practice for a high-level position.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So all really good things. So we'll see about it. We'll let you know. Yeah. And I mean, I know that Franklin is feeling torn about it because on one hand, yes, he wants the best for me. Yes, he does also want (inaudible at 15:36) on the other hand, he just got this great job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm wondering if you're a little nervous about being as excited as you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Partly for this in particular, but partly in a way that maybe you can be at other times too that if you get too excited it could either lead you to make a decision you regretted later or to being disappointed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'm kind of wondering if it's hard to be excited and enthusiastic without being a bit nervous?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And I think also this might sound silly, but I almost feel guilty for being excited about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds that way a little bit. How do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I feel a little silly because I don't have a job...I don't have a job offer. So it's like, well, there's nothing really to be excited about. But I think that there really is. It's just an honor to just be called for it -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - on a coordinator level. Yeah, I manage somebody, but I'm not a manager. I mean, I am, but in title and (inaudible at 16:47).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It feels like coordinator, manager, director, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so Suzanna is my manager, but I'm Mindy's manager because she's an assistant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But still in terms of resume -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 17:00) as a director?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Suzanna is...her title is something like Associate Director of Development and Public Relations or something along those lines. But, yeah. But then our executive director and director are her -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Straight bosses?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if we're just straight talking resume, how it reads -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - going from a coordinator position, skipping right over a manager position, even though I had been Carrying Manager previously. Anyway, whatever, it's all good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's a big step up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a lot. Anyway - but I think the guilty part comes in because I do feel selfish. This would just be for me. This would be taking Franklin away from a job that potentially could be really good for him career wise. Could potentially he would really love. I'm throwing him back in the situation where he may have to be a barista or something if we move immediately. And give up a job where they are...they did tell him, "This is great because we really want to get somebody here, that'll be here for a few years." Which - yeah. I want the plan.</p>

<p>So that's why I feel guilty. That's why I feel guilty. Because I just feel guilty if we go, I guess. I feel - and he did not by any means say anything that should make me feel guilty. He was - it was hard because we were G-chatting, so it's hard to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it doesn't sound like this comes from him. [18:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's not though. He's very...like I said, he was literally, "Yeah, I found a great job. Yeah, we're in a good position to stay, but if you get an even better job, then I'm behind you. If this is what you want, then I'm with you." Which is great and I love him for it, but I still feel guilty. And I'm - I don't...I don't think I really should, I just do. And I don't really know why I guess. Maybe it's in my nature, it's part of my personality. But I don't know. I guess I just need to drop it, like drop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you also...because in the way that you get excited about it kind of in your mind get a few steps ahead of yourself? In other words, there's some part of you that feels like you've kind of already made the decision?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That this is going to happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you know logically, of course, that that's not the case?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [19:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But in a way you kind of already feel like you've done this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so I mean, you can kind of feel guilty because it has already happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles) yeah, yeah. It's like the possibility is enough to make me feel like the effects of having making the decision already. Which I think is echoed in lots of other facets of my life. It's kind of - similar to what we were talking about last week about getting irritated at Franklin. And it's in my head, we've already not been able to work it out through talking about it and the only option is breaking up. That's...it's kind of...it feels like a little bit of similar reaction in that way.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, there's a few things that happened this week that irritated me and got me really annoyed at Franklin. And now I'm having trouble remembering what they are. So maybe they weren't that important. But like - [20:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or maybe you're forgetting because you feel even worse than angry after you're already feeling guilty or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe it just pushed out of my consciousness, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or maybe you're just excited about other things (inaudible at 20:50) (Laughter)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think it was like little stuff though. And I kind of just - oh, one of them was just I got annoyed cause he wouldn't stop talking the other night. And I was tired, I was falling asleep. And I really thought - we were watching TV. And I was laying...we were laying in bed I was...I had my head on his shoulder. And I really feel like I had fallen asleep and he was still talking. And I hadn't...I clearly hadn't been responding. And I'm just thinking, "God I don't even know what this guy is even talking about right now. Shut up." And that's how I felt. And then I felt bad because I didn't want to say that. So I don't even remember what he was talking about. But I just didn't care. It was something about...I don't know, like a Doomsday Shelter or you could see where I fell asleep.</p>

<p>And I just remember feeling so irritated that sometimes he just doesn't stop freaking talking, and I don't want to hear it. I mean, I guess that I do that to him sometimes too, I'm sure. But I felt really...I do remember just feeling really...I woke up and was like, "Oh my God, I'm really annoyed right now. Can you just shut up?" And I didn't say that, but that's how I felt. "Stop freaking talking. God."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what was bothering about his talking? [22:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I did not care about whatever he was talking about and really didn't want to listen to it. I just wanted to watch TV or go to sleep or something. I think that's purely...I don't think it was anything that was upsetting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was just...I just didn't have any interest in it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it annoyed me that he was talking for so long.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was something else that I don't remember what it is that I literally was upset...felt really upset about that I can't remember what it was. But I do remember being really annoyed at him at his talking. Yeah, I remember talking. It was just so freaking annoying, but maybe that happens sometimes. And I (inaudible at 23:23) on my way over here. I was, like, oh, I really want to talk about this job situation, and how I'm feeling about it. And oh, there's the other stuff about Franklin that I wanted to mention that I...and then I couldn't even remember on the way over. (inaudible at 23:36) you remember it, but then also what popped in my head was like, maybe I can't remember because sometimes you just have to...not about little stuff sometimes, maybe I just have to let it go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I love the guy. And usually I'm not annoyed with him. It's not like 75/25 of being annoyed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [23:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's maybe the opposite which I think is okay. I'm sure that he's annoyed with me. I mean, it - the other thing was, I do remember that whatever these issues were that I dealing with this week when I had a problem with him, I did do a much better job...I don't remember what they were, so it would be better if I remembered. But I did...I do remember being much better with my reactions and not having a frustrated reaction or an upset reaction or a jerk...knee-jerk reaction.</p>

<p>There were a couple - the other thing is he gets very - so anyways, I feel like I didn't have a...I feel I was able...I was in control of my reactions a little bit more which felt great. And I don't really know what prompted it. But maybe it was just purely the fact that I did not want to have an argument and don't want to argue like that as much. And so was able to then kind of maybe subconsciously or unconsciously control my reactions a little bit more.</p>

<p>There were a couple times when he just gets very excitable when he's talking. And if it's...if there's anything that is going to be maybe a difference of opinion which happens a lot we have a lot of different opinions on things. He can get very...he's a very debative (sp?) argumentative person. It's his family trait. I mean, they all, I think I told you, they're all just very...they're all just know-it-alls. And kind of - he has some of that too. And so he tends to then get very animated. And his voice goes...gets loud. And so there were a few times when we were having conversations this week about things that we were differentiating an opinion about. Or I said that was annoying or he said that was annoying or whatever, where I would keep having to say, "Franklin, please, can you lower your voice and try to speak to me like we're having a conversation, not a debate?" And a couple times it was like, "Well, I'm annoyed now. So, yes, I'm going to yell." And then...and then there were a couple times where I did literally have to get to the point of kind of raising my voice to tell him, "Franklin, please, stop talking to me like that. Please, talk to me like a normal person, so we could actually have a conversation and not an argument."</p>

<p>And so I think that was maybe what some of the frustrations were. I don't...I don't remember the context. But it was frustrating to realize that while I'm trying to control my emotions and my reactions to things, so that I don't have these knee-jerk reactions that I do and tend to get me in trouble, he's not able to control his volume and attitude and the way that he's talking about it. And I know he's trying to work on that and he was started to quite down at some certain points. But it was definitely irritating to have to say it more than once in a couple of conversations, "Franklin, please, lower your voice. There's no need for you to yell. We can just have a conversation about this." So that was...that was definitely frustrating, but definitely a step in the right direction. And my - and this is just how I was handling it. So I feel good about that, but I just...I want to try to minimize conflict, but - I just said that and it seems like a little bit that's kind of a loaded statement. There's always going to be conflict. [27:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It (Pause) it seems to me that...because the things that you're getting upset about on both sides, your feeling of guilt about thinking about getting this job. As well as of annoyance with him (Chuckles) relate to way you just kind of be like failing to pay attention to each other?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like with this job, it seems to me that maybe part of why you feel guilty is because you feel like you're not taking him into account enough? [28:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying that you'd actually do that if it came to making a decision about whether you wanted to go. But it seems in this way where you just kind of jump ahead to already having gotten it, already having decided to go, and pushing other things aside. And it's - there's a way you can think about that with not really feeling like you're thinking of him and you're feeling guilty about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like I said, I'm wondering if it's that way with his yelling at you too. Whether it starts to feel as though...not just that he's not being considerate, but something kind of more basic than that. Just kind of off on his own yelling about something as opposed to actually really still having this discussion with you personally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like when you were asleep. It's sort of like...notice that he's not stopping to consider that you might not be so interested because you're asleep? [29:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter) And bothering to stop the conversation when you're obviously not a party in any way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like a sort of basic - ignoring isn't even quite what I want, but sort of like the other person isn't there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. It's like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like that's what really bugs you on both sides?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [29:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, in terms of, "The me," yeah, yeah. I do feel like thinking ahead of all this stuff. It's like, "H'm, am I not taking into consideration Franklin and having blah, blah, blah." But then, yeah, I think that in terms of him going on his stupid rants or getting all animated when we're talking about something that I don't really give a shit about, I just made a statement about. Please, let's not get emotional here. But, yeah, he's just really being...and he's being selfish in that sense - well, yeah, a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe subconsciously...maybe unconsciously rather, but that it's just he wants to talk about it and gets his whatever opinion, and he wants to make sure his opinion is heard. Even if I don't really give a shit that much about my opinion to let...for him to get so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - preachy about his or whatever. But, yeah, exactly. That why are you even talking about for so long that wouldn't leave a break for the other person to respond? That are able to fall asleep and then also wake up and you're still talking?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (Laughter) [30:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And literally, I looked up and I said, "What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's like, "Oh, you're asleep." And I was like, "Yeah, I am."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's like, "I'm sorry. I'll stop talking, I'm boring you." And I'm like, "No, it's okay. It's not that, I'm just tired. And I lost track of what you were talking about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because what are you talking about?" And then he got irritated at me because he was like, "You're not interested in watching all the same documentaries and stuff as me. And in the whole two years that you've never watched a documentary with me that I'm interested in." And I'm like, "Well, you never watched a documentary with me that I'm interested in." I watch documentaries. I just don't really...I'm not - we got in an...and it's about - oh, I know why the thing started last night -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [31:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: - or whatever the hell he was talking about. Because somebody put something on Facebook where some person had recorded 20 things all Americans should know. And it's one of these kind of people...it's all this about the government and all this stuff and about Americans about what do, and what you don't know. And Franklin was like, "You want to watch it?" And I was like, "Not really." He was like, "Wow, you're just content, huh?" And I was like, "Kind of." I watched the...it was...yeah, it depends. I know that there's stuff I should probably know, but I'm not really going to do anything about it. I'm not going to move to Canada so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's not...he's very much about, "You should know. You should know. You should know." So then I put it on. Mistake. It's this woman talking so close to this whatever recording device she had. I hear her every lip smack. And you can hear her talking. Anyway, and it was - and I was...yes, I'm already - I can't pay attention to this woman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [32:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he got really annoyed and said I should listen to this stuff and why am I so impatient. And then there's this whole thing. And then that's when I fell asleep, and he was talking about I don't know what.</p>

<p>But he was not happy that I was not interested to - but he likes to watch all these stupid documentaries that are about pure aliens that built the pyramids and all this stuff that may or may not be true. And then...sometimes cool to watch and hear about. But that I just...I'm not going to take to heart and start...I don't know building...going to a mountain on December 21, 2012. The world ends, the world ends and that's it, whatever. It's just not -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not putting on your tin foil hat yet kind of stuff? [33:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I'm not collecting cans, come on. So anywho (sp?) that's what that was about. And after I...after he realized I was falling asleep because he was talking too long. He was like, "Okay, fine." And he backed off and he was fine. We woke up and it was fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was fine. So it was really annoying. And then - but now I...again like you said, I think I may be kind of pushing at all that stuff that I was so annoyed at this week to the side.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I feel guilty about this whole possibility of taking him out of a job he just got da, da, da, da, da.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But to the same extent really also very excited to see what's going to happen -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. [34:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and possibly go for an interview or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You should be excited, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, that's - there's always something that just right when I'm settling back down, it seems like these past few months or like...for a while this summer -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's always something else that shows up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 34:26)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The dust is settling. And then something else comes up and dust settles. And then - which I think is not a bad thing to happen for us. Change is constant and that's okay sometimes. It's just I'm obviously on edge because I worry about everything and start thinking about every little last detail. The whole dad thing, the whole pay for the ticket thing, really it's great. I really am very grateful because if that happens and he's able to pay for it for me and I don't have to worry about it, then, yeah, of course, I'm going to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's a no-brainer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a no-brainer. It's not...there's no question. If I had to pay for it, yeah, there'd be a question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we'll see what's... it's Friday now. So maybe they'll respond this weekend, maybe I won't hear until Monday, maybe I won't hear until Thursday. I mean, whatever. I'm going to try to just enjoy the weekend anyway and not dwell on it too much. Because I have a tendency to kind of create scenarios, and I don't know, just kind of fantasize things that make me stressed out more. [35:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of what scenarios?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What if they want a second interview? How will I get there for a second interview? When will they want...what if they don't...what if they're not going to e-mail me because I said (inaudible at 35:53) I was so stupid. I should have just said I can come whenever and get sick...and go take a sick day. These are the kind of things. What if I should have told him I can come this weekend if they wanted to interview me this weekend? But I think that that's stupid. I told them...what I told them it was appropriate. I mean, I don't think they would expect me to be like, "I'll be there tomorrow." They obviously know I'm working. They obviously know it's the semester, if they wanted to go to my website they could see how many events we have. (Chuckles) But I think the other thing is, I don't want to get too excited by thinking of scenarios like, what if I got it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd be Director of PA. Within 90 days I'd be - and hopefully, I could get my GRE and enter into their program. But I mean, the prospect is very exciting. And the pay grade is $48 minimum...the pay...$48 minimum, $99 max. And I don't even $51,600. They'd have to at least match. And I think that they would...I would probably get like $55 offer from them. I'm sure they'd offer me more. I mean, they could it would be weird kind of if they didn't. [36:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would have to be more than that, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that would be easy living down there, I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We would live very nicely. And I mean, we would be able to afford Franklin needing to find work for a little while. I mean, really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [37:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And especially if we found an apartment kind of close to the university. I mean, I don't know. But I don't want to think about too much of this because then it's like I don't want to get too excited for something that may or may not ever happen. But on the other hand, it's kind of fun to imagine.</p>

<p>It was like really, really exciting opportunity for me. Not only would it be a boost in my career, still be doing events, it would be in development which is something that I've been growing more interest in. It would give me a chance to be there. I mean, it would just really be good on all fronts. It would give me a chance to get a masters that's more closely...more closely matched to what I want to do that I can pick from everything as opposed to what's limited in this one section of the extension school. And then for free, not even for $500. So part of me is like, yeah, too bad to think of stuff like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: True. [38:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it'd be really, really a good opportunity. I think that - but again I just...I just have no idea. I just have no idea what this is all about. I just...I think I'm still not really understanding what I've been called even. The thing is the job description, everything it says up to a certain point I would check, check, check, check, check. It was bachelor's degree, four years of experience in this field.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Obviously, I have way more than that. And then it said must have experience...what was it, working with development databases or whatever. They named some system whatever, Domer (sp?) Track, I don't know...or whatever. And registration for large events including online registration tracking. So those things I haven't done, but I've tracked...I mean, it's nothing that I couldn't learn really quickly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that...maybe that's why they kind of looked - but again, I don't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 39:29) all of a sudden pretty specific skills, not -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - had you worked in this field a bunch of years or not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I think that probably - but partly the reason is because all the items that I listed under my...under my job duty now are essentially what they've been looking for. Even if it's not specifically working in this program or with online registration where that would be, clearly from my resume, very easy for someone like me to learn. And - yeah. I guess - but honestly, out of all the applications, which I'm sure there are plenty - this has been up since last Wednesday, so now a little over a week. And there're picking me. I mean, I know how many people apply to these jobs. I mean, hundreds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not even talking about the...not even including the internal people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which usually we look at first. You always look at internal first. So I mean, yeah. I just feel super proud of myself and just want to see where it goes. I'd be a fool to not try to grab up this opportunity I think. If I can. I do want to be honest with them again about the possible start date and whatever. But if they have...I have to be...they have to understand something about relocating especially if they're not going to offer to pay my relocation cost.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If they offer to pay my relocation cost so maybe I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - have to rethink it, but...yeah. So that's what's going on. So maybe by next week we'll - oh, wait. And then I also - we have to reschedule. [40:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My appointment for next week, possibly the week after.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know yet so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But next week we...I have an event this week where it works so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next week is...it's hell week. [41:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All righty. Okay. So next week this time is not so good. So let me see what also I've got. I could do Thursday at 12:45?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Un-Uh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could do -</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would have to be early.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - Friday morning at 7:45?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And —wait, wait, wait. What time would we be done then, 8:30?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 830, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I can't do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to be at work by then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe - yeah, this is (inaudible at 42:26).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. I've got...that's all I've got. I mean, I could do a little later that morning, but I imagine that's worse for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Yeah. We may have to actually - I just have such a crazy week of events.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I could...I could do 2:15 on Thursday if that's better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Un-Uh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just we have too many events next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Multiple events every day. So it's just - and I have to be there. So if something else comes up in an early morning other than Friday, will you let me know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will let you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, otherwise, we'll say regular time on the 30<sup>th</sup>, but I may e-mail you because if I'm going then -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - obviously I'm not going to (inaudible at 43:21) (Laughter) okay, good. So yeah, if anything comes up in the morning next week just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will let you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - give me an e-mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Congratulations again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. And I'll keep you posted on the week after that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, thank you. Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Take care. Thanks, you too.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, the clock. Oh I think I put it over here. I need to put it here because then I'll run out of batteries if you don't mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. I have an interview this afternoon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks to the career fair last week I'm cranking up. And now I'm kind of thinking of the interview. I'm behind on school work, behind on research. And over the weekend I had a date with the couple I'm dating (ph) and dropped the L word because I mean we've been seeing each other since May and it's true and I've been wanting to tell them I love them for a couple of months now. And they didn't reciprocate so I'm kind of in an emotional tizzy over that, which just seems completely shallow and frivolous compared to oh my gosh I've made no progress on my Masters thesis for the last week and my advisor's going to kill me, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. I hear a lot of time they're kind of important to people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it does say something about my priorities and I can spare that to be frivolous compared to what's going on in my professional life. But yes, I keep getting distracted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well in your [inaudible at 00:01:48] your tendency to be quick to dismiss things that you feel and what emotionally matters to you and view in sort of a critical way. [00:02:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay don't frighten me. But yes, yesterday was a really terrifically bad day. I failed to get out of bed until about 10; my class was in 30. Didn't go to class. Instead, bought an iPad off of Amazon. Read this hardly cheesy mystery novel until one and then I went to an information session for the company I'm interviewing with today - they were having an on-campus info session where all applicants were expected to attend at 5:30 and I still hadn't done any work. So I spent another two hours very, very, very slowly getting dressed and getting ready to leave the house and I needed to go out to Manchester to pick up my interview suit because I just bought. I had no interview clothes since I've been out of commission last week so I went out on Saturday and bought a bunch of clothes and of course since I'm short, always in need of tailoring. So I was supposed to go pick them up because they'd been hemmed yesterday and I didn't make it because I didn't leave the house early enough.</p>

<p>But I at least got progress done on the homework assignment that was due yesterday. It's still on time. I'm going to slide it under the professor's door tonight with a note apologizing both for missing class and for the late problem set. I think that would be okay as long as I get it in before he publishes the solutions. He's kind of like that. I took a class last spring with him. And anyway it turns out it doesn't matter because I didn't go pick up my suit because at the information session the two critters (ph) were wearing jeans and sweats and all of the candidates were wearing khakis. So I figure dress pants, dress shirt should be fine for the interview. I hope. Whatever. It's something with labs; they're full of researchers. Most of them are researchers and wouldn't wear a full suit. Maybe if I was interviewing with the wives in the harbor I'd need to wear a suit. [00:04:45]</p>

<p>So yes, there's that and I'm giving myself up for not getting more work done yesterday, not getting out the door earlier, not making it to class, not doing my problem set over the weekend instead of waiting until the day it was due. I tried to get work done Monday. My husband had the day off and suggested we go to his office because he had some stuff to catch up on, some personal projects of his and his office has an espresso machine, what a mind of him. So we went to his office and instead of doing research or homework I spent the whole day working on cover letters and applying to jobs which needed to get done but perhaps not urgently. The thing that was due on Tuesday maybe should have taken priority. But anyway at least I'm putting off doing the things I don't want to do already and things that need to get done instead of playing games, which is still avoidance but perhaps...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well and you're saying getting the homework in late probably won't matter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It's a tough assignment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I've done maybe about 60 percent of it got done yesterday. And I've read through the problems when they were assigned and they've been rattling around the back of my head. But I didn't actually sit down and push this thing that hard working through them. I'd sit down for maybe 15, 20 minutes at a time and jot down thoughts and scribble things on backs on envelopes and stuff, but actually writing things out and connecting all the dots and making sure I didn't leave any steps out. So yes I was in the library by 9:30 this morning struggling with that assignment before I came here. There was this one problem that just stymied me and I ended up just writing what I have and saying here's where I got stopped and submitting that. [00:06:48]</p>

<p>But yes, there's - and I even caught myself this morning changing my targets for awards since I was walking to the library from where I parked my car down in Permit Parking right on the street, I passed by the coffee shop and was like I would love a hot chocolate but I don't deserve a treat because I haven't gotten anything done, even though I did actually spend six hours working on these problems yesterday and made a good effort on them. I decided that that wasn't enough just getting some work done. I needed to be perfect and do work every day for a week before I could get hot chocolate I don't know.</p>

<p>I realize that this is completely crazy and that promising myself rewards and then taking them away is probably not helping me but I still I couldn't bring myself to just go in and order the goddammed hot chocolate. Instead I went downstairs and [inaudible at 00:08:02] with quarters. [00:08:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened when you couldn't get out of bed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean? What was going through my head or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, what did you feel like, what was going through your head? This was Sunday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Monday, sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yesterday. That happens a lot I'm sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was on Sunday? Oh, I'm sorry, Monday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well Monday he had some time off work so he was at home and he kept trying to drag me out of bed and I kept resisting him saying I'm enjoying the blankets and the pillows and you can't make me and I don't want to, et cetera, et cetera. Yesterday, he had an early meeting so he was up before I needed to be up so I was on my own. It was more of a - the alarm went off and I was like I should get out of bed, the alarm just went off. I don't want to; five more minutes. I'm so sleepy; I'm too sleepy to get up. And I think I knew I was just rationalizing away, not facing the day on some level but it was very much of a oh another 20 minutes won't matter; what's 20 minutes in the grand scheme of things. I'm really tired. [00:10:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get - here's what I'm wondering about. I wonder if you kind of feel like a mess. And a lot of the sub criticism and these sort of systems or schemes is punishments and rewards and expectations that you kind of seem to repeat a fair amount to yourself even though you know it's not the best way to get motivated and usually just sucks. I wonder if that stuff is all kind of part of how you hold yourself together or try to hold yourself together and put some kind of structure on what you need to do and where you're at and what your goals are going to be and what you're going to try to be focused on because without it you just feel more like a mess and really upset and at loose ends. [00:12:23]</p>

<p>I mean clearly there's a way in which you kind of just want to be comforted, like you want to stay in bed, you want to stay under the covers, the day is overwhelming, you want the hot chocolate, it would feel a lot better than facing the problems then, it would sort of be reassuring, soothing. And I think - I know you really come undone if you give into that stuff too much, like you'll be in bed all day or you'd never get to work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very true, I wouldn't. As evidence by yesterday, I didn't get out of the house until 2:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and, so just sort of self-disciplinary side though ineffective in a way, is an effort to pull yourself together or a struggle against something that feels really overwhelming, which is how much more care, comfort and reassurance you need than you have. [00:14:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I think - I don't know. My reaction to that is I don't think there's any amount of care, comfort, reassurance that would be enough. It's kind of like a bottomless well of needing to be held and told that everything is going to be okay. And it's not - I don't know. Given that I kind of feel like there will never be a point where I'd feel like I've had enough comfort and reassurance, there's no point in - I should just keep going because I'm not going to get what I want. It's impossible; there's this infinite need and finite supply in the world and so I might as well push it aside and keep going, which is what I try to do unsuccessfully most of the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it like to have that kind of need? I mean, how do you feel it? What does it make you think of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me disgusted with myself to be honest. People are all fundamentally the same. We all have just the same emotional needs by and large. And other people manage to get by without being completely crushed by the fact that they're not being coddled 24-7 and told that everything is okay, so why can't I? Why... [00:16:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People, especially adults, actually have very different needs in terms of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean we're all human, right? We share...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I agree with that, yes. Most grown-ups aren't walking around feeling the same degree of sort of intensity and need and seem to be overwhelmed about that as you, I'm pretty sure. I'd say nobody else is by a long shot. And there are also reasons for that, some of which I kind of know about, other's which I don't. It's not just that everybody else is stronger and can manage it better. [00:18:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I didn't mean to imply I thought that. It's more what's wrong with me that I have this seemingly boundless well of need that other people don't have?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I see. Where do you feel it? Do you feel it physically?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there other things you can say about what it's like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly just this - I'll find myself thinking we're [here in the cars] (ph) and I just want to be helped, as ridiculous as that sounds. I don't know, I feel stupid saying this out loud. But really I just want to be held and told that I'm worthwhile. [00:20:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there things that happen that make you feel like you are either sort of being held in that way or made to feel that you're worthwhile?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think maybe praise especially from professors or mentors. Dave tries, he'll hold me and tell me that he thinks I'm a good person and, I don't know, it's just I have a hard time believing him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably, I imagine, you wish you could. [00:22:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think this notion of being good is very vague. In my head it's tied up with being smart and getting work done and meeting your obligations. And I feel like that's completely responsible to loving someone. So there's part of me that when Dave tells me I'm a good person, my reaction is you're [inaudible at 00:23:19] because you love me. You're overlooking my flaws; I'm not actually that good while he's going on. Of course when I actually say that to him, makes me ungrateful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you mean about, are you talking about being, personally being orthogonal? What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry, I have all this slang that carries from my technical world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I know what orthogonal is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Completely unrelated to each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess what I'm confused with is because it sounds like you're saying that you see them overlapping with Dave and that is because he loves you that his opinion of you is biased. But you're saying that your being lovable and a good person are in fact orthogonal and in practice in him that you feel like that gets mixed up? [00:24:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but it seems perfectly reasonably...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean people fall in love with terrible human beings all the time, right? And certainly people fall in love with people who are not competent at their jobs, not - don't manage to get places on time, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I see what you mean, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know being in love with someone has nothing to do with the particular set of virtues that I consider to be the definition of being a good person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get it. And which have much more to do with functioning sort of thing, with morality?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some things look like competence, ability and productivity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I grew up with a very puritan view of work ethic. If you're not working to your maximum capability and doing good for the world in some way, contributing to society, accepted member of society then you're not actually behaving in a moral manner because it's saying you waste the thing that God's given you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't have much religious education as a child because my parents have my own issues going on. We never actually meant to stay at any kind of Mosque or [inaudible]. But one of the few lessons I've heard emphasized repeatedly was waste of talent, waste of resources, waste of food, waste of anything was the worst thing you could commend. I've definitely internalized that. And even when I do manage to carve time out for self-care and leisure it's not because I think I deserve but because I feel like it would make me able to work more effectively. Now it's an investment in being able to contribute to [inaudible at 00:27:13] designed approach.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have imagined that this singular, pretty singular focus productivity has something to do with maintaining this bottomless kind of sense of need.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can you connect the dots a little more for me? [00:28:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. If you're never focused on doing things because they feel good or you're taking care of yourself except to the extent that that can make you more productive, and you judge yourself entirely by what your output is, how good it is, no wonder you feel like you need to be comforted and held and in some sense really pay attention to all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How come? I'm sorry I'm just not following.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's probably important [inaudible at 00:29:03], I'm just not being clear. Let me resort to a metaphor. So I think this is probably externally true when you were a kid and probably internally true this way now. But if you think of one of those kids whose parents decide when their kid is two that they're going to be an Olympic skater or an Olympic mathematician or musician and his entire life is organized around that, that kid doesn't have any time to sort of be a kid in the conventional way of understanding that. You might think the kid would feel like they're missing out and would feel like, you know I could just, I don't feel like I could ever have enough recess or I don't feel like I could ever spend enough time on the playground or I don't feel like I could ever have enough Christmases or whatever because the part of the kid that needs those things is totally ignored - or I don't feel like I could ever have enough hugs or something like that because that's not what anybody cares about. All they care about is the performance on the ice or the violin or math or whatever. [00:30:47]</p>

<p>That's kind of what I mean. Am I - is that clarifying? Maybe I'm wrong but I'm trying to make sense. And as I say, I don't think that's the way your life is externally now. I mean I probably should have said it might look quite like that now, but it probably did look like that sometime as a kid. But internally, I think you kind of still run things that way. So I guess that's sort of what I had in mind. I don't think that kind of running things that way in the present is the entire story about your feelings or your need for being kind of held and reassured, but I think it's part of it. What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds reasonable. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes to mind? [00:32:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think mostly I feel like I've got character flaws and I can't stay focused and stay productive. Well it's not even matter of staying focused, it's a matter of getting into that manta in the first place because once I get started on a project, it's very easy to stay with it until the timer beeps or until I finish the assignment or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really getting on the horse?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, even to the point where when I'm deep in a project I will forget to eat, forget to check the clock. A couple of weeks ago I was working on a really interesting project and just got so absorbed into it that I didn't notice time passing until my bladder was about to burst. And I looked up and I was like wow I've been hyper-focused on this for 6-1/2 hours. Maybe I should take a break, use the restroom, get some food. And it's almost like a high, like almost a chemical high, that feeling of being in the groove. I'd like to be able to access that at will instead of just hoping for inspiration to hit. [00:34:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can sort of turn it on at eight or nine in the morning, run with it all day and then turn it off and go home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be ideal, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there more you can say about this state when you're in it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's almost like a fugue state. When I come out of it I can't really remember what I was doing or... [00:36:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My hunch, personally no more than that, would be that on one hand you say you're really hyper-focused and sounds like sometimes really productive, and can really bring your mind to bear on what you're working on often pretty [inaudible], but that you also kind of forget yourself and almost in a sense of denying yourself somewhat, which I imagine has something to do with why it's hard to get into that state. [00:38:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not if I'm deliberately suppressing my ego.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's your thought?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I suppose that I don't do it deliberately this denying myself in reference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't sound to me like it's sort of deliberately conscious. I guess it does sound to me like it does have an amount of self-sacrifice on it, or self-abdication.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe unconsciously?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I mean almost in a way that if you knew you were going to run a marathon. That's a little different but you knew you were getting ready to do something arduous and was going to be painful at times and you got to perseverance and you have to ignore the pain in your ankle and desire to stop at some point more than once or the thirst or whatever else, the hill and just do it. So I can understand in that case why it might be hard to get out of the door to go do it. And I'm not saying it's exactly painful in the same way to be working but I think this kind of singular focus thing probably involves shunting to the side some important stuff in a way that one hand's very directive but in another hand may be complicating this way or painful even. It doesn't sound like you're aware of being in pain when you're in that mode but I guess it seems to me part of the issue. [00:40:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually did use to run, not marathons; I think the longest race I ran was six miles but yes I understand the metaphor. Putting self aside. Certainly when I was running, it had to be a very deliberate I'm going to box these gloves off because I have to focus on tempo and cadence and breathing and all of that. I feel like when I get into one of these hyper-focused states - I don't start out intending to get into that state it's just I start working on something and sometimes I have to force myself to start working on it, but then the work becomes so interesting that it absorbs all of my attention. Certainly in a way that never happens when I'm working out or running.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Is it a kind of high? Like the runner's high but not with running? [00:42:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, yes, it is. Yes, I never experienced a runner's high, which is why I stopped. I do get into the whole endorphin rush after I lift weights. I really hated running and only did it because I felt like I ought to for health and well-being or something like that. Yes, running is boring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes I'm not aware of picking it because I think it's the best thing ever, it was kind of close at hand, just kind of the image of it. Well we'll stop for now, but hopefully your interview goes well. Good luck and we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:43:27]</p>

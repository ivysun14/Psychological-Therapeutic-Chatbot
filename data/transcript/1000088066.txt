<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Client 0426-002; reel number 111. Seventeenth interview client 0426-002; reel number 111. Seventeenth interview.

</p><p>PATIENT: There's so much (inaudible at 0:27). (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Something that kind of snuck up on me and I wasn't aware of it and I wanted - I wondered if you were in the same place and if you were, I wanted to tell you; which is that we have a maximum of four more times.

</p><p>PATIENT: When do I - do I take a test? I thought - I thought that (inaudible at 1:06) said you would take one now and later.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. I don't know. I guess. Whenever you - when you ...

</p><p>PATIENT: At the end.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: OK. That's how I (inaudible at 1:17) (chuckling).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Pardon me?

</p><p>PATIENT: I said that how I was going to tell when I was through; was to (inaudible at 1:22). Well, I'm not getting very far under this part.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I don't - I really - you know, I think I really don't have anything bothering me. (inaudible at 1:55) could mean that what I'm here for; to talk about things that bother me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: I talked - this girl asked me over for coffee today to discuss her child. You know. And I - you know, I kept - I kept thinking about it all the way back. And what - you know, what the problem was - you know, like she's got a really bad kid. And my (inaudible at 2:28) you know, I just feel real badly about not being able to spit out an answer and say, "Look, if you do this and this I think it [will all] (ph) shape up."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Your problem is you can't give her some easy answer.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I can't even - you know, like there's not even - there is no answer. And you're not even sure if she wants to hear. You know, like maybe she called me over there for me to say, "I have not noticed anything. (inaudible at 3:09) is just a little dear."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know and it's all in your head. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: But you know like I couldn't do that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. But it sounds like you had some - you couldn't do that but you sure (inaudible at 3:20) some sense that it was something - maybe something like that that she wanted. Maybe not. (inaudible at 3:27) not to listen but ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not - I'm not really sure, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd heard by the grapevine that she is really worried about her child and she should be. And she said to me, you know, like (audio gap at 3:45).

</p><p>[3:58] child is. I'm not trained.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And like you know, I could - if it was a simple thing like biting, I could - I could say what we had tried in the past. But when you know this child is, you know, a real misfit and she's just going to be going through hell as she gets older, it's - you know, that's kind of hard to say.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: If it's - then I don't even know. Maybe she'll straighten out by - what? - good fortune, I don't know. You know. So you can't - I can't really say, you know, "take my word for it," because (inaudible at 4:50).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I have a sense for you're not - on the one hand, feeling that it's totally beyond your knowledge to provide any help because the child is really badly off in a certain global way; not some simple thing that you can help with. But, on the other hand, feeling that you don't know enough to say that with any authority.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I could - and yet I feel like a hypocrite going over and, you know, patting her on the backside and saying, "It'll all be alright" when I - you know, I'm very, very sure that it's not ever going to be alright if she doesn't take some sort of action with this child (ph). 

</p><p>Why is it me? You know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Why not - why not ask somebody else? And this - yes. I get my life a little straightened out and then there's a little ruffle (ph). [5:57] And I - you know, like I want to - I want to help her because she - you know, like her mother needs help. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You do want to help her but on the other hand, it feels like a terrible - a very difficult position you've put in.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Because I'm not the one that can help. I mean it's not me. We have a neighbor who works with Kutchner (ph). (inaudible at 6:32) I said, "Why not ask Jan? I'll just come and have coffee with you and we'll talk about trivial ..." But basically I ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But instead of asking Jan, winds up putting it on you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And then I put it on Jan. (chuckling) Hoo hoo, [she just loves me when she gets home] (ph). I hope she does. (inaudible at 7:02) said I would come back when I was through here and she said, "Where are you going?" And I said, "I'm going to therapy" and she ... "What's wrong?" I guess she thought it was physical therapy. (chuckling) I was hurting somewhere (ph).

</p><p>I feel that's much easier to say now.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feeling more comfortable with that now.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. You know, like if they're really interested in my business, instead of saying, "It's none of your business, I'll tell them (inaudible at 7:38)." You know, where I am at 3:00 on a Tuesday. It doesn't bother me like the first couple of weeks. Like you know, I didn't want everyone in the world to know. Because I thought it was a bad reflection. And now, you know, depending on their response, it's a bad reflection on them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Now it doesn't seem to you like there's something wrong - that it says something ill about you but it sort of says something about them how they take it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, how they take it. Yes, because I think I function more normal, you know, than many of my neighbors. More normal. More normally. The most normally of all. (laughing) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's not - I guess it's something like ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Not embarrassing like it used to be.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, not embarrassing and it also sounds like, you know, like you see yourself as being better off. So it doesn't ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ... doesn't matter what they think (inaudible at 9:00). Because you're better off than they are.

</p><p>(pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: And there's - like there's really only one person that I feel, you know, [has he] (ph) known that I was going to the therapy, still treats me, you know, like I'm sane. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's only one that does still treat you ...?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. All the rest like kind of treat you gingerly or (inaudible at 9:44).

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, like avoided me from that time on. And I - you know, like I don't think that my - that I could have gotten worse by coming here. I mean so it must be in there heads that - not mine.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. For almost everyone who knows, there's some stigma ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ... attached. And that says something about the kind of people they are.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I would say more than me. But that, you know, it doesn't even bother me. It's - you know, like it's even (inaudible at 10:36) you know, a secret joke; "I know something and you don't" (chuckling) sort of thing. But I even - like I don't go around with a half grin on my face all the time; otherwise, they might have (inaudible at 10:48) (chuckling).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean you know - you know something ...?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, just you know, like I feel better than they do ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 11:00)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And so ...

</p><p>PATIENT: And the - you know, they - not they; not all of them but you know a couple would say, (whispering) "Well, what was it like?" And you know, like I know and they don't. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like - it sounds like sort of having some kind of strength or sophistication that they don't have.

</p><p>PATIENT: That they don't have. Right. You know, and maybe they aren't too - you know. Well, I would say that maybe 99 percent of the people would feel better if they went to the therapist. You know. If they're that curious. I mean, boy, you'd really have a busy day though, wouldn't you? (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean if everyone that you thought ...

</p><p>PATIENT: If everyone ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ... needed it came.

</p><p>PATIENT: Or if all the people that thought they needed it really would come. Because my - you know, my brother said to me he'd like to come. But like I know he never will. And that - you know, like one night at bridge, all these - this was before I came - all of these women said (inaudible at 12:15) they sure would like to go to a therapist. They sure thought that would be really good. And if all the people that thought that, you know - because I always thought they (inaudible at 12:32) with it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry, what ...?

</p><p>PATIENT: I always thought - you know, when they were sitting there saying they would like to go to a therapist, I - you know, like I was the only one that said, "I think if you really ..." - you know, "Like if you really had something serious that you had to go for a therapist - to a therapist for, then you wouldn't be sitting there saying, "I'd sure like to go."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, [that was a line that was] (ph) really interesting but (chuckling) suppose that the people listening on the tape are going to get [to see me go through a lot of it]. (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What would - you know, that jarred something for me because you talked about - and then a couple of times I (inaudible at 13:21) kiddingly about the people.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I just don't feel like I'm doing anything except babbling on. You know. And it - I feel very, you know, like an egomaniac of some - a sort. You know, I come here and I spend an hour talking about myself. You know. And it's very easy to talk about yourself because you're, you know, one of the coolest people around. But to really - to say something about yourself or to find out something about yourself, that's really hard work. I mean after the initial discharge course (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're feeling now sort of like you're being lazy; sort of wasting your time eating bon bons ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ... kind of ...

</p><p>PATIENT: But it's not only - I mean I feel sorry for the people that have to go through these tapes. I feel sorry for you. I mean surely you can see doing something for somebody. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. I can be doing something important or something ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ... that would have some meaning for me; instead of sort of being - instead of kind of sitting here and being bored to tears and turned off. Is that ...?

</p><p>(pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know about being bored. You know what I mean? (chuckling) It's scintillating, but it just - you know, like it's not - it really is a waste of our time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Where I try to get a - whereas I thought you had feelings or ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ... perceptions about where I am and I was trying to ask you what they were. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Bored. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, (inaudible at 15:32) bored (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Well, I'm trying to find an (inaudible at 15:37) thing and I hope ...

</p><p>(pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Disinterested.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, you missed your calling if you're disinterested. You should have been an actor.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But does it seem to you that I'm bored or disinterested?

</p><p>PATIENT: No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But ...

</p><p>PATIENT: But you should be. (chuckling) 

</p><p>(pause) 

</p><p>I think from - that maybe I should have an hour before this to sit down and think or something. Because I - you know, through the week, I'll try - you know, think - I'll try. I'll really try and think of some, you know, some reason why I am not climaxing; that I haven't (inaudible at 16:55) before and I cannot - it just doesn't go anyplace, you know?

</p><p>(pause)

</p><p>The - you know, like one of the main things is that I'm just too - I think that I would love to (inaudible at 17:37) proud of me for the rest of my life. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Like it's less to your own timetable and priorities that you just never do anything about it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Because I just don't want to fiddle with it (inaudible at 18:02). And you were (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?

</p><p>PATIENT: Why - you know, like - like say the last time we had intercourse was at 3:30 on Saturday - or on Sunday morning. And you know, like all the energy you have is just to stay awake through the whole thing. And the time before that, it was - you know, you had 30 minutes to do, you know, and it's just like you've got a clock, you know, ticking over you and you've got - you've got to do this and it's got to be done in the shortest time possible. And ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You know, that sounds like you're saying to me like, "When I think of having intercourse, it's like having intercourse under the gun; either because I'm too sleepy so it has to be quick that - or because it's something that has to be done ..."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: " ... in 30 minutes. And like I don't have to - like I don't have the attention (ph) left over or time left over or something to kind of explore a little. Like I feel a little (inaudible at 19:57) utilitarian. Functionally (inaudible)."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. You know, one of the times when I really enjoy having intercourse is - you know, is like in a sneaky situation; like your children are outside playing and you know that they're going to be coming up, you know, and you have to one ear out. I don't know why ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: ... that really turns me on (chuckling). You know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: But there you are again, you know. Like you have to get it done. Maybe that's why I like to do it then. Because we're not going to fiddle around. We're going to get in there and do it. Period. You know? 

</p><p>(pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sounds like (inaudible at 20:55) to do it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, that's two things. But maybe that's why I like to do it while the kids are outside.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. It's sort of like - that sounds a little like a kind of adventure or something, you know?

</p><p>PATIENT: It is kind of - you know ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Fantasy.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. But it's still kind of a beat-the-clock sort of thing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And I can remember one time - one other time, which was, you know - like it's been six years ago. I was really turned on because we were - we were staying all night with some people and, you know, it was a quiet adventure. You know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like not wanting them to hear you.

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughing) Yes. (inaudible at 21:37) Yes. And you know, like there was no reason that they shouldn't or couldn't.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So having to be super quiet (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. That was much more interesting than just hopping in and hopping out. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right, mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: But that wasn't - you know, like we didn't have a timetable. (clears throat) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, but it sounds like you had a different - you had no timetable but you had like a different kind of constraint. You know, you weren't constrained by time but you were constrained by these people's ears.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds like, in most cases, there have been some kind of external circumstance adding a kind of touch of drama (clears throat) or something. 

</p><p>(pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know how you would arrange that every time. (chuckling) "May we stay all night with you tonight"? (inaudible at 22:45) The last time, at 3:30 in the morning, my - you know, I looked over and there was my three-year-old daughter standing in the doorway and I was just sick. 

</p><p>(pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Thinking the first time her having] (ph) watched you have intercourse.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I think she, you know - probably, she just got there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I didn't even want her to see that. (inaudible at 23:24) suspect she was going to be up roaming at 3:30 in the morning. But it's still just - really it bothers me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 23:33)

</p><p>PATIENT: I just don't want her to see that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, I was ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Because ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Go ahead.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because they get the wrong idea about it. Because I know that I saw my parents - you know, I saw my father roll over very quickly. And I didn't know, really, what it was. But I didn't think it was anything very good. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No. No, I was more kind of thinking about what you're - or trying to ask you what your feelings were when she saw you. It's not like you were like ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ... sick to your stomach (inaudible at 24:18). Tell me what you were feeling.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I can't really describe. I mean I just thought, "Oh, no." (chuckling) I just - you know, I guess it makes me physically ill. And it - it's just kind of an uncomfortable feeling having somebody - I don't know what she saw, how that's going to affect her in her married life. I don't know if it even will. You know? Or whether it was dark in our room and light out there; whether she'll see.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I want you to try something with me. OK? (inaudible at 25:06) you'll know yet (ph) when I'm done. I want you to do with me - (sighs) if you put yourself back there and imagine the scene in front of you; you've just had intercourse with Jim and that you see her there. And then I want you to tell me what the thoughts you're having are. What thoughts you're having. Can you do that? And tell me in the present tense; not like it happened but like it's happening.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I didn't have any thoughts, really. I mean, you know, like something must have flashed through - or something flashed through my mind. But I just - it wasn't sweet (ph). You know, rolled out of bed and got my robe on and asked her - well, I - I don't know, maybe it was physical; like my heart went - or my stomach went. But I - you know, like it was really too quick ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: I saw her and I gasped, I think. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it sounds like then you - all that you can remember is something like seeing her and a feeling of just horror (snaps fingers) just like that and not having anything but that feeling of ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, it was just, you know - like I don't even think anything could have flashed through my mind that ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That ...

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, off you go and out you go. And I must have been there 30 seconds with my robe on and she did ask like - she asked something about Daddy. And you go again. Oh, I know. "Why are you sleeping without any clothes on?" So obviously she did see. Luckily it was warm out. She accepted that. But I mean will she accept that? I mean does she really accept that? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You wonder if you really gave her a credible explanation that night.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well. Not really, because he always sleeps with his shorts on; whether it's 200 or nine. But whether she'll - you know, whether she'll ever reason that out or whether she'll forget it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. You mean you ...

</p><p>PATIENT: I just - you know, (inaudible at 28:09) whether it's (inaudible) damage or anything. I didn't want her to see.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want her to see regardless of whether it would hurt her or not. Something that you didn't want her to see.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, it's like how do you ever know whether that - I mean I don't know, but the fact that I saw my parents doing the same thing, you know, has - that's been held against sex for the rest of my life. I don't even know if I knew - you know, like I didn't even know what it was ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: ... when I saw it; whereas she doesn't either probably. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: (clears throat) (pause) But I knew - you know, I'm sure like when I saw that, I mean I can remember the whole scene right now. With my parents. My little brothers might be in there, too. And you know, I thought at the time, you know, like it's not a very appetizing - [it's not the word] (ph) - it really doesn't look very good to some four-year-old child.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It didn't look very appetizing to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm-mm. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You felt revolted. [30:00]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I didn't have the - you know, like I think have read - I'm sure I have read - that children who see their parents having intercourse, you know, like they all say, "Stop hurting Mommy," you know. And I didn't - it was not that for me. It was yuck (ph). (inaudible at 30:22)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Pretty (ph) disgusting. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, it didn't look quite much fun to me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like more than it didn't look like it was fun that it - that it looked (inaudible at 30:31).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, it looked bad instead of ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I don't want - you know, like that could very well be your first thought. I mean, for Sarah that could - she doesn't know what it's about and it could mark her for life.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Could be a very significant and destructive thing for her.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. And it could be nothing. But ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you just have no way of knowing.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I mean like why take the chance. But it's already ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Been taken.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. It was just carelessness really. All you have to do is shut the door. And then if anybody hops down the hall, they have to at least open the door. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's your own fault, I guess you're saying. That she could be scarred for life and you did it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. But you know, like I don't really (clears throat) - I don't sit around and blame myself for that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And like I may never know - I mean my mother wouldn't have known about now and I will probably never know. But I might always wonder about it. Not with kicking myself; although ... [32:08] (pause)

</p><p>[32:39] Pops into my mind that it's a bad thing to see. (pause) I'm wondering if it's a bad thing to do if I think it's a bad thing to see. Or whether I can say, "Do as I say, not as I do." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Whether you can make that split or whether it's all the same thing as ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Or whether I'm building up a (inaudible at 33:21) she may not remember.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I guess it's very important to you but ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, everything I remember from childhood has to do with sex. Now I wonder why. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like sexual experiences were very important for you as a child.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, but why? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That should be (inaudible at 34:08).

</p><p>PATIENT: So it's in the genes, I guess. [34:17] (pause) 

</p><p>[34:58] Wonder if I'd feel the same way if that were my older daughter. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, like how you - I feel like Jennifer might have just said, "Oh, Daddy's giving you the seed. Are you going to have a baby?" (chuckling) You know? And I think that it might be a little - you know, Sarah's that much younger. (pause) Like Jennifer might have been able to, you know, [let it slide] (ph) sort of thing and I just wonder if Sarah isn't a little, you know - like she's really much too young. Like she's always going to be too young (chuckling), as far as I'm concerned.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She's really your baby.

</p><p>PATIENT: (clears throat) Yes. And yes (loud airplane sound), Jennifer just knows a little more. She's really ... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (airplane sound continues) It all just sounds like you're (inaudible at 36:20). Like she could take that kind of in her stride ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ... whereas Sarah is sort of more vulnerable or ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, she's really too - you know, like she's more like I was in the family, you know? There was - there was always somebody else in front ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To take the heat or whatever.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I identify with Sarah (chuckling) more than Jennifer. Because Jennifer was more sophisticated at four than I am now. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you certainly (inaudible at 37:11).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, she's OK. I mean she kind of gets through life, I think. I guess you can never be sure of that either. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But she's a real solid ... (inaudible at 37:27)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, she kind of just strolls right in and she's sensitive to - I mean - she told me yesterday that school was dumb. And I said, "What happened?" And she would not tell. She sealed her lips and I mean nothing could get it out of her. I supposed (ph) the teacher told her that she was coloring something wrong and she [flung her opinion on the school] (ph) that day. But like she went back, where Sarah wouldn't.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sarah's a quitter. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. (chuckling) Not really a quitter but she just - she's never had to go in and do it herself. You know. Like somebody always takes her. Jennifer walks to school with Sam and, you know, an adult takes Sarah to school and mother picks her up. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sarah's coddled.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And so, when things happen that are difficult, like she crumbles.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, she probably would. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I thought - that's what I said before - it sounds like ...

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Huh? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Just like mother.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. A hothouse flower.

</p><p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) It all depends on - it all depends on where you are in the family.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Your fate (ph) was fair game because you're the baby. [39:19] (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: [39:41] Well, it really shouldn't be so with me. Because I had a brother that was 12 months younger. Didn't really have time to be much of a baby. But I was because I was the only girl and my father would give me lectures about quitting but he would always let me quit. Always there were two things I quit.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. But those two things are very important that you feel like (inaudible at 40:20).

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm. Well, more important than quitting was - you know, is like starting something you don't want to do and you can't handle and having a little direction or having someone say, you know, "You can't handle this." I'm not quite (inaudible at 40:46) but I just feel like nobody ever put their foot down with me. I mean obviously they must have when I was, you know, a preschooler. But it seemed like from then on, I could do anything I wanted to do (inaudible at 41:08). I mean my mother and father I think wanted me to take piano lessons. Excuse me. And so, they casually mentioned would I like to take piano lessons and went out and bought a $400 piano. Which I think is just insane. Because you know, if you ask any little girl and she's going to say, "Yes, Mommy." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And all you had to do was sort of say a lukewarm yes and they (snaps fingers) jumped like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Yes. I mean it was for them; it wasn't really for me. They wanted a piano player in the house and I looked sort of like the one and the boys were working and you know, I'm (inaudible at 41:55).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [That's the thing a girl does] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. So but, you know, instead of - you know, if I had it to do, I might rent a piano and see how the kid was going to do on it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well hold it now. It sounds like you're two ways on this. On the one hand, for them, that they wanted a piano. But on the other hand, it sounds like you feel some sort of complicity in their going out and buying a $400 piano. That somehow that - you're at fault or something there. I ...

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I'm not. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: OK.

</p><p>PATIENT: But you know, like I must have been seven. And you know, for one thing, they started me too young; they couldn't wait. And nobody told me anything about practicing; whereas, you know, I thought you got this magic piano and you got - you played the piano.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: And instead you have to sit down at the damn thing (chuckling), you know, and practice. And I hated to do that. And instead of making me practice or saying, "OK, you don't have any more lessons," they let me go on and I embarrassed myself every Saturday when I went for piano lessons. They were, you know, really - sometimes they weren't really very bright. I knew I couldn't play the piece that I'd been supposedly been practicing everyday. My mother knew it. Why do people let things like that go on? You know, like they were looking for a miracle. Someday I'd wake up and want to play the piano. Something I wouldn't mind. Now's the time. (clears throat) But I don't need a - you know, a baby grand to play on either.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The sort of feelings you were having, which I'm (inaudible at 44:13) trying to think of - I'm not - I'm not clear, Jessica. But like they let you go on making a horrible fool of yourself and being terribly embarrassed and uncomfortable and anxious (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. Kind of weird. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: When you think of going there every Saturday and not being able to do anything ...

</p><p>PATIENT: I could hardly play my scales after five years. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, it's almost like all embarrassed again. Because you're angry with them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I guess so. You know, like if I had had anything - yes, I was such a fat, (inaudible at 45:05) child ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: ... I'd really - you know, I was just too - I didn't have any energy and nobody - hey, I guess you can't always - you know, like you just can't go on blaming your parents (chuckling) for how you turned out. But I do think - to me, like after the first year, when I wasn't ever practicing, that they should have said, "You know, she's not practicing, so why don't we just discontinue the lessons?" You know. And it may have been that when I was in high school I might have wanted to play piano. But somehow I feel like it was ruined for me and - well, I don't - I just don't know, really, what it is because, you know, obviously I should have learned, somewhere in my life, that instead of [Sunday sermons] (ph), you know, you don't get anything for free. You have to work in this world if you're going to get along. And you know, the rest of it. But I should have learned that you have to practice before you're going to be good in anything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: But like I know that right now. But the thought of practicing just - ugh. And it's not like - I'm not really afraid of hard work. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's not like you're afraid ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Or ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like it turns you off, that's all. You don't want to do it is what ...

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. There's nothing I'm that turned on about that I could go out and really work at doing something well. Because nothing really thrills me that much. And I hate to think it's all on this one thing (chuckling). All on this simple piano (inaudible at 47:15). But I don't know. Whoever said you have to teach - or how do you go about teaching children this. I mean they would say this, "You have to practice. You can't - you know, you're never going to learn unless you practice," but nobody ever insisted that I practice. And you know, it's just really something. What is it? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But, one thing I'm very clear about is feeling very indignant and resentful that they didn't make you practice. But what I'm not clear about is it sounds like you see that (clears throat) - that they didn't make you practice - as having caused something - yes, (inaudible at 48:32). The fact that they didn't make you practice then, has caused you to not want to practice now; to not want to stick with anything because they didn't make you stick with the piano. I think that's what you're saying. And I'm not - if that is what you're saying, I'm not clear how. What - why? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because let me give you a counter argument. Because like the other side of that could be something like, "Well, if they had made me practice, I would have hated it so that I wouldn't want to practice anymore on anything (inaudible at 49:06)."

</p><p>PATIENT: Alright. [While they've been] (ph) - OK, if they don't make you practice, then take the damn thing out of the house. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: Or say, "Alright, if you're not going to learn this piano, we're not going to take you into town on Saturday to your music lesson." You know, it's just like you're - I was being ridiculed every day. I mean I stopped maybe in eighth grade. But that piano was still there looking at me. I still couldn't play a note. I never touched that piano from the day after my lessons were done. [I went to] (ph) take the lessons for three years.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And it's sort of - it's like it's a thing sitting there. You know. And every time you go past it it's saying, "You're a quitter, you're a quitter" or ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just saying something or it's doing something by its presence there. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like what happened was that they subjected you to intense guilt ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Guilt. That's the word.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ... and they should have done something. They should have done something to help, instead of just plunging you in the middle of a situation that would make you feel guilty.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Just either say "Do it" or "Don't do it."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: But you know, just don't - and "Well, we wasted a lot of money on you." You know. And I didn't think - I really didn't feel guilty about that. You know. But maybe I do. But if it was my child, I wouldn't have wasted the money on them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's not your fault; it's their fault.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, it's my fault for not - well, you know, in the beginning it was their fault. You don't just tailor to their every little whim ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: ... somebody has.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I - you know, even though you know they wanted a musician and the whole bit about "You'll be the life of the party" ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: ... even I heard.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sounds ...

</p><p>PATIENT: I did. I had a guilt feeling and I still feel guilty about those damn piano lessons. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And they seduced you into it. (inaudible at 51:27)

</p><p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) I don't ever - I remember the day they asked me. It wasn't the same like the little kid comes home and says, "Georgie is doing the piano" (audio gap). [51:36]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I mean you say, "Do you want me to buy you an ice cream (inaudible)?" Well, yes. (chuckling) (inaudible at 51:57) but let's just take one out. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And - I just - you know, something I don't think I would ever do. Like my mother, you know, totally different personality. Father could play the piano and the trumpet (ph) and et cetera and et cetera. He was very musical.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I think my father wanted somebody to play while he could sing. He likes to sing. Getting one of those little things (inaudible at 52:30).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, they wanted - so they wanted - they sort of manipulated you into wanting, into saying you were going to take piano lessons. And they weren't even doing it for you anyway. They were doing it for them. Yes?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. That's probably why they didn't give up. You know. They wanted it so badly.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: For them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. But if my mother would have taken those piano lessons, everybody would have been much happier. She would have been happier. Dad would have been happy. He'd have had somebody who could play.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Instead of using you - I mean you as the scapegoat. Scapegoat (inaudible at 53:16).

</p><p>PATIENT: But I mean like that's been my whole life. I didn't want to do anything. I didn't have to. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And you know, like my kids know that if they ask me a hundred times for something that I want to give it to them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know and if they're persistent enough, they all get it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: And kids know that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: That if I say, "I'm not going to do that" - and with my mother, I only had to say it a couple of times. (inaudible at 53:52)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what ...

</p><p>PATIENT: You know. I think I told you I had a girl scouts calf. You know about girl scouts?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Girl scouts the (inaudible at 54:05).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, well I had a calf.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is that right?

</p><p>PATIENT: And my brothers did too. We would go to pick out our calves, you know? And my father would help me, supposedly you read - you find out how the calf stands; it's going to be a good show calf, et cetera. But my dad helped me pick mine out. It was, you know, the best of the three. And you always - you had to water and feed, comb your own calf throughout the year. And I didn't want to; one of the boys had to. You know, I wasn't going out in the blizzard. So they did. And coming to the fair, mine was the grand champion with the purple ribbon. The boys, who had done all the work, had the white. Or the red, which is down there. And they - you know. And you know like you're really getting away with something. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. And you know and that makes you feel terribly guilty. (inaudible at 55:21) you have a two-edge thing going for you. On the one hand, you're given all of the part of - like you're given - you're given whatever it is you want. You're excused from whatever it is you don't want to do. And you're just a princess sitting on your cushion eating bon bons. The other side of that is you feel terrible. You feel guilty. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Feel like you're getting things you don't deserve. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I got things I didn't even want. But the bad part of that was I really - you know, even at that age, I felt badly that the boys had done that work and I hadn't really. And I really didn't deserve it. I just had the good fortune of picking out the better calf. And you know, it was nothing I had done. Well, besides the fact - and I heard my father say this (inaudible at 56:22) - you take your calves out in front of this audience (inaudible) and here's this little girl with, you know, 1,000 pound calf. And they - the prize goes way up. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just by virtue of being a little girl.

</p><p>PATIENT: Just ... right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: And that - you know, that's not right. And I even knew that at the time. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So (clears throat), it sounds like maybe you've been feeling guilty ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Even then. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ... about kind of being a little girl and conning (clearing throat) everybody (ph) by virtue of being a little girl.

</p><p>PATIENT: My dad thought it was really funny.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Pardon?

</p><p>PATIENT: My dad thought that was funny. (inaudible at 57:11), you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I can see that he thought it was very funny. But I can - [I have] (ph) one way you might have been feeling horribly embarrassed. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I just always felt sorry for my brothers. You know. I don't - I don't think like I was embarrassed because, you know, I was - money. All I was there for; to make money. Wasn't it my love of cows or doing a job well. Money. Even at that age. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: As far back as you can remember?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Buy another cow. Have a herd someday. (laughing) (inaudible at 58:05) It's my brothers feel bad about that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If they - kind of if they don't, the way you're feeling, they ought to. 

</p><p>... (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (pause) [58:31] You know, girls really do get away with a lot (inaudible). (inaudible at 58:40)? Corn has (inaudible). Do you know the things that go up on the top at the World's Fair? (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: And you have to pull those out at a certain time of the year - some corn. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 59:01) And you know, like if I had a - this was a - I mean like you had to be in high school. If you weren't tall enough to reach the tassels - you had to reach up by hand, every one of them (inaudible). If I had a (inaudible) I could walk (ph) down the wall. Skipping gaily.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know. And I never got tired. If I had a (inaudible at 59:27), I really had to work because I was going down. (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of sounds like being a girl in a world of men. It really kind of lets you off the hook.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, (inaudible at 59:38).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And also leaves you feeling guilty. You know, something like guilty.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I didn't (ph) think of that. [Might I really have] (ph) felt guilty about it at all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Or is it just now in the telling that ...

</p><p>PATIENT: At the time, I don't know. I probably thought it was kind of cute at the time. And just being out there in that heat. Phew. With that corn (inaudible at 60:14) getting an education at the time.

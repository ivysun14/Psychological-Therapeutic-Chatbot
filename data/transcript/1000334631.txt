<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) It seems like every day now I want to find the unhappy face and then see how I react to it, because it was the first thing that I thought of when I came in.  When I, I didn't think of it before I actually came in here.  And at first it always seems like I'm not going to be able to find it.  But as soon as I saw it today it, again, made me feel very annoyed that it was there again.  Maybe in a way I'm hoping I won't see it again.  And it also made me think of a comment that MSCZ made yesterday after, it was regarding what I was doing after we left my sister's dance.  And he thought that I had a very good time and in some ways I did, but in some ways I almost felt as if I were trying to appear that I was.  But I felt sort of uncomfortable.  And so as soon as we left I began talking about all the things that I'd found uncomfortable rather than about the things that I'd enjoyed.  And MSCZ remarked that it seemed to him that the further away we got from the house the more I was bringing up that I hadn't liked and almost trying to convince myself that I hadn't enjoyed it.</p>

<p>And I don't, I don't know whether that's really true or whether it really is true what I'm telling myself now, that I was trying to just keep a good front up.  But the thing that, uhm, I noticed most that did distress me about how I reacted to the evening, and it was something I hadn't even anticipated, was a feeling about these were all my sister's friends and that all I was to them, even ones that I'd met many times before, was FYC HRC's sister and, or FYC BBQ's, depending upon how they knew her previously and that somehow I wasn't anything in my own right in their eyes and that after they welcomed me because of my connection with her, they would have very little interest in me as an individual.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And the other thing that probably more than anything that bothered me about it was that I always, or very often when I'm near my brother-in-law — I'm very rarely with him — but around where he is I get a feeling of tension about our relationship.  And I can't tell again whether I'm imagining his reaction to me or if, if something is really happening there.  (Clears throat) But it always seems to me that he has very little interest in being around me or talking to me or knowing, well, just exchanging ideas with me.  And I know things have been awkward between us, but I can't tell if that's it or if it's just that he basically doesn't like me, which in itself makes me feel uncomfortable.  But I think I've reached the point where if that's it then I'd like to face it so I could accept it.  Because he, he was just very odd last night and, or 2 nights ago.</p>

<p>And I can't tell how much something else is functioning there because when I was talking about this feeling I had on meeting FYC's friends and being only her younger sister in their eyes or just certainly here you are spending an evening with people and absolutely none of the people you meet are going to, at least it seems to me, are going to be any kind of a lasting relationship.  And this always bothers me.  I can't seem to just enjoy the evening for the evening and accept that I might not see any of these people ever again.  And then I realize too that still something was functioning that functioned, that I realized was functioning when I went to PEC, the feeling of FYC's friends being better than mine.  And I, just from my reaction to the dance, I realized that when I'm around them I'm still doing this.  And so it makes me wonder if maybe I have some kind of a reaction to FYC's husband being better than mine and then this is somehow acting in how I respond to MEIR and, in turn, how he'd respond to me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I'm sure that sometimes the fact that he's extremely well-off financially has entered into my mind as a comparison.  And I don't know whether I fought it off because I feel that that's an awful comparison to make or whether, I don't know, it, I just don't know how strongly that affects me.  And I think also just how, as I think of his, of FYC's friends as being better it sometimes seems to me that his friends are better than MSCZ's, that they're more interesting and they're involved in life in a deeper way, that they all seem to have some definite area where they can really make a contribution, which is probably what makes them more interesting.  But again I'm doing with his friends and MSCZ's friends what I do with FYC's friends and my friends.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know how much this might have had to do with my attitude when I actually got to the dance but the people who were giving the dinner we were attending were unable to have it at their house and so my sister asked my mother to have the same dinner at her house.  And so in a way it just seemed like it was my mother's dinner, my mother's party and that all I was was a daughter in the house.  And so then I was Mrs. HRC's daughter.  And Mrs. HRC was the one giving the party for these other people.  I didn't feel it that strongly at the dinner.  I enjoyed myself at the dinner.  But I think that there was something of that in my reaction to it.  And it did sort of bother me that of all people it had to be my parents giving it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I'm not quite clear on it.  The dinner and dance were separate, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because there were so many people involved they had several dinners.   They'd asked several people to give dinners.  And I, as much as I was afraid of all the aspects of not knowing people and going places I'd never been and hostess that I didn't know and things like that, I, when I found out we were having dinner at my own home, my parents' home I was very disappointed.  And that kind of surprised me because I thought I might have felt more relieved about it.  (Clears throat) (Pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose (clears throat) there's an aspect, too, that bothers me about a dinner at my parents' now because of the feeling that if I want to join a conversation that my mother's involved in, I just can't seem to do it.  And I don't know, this is usually when the people that she's conversing with are younger people and they all seem to be kind of deferring to her and her attitudes and opinions, my mother.  And I don't know whether it's because it seems that they're — and if I join the conversation I always try to join through addressing the others — are using her as a focal point or whether I see her as a focal point, but some—, anyway I always try to join through my mother.  And she always ignores me.  This is something I've mentioned about just dinners in PTN when there've been guests, but family friends.  And it happened at this dinner too.</p>

<p>And the, it was when I addressed her, it was times when she could not have not heard me.  Or at least it seemed to me that, that if I had done the same thing with anybody else I just know from experience that they would have acknowledged what I said.  Because it was during a lull in conversation.  And then she'd just start talking again as if she never, as if I weren't there.  And it's just this feeling that I'm not there and then sort of an embarrassment that I keep on making this remark and, and am rejected in a way, I suppose.  But then the other people who were there hear my remark (laughs) and, and realize that I've been rejected and that makes me feel even worse.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I can't tell whether, when she does that, it's a case of, in a way not hearing me because she's so busy concentrating on how she's going to keep the conversation going.  Because I do think she does feel this type of tension.  But since she does it to me when the situation is much more relaxing for her, it seems like it must be something else too.  And, and so—, it's something aggressive on her part, as far as I see it.  Or somehow she doesn't want to be ignored herself and feels she has to fight to get in ADN.  It gives her some kind of a feeling of superiority to be able to ignore somebody else and to have that person take the being ignored, to have the power to do it.  And I just can't tell exactly what's going on or if I am imagining it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But it makes me, when this happens, it makes me feel not only upset that she would do this but it also makes me feel very angry.  And I always just have to withdraw from the conversation, just completely leave it or withdraw completely from the table or, depends the conversation after that, and be realizing that I've been rejected from it.  How strong the feeling is.  But I can't stand to even be listening to —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you leave the table, you say?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, I just started talking with somebody else.  But at, in PTN I'll sometimes just leave the table, because it's almost a feeling of, I won't be able to control myself if I stay because I'll just feel so angry.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What would you like to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, maybe shout something awful at her or throw something, break something.  Generally just create a disturbance so I'll be noticed, I suppose.  But I think in a way I want to attack her, hurt her back in some way.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And whenever I remember a dance like that or any social occasion, it is true that the things that will come to my mind are the things that are unpleasant to me.  And I suppose in a way mainly because I feel I was inadequate in some way or did something stupid or my response to somebody or remark was inappropriate.  And I don't just choose to remember the nice parts.  And it's almost, I will refuse to see that there were nice parts, even when they're happening.</p>

<p>And I was just wondering if somehow I'm more comfortable in this image of myself as somebody who's always going to do stupid things and be inappropriate and have an awful time and be afraid beforehand.  And, as much as I think I don't like all this, I'm too comfortable in it to allow any change that may be there to occur if I would just let it.  And it, and I think, too, because of this attitude that I'm making myself go to these things and the fear that I might miss something too, but partly just, I'm afraid of it and it would be a good experience to go so that next time I won't be quite so afraid of something like that.  So perhaps in a way afterwards I keep trying to think, well, "What lessons did I learn from it? Where was I stupid or where did I make a mistake?"  Or even during it, I might be doing that, so that I just, I get so self-conscious that I don't even know how I can judge anything very well.</p>

<p>And I was thinking partly of, uhm, there was one fellow there who's married to a close friend of my sister's.  And I knew this close friend when my sister was at college.  And she was one of the few that, uhm, well, she didn't know too many people there so, so I had the feeling that any interest she had in me was more because I was somebody that didn't know too many people too and, and therefore we could stick together.  But, uhm, anyway she was very nice to me.</p>

<p>And her husband had indicated he wanted to have a dance with me.  But he was sort of a wild dancer.  And I'd seen him dance with other people and I was just petrified of his asking me to dance, because I've always been very timid about dancing and assuming I can't dance well at all.  And then finally later on in the evening he did ask me to dance.  And in a way I really enjoyed it because even though he wasn't as good a dancer as maybe MSCZ or somebody else, he was wild enough and strong enough as a leader so it made me do things that I might not have dared to do otherwise.  And I just didn't even have time to think about whether I could do them or not.  But then at the end he, he was acting in sort of a peculiar way and I began to start thinking about, well, what should I say to a person like this so I won't seem too serious or, I don't know.  I just got so self-conscious about how you kind of answer somebody who's making really kind of stupid remarks.  And, and instead of thinking his remarks were sort of stupid I began to think that my responses to him were sort of stupid and that it could really matter.  And now, instead of remembering that I, in a way, enjoyed the dancing part with him very much, all I remember is this feeling of being very uncomfortable near the end when he started saying things to me.  And I don't know, I felt he wanted to dance with somebody else or at least stop dancing with me and he didn't know how to get out of it.  And, because we danced for quite a long time and I just assume that I really wasn't very good and so therefore he must want to stop dancing with me.</p>

<p>And I can, I can just see that the whole thing I was doing was concentrating so much on myself that I really couldn't even judge what was happening, and, and I don't know, the real situation between the two of us (clears throat).  And then afterwards I saw him doing something else that made me feel, in a way he might, he might have been very insecure about things and I just realized, anyhow that he's a rather strange person and that I had assumed too much about myself in it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And something else that's coming to my mind now, although it didn't at all yesterday — and yet on Saturday it was very much in my mind when we were going up to PNOTS — is, is a dream I had.  And it was, well, I could remember enough of it so — I was practically awake when I had it.  It was right before I got up on Saturday.  And the details of it are sort of vague now.  But somehow it was a gathering of people that had something to do with this dance.  And, I don't know, we were sitting around talking and you were there.  And I can just remember in the dream feeling a progressive need to withdraw more and more and, I don't know, just a greater feeling of discomfort.  And then, at one point you sort of indicated to me that you knew what I was doing and that I'd better stop doing it.  And I think I woke up then, but I had the feeling that I could stop doing it.  And just somehow thinking about that during the day was very comforting to me and I didn't get nearly as nervous as I thought I would before the dance.  (Clears throat) But then it bothered me that I was kind of using fantasy to escape in.  And it just did seem like an escape to me.</p>

<p>And the dream also had something to do with the movie we saw Friday night.  Uhm, and I can't remember now exactly how it was worked in too, but I do recall realizing that some of the aspects of it came from the movie.  And this just made me think again of the fact that I like very much to see movies because they are an escape.  And I like very much reading novels because they're an escape too.  And I'll think more, "Wouldn't it be nice if I were such and such?" instead of looking at what life really is for me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What was the movie?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Duffy."  And the, uhm, I don't know, there was something I found sad about the girl and something I found rather attractive.  She was somebody who just wanted to be a free spirit, I guess you'd say.  And just be.  And everybody that she had any kind of relationship with had to accept that she didn't want any ties, that she was just going to be.  And so people were all very fond of her.  She was an attractive type of character, and, and they did all accept this.  And I think there was, I don't know, something almost paternal in, in their reaction to her, which I liked, as if they were amused by her and would enjoy her when she was there.  And then if she felt she didn't want to continue the relationship that was alright, they'd accept it.  And then if she wanted to come back they'd accept that. (Pause) But I also felt sort of sad by her and, and as much as this kind of lack of responsibility to anybody else was attractive, there, there was some kind of a feeling, too, that in a way she really wanted to, well, need somebody, I guess, and she wouldn't let herself.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about another incident at the dance that (clears throat) did upset me at the time but I, I've been letting it upset me even more afterwards.  It's almost like I'm working myself up to really feeling rejected by it.  And this was, ah, when first MSCZ and then I joined him, was talking to a fellow that we'd met once before, independent of my sister.  And he seems like a very nice person and, and I guess I feel this kind of compulsion to know him well enough so that we can see him on our own if we wanted to.  And I had just come up and started talking to them then when the girl that was with him left with a great deal of commotion to do something like comb her hair.  And she was hardly gone when she came back and immediately insisted that they go off and do something else.  And it did make me feel that what she was doing was saying, "Come on, don't just stand there and talk to them."  Because she never once made any attempt to just stand there and talk to us.  And, and then they just went off somewhere else and they didn't do what she'd said.  So of course I took it immediately that, well, that was just an excuse to get away from us.  And I just took it very personally.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it bothered me enough so I just had to say something about it to my sister, which also annoyed me that I couldn't just keep it to myself.  And, of course, I couched it differently but, by saying something like, "It was nice to see this other person again."  And I know my sister likes him.  And so she said, "Yes, isn't he nice?"  And then I just mentioned that this girl had whisked him off from us before we had a chance to really talk with him.  And, and, ah, I suppose in a way I was hoping that my sister would make some kind of a chance for us to see him again.  I don't know exactly what I thought I was doing by mentioning it.  But then my sister said something which annoyed me because I felt, well, that explains it.  And it probably doesn't at all.  And this was that the girl has just become divorced from her husband and, and my sister's implication was that the girl was all sort of mixed up.  So you can't tell what she'll do.  But that's how I took it.  And I was annoyed with myself that I sort of said to myself, well, that explains it.  And, but because I saw that she did this, this — I mean it seemed that she did reject me and MSCZ — I immediately felt an anger toward her.  (Pause)</p>

<p>In a way it's the same kind of anger that I felt toward my mother when she didn't respond to my comments when she was talking.  And I think sometimes I tell myself that that kind of thing is impolite to do to people if they are just talking.  But in a way it's, it's an excuse because I don't, I'd in a way like to be able to have the strength to, if I just feel like going and doing something else, suggesting it or doing it.  Because, because it's probably similar to the feeling I have when I'm at just a cocktail party and where the flow of conversation is, is very brief with any one person and, and very superficial.  And I'll always tell myself, well, it's impolite just to kind of talk for a few seconds or minutes and then walk off.  And I'll end up never being the one to end it and the other person always is in the position of having to then.  And it ends up making me feel the same kind of feeling of rejection.  And yet I also feel a certain jealousy that I can't do this and, and I'd, in a — I'd like to have that kind of freedom when I'm anywhere.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Or if I do do it, and it's usually un—, under very unusual circumstances, I always feel I do it very awkwardly.  And some—, I feel sort of guilty about having left the other person probably because I'm always afraid of being left and being in a situation where I'm obviously there alone, rejected.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And now I'm feeling some kind of a annoyance that I'm thinking about this dance so much and talking about it.  I sort of have the reaction that I'd like to just not talk about it anymore.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You said that, uhm, in the dream I said to you, in effect, "You know what you're doing and stop it."  Right?  What was it, z____?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I — what you said?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah, I mean, what was it that, ah was being referred to?  Do you recall?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I was actually sort of, uhm, gradually hunching up more and more and putting my face in my hands and just kind of hiding my face.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah, that's what I was referring to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of gradually, yeah.  But beyond that, what feelings I was feeling that was making me do that.  But it wasn't a harsh kind of a thing.  I don't know, it was almost a feeling of being understood and somebody who expected something else from me and yet because they understood what, what I was doing, cared and could be gentle about it.  I don't know, it was, it was, uhm, just a very comforting feeling that I got from thinking of it.  But even while I was feeling that, I was also feeling upset that I had a dream that you were in, because somehow, I think even before I started analysis, I was afraid of fantasizing about you and making you something you weren't and having you take an importance with me that was just fantasy.  (Silence)</p>

<p>But I think also your being in the dream represented something more than, than just you.  I mean, it was sort of a feeling that I have about being here — and I don't always have it — but that, well, I am feeling more and more that what I am thinking I can say and that at least there's not any horrible thing happening to me for saying it or any rejection for saying it.  I don't know, I can't really find words for this feeling but there is a certain feeling of freedom.  (Pause) At least, there wa—, there is when I'm not here.  Sometimes when I'm here I can't believe that there is because I just feel so tense or disturbed because the thoughts that I'm, I keep having are disturbing ones but — (Pause)</p>

<p>I also wonder sometimes if I don't subtly do things to, uhm, make up for all the horrible things I'm saying about myself here, to counteract that in your mind.  And if maybe having you in a role of being nice to me, so that then I can talk about you in a nice way, in a sense isn't my way to sort of, you know, make up for all these things that I've been saying about myself.  And as if, well, in any relation to another person part of what you do with them is, is to be nice to them and oh, it's almost like giving you a present or something, I don't know.  I don't really know whether this is something I do do, but it just struck me that, that so many times you find that you are fooling yourself with what you're thinking and the reasons for it — just makes me distrust everything that I do now, I think.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

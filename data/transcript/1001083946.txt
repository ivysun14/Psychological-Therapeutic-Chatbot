<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Don't even look at it. All right, you've got a lot of energy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, but last week I had a serious dip.  I mean, in bed, didn't wanna get out, feeling like hopeless, the whole thing.  Lasted for about three days and then went back to the Tasmanian devil, full of energy.  Everything is wonderful, so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't like the dips.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, well that's what the Lamictal is for, is to try to prevent this.  So we need it higher.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'm not ever supposed to be like this?  Happy?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, okay, might as well learn this now.  If you're on the manic side you have extra energy, you could be kind of euphoric, happy.  You don't need as much sleep.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You get more impulsive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I haven't done that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I mean maybe...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In general...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just with the exercising. I'm like, I have to exercise like at least twice a day now and you know, I'm always looking for new exercises to do and I just have a lot of energy.  That's the only way I can describe it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well that's not normal.  It might be nice.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm sorry.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> As a matter of fact most manic people say can't you just keep me like this and well no, I can't because the danger is, you kept going up, up, up then you get poor judgement.  You get more irritable, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like, you know, I had, I can remember the guy being in here and he had just, the day before, spent eighty eight hundred dollars at Circuit City stereo equipment and he didn't have the money.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I wrote him a letter to explain it and he said it's tough, you know, so. And I actually had a guy that went and bid on, and I guess got, a piece of land for two million dollars in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I saw him about a year and a half later, he came back, he went away somewhere and came back and he said they were still trying to collect the money from him.  He didn't have any money.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He just bought it and-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He went and bought some boat that was sinking in the middle of the [DEIDENTIFIED], you know?  Stuff like that.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you can get sexier, you can get more interest in sex.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, well, but I don't have a partner to, uh-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you can just go out and try.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know what, it's true, in dreams, yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, okay, see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.  Obviously men are in my dreams a lot more lately.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.  We figured it out now we just got to get you in control of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But look, I called in, I had this rash and then I had another one on my leg.  The one on my leg, although I have been getting quite dry lately, I don't know.  Is this the Lamictal?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't think so. That's the only two places?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, and this one itches like the dickens.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Shit. I mean usually when I see it, it just doesn't look like that, but and it looks more like you contacted something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know because, and this one's drying up.  It doesn't itch anymore.  This one still itches.  So I don't know, I'm still taking my medicine but-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How much are you up to now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One fifty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just doesn't seem like it.  And it looks very much like a poison ivy kind of thing though, it could be.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't want to switch meds, doc.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well let's just, all right, let's get it up to two hundred and, but if you get more of it, you know, before you come back, just stop it. We could...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just stop it cold turkey?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's not a problem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Meanwhile, it looks like it, I would put Cortisone cream.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have been.  It seems to help with the itching.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This part is weird too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no, that's a burn.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh that's, oh okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's a scar from the burn.  It's just right here.  But I can remember getting something similar to this like when I lay out in the sun I get it up here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but well...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I haven't, I mean other than me running a lot more, I don't know.  Anyway, I just wanted to show it to you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you have a rash, right wrist.  [INAUDIBLE]  I don't know [INAUDIBLE].  Now, so we got the Lexapro and you see the Lexapro may not be doing anything but we don't take it away, but...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And there's other things.  Let me add something else that's a mood stabilizer.  Especially since Lamictal might have to go just to see if that's doing that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like these drugs are, like I'm making this stuff up, but this could be an antidepressant, a tranquilizer and a mood stabilizer.  It's new, using it for this.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that will replace the Lamictal?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It could.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or in addition to?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It could.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It could?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So now we'll, we'll go and put them together.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because it might slow you down a little bit towards normal right now.  Lamictal doesn't do that.  It can only be antidepressive or stabilizing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, but this could be tranquilizing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, so I take it at night?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Take it at night, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It'll last all day.  That's Abilify.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm taking a lot of meds, doc.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well yeah, till I get this straight.  You know.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  I did want to talk to you about something that my step mother said the other day that upset me. One of my daughters, [NAME OTHER], is an office manager at [DEIDENTIFIED], she's been there for about four years.  The chief doctor, has been for about six months, making her feel a little uncomfortable.  Let me preface this by saying that my daughter is gay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.  Now is the doctor a man or woman?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's a man.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he, you know, asking her to lunch, texting her how much he misses her when it's her day off, leaving her little notes. Anyway, it's developed to the point where the coworkers felt it important enough to call corporate.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ohh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now this sexual harassment thing is coming to, into play.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So she called me and asked me for my advice which I gave to her, but it wasn't the advice she wanted to hear.  I told her she needed to stick it out, you know you can't just leave without another job, she has responsibilities.  She needed to defend herself with corporate.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my mom was telling her leave, just get out of the situation.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So anyway.  I was telling my step mother that I felt like my mom was giving [NAME OTHER] the wrong advice and my step mother just looks at me and says, well I'm sure you can understand why no one would want your advice.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Eww.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I said, why?  And she said, well you made a lot of bad choices. And it hurt my feelings, but more than that it made me angry because I don't know anyone that has never made a bad choice in their life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And just because now I'm bipolar, which they throw that around a lot, you know.  dad will say are you medicated, you know everything is like this big joke now around that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't think it's funny and I don't think it's-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you're, on one side you're obvious bad decisions were in the corporate area.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, so that's probably what you thought of.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I'm sure she's also referring to my bad decisions with spouses, you know.  I haven't picked the best spouses or whatever.  But, I mean, is that what people think of me now, that I just, I have no sense, I have no-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I wouldn't think so.  Well first of all, see you probably, now looking back, did some things when you were manicky like this or what.  See you could be worse than this if you didn't have the Lamictal.  It's all right now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, but no one will ever understand that, I mean most people.  Even if you said, oh I was manic. They'll say, oh you're just making up excuses. So, it's not...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You got a tough thing to walk around with.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean I know I'm like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't think she should have said, but since I know her, I mean she just blurts out whatever she's thinking too, so, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But how should I have handled that?  I mean do I just let it sit in me and make me more and more angry?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, no, no.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And help to lower what little self esteem I already have, or do I confront her or what do I do?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I would, it'd be better to say something like, you know, I could see where you were coming from I got to tell you, you know, that made me angry and I'm trying to get over it, or something like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm trying to think.  I mean it doesn't mean your decisions are going to be bad in the future.  You know, that's in the past.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Might people think that?  Maybe it's like alcoholics.  I mean you've know this person is an alcoholic for a long time and they say, oh well I stopped drinking and I haven't had a drink for a month.  You still think of their past.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But what happens is after about six months to a year of them being okay everybody else kind of predicts the bad too as long as they [INAUDIBLE], but, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it takes awhile to believe somebody's changed even though you know you are, at least you and I know it.  So, you're somewhere, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  You're going to have a little bit of that from now on I guess because of your past, I mean not that you killed anybody or anything, but that doesn't change who you are.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you're kind of like the ADD people, attention span people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When I get them on the medicine and they get, you know, more normal, they're going like, geeze, what did I do in the past, I did all these impulsive things and I can't believe the way I was.  You just got to move on. I don't know what else to tell you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know I need to move on but it just, hearing that come out of her mouth was, it's one thing to think maybe people think that, but to hear it verbalized was like whoa.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well that's just because she just always felt what she says.  She means well, she's a good person but-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And your father is a little bit like that himself. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  You know, he'll say boldly in front of anybody that's at the house, are you medicated?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, shit.  Well that too, you got to say, can we keep this a little quiet please?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, as a matter of fact I am and what's this have to do with anything?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I have other people do that.  You know, like same situation that you're married and then something normal goes wrong and you yell at the guy or you have a little PMS and he goes, are you taking your medicine?  I can't stop all of that.  It's not fair.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Other than that everything has been good except last week, I did, I was in a bad dip for three days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you finished going through that box of stuff now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you putting it off?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, good.  [INAUDIBLE] time, whatever you need.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Last week I just, I don't think I had ever really noticed the dips and the highs because I was always so medicated with alcohol, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That, that, well a lot of manic depressives become alcoholics.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So now that I'm not drinking I see them more clearly, and that dip last week was, it was a good one.  I didn't want to get out of bed, I cried all the time.  Thought about, you know, the whole thing how I used to think I could end all this for everybody, I could stop being a burden to everybody.  I can...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That whole horrible thing came back.  And then just like that the next day I'm back to running and feeling fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you just switched.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yep.  It's amazing, isn't it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you think you keep getting more and more energy and need less and less sleep the only recourse we got right now is to use more of that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You could call me though. Matter of fact I'm on...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I'll see you next week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but I'm on call this weekend fortunately, so it wouldn't do you good to call anybody else on the weekend because they wouldn't know where we're at but at least I do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  So this might, if these things start to spread, replace the Lamictal?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Does this have more side effects than the Lamictal?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that's a low dose of it, so I don't expect any problems from it.  Now the Lamictal you just have the one pill that's-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, sir.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We better take it up to two hundred but we better, you have any more twenty fives?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, sir.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We'll have to wait for that I don't have any either. So for about three days add twenty five and then add fifty so...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> By the time you get back here you have two hundred.  I don't think you'll need many of these.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do they make a two hundred?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I think so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I had just filled the one fifty. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you just got them?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, well, there's twenties.  That'll last you awhile.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's good.  Maybe I can get some more samples.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you know how much that is for thirty pills?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ninety bucks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> More than ninety?  How much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A hundred and seventy dollars.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Fuck.  All right, let's see how big a one they make.  That is terrible.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For thirty pills.  Are you kidding me?  I feel better already, I don't-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I called myself an antibiotic in a couple weeks ago and I go in there and get it and I don't have any insurance coverage so the guy says, eighty eight bucks. I said, well did you forget the doctor discount?  He says, that's with the doctor discount.  Yeah, they make a two hundred.  I'll just have to do it this way for now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If it gets too itchy or something you can also take Benadryl, you know, for that.  You know, sometimes that-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I'm hoping it'll work so this stuff doesn't spread, I can handle it here and here, but I couldn't imagine this all over. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, that would be. I've never [INAUDIBLE] rash all over you, say it's like here...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or on your back a little bit or something.  But I don't think that's a rash from drugs.  Think about it, it comes through your blood system so it's all over area.  You know, it doesn't get isolated like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I just wonder if you got it from poison ivy, you hit something, or-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.  Can I still exercise, do I keep exercising?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah. The medicines aren't going to interfere with that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, but I don't want to make myself more-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, you won't.  Nothing like that affects it, I mean it's the balance of something up here, so-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then you get like this huge surge of adrenaline.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you sort of do, yeah.  Like if I had an old man, we'll say, with maybe a heart condition, who was getting like this, doing that shit, yeah, he could kill himself.  He could give himself a heart attack or something.  Because they'll do stuff like, oh it's amazing, I mean the stories I could tell you.  Like this one guy decided all on his own he was going to change all the wiring of his house and he was not an electrician and he just kept doing that day and night and day and night.  Just crazy stuff, see.  So your judgement just becomes, it's gone.  So we do not want that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  My daddy comes home one day and I'm repainting the house!</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, yeah.  Painting your car.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Dad, I decided your Benz doesn't need to be black anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Pink.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Even he said this morning, [PATIENT NAME]. I mean I was too, I was going, going, going, going, I couldn't stop [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have some handouts about this that are pretty good. But I don't know what I did with them, sorry. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I talk faster.  It's hard for me to keep up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You talk faster and you think faster.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  So maybe I better get you in here early next week.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's see, I kept these things here. Nowadays it's just as easy if I give you some [INAUDIBLE] on the Internet, look up the symptom, you'll see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For bipolar too?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, just bipolar.  And in bipolar too, the idea is you mostly get depression, even if you get manicky like this you don't get real out of it.  And usually it doesn't last long.  So that'll be good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right [INAUDIBLE].  I'll make another appointment for...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe like...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Monday or Tuesday or something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We'll still be here the next week.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

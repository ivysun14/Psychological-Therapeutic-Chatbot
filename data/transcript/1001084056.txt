<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, I saw you a month ago, September 19th and at that point your mood was stable and it was good, see I told you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's devastating.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I know, well listen, it's frustrating but we'll get there.  If your brain can get there for a short time, then all we have to do is get you there for a long time, right.  At least you can get there.  It's much more frustrating to not be able to even achieve any level of remission; at least you can get there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But that's always been my problem, I get there but I don't stay there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't stay there, I know.  All right, so you weren't sad, you weren't anxious, you weren't irritable, your heart rate was 100, your appetite was fine, you were not exercising, your sleep was okay, your energy was good, self esteem was okay, you were not suicidal, you were not hopeless or helpless, concentration was good, no manic symptoms at all, we thought that you were doing nicely on your usual cocktail of Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No not - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not Cymbalta, Provigil, Vivactil, Zyprexa, correct?  All right, so tell me the exact doses you've been taking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Lamictal 100mg, Wellbutrin 300, Vivactil 40mg, 2 pills, the 10mg - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Two of the 10</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 20mg and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Zyprexa?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Zyprexa, the Zyprexa had to lower because it was making me too tired so usually 5mg, um, sometimes more if I have a bad day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And how about Provigil?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Two hundred, I couldn't, before I felt like this I thought 200 wasn't even good enough and I couldn't get off of it, now forget it, you know, this is typical, this is what happens to me, it comes with change of season.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So what happens?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sunday I started feeling very tired - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Up until Sunday you were okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I had - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes but it lasted, it only lasted like a day or 2, you know, I got scared - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It lasted only a day or 2, then I was fine, I went right back - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Then you got [INAUDIBLE] again.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Immediately, there was no changing, everything, I was fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So your mood was okay until 2 days ago, 3days ago.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Saturday night it started, Saturday night is when it started.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and what happened?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I started feeling very tired.  I didn't have any desire to do anything, just very tired, I felt like sleeping.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And the last couple of days - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you lost your drive - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your motivation.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right and the last couple of days have just been, the depression, the sadness and the overwhelming, the overwhelming depression has just been awful, I mean just crying a lot and, um, feeling a lot of the feelings I felt before, hopeless and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you anxious?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Today I have terrible anxiety but I didn't take my Zyprexa yesterday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What changed, just the days, the shorter days?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, you know, there are things going on that I think would make anybody depressed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My relationship with [NAME OTHER] is just really, really, really bad and it just, it just kills me. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why, what's going on between you 2?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We just, we just can't, she just doesn't, she just doesn't really want to know from me, she only wants [NAME OTHER], she only wants her father, she doesn't want, she doesn't want to know from me.  Um, I mean I begged her earlier, I was crying, I said, you know, we've got to do something, it can't go on like this.  I said I'm your mother, I love you and also she's not doing well physically, she's having some, she's having a lot of problems, so I'm very worried about her.  They think she may have endometriosis and she's got the PCOS so that's complicating it, so - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the bleeding issue.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I was very worried about her, um, so -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> At least your moods are okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, yeah.  So a lot of this has upset me but it, this has been going on all along and it didn't get me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's right, that's right</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not like it's something out of the blue, it's just that - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For some reason your brain became more vulnerable.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and one of the other things that is really devastating me, that's depressing me, I, I gained so much weight.  I struggled so hard to lose, I finally lost 18 pounds and I think I gained back about, I think I gained 18 and then some.  Nothing fits me, I feel like a balloon, I feel horrible, I can't stand to look at myself and I'm very uncomfortable. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is your appetite very high?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It is, it is but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was having, up until the last couple of days, I was having a lot of trouble falling asleep.  Once I fell asleep, I was okay but I could not fall asleep until like maybe 4:30-5 o'clock in the morning but now - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why not, what was keeping you awake?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just couldn't sleep, not tired.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That was the last month?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's the way it has been all - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Might that have been a little mania?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, I don't know, I don't know, it's not like I didn't need sleep because I would make up for it, I would sleep later.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Were you revved up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, just wasn't tired.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But then you got to sleep and you slept for how long?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I would sleep for 7 hours.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You were.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So a decent night's sleep.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Even though it shifted late.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just the wrong time, right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Were your thoughts racing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Talking too much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh, just couldn't sleep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you cycled out of it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, now the last couple of days, all I, I'm back to like I feel asleep in the car, back to that just exhausting feeling.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think we're not getting much from the Vivactil anymore?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean you have to tell me, is the dosage too low, would I be doing better if it was higher now?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We've got to raise all your meds, you know, we've got to get you back.  We can't let this slip away, we really can't.  Any suicidal thinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I did yesterday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have any plan to hurt yourself?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it wasn't like a plan, it's just that I felt very, I just felt like I didn't, I felt yesterday, I felt like I just didn't want to live.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I feel like I just can't, I cannot keep going through this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you able to concentrate?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm having some trouble there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Spinning your wheels a little bit.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I was having some trouble concentrating like when I'd be watching TV, my mind was wandering but the one thing that has stayed with me that I did not have before was still the, um, ability to function, you know, being fast, where before I was always so slowed down, I still had that part but I'm losing it now because I'm so tired.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now you're slowing down.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right because I'm so tired.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So not enough juice.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I could have slept all day today.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Self esteem is for crap?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, we need a radical surgery, so here's what we've got to do.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What are we going to do about my weight?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, do you want a diet pill?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That would be great.  But when I mentioned Phentermine to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], he said no way because he said my heart rate, my heart rate was too fast.  Would Phentermine make my heart, you know, would it speed it up?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and Topamax never helped?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It did a long time ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The main way to get you to lose weight is to get you off the Zyprexa which we can't really do right now.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You think it's the Zyprexa and not the Vivactil?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You do.  Since I started the Zyprexa, I gained like 22 pounds in a short period of time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think we have to do full court press.  Have you ever been on the MAO inhibitor, Selegiline?  Okay, the type of depression you have right now is called atypical depression, right, it's depression that the key feature is this lack of drive, this lack of juice, no energy, dragging, right, and it comes with this tendency to oversleep, overeat, have very low energy, and be very sensitive to rejection, right, that whole group of symptoms is the atypical symptom.  We suspect that syndrome involves a dysregulation in dopamine and it often is set off by the shorter days, by the way, but it's a dopamine problem.  Most of our drugs are pretty weak with dopamine, however, Wellbutrin has got some dopamine stimulation and so I want to increase that to 450 and one other thing we use sometimes is a stimulant like speed but with your heart rate so fast, we can't really do that, so the other thing that is dopaminergic is the MAO inhibitors.  Now the reason why we don't generally use MAO inhibitors is because of the dietary restrictions and the potentially life threatening interactions, right, and you've been nervous about that in the past.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so normally with you, we tiptoe, you know, tiptoe into that neighborhood.  The newer MAO inhibitor called Selegiline comes as a patch in which you don't have to worry about the dietary restrictions at the low dose, so I think kind of round one, the easy thing to do is start this without the dietary problems.  It's kind of the safe MAO inhibitor.  Now if we have to increase the dose, then we'd have to worry about the diet and then we'd have to have a longer conversation.  For now, for round 1, just slap the patch on, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Read the whole insert; you can learn about it, totally safe, no dietary restrictions, okay, at the low dose, at this dose.  If we have to increase it, you'd have to worry about the diet, at this dose you do not.  The reason why it's worth trying is what if it's the home run medicine, then it's worth being on the diet, you know, and we'll kind of know if it's good for you on this round, okay.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You don't think that raising the Vivactil and Wellbutrin won't help?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We're going to do that too.  We're going to do everything.  Remember, you were just well for a while which for you is so dramatic, so dramatic that you finally got well, that the fact that you were only a few days depressed gives us an opportunity to rush in fast before you get very depressed the way we know you normally would, right, it's early now, we can jump on this fast, so even though normally we don't like to do multiple things at once, in this case, I think we should throw everything at your brain to get you out of this state, do you agree?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I agree, I just, I can't, I'm just very nervous about the MAO inhibitor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, it's your depression.  I mean you could stagger it.  You could first do, you know what, we stopped the Depakote last time, right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think we lost anything off the Depakote?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and you're on 1mg now of the Xanax?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Ah, right, I mean some days I take more, some days I take less.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'd like you to increase the Lamictal also.  Lamictal to 150 for 1 week, then 200, to Wellbutrin 450, Vivactil, now remember you had trouble tolerating Vivactil, if you can tolerate it, I would go to 25, to 30 - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't because they come in - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can't break the, they come in 5's also.  All right, let's just go with 20 to 30 to +/- 40, okay, if you can tolerate it, work your way to 40.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> How long a period of time?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> As long as it takes, you know, it could be a week, it could be a day.  You figure it out, you kind of know.  Go up on the dose, see if you tolerate it, if you are, keep pushing it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The Provigil we're going to maintain 200 and Zyprexa, you know, eventually I'd like to trade Zyprexa for something else that doesn't make you gain weight.  Right now we don't have that luxury.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We have to wait till I feel better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The time to make big change is when you feel better, not when you're this depressed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so Zyprexa you're stuck with and then after you do all that and you still think you need to push, [INAUDIBLE] 6mg per 24 hour patch, okay, learn a little bit about it.  Should I even write the prescription?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> For this you mean?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah or do you think you might not do it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I might not do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, if you need it, I'll write it here and you'll, you'll decide and then we'll go to 200 on the Lamictal, 450 on Wellbutrin, 200 Provigil, maybe to 40 on the Vivactil, and 5 on the Zyprexa.  Do you need prescriptions?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Lamictal, do you want a 200 Lamictal or do you have enough?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, keep it in the 100.  I'm going to be doing the, um, you know, I need a prescription for the 25mg then so I can do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll give you the 25's.  So let me write for the 200's, okay, Lamictal 200 and I'll write for Wellbutrin, 3 of the 150's?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right because that's, right - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Provigil you need?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't think I need - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Vivactil you need at the - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because we're increasing the dosage, yes.  Write, you know, that I'll be taking 40mg so I'll get enough.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And the Zyprexa I still have enough.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the [INAUDIBLE] I won't write.  Do you need Xanax?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh Xanax, yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does it help you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, Xanax definitely helps me, I mean it's just I know that difference at times I need the Zyprexa but the Xanax does help.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll write that you take 5 a day, okay, just so you get a lot of them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  If my heart rate wasn't high, what could I, what could I take.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Phentermine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I spoke with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], right; did he put you on the beta blocker?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He gave, you know, he gave me a sample of it but what I, what I really would like to do, I didn't take the medicine, I'd like to see a cardiologist because I don't feel that my heart rate is high, I don't feel it, I feel fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It is high.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I mean you're not getting symptoms of it but heart rate being high is an objective fact.  Your heart rate runs at about 100, you don't have symptoms of it, which is very good.  If you were getting short of breath or faint then we'd, then we'd worry more.  You just don't, you know, the normal is 72 plus or minus 20, so normal runs between 50 and 90.  You're just a little above the high end of normal.  It's not dangerous.  We just don't like seeing it that high.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
Dr: It's almost certainly my meds.  I mean it's probably the Vivactil.  It's not dangerous; don't worry about it, as long as your thyroid is fine, I mean I wouldn't worry much about it.  You can see a cardiologist.  I mean those are the experts.  
<p><b>PT:</b> And if we're going to be raising the Vivactil, it's only going to get worse.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It might but let's hope for the best.  Don't, don't give me trouble, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just like your daughter, you know, the medical stuff had to interact with, you know</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't to get [INAUDIBLE] because if it wasn't for the heart rate then I could take the medicine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well but the key maneuver in getting you to lose weight would be getting you off the Zyprexa.  It will melt away, I promise, it will melt away.  I promise, it always does.  I do this all the time.  People gain a ton on Zyprexa and then they lose it as soon as we take them off but you have to meet me half way, you have to get better.  You get better, it's the first thing I'll do.  I mean I might not take it away right away but we'll try to switch it for something else similar.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like what?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Geodon.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't take Geodon.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, not Geodon, I mean something in that class.  [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's your age?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Fifty three.  Do you think it's worth a try, that I should try the Topamax again and see if it helps.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You had memory problems, even at the low dose, even at the tiny dose.  I know it's frustrating to have gained all this weight.  I have to, we have to have priorities though and I mean 3 or 4 days, why did you have to crash, you know.  If you would have come in here last week, we would have done everything you're saying, we would have started bringing you off the Zyprexa and, you know, started moving, but now you crashed and now all bets are off, we have to get your brain back. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, it's not even like a slow thing, it's like a switch is pulled.  I just go down, it's not even, you know, a slow, I plunge right down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it's not even bipolar, I mean you weren't manic - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You were normal</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Why does that happen?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's like migraines or seizures, it's what we call paroxysmal neurologic events, it just boom, like a seizure, it's like saying why does a seizure happen and why does a migraine happen.  Migraines happen, there may be stimuli, blah, blah, blah, but we don't really know, we just know that they happen, right, people just get into those states.  Your husband just came.  I hope he's not expecting us to, [INAUDIBLE] or not?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, he doesn't.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Hey, how have you been?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We missed you, we just finished.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> All right.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds like, you probably didn't want to hear all this anyway.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let me summarize for you, you did pretty well until about 4 or 5 days ago and then she crashed.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But let's all agree, she had a good run, she had a good run for her, given how sick she's been over all these years, let's focus on how well she did and the fact that her brain can get there is so important for us to know and to recognize.  Brains that can't get, I mean you were probably starting to feel like she could never be well again but now we know you can be well, you can, all we have to do is keep you there, so because it's so early in her relapse, right, it's only 4 or 5 days that she's crashed</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm proposing an extremely aggressive treatment plan that we virtually increase everything and throw the kitchen sink at her brain so she can, so we can get her better before she really - </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hits the bottom.  We recognized that the weight gain is frustrating, bad for self esteem, blah, blah, blah, but it probably doesn't have much to do with this brain illness.  We've got to get this brain illness better separate from anything to do with the weight gain and then, at some point, maybe alter things - </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Of course.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Absolutely and the weight will melt away when we get her off the Zyprexa, almost certain, the weight will melt away and we will get her off the Zyprexa but because she crashed, we don't have that luxury right now, so we've increased the Lamictal, we're going to increase the Wellbutrin and increase the Vivactil and what I'd like to do is start an MAO inhibitor that doesn't have the dietary restrictions, it's a patch, Selegiline patch.  She's a bit reluctant and so I think you're probably going to wait a little bit after, you know, to see whether these other increases are doing anything before going to this.  You could do it all at the same time, just - </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And the MAO inhibitor with the patch is like safe, it's not any more dangerous than any of the other drugs?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She's reluctant I guess because - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's no more dangerous.  There's no dietary restriction and I'm even putting it on board with other medicines that we wouldn't really use it with if it weren't the patch.  You know, the Wellbutrin we can use with a MAO inhibitor.  Vivactil, you're allowed to but usually we don't.  In this case, it's okay, in this case it's okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But it's okay if she doesn't start the patch immediately and try all the other drugs.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, try everything, because there's some chance or a decent chance that she won't be able to get up on the Vivactil, right, because there was a struggle getting her to even this dose.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I had a lot of anxiety.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, so she may not, but if it's looking like that's not working, I would go to this MAO inhibitor patch.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And keep everything else the same and just add this on to it.  Are there any, you know, over the counter drugs or anything I should know that you cannot take this with?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, but try to avoid over the counter drugs anyway and when it says on the label do not take this if you're taking MAO inhibitor, try to avoid it or call me.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, just don't take it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The problem would be if this starts working but no well enough, the higher doses of this require the diet but let's, let's do first things first, start with this dose and see how you do.   The reason we're pushing this and the higher dose of Wellbutrin is because the nature of the depression has very atypical features, the overeating, oversleeping, low energy, very dragging, unmotivated depression.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Is the weather change a factor in this too?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The shorter days, absolutely, in fact, I forgot to mention this, you should consider a light box.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We have a light box.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We have it.  It never did much for me though, I used to use it - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you been using it?  Use it now, 30 minutes a day, it has to be morning, it can't be after 9 a.m., okay, and it's been studied, it has to be morning light.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and that should, you know, you have bad luck if that doesn't work because often if you're seasonal, the light box will help quite dramatically.  </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She's afraid also that it would make her manic but you don't think that's - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It can, but it won't.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It used to but I wasn't on the Zyprexa then.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When it used to make me manic.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It used to rev you up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It means your brain responds to light, that's great, that's good news.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How long did you use it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A half an hour.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A half an hour, well, start out with 15 minutes and then work your way up to a half an hour, okay.  It's another drug, consider it another drug.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean and it could be these last few days, it could be the shorter days, you know, and this is when it happens.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, right, this is difficult for me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is when it happens.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is difficult and I understand, you know, that I can't go off the Zyprexa but when, you know, you're saying it's going to melt off but, you know, but I could put on another 20 pounds.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, you won't.  People usually plateau, they put on what they're going to put on and then they just plateau.  Hopefully, this is the Zyprexa weight and you're finished.  It's very frustrating but let's not forget, you had a good run, you had a good couple months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, I mean that's what, this is so devastating to me because I got a chance to see what it was like to be normal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then to just crash like this, this is just horrible.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is how it goes, this is par for the course.  We'll get you out of this.  I've seen people far sicker than you get better, okay, you'll get better.  All right, let me see you again, let me hear from you regularly, like once a week.  Just give me a message on the message, how you're doing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And let me see you again in 2 months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think I already made an appointment with you</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For a month?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I mean I've given you so many things to do, we've got to give it a chance to work.  I don't want to make a lot of changes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I'm not a big fan of changes, I'm not a big fan of on the phone saying increase that, increase that -  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This is the plan, we've got to put your head down and just do it - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And deal with it and then we'll work our way from there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If I see with the Vivactil that I'm getting a lot of anxiety, should I try to stick with it and add more Xanax to it or - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You could, you could, I mean decide yourself.  If it's if it's something you think you can get through with the Xanax, because last time we did it, you managed it and it really worked eventually.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When you barreled through the anxiety.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I separated the dosage, that's when it, you know - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you may have to do that too, just play with the options till you get it right, okay.  I'll see you in either 1 month or 2.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What were [INAUDIBLE]?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I asked [NAME OTHER] today, do you know if [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is okay and if she's still practicing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You don't [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], she's not seeing you anymore.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, she's not but she tried to call</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He hasn't called her back.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The only [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] got to me through some other way, I happen to know</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Some other doctor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, I happen to know [NAME OTHER] because we trained at [DEIDENTIFIED] together but I didn't, she's not in my [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, all right, thank you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Bye bye.</p>

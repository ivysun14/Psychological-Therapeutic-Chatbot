<p>PATIENT:   (Sniff, Silence) I was just thinking about the fact that, uh, well, when I realized I was feeling this way, it was Sunday or Saturday night.  I felt extremely resentful about the baby, and trapped.  And (Sniff) uhm, we ate late Saturday night, and I thought this was the reason I couldn't sleep.  But, uh, uh, now when I think about it, it seems like I didn't want to sleep Saturday night.  So, I don't know when I finally did go to sleep, but it must have been around 5 o'clock in the morning, or something.  I mean it was, I didn't get very much at all.  And then Sunday, I was still feeling that way and I could have taken a nap.  But I wanted to lie down, but on the other hand I still had that feeling that I almost wanted to keep myself awake. </p>

<p>And, I don't know, first I, I, until right now, I was thinking I was feeling resentful because I wasn't sleeping and I was feeling awkward and tired.  We went shopping on Saturday, and I, I felt tired after doing about the first thing that we were going to do.  And that was sort of discouraging.  And, uhm, I don't know, now I just sort of wonder if, well, I was thinking about, I think it was around Friday I was talking about my father and how he used to hide in the bathroom or in the closet, and my curiosity about his penis, and all.  And I, I don't know, I just wonder if there's a connection.  (Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>I don't kn—, I'm asking myself what, if, if I think there's a connection, what it would be.  And (Clears throat), I'm just not sure, except the idea occurs to me that it might have something to do with feeling that I wanted the baby to be the answer to something that I'm also feeling it's not going to be the answer for.  Or except, except that, the way I remember feeling especially Sunday morning was, not so much just sort of resenting being pregnant at this last point and wishing the baby would be born, as much as just wishing the baby didn't exist, and going back to before I was pregnant.  So that feeling of being trapped was, I mean, sort of literal right now, in that, there are things I can't do because I am pregnant.  And then, just a sense of how my life will change and not thinking anything nice about it changing, just feeling trapped and, and having a responsibility, I guess.  (Sigh, Pause, Sigh, Silence)</p>

<p>Mm, I just began thinking about (Sniff) another (Clears throat) apartment b—, I think I mentioned that we were going to go see it at some point.  And, I don't remember, it's in the same building that had, had the legal suit. And, uhm, there was a question whether it would go co-op.  And (Clears throat) we'd heard about this through friends of the BFM.  And it appeared, it appears, I don't know, the woman hasn't told us exactly what she wants for it.  But uhm, when we heard about it, this woman who owns it, or will own it, was planning not to ask too much for it.  So it sounded like something that would be very, not, a good deal for us.  And uhm, then we wouldn't be stretching ourselves so much. </p>

<p>We went to see it yesterday, a—, b—, well I was thinking that uhm, yesterday I, I felt sort of strange, anyway, not having slept very much at all.  And I, I, I didn't really feel very alert.  But now when I think about it, I think anyway, my reaction to the apartment was rather passive.  Because if I, if I'm actively thinking about, there are things I don't like about it.  And then there are some things that I do.  And I just (Clears throat), I don't know, I don't know if I feel I know how to balance them.  And so I'm sort of deciding that everything has to rest on how much she asks for it.  And if she's asking enough so it isn't really a good bargain for us, then we should go ahead with the other one that we were considering in the other building.  It's bigger and will be more expensive. </p>

<p>And I, th—, th—, but I, I, I've had a feeling, and I think maybe I've even talked about it here.  I can't remember.  But, I've had a feeling that there's something, I'm putting something into this apartment question, still, that, a feeling or reaction that belongs somewhere else.  And, I don't know, just the fact I think about it, after thinking about the way I felt yesterday.  And I was busy resenting the baby and putting all my emotions into that, so then the apartment itself wasn't so important anymore.  But then today, I had a good sleep last night and I woke up feeling good, and I woke up feeling much more, sort of intense about which apartment should we take.  And the fact that I don't feel a hundred percent on either of them, and getting all sort of caught up in that question again, which is the usual way I am.  (Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I just (Clears throat) thought of the fact that, again, although I know it has been sort of in the back of my mind this weekend; that you told me about cancelling several times.  And now I'm just wondering if, I don't know, almost the feeling I had over the weekend, and why I was feeling so strongly about wishing I weren't pregnant and that there wasn't a baby coming along, and all.  Almost as if well, the baby hasn't done what it was supposed to do, because you're cancelling still.  So it would be better not to have it, or something like that. </p>

<p>Because I remember when you told me you were cancelling, my reaction mainly was just simply thinking, well I might not be here, too.  And, uhm, I really didn't let myself feel anything else.  (Clears throat, 2-minute silence, Clears throat, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, first I thought, was thinking this didn't seem very significant.  But now I wonder, too, because I was, I just started thinking about well, first uhm, that often when I've come in here and after I first, uh, lain (sic) down, the baby's been quite active.  And this time, I don't remember, but it doesn't seem that the baby's been as active.  And somebody has been telling me, lately that, I think FNI or somebody, that the baby's quiet a day or two before you go into labor.  And, I mean generally, I haven't noticed too much difference. </p>

<p>But it just, I just started thinking about it.  And then, I went right from that to thinking about uhm, the fact that my mother's going to be away this well, from Wednesday to Sunday of this coming week in PTN.  (Clears throat)  So, if I went into labor and got out of the hospital before the weekend was over, I was just thinking well, maybe she'd stay in PTN until the weekend was over, and then come down.  Which would leave MSCZ and me a little time alone, first.  And I don't know, I was feeling very much being alone with MSCZ and having the baby, the three of us together first, as if that were important.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You said first what you just said didn't seem significant, and then now it's different?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Interrupts) Yeah, well, I don't know why it —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupts) What —</p>

<p>PATIENT:   — s_ seems so, I don't know, just, I mean, I'm thinking well, that's a, would be a normal feeling.  But uh, just in terms of, I don't know, someh—, it's my mother who's coming and sort of will be a well, in this case a fourth person, or in a way really, a third person.  And I think I have mixed feelings about her coming, which I haven't really faced too much.  And uhm, I don't know, somehow I think, I feel of her as intruding.  And just the fact that I well, I don't know, But I associate, somehow it's important because I was thinking about your cancelling, and the fact I wondered if that has anything to do with my feeling resentful of the baby.  And then thinking about my father.  And then I think of this particular aspect of having a baby, of the fact my mother will be coming down.  It just somehow — and the fact that I would just as soon maybe that it work out she can't come for the first day or two after I'm home.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And, uh, I don't know, MSCZ's every once in a while wondered, I don't know how long she plans to stay because she never really has said, but he's been sort of worried that, I mean there are some things she could do that, if she were younger, that I don't think I'd want to ask her to do.  And uhm, so that in a way there really may not be that much for her to do.  I mean, there will be some things that will be very helpful to me, but she won't be that busy.  And he's been worried that it'll be sort of a bore for her. </p>

<p>And I, I don't know, it just seems like the way I've been thinking about it is, that sort of the baby and I will be off somewhere, although there's no place to be off to in our apartment.  Uhm, but anyway, ah, just sort of my mother will be taking care of herself.  And every once in a while I kind of get apprehensive that well, it's not quite that she'd try to take over, because I'm always thinking well, this baby is mine, not hers.  And I think she'd honor that, even though she might have other inclinations, she would still sort of control herself on some things, if she felt I was determined to do it one way and she didn't agree.  But, I don't know, it's almost as if I don't imagine there will be any real connection between us.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I guess it, what it is, is really, I mean if there is a connection, I'm still feeling very much that it's MSCZ, me and the baby, and she's very much an outside person.  Or a third person, in the sense of MSCZ and I being together and, because of the baby or around the baby.  And then somehow she's there, but excluded in a way.  (Pause) And, knowing how I felt about her and my father, it seems almost like I'm enjoying that thought, because of, sort of, well, now she'll be in the position I always felt in. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Maybe even more specifically and in particular, when she brought FNA home, and MLWZ home.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Yeah, especially MLWZ.  Oh I mean, probably FNA too, though I still just don't remember.  (Pause) But what comes to my mind immediately in connection with MLWZ, is uhm, that incident, I don't know if I'd been told that she was pregnant.  I think I've already been through this here, but uhm, when I hit her in the stomach, and I, I think now my es—, understanding is she was pregnant when I hit her.  Although I,  as a little girl I'm not sure I had fully realized it.  And then, she went into the b—, she didn't do anything to me.  There was no communication between the two of us.  She didn't handle my hitting her.  She went into the bedroom, her bedroom, and I don't know if my father were already home or he came home shortly afterwards, but uhm, he went into the bedroom and there they are in there together, and then, I'm outside.  And then he came out and beat me up.  I mean, it was more than just spanking me, it was really he wa—, he was just sort of out of his mind for a minute.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And of course, the ending of it was he shut me in my bedroom closet.  And I'm not sure, what must have seemed worse to me, being beaten when he was sort of really wild or being shut up in the closet.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I think at the time it made me feel very defiant.  Because I didn't feel, I mean, I didn't understand what I had done, really.  And I think I realized I'd hit her harder than I should've.  And I, I'm not sure, I mean, when I hit her, I meant to hit her hard.  But afterwards, I think my feeling was, I shouldn't have hit her so hard. And I knew I had hit her too hard.  But other than that, I didn't feel what I'd done was of such a magnitude that my father should have reacted the way he did.  And I, I'd, I think I felt very angry and defiant when he reacted that way and — in favor of my mother.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Funny, I was just thinking that's the first time that I recall, uhm, well, I think I must have been feeling really resentful toward my father then, and uhm, obviously I was toward my mother when I hit her.  But it seems like it was the first time I felt that way toward my father and it must have been shortly after we'd moved to the house, right before MLWZ was born.  And uhm, it seems like it was the first time that I'm aware of, I don't know, I was thinking, trying to think back to the house we lived in before and what I remembered, but of being excluded, and my parents being very much together.  Because I have no memory of their room in the other house In any way like I do when we moved.  And their room was right across the hall from the room FYC and I shared.  But If I remember anything, I remember being able to go in it.  I don't remember a closed door, and not feeling I could go in.  (Clears throat)</p>

<p>And I was also just wondering, although I must have had feelings when FNA was born.  I just,  don't seem to recall them, but she was — I mean, the house was not very big, but my parents' room and FYC's and my room were opposite each other at one end of the hall.  And FNA's room was down at the other end, and I think there was a maid's room and a guest room.  And they had a room that, I think, I don't remember now exactly, I think maybe later it was changed into a bathroom.  And I don't know where FNA was.  But for awhile, it was a very small room that was used for her room.  But she was sort of off down the other end, not — in a way.  I, the way I remember the hall, it seems like it was a long hall, though I know it wasn't at all.  And so it was as if we were all together as a family, the 4 of us down at one end, and she was way off down at the other.  And therefore, excluded to an extent.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You notice that y_ you uhm, started off thinking about the way you felt yesterday, being angry that you're pregnant and angry at the baby.  And then, now you're thinking about how you're recalling the time when you were angry at your mother.  At least you hit her, and uh, clearly they reacted as though you had hurt her.  Your father was very angry, and you got angry and defiant with him.  Did you want to hit the baby yesterday, hurt it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   I think I did, yeah.  Because I, I remember it was one point feeling very much that — I'm not sure if the baby were kicking me any different than it, differently than it has been.  But, just began to feel the baby's really hurting me and feeling angry, partly, I mean, angry, anyway, and then angry because the baby was hurting me.  And, uhm, feeling — I've gotten stretch marks on the underside of my stomach — and uh, feeling angry because of that.  And I felt as if I could almost feel the skin stretching.  And then, I think I almost had that, I think I had the feeling I had one time when I was first pregnant, of wanting, just sort of to hit my stomach.  And really to be hitting the baby, not me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I don't know if it's part of an old feeling, or just a natural reaction (Sigh), when it's going to be my own child, and I'm feeling that way.  But I felt, I know I felt very guilty, too.  (Pause) Because it seemed to me, it was well, it was such a strong feeling.  It was way more than just sort of resenting something that was about to change my life, and I wasn't sure how it was going to change it.  And I wasn't thinking about the positive side of things, either.  It seemed, I mean, because I really did want to hurt the baby then. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   You thought of my cancelling in this connection.  You said you thought there was some connection.  Like the baby didn't serve it's purpose enough. What, what is it's purpose for me and you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause) Well, I, I mean I think of it 2 ways.  Because when I said that, I was thinking of it as its purpose was to sort of keep you with me and to exclude other people.  And, and I think of that incident again, when I hit my mother.  And I just, I don't know what I know about it, except I feel sure that if she hadn't been pregnant — I just feel sure she was — and if she hadn't been that she probably would have handled it, and my father might not have even known about it.  But, but this being pregnant pulled them together in such a way that he reacted as he did.  And he — danger to her from the outside, and I was very much on the outside.  And so, I guess, but I mean, it's more than thinking it would make you protective.  It would be, you would then exclude everybody else, or something like that.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I, I was just thinking about the fact that, (Sigh) uhm, I'm re—, I re—, I keep recalling that incident so vividly of when my father punished me for hitting my mother,  And then the fact that over the weekend I was feeling I wanted to hit the baby, and was feeling so resentful and, I don't know, just wondering, even if I were thinking the baby hadn't served its purpose with you, how I could feel the same way that I did about my parents and, and the baby that was excluding me.  (Sigh) I don't know, and then it just seemed to me that somehow it's a feeling of, if there's a potential baby there and something's gone wrong, that's what I blame.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I began to think about, uhm, uh, uh, "Love Story", the bestseller I've been curious to read for a long time.  And I finally just read it over the weekend.  And, I don't know, I think I was thinking about it in terms of being sort of — oh, maybe in a way, envious of the girl, even though she does die.  But well, or at least wanting to have whatever the potential that she had, to establish a relationship that was so strong.  Well, she did with her husband. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

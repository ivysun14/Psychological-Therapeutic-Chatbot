<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how you been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Have a good trip to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it was great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, good, you had good weather?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was beautiful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [DEIDENTIFIED] was, I don't know, right around 90—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then we went down the coast to [DEIDENTIFIED] and, uh, I could live there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a nice place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Live at the beach, I could just, I could just park it right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] have an office down there in [DEIDENTIFIED] do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right now, we've got [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], um, [DEIDENTIFIED] and yours truly so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not even close, unfortunately.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm pretty good right here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably, yeah.  So how have things been going since you got back?  Everything going okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is, it's going good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, uh, I'm off of my performance plan at work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so that's a good thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Did they have like a formal review to sit down and talk to you and they said everything is fine—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're doing great, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was official, so it went through HR and now it's officially, um, over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a relief, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, that's, that's, uh, while it doesn't change anything, it's just a weight off my shoulders.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and I think it may change something in the sense that what I've seen is companies have a tendency to use that against people whether they're supposed to or not something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If there's a lay off, they'll look at people and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Get rid of people on performance plans or whatever—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know and that can still be the case, you know, really once you have that, um, it's, it's kind of permanent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In 10 years, perhaps not, but in the next couple, you know, and it is what it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you just have to be kind of careful then at work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I recognize the reason—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't blame them for doing it, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We reap what we sow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it sounds like things are going better though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they are.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Things are going good with the kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, they're—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Settled into school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They are and they're kind of coming around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] is starting to ask some questions that I figured he would at some point.  I didn't think it would be this early but, um, you know, [NAME OTHER] is having a tough time not belittling me in front of them and I continue to suggest but it's such a slippery slope of accusation versus suggestion—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I decided and this has been the past couple months, I guess, just going with actions and not words—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is your divorce finalized, I can't remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So hopefully then there'll be some healing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And moving on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And think that's happening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do, I think, um, it's getting better but [NAME OTHER], he, he's come to me, oh, he comes to me often with it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And says, uh, well mommy says this but I see this, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She says you're a such and such but yet that's not what I see and, you know, I respond to him with mommy has her opinion on things.  I said, uh, you know, and whether she shares that or not, it may or may not be appropriate but what it comes down to [NAME OTHER] is you just go with your heart and what you believe and you'll be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And kids make up their own minds over time.  When they're young, they're impressionable and parents do tend to put them in the middle, they don't, it's not comfortable for them but over time they tend to see what's going on and also they don't pick sides, I mean kids don't want to pick sides, they want to love both their parents.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's, you know, I think, like with [NAME OTHER], he's having a tough time with it because when she bashes me, he does take her side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I've got enough confidence now in what I'm doing that I just let it go.  I don't defend myself, I don't have to and my defense is through continuing stable consistent life.  When they are with me, it's the same and it's the way it's supposed to be, in my opinion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What I believe in and it seems to be working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've got some happy kids so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In fact, they're starting to defend their, um, potential step siblings, it's pretty funny.  Last night [NAME OTHER] got in trouble by, from [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] got pissed at [NAME OTHER]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] said you don't talk to her like that.  [NAME OTHER] says oh yes I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm the mother.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But you know what, it was cute to see him defend her, that enemy that once were.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're now seeing the, um, the unbiased truth—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of what's real versus what mommy has been saying, you know, whatever, she's going to do what she's going to do and I've finally been able to act like I've been feeling all along.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm finally to a place where I don't react when I hear these things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I just, not that I don't react inside—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't say anything and I just say, oh, okay, well, what would you like me to do, what can I offer you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's going good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Well and I'm thinking [PATIENT NAME] too about the research they've done with blending families, I can't remember if we talked about this, but they used to say that it took about 3 years to blend a family, now they're saying it's more like 6 or 7—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what that, what I mean by that is the research shows that people continue to kind of work and shift and blend over the years and so, hopefully, there'll be some continued healing and kind of blending over the years with the kids.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now, and I don't know if you know this but in that, did they find a difference in age?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know, I don't know if that took into account the age of the children.  I would expect it does make a difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because my little one, [NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And her little one, [NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Are the best friends on the earth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll bet, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean they are inseparable—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it is the cutest, coolest thing, I mean they just, and they compliment each other very well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, so I wonder if, you know, [NAME OTHER] has had probably, I wouldn't say the hardest time because he's starting to get into the free thinking age.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old is he now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He'll be [AGE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, [NAME OTHER] is the one that's tough, he's [AGE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he is, he is smack dab in the middle of, um, all I have are my parents who tell me these things and it doesn't make sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so I just, with him, it's do the course is my only answer and show him what's right and not tell him but show him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think you're right, I think it's the best approach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know it's going to be slow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's, yeah, it'll take years again but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he's one of those that I may lose till adulthood.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes it's not until kids get out on their own that they can kind of see the whole picture, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's a risk I took, um, and I'm willing to continue that risk because A, there's no choice but B, even if there was I, I wouldn't trade that for the peace that I have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good, yeah, you can just, we just have to make the best decisions we can in life and try to live with them and move forward.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is, I mean it's a lesser of evils is all it is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, nothing is perfect is it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We just try to find it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't expect it to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't know what that meant—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, the feelings that I have are—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My dad told me I'd feel them but I didn't know what he meant—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And now I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The pain of not having my kids every day is permanent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't go away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It never will and so that's something you live with and that humility makes you stronger in ways.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's the only hope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and your mood has been holding up okay, you're not getting depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have, I don't know if you have any other experience but it sure seems like the generic Lamictal doesn't work as well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I've heard, I'm just starting to hear from people, um, just actually yesterday someone told me the same thing and they wanted to go back to brand name because they weren't, weren't feeling the same on the generic, so it's pretty new still so I don't have a lot of experience in it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm switching back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I've got an article on my bulletin board out here about the fact that the FDA is looking at generics because there have been so many complaints that they don't work the same as the brand name and for some people, especially with antidepressants and mood stabilizers, it can make a huge difference for people and how they feel, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It took me, I mean we went to it the first time it was available and I noticed it right away but I thought, well let's not, let's not have the placebo effect or whatever—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I don't want to, I want to give it some time, so I've had what, 3 months on it, 2 months on it, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The generic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The day it came out was the day I got it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, just ironically the way it timed but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so 2 or 3 months and now my next script I think is in a week or so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're going to switch back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm going back—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'll pay the 70 bucks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, it's worth it for your piece of mind, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, I mean it just really doesn't seem to, you know, the combination of the Lamictal and Adderall—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Chemically or whatever, that combination is what is key for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the, what I noticed is the change in Lamictal changed the way Adderall worked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry, the change, say that again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The, by going to the generic—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It changed the way the Adderall works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Now are you using the generic Adderall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you've been on that for a long time so that's consistent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I have and, um, a while back I got it at Walgreen's instead of King Supers—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they have a different generic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's different too, so, you know, I'm going to go to brand with everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've decided, in fact, today I'm going to call King Supers and have them order in my Adderall for Friday so that they'll have, because nobody keeps that brand and, um, and I'm just going to go back to brands on everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The money savings on those 2 particular, now the others I have, everything I have has generic available.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the Zoloft does—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Clonazepam is generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And those are all fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they're all generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But you know what, the only one I ever had, well no, the Zoloft and Effexor both were, were brand when I started them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  So you're going to switch just with the Lamictal and the Adderall back to brand names.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just those 2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the Adderall isn't that much different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Lamictal is over twice but who cares, I mean I noticed it doesn't, I've just been lower.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just in general lower—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And more, a lot more like a rapid cycle—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Throughout the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I call it moody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which I have for many many years until I started Lamictal and understood what the difference between moody and a rapid cycle is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, so, but I'm certain that's what it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, now are you sleeping okay at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not as good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's the other thing is the Lamictal has a sleepiness, whatever you want to call it, factor to it and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it more, are you having trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep with the generic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, staying asleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, how's your appetite been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I've had less of an appetite.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you know how much you're weighing these days [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About 210.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and how tall are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	5'8"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so is that weight pretty stable, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Always been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it shouldn't be but it's high for me but it's been that way for a couple of years now so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just, it's one of those where it's on the priority list, it's just low down here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What about concentration and focus, you doing okay at work or is it difficult?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, um, any excessive worrying or anxiety about things, is it more than you'd expect?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay and it sounds like you're getting enjoyment out of things, like you went to [DEIDENTIFIED], you're hanging out with the boys, you have a good time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, so no suicidal thoughts then I assume?  Good, okay, okay good, any side effects other than what you've already told me about the problems with medication, any other possible problems with medications.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've noticed that, um, since I switched to generic and I don't know that all these are related, I don't, and when I switch back, I'll be able to tell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly, that's how you find out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I seem a lot more short tempered.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, you know, really my life hasn't changed, I don't have any reason to be because I thought this through, because I don't like it, and I just, I get angrier about things quicker and more angry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, huh, well I think definitely it's worth trying going back to brand name and just see how much benefit that gives you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's the only way to find out really.  You know, and what they've said is when, after they looked at generics, they said they meet the FDA guidelines but those guidelines say that the generics can be within 80 to 125% percent of the same potency as the brand name—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So there's a 45 point spread in there which is a significant difference when you think about it.  I mean it could be, uh, just potency wise it could be a lot different, um, and then also they found that sometimes the release isn't the same, like for example, some of the delayed release medications that are spread out over 12 hours, with the generics they're spread out over 3 hours, so you don't get the same coverage throughout the day too, so I think it's worth trying the brand name to see how much better you feel.  It may take a month or so to really get a sense of the difference —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just because things happen from day to day or week to week that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	May effect how you feel too but I think over the course of a month, you'll be able to look back and say either yes, I'm feeling better or no, I'm not feeling any different—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Compared to when I was on the generic, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, my girlfriend [NAME OTHER], she takes it too and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And only about a week ago we figured this out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because she's been having some troubles to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Moods and then she, ironically enough, one of her friends who takes it also said, yeah, you know, just in passing, said hey I switched to the generic and my doc told me or she read something that her doc showed her, gave her, about, um, this particular article said if want it to work the same, you need to take twice as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm like, well, um, I don't know about all that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll just go back to the regular one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that's a better choice for a lot of reasons.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, yeah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Try to remember that when somebody else is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you never know if you start doubling doses what you're getting.  That's the problem with generics, I mean they're supposed to be the same, you're supposed to be able to switch back and forth without any, any noticeable difference but it just doesn't always work so, um, okay, well good, well we'll get, so we'll give the brand name a try, the Adderall, uh, we'll give the brand name a try on that.  Let me get you a prescription for that one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been doing good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been doing good on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I said, the Lamictal, and once, once I kind of came to this, I realized it all, because after the initial, oh, that's all in your head, which is it, right, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's still real.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, um, I kind of just put it away, you know, and didn't really pay much attention so, like I said, a couple weeks ago, a couple weeks when we came to this epiphany, like uh—huh, that makes sense and, um, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  Now [PATIENT NAME] do you want, excuse me, do you want me to write the one just for today or do you want me to give you one for next month also, what's your preference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, probably next, next month will be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I said, I've actually washed one and it was fine, did I tell you that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You lost one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Washed it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, washed it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the washing machine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, you did tell me that, I remember now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And something with that paper, the way it worked with the pen, it was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I took it to [NAME OTHER] [DEIDENTIFIED], he's like well this is perfectly legible, the edges are kind of tattered, I thought, well okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's pretty good.  Yeah, as long as it holds together.  So do you have any other trips planned or anything fun coming up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really, I'm kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Going to settle in the groove of school and all now and working.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't like this time of year.  [NAME OTHER] says, you know, it's the evolving of the next season and I say oh well, in my opinion everything is dying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what fall is.  Not that I have a negative spin on life anyway but I don't care for fall because I love summer and I hate to see it go away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, let me see here, 28 days from now, make sure we put the right date on here, so, 1, 3, 4, so it would be [DATE].  Okay, good, and you're okay with refills on the other meds, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, good, well, yeah, I'll be real interested to talk to you in a month and see what you think—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	After switching back, to see if you can tell there's a difference.  Okay, so these are identical except one says don't fill till next month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, anything else you can think of before we set up another appointment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, um, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That'll do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to check back in a month or do you want to give it 2 months, what do you feel comfortable with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, um, what I was thinking is why don't, why don't we do it after the, you know, the last week before this one is ready.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The last week before that one is ready?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before this, before this one is over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so before you run out, I got you, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So like 4 weeks after that one, so that'd be 1, 2, 3, 4, that's going to be right around [DATE] or thereabouts or a little early, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wednesday or Thursday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, Wednesday or Thursday, lunch hour again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that works good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually, Thursday is not great for lunch hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, well, we've got Wednesday [DATE], do you want to do 12 or 12:30?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, 12 is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you want a card too [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I switched carriers and [INAUDIBLE] this time completely, I didn't get anything off of it, so it's [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I just see a note here that I had from [NAME OTHER] , did she ever get in touch with you about setting up some kind of payment plan?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do, I have a letter, um, and I've got an idea so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just need to let her—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, if you want to just talk to her.  She has leeway, she takes care of all the billing so, you know, if you can just call her and set up whatever works for you, she'll set it up with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I need to get, there's a couple of things I've got to get, this bill is one of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Get moving on them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, well if you have any questions or any problems before next time, give me a call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hopefully, things will be getting smoother.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm curious to see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I am too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but like I said, it's not dramatic, it's not like a huge, um, you know, deal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I mean I would say the plus or minus 20%—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, 15% versus 50% or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Major change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But enough to be noticeable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I was going to say, if it was enough to feel a difference, then it's enough, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We'll see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we'll see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Spend the 70, who cares if it works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you feel better, it's probably worth it.  Okay, I want to shake your hand today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, I sure can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take care of yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right, you too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, thanks, bye bye.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how have you been?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not too bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not too bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not as good as I'd like.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well and you know [NAME OTHER], my husband</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's like don't change anything, don't change anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because he thinks things are going so well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I don't think it's so much that.  He does, I mean we talked about this at great length over the last couple of days, it's not so much that but every time we tried to change the medicine, it just like, you know, it usually is not good results but I think, honestly, I don't think I always tried the medicine for a long enough period of time to really know for sure if it's helping.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you know, I do a lot of research on bipolar and stuff and I know my condition is relatively mild but when it's bothering me, it really bothers me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And this last month, I had a pretty hard time but then I had a period which I haven't had since March.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it could be hormones too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It could.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The weather messes me up and then I read something that bipolar, you tend to have more problems with mania and hypomania in the spring and summer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Usually true. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'm like, you know, okay, well weather wise it's still technically summer even through it's September so, you know, I know that could be a big part of it and last year, just with that small dose of Lexapro, I did really good in the winter with my light.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I never went into the winter depression, whereas the year before when I was on nothing, I couldn't even get out of it and this last year, I never went into the winter depression and I very rarely ever have problems with depression and when I do, I would have to say at least half the time, if not way higher, it's like yesterday I had a bad migraine and wound up missing the whole day of work which is pretty unusual.  When I have a migraine, I usually only miss a couple of hours and I'm there by lunchtime at the latest.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But sometimes I get one that the medicine just doesn't cut it and that's what happened yesterday and then either later that day, if I make it to work later that day, or the next day, I'll be like really weepy and just really emotional and I think it's just kind of a hangover effect from either the migraine or the meds or both but I definitely, there's definitely a connection between the migraines and the mania, definitely, definitely, definitely, because if I'm really manic one day, I'll always have a migraine even if it's just a mild one, I'll always get a migraine but the biggest problem and I have an appointment with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], he's my regular doctor</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I don't see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] anymore since I don't really need pain management anymore but I'm still taking a lot of the Perco and I have to be honest, it's not just for pain, it's like management type issues.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] didn't have a problem with that but I always kind of did and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] doesn't like that either because the amount that I was taking, like a hundred and twenty tablets per month, I mean that averages to four a day and that's like, you know, you're pretty much, and then he asked the questions, you know, could a lot of these headaches you've been getting be rebound headaches.  I know a lot of the headaches or pain that I do get, it's always in my neck in this occipital nerve here is where things usually start and I know a lot of it is stress and whatever and I always keep thinking, you know, if I could manage the bipolar, especially the mania part of it better, then I really believe that I could have less migraines</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And overall lessen my, you know, I hate to use the word dependence but, you know, let's call a spade a spade, I think I really am a little dependent on the Percocet, although I can go, you know, days without it if I have to, like if I run out before I have my appointment.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I've proven that I can go without it, I just don't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, when you say pain and management, management of what?  What else does it help with?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well it's like there's different kinds of pain, you know, when it's a migraine it's like right here, like a knife.  Once in a while I'll get them on my left side but mostly on the right side but it always, I have this and I have hard trouble disassociating the two, you know, I get this tension in my neck and I know that's stress and probably bad posture at work and stuff and when I see the chiropractor that helps.  When I get a massage once in a while that helps but if this is bothering me and I leave it unchecked then it gets worse and worse and I wind up with a migraine and it's like, so management of the pain or the almost pain, because sometimes it's not even really pure pain and then if I'm then taking four tablets a day or, you know, more then I won't have a problem so much at work or whatever but like when I get home at night and I'm trying to wind down and I'll be sitting there and I'll just be not like shaky but just kind of like restless.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like not even jittery, it's not that extensive but just, you know, I can tell, you know, it's because I haven't had any, you know, in a day or half a day or whatever.  It's like so I definitely know my body is I think too used to it and when I had cut back down to like sixty a month for a while there because a hundred and twenty was the normal dose I had been on for years and years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And when I first started seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] earlier this year and I had cut back to sixty, then it got to the point where if I did take a whole one instead of usually I cut them in half, if I did take a whole one then I would get really loopy which I hadn't had that reaction with Percocet in years because my body is so used to it, so it's like, you know, what I really want to do is just go cold turkey and just not take any more of it at all but, you know, I'm one of those kind of people, it's like I'm afraid if I don't have some on hand, what if I get a migraine, blah, blah, blah, and it's like I don't know, I just, I don't know but I really think, you know, and things aren't going bad, I mean and like I said [NAME OTHER] and I talked about this at great lengths because I said I'm just, I'm not happy with just surviving and he said well look at what you're doing, you're nowhere near just surviving anymore and I'm like well damn, you're right because work is going great.  I love my job, I love my boss, I purposely didn't apply for any promotions recently because change is not what I need right now especially if I'm going to try to look at fine tuning my medication and my boss is really good about working with me with the bipolar and, you know, if I'm having a day where I'm bipolar or manic I'll always know because I'll be paranoid, I'll be off the handle easily, you know, things like that and, you know, I'll just tell her, you know, I'm really bipolar today and she'll just help keep things away from me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like the best thing that helps me when I'm manic, as far as behavior wise, you know, not even taking about any medication, is just removing stimuli from my environment that are causing me to be more manic, you know, don't listen to, you know, dance music.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, listen to something smooth and soft like I listen to a lot of native American music and stuff and that's real calming and soothing or I'll even be in my car and won't put anything on at all, you know, and some of those things, I think kind of tend to kind of feed into the mania.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I think I've finally gotten past the point of sort of liking the mania because I get a lot of stuff done because I've proven I can still get stuff accomplished anyway and it's like, just stop being so hard on yourself about needing to get so much done all the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But what I am all stressed about the time lately is the sanctuary, because I told you about the sanctuary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The big cat sanctuary?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and it's like, you know, when my boss and I talked about this in my review, it's like I'm really good at sabotaging, when things are going too well, I feel like I need to sabotage and it's like work is going great so I have to have something in my life, you know, that's just causing me stress and causing me to have trouble sleeping at night or whatever because that's just the way I live which is stupid but, you know, this is what it is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so I really like going out there and I like dealing with cats and stuff but there's so much political crap going on and it just really, you know, I actually was doing okay, we got rid of somebody that was a problem this weekend and, of course, now she's all apologizing because she's regretting but too bad, I don't care but, you know, what that's caused is me to have to take on a lot more responsibility but I'm getting better at setting limits because I told [NAME OTHER] yesterday, I'm showing all, I'm giving you all the passwords because I can't do all of this.  I work full time, she doesn't, she doesn't work except in the home so she has more time to devote to all this, you know, monkey business paperwork stuff, you know, there's certain things that I can do and that I'm good at and that I'll help with but, you know, there's got to be a limit and the owner's of the sanctuary, you know, they're good enough friends with me that they respect that and if I say I can't do it, I won't do it.  Well then [NAME OTHER], the owner, being the just good hearted, you know, trying to get things accomplished guy that he is, he went and put me on the license for the place and I found this out Monday night and I went out to, I was over there doing some stuff on their computer and then we went out to dinner and I was like, well shit, don't you think that's something you should have asked me about first because, you know, being on a license to a wildlife sanctuary, I think, is a pretty big frickin hairy deal and, you know, I talked to [NAME OTHER] about that last night and, of course, I was crying because I was in my whole migraine hangover thing and I was really emotional and I was crying, I said, you know, don't take the crying as, you know, I'm not that upset at all, it's just that I'm really in a bad state, we should talk about that when I'm feeling better.  I'm pretty good at let's talk about this later but it doesn't always work a hundred percent.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, like I can't not talk at all, that's kind of the problem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you know, so [NAME OTHER] immediately, as soon as I got off the phone with her, [NAME OTHER] calls me back and he's all apologetic and he's like, you know, I just figured there'd be something you'd want that you'd want to have a say out here and you do so much work out here and I know his intentions were great and I said but quite frankly, it scares the hell out of me because what if something happens, you know, are they going to come after me, am I responsible, you know, and it's like, you know -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a good question.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's like well I'll call [NAME OTHER] tomorrow and tell her to take it.  I said don't do anything yet until I'm feeling better and have time to sit down and talk about it and if I'm going to be on the license then I'm going to need to know how to tranq the cats, how to write up the medical records, how to do all that stuff but it's like blah, you know -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's a lot of responsibility.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And [NAME OTHER] knows that's not good for me, that that's not what I need. I just want to be, you know, I'll be the head volunteer or the coordinator of volunteers, that's okay but I don't want that much responsibility but then he said well really all it does is give you the right to have public out there for tours when he's not out there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, well you know, I guess I understand that but then if that's the case, shouldn't [NAME OTHER] be on it because she lives two doors down and she's out there, you know, she would be the one that could be right there if something, you know, if an inspector did show up and [NAME OTHER] is gone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, so it's like, you know, but he's been burned and so he doesn't know who he wants to trust and he knows he can trust me and so but I'm not the only one he did it to, he put [NAME OTHER] on there too and neither one of us really have any real cat experience except for out there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it seems like it would be something to talk to you about before he does it usually.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well you think but, you know, that's [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, and he's got a good heart but the thing with [NAME OTHER] is you can only believe about half of what he says.  He's not intentionally lying, he just, he doesn't listen, he doesn't pay attention, things go in one ear and out the other, he says something, you know, I'm just going to close the place down, you know, if he's mad and really he doesn't mean it.  Well his friends who know him know the way he is and know that he can tell a tall tale and you take everything he says with a grain of salt, you know -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that kind of thing, just [INAUDIBLE], it's not anything against the guy but it doesn't make it any less stressful for me and that's not what I need.  That's supposed to fun and, you know, some exercise and whatever, so yeah, so the stress that I have in my life right now is mostly just the sanctuary, nothing else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you know, completely cutting it out of my life wouldn't be the answer either because then I'd probably wind up depressed about it.  You know, it's been a good thing for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But so anyway, so the point of that whole story was that [NAME OTHER] was saying, you know, look at how much you're doing, how much time you're spending and whatever else this stuff, you know, you're not just surviving, you are really getting to a point where you're thriving.  I'm like yeah, you know that's true and he really, he really doesn't want me to change any medication but I've got to do something about these headaches because I've been having one bad enough where I'm a little late to work, you know, I think a lot of it is just not the right amount of sleep or at the right time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, because like it doesn't help if you get 8 hours of sleep if you don't go to bed till midnight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I know with bipolar, that's the number one thing you've got to do is get your regular sleep and I've just been so bad about that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm sure that would help everything if I just, I've been trying to eat a little bit healthier lately, I mean not making big demands on myself but, you know, one step at a time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and are you getting about eight hours sleep on average per night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Most nights but not always.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, like if I go over to their house during the week, you know, I don't get to, I don't even get home usually till nine or ten and I have a real problem unwinding and just going to sleep.  Now I did get my CPAP machine a couple weeks ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You got the results of your sleep study?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, yeah, and they -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did it show?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well when I'm on my back -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had like, what did they say, like 45 apneas per hour, really bad, really really bad</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But only when I'm on my back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't sleep on my back that much but it was enough, you know, to be of some concern, so I got the machine and that does help.  [NAME OTHER] is sleeping great because I'm not snoring anymore but I'm having trouble adjusting to, you know, I don't like the claustrophobic feeling with the thing and so I'm still trying to work with them to get some sort of a, you know, whatever works mask wise that is less troublesome for me but, you know, one night I woke up in the middle of the night, took the thing off, turned the machine off, hung it up on my bedpost and went back to sleep and I don't remember doing it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In my sleep doing that so it's like wow.  And I've sleep walked before and I sleep talk a lot, in fact it was really funny, [NAME OTHER] was reminding then I remembered this after he told me but I would have forgot about it but one night I, you know, pulling on him, poking him or whatever and he thought it wanted the covers so he let the cover, you know, I'm like no, no, honey and he's like what and I said the answer to the question is pi and I guess he knew I meant pi like in mathematics but he was, you know, being a smart ass because that's what he does, you know, for a living practically and he said what, you mean apple or cherry or what are you talking about, then I got mad and I'm still half asleep at this time, I got mad because, you know, he was saying pie and I was like no, like three point one four, pi, you know, and he's like you said something, you know, and I was back to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, then he told me about it the next day and I remembered that and it was just, you know, so I do talk in my sleep and stuff sometimes, that hasn't changed but that's okay but it seems to be helping as far as, you know, I have less times where I'm waking up in the middle of the night</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's just, you know, adjusting to the, trying to find the breathing apparatus part that works, it's kind of hard because it makes you feel kind of claustrophobic, you now have this big tube you're connected to, this big hose, it's about this big around and it's kind of heavy and like I've got this one little mask that I really like but then it has these holes for the, you know, because you have to have, it has these holes and their right in the front of the little, where the thing comes out to connect to the hose so if I lay on my side it blows on my hands.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, it's always got to be something with me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you haven't found one that works well yet?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well it works okay but just not, you know, ideal but I mean the gal is working with me on that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Do you have more energy now that you're on the CPAP?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  Yeah, I think I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I think I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  How about your concentration and focus, do you notice any difference or is it about the same?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it's about the same.  I really more depends on what kind of sleep I got the night before, like as far as how many hours or, you know, like today I'm having a little trouble concentrating.  Well, I thought I was and I was like, you know, we had this little quick meeting with our sup and I was like what the hell did we talk about and then I wrote her an email, you can, can you send me a bullet list and I thought, you know what, maybe I remember most of it and so I wrote it down and I said if I forgot anything let me know but I think I did remember it all, so I think I'm underestimating myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just takes a little more effort to get the same level of concentration might be a better way to put it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's just, you know, the day after a migraine I'm always kind of off.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Especially if it's an all day migraine like yesterday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you know, I'm sure that, I'm sure it's got to be, you know, rebound headaches and stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm sure of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME] do you know how your weight is doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Weight is the same.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Stable, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't lost any.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That hasn't changed, okay.  Are you having problems with anxiety at all?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh not too bad, really, in fact, the last, I just refilled my Xanax, I don't know, not too long ago but I had gotten, because you had given me a prescription for sixty of the extended release.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you figure, you know, if you're taking one every day, that should last at least two months and it lasted me over two months, it lasted me about two and a half months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, so still more than I'd like but I don't know, if you're taking it every day, it's probably more than you should have to isn't it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well it depends, the least amount you use the better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because if you don't take it every day, your body won't develop a tolerance to it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you can skip some days but if you need it every day, then you need it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I'm not, I'm sure I'm not every day, in fact lately, it seems like even less.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But maybe that's the problem, maybe because I'm not controlling the anxiety, maybe that's why I'm having more migraines.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know if the migraines, you know, are telling me that I'm having anxiety or if the anxiety is like a predecessor to the migraines or if one causes the other, I'm not really sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But the two always go together, the mania and the migraines, ninety nine percent of the time unless I get a really weird migraine because I'm getting the flu or something like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Otherwise always, the two always go together.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that's why I'm thinking if I could control the mania, the upswing of the bipolar a little bit better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's possible, that might help.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But what was that last medicine that we, I got from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and I tried it and I thought that medicine was supposed to be good for, Topamax.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh Topamax, yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I thought that's supposed to be good not only for migraines but also bipolar.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's supposed to be.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Supposed to be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It didn't always work, unfortunately, with all these medicines they don't always work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, so what did I say about the Topamax the last time I talked to you?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You got nausea and headaches so you stopped it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but the nausea went away after but, yeah, it did seem to make my headaches worse.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Also, you had tingling in your fingers and toes. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh that was the stuff, yeah, that and the nausea went away, like the tingling was really bad at first, especially once I was completely ramped up but that went away like within a week of me getting to the top dose.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the nausea too but the nausea made me, like I remember now, I wasn't eating so much.  Maybe, see that's what I was thinking is I wonder if the reason I was getting more migraines is because I wasn't eating, because my blood sugar probably got low because I remember I was taking it and I was working out at the sanctuary and working quite hard.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I wasn't hungry for breakfast and I don't think I ate lunch and then by three o'clock I was like blah, you know, well of course if you're not eating, you know, if you don't make yourself eat anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That could be a problem but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, I'm not sure what else, like, plus looking back at the Abilify too and I can't remember what my problem was with that exactly.  I think it made me sleepy or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Fatigue.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the only problem you had with it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm just not sure what to do but I really think we need to try something else and I do have an appointment with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] tomorrow so, you know, whatever we think might be good to try then I can run it by him tomorrow too and see what he says.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, because I mean, I think the three of us need to work together as far as, you know, if we can find something that is supposed to help headaches not make them worse and help the bipolar at the same time but I really think if I get the mania, you know, I hate to use the word under control because it's not out of control but if we get, you know, more managed -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And if I'm taking less of the Xanax to get the mania more managed, I really think I'll have less headaches and I don't know if one causes the other or what but the two seem to always be related.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  What about [PATIENT NAME], do you get some enjoyment out of day to day activities or do you feel like you're just kind of going through the motions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think a lot of time I feel like I'm just going through the motions.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I do really like my job, like I don't dread Mondays or anything.  I only dread that I have to go to work when I have a headache.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But other than that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you know, that's the other thing too is I think I'm giving up too easily lately, whereas normally if I have a little headache in the morning, I'll still go to work anyway.  I'll take my Relpax because that has, you know, relatively no side effects for me and usually it works really well and I'll take that and I'll just go to work but I think lately I've been more like, oh I have a headache, I'll just go back to bed, you know, I think I've been giving up on it too easily lately.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you think that's because you're worried about the headache getting worse or you just don't want to go to work or what do you think causes you to give up easier?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Honestly I think it's just because I can, because I have FMLA so I'm not going to get fired, you know, but then I lay there, you know, especially yesterday when it's an all day one, then I lay there and feel guilty about missing work so it doesn't really do me any good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well then do you feel better when you're at home?  Some people feel better, some people feel worse at home, they feel better if they're busy and occupied.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just depends.  I think for the most part, no not unless it's a really bad headache where I just want to be in bed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, but if it's a headache where it's like bad enough to bother me but not really bad enough to be in bed, you know, then I feel guilty, then I'm out working so then I get worse.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, then even if I don't feel a hundred percent, I'm better off just going to work and just suffering through it because then at least I'm at work and I'm getting something accomplished.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it just depends.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  What about</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think, I think what it boils down to is if I'm tired, like I didn't get enough sleep the night before and I have a migraine, like I'll be watching the news trying to have some coffee, trying to, you know, get better and I'll be falling asleep in my coffee.  If I'm tired and I have a migraine, I'm much more likely to just, you know, screw it, I'm going to go back to bed for a couple hours, whereas, you know, if I got a full night's sleep, you know, then I think I can withstand a little headache, you know, unless it's a really really bad one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I think, you know, I don't think they're as bad as I'm making them out to be, I think I'm just giving up too easy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And there's one thing that will help that the most is if I get more disciplined about going to bed at the same time every night because then that won't be an issue.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a good idea.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A very good idea. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I don't know, maybe I don't need any different medicine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I really don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you know what, and I don't think there is one necessarily, other than Topamax, that can sometimes work for migraines and bipolar.  It's really the only one typically that can do that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So if we were going to try something else, you might have to try two different ones.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> One for the bipolar and one for the headaches.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, yeah, I'm not sure either.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] suggested, you know, even though I tried beta blockers and all that years ago -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I was first diagnosed, he suggested maybe trying that again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You could try, it never hurts, they're a very safe class of medicines.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So there's very little that could go wrong.  So what's the plan with the Percocet, is it to try to keep at the level you're at?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I want to cut, I want to cut down.  I mean there's no reason that I should need to have more than like thirty in a month, you know, and here's the biggest thing that I was, you know, having a problem with was that you think of it in terms of, okay, how many per day is that and what you really need to do is think of it, okay, how many bad migraines do I get per month, you know, how many pills do I usually need per migraine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So really, if you look at it that way, maybe you know on a bad month, two really severe migraines per month times maybe four to six pills per migraine, depending if it's one of those three day ones maybe more but that's still, that wouldn't even be twenty a month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So you know, my, what I really want to do tomorrow is go to him and tell him, you know, I don't want more than twenty a month but, you know, if I cold turkey it like that, I'm afraid what the repercussions are going to be but it's like I can't go on like this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This is ridiculous.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I understand but, yeah, I would encourage you not to cold turkey because you can go through withdrawal but if you taper back slowly, most people do fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  If I go from a hundred twenty to ninety that's, you know, three a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I cut them in half and that helps too.  The last couple months I haven't been cutting them in half.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that's a big problem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The other thing I worry about [PATIENT NAME] with Percocet is the long term side effects.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've had a lot of patients -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think you and I talked about that last time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It scares me because I've seen so many people have so many bad things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I've already be on it for, I don't know, what three or four years maybe</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so it's adding up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been a while already, yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it wold be great if you were able to cut back and then maybe if they are rebound headaches, maybe they'll get better actually as you decrease the Percocet.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well maybe I should just have him give me something different altogether than Percocet because, you know, I used to take Vicodin but the reason that we got away from, in fact, for a while I had like sixty Vicodin and sixty Percocet for month, and the reason we got away from that was because if I take the Vicodin at night, it tends to make me a little hyper where I can't sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's like if I'm having a severe migraine where I really need it, then it's not going to keep me from sleeping anyway because the migraine medicine and the migraine itself is going to make me sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So maybe I should just switch to a different medicine because if the Percocet relaxes me, you know, if the Vicodin makes me jumpy, I'm going to be less likely to want to take it in the middle of the day unless I really have to have it but I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, if you do switch, it would be nice if you could switch to something that's non narcotic so you don't have those long term side effects.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If there is something that's safe and effect, that's the problem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But like what, what would be effective?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know because that's not my area of speciality.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'll talk to him about that tomorrow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I know there are a lot of patients who have had migraines who try a whole range of medications though, so I know there are a lot of different options out there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I think the key is just to talk to him and see what's going to be the most likely to help you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just feel like, I mean it's almost to a point of, you know, drug dependence in a way, I mean even though it's, you know, maybe a mild case.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well you can definitely get dependent on the narcotics.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's on the classes that can happen with.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you know, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] kind of view of it was, you know, relatively speaking, that wasn't a big dose but he never talked about the long term effects or anything and he's really coming at it from, like I said, a pain management standpoint.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I first started seeing him, it was a serious pain management issue because I was missing more work than I was making it to.  I was having a lot of, and I was in the hospital several times a year in the emergency room.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, they're not that bad anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  And [PATIENT NAME], you know, even among pain doctors in [DEIDENTIFIED] there are two different camps.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did I mention that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you talked about this before.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> One that'll say take about as much as you need, the other will say try to get off of them</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because of the long term side effects.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I think the key is to find what works for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and I don't think this is working for me because it's not, it's not like I'm getting better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm just, you know, there and it's like, no, no, no, I just -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I think I need to just get completely, because obviously, you know, I've proven to myself that I can't handle a small amount of them as far as, you know, only using it just when I have a bad migraine.  Like realistically, I shouldn't even carry any of it in my purse unless I'm gone for the weekend or, you know, way out of town or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or maybe just take a couple in case you get a bad headache or something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but then it's always, you know, then it's always, you know, oh I'm having a bad headache at work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know what I'm saying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you might take it when you really don't need it that badly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it's like if I'm just at work for the day, I don't think I should even carry it in my purse at all because then, you know, if my headache is that bad that I have to take a Percocet, then I should be home in bed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's kind of the way to look at it, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think it's a good way, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But then would I wind up leaving work more often, it's just -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well it sounds like the good news is you really like your job and you like your boss.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it sounds like you enjoy going to work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, because I know there's been times when I haven't -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, like there's that honeymoon phase, like a year, a year and a half, and then things start to go wrong and then oh, I'm getting more migraines or I'm getting more migraines because I'm not enjoying it as much and then that pisses the boss off and, you know, it kind of snowballs from there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How long have you been there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two, it was two years in March, so over two years.  I've been with this boss, it'll be two years next month now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's two and half months, or two and a half years you've been there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And could you see yourself staying there another two and a half?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, easily.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I could see myself staying in the current position I'm in, you know, sometimes I get frustrated about not getting promoted but, you know, I really don't dislike what I'm doing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's just I've got to long term look at what I want to do, plus she's going to be retiring so I'll have a new boss eventually, so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I'm talking about stress level, what would be the next level if you did get a promotion, what would you be doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Casualty specialist.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's the difference between that and what you're doing now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I would deal with third party injury claims.  Right now I deal with first party injury claims where [INAUDIBLE] injured and the [INAUDIBLE] pretty much, you get the bills you pay it, you don't have a lot of, you know, adversarial stuff about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Most of the time, my insured are in default, they've been rear ended which is the high likelihood. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Most of the time if there's a chance they're at fault, like a red light, green light, you know, who had the red light, a lot of times the other party is injured too, up it goes to the casualty specialist.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now if I'm up there, I'm dealing with all the dregs of that, you know, arguing liability with people, arguing with people, you know, there's only a scratch on the bumper, I don't really see how you're so injured and all that kind of stuff, so it'd be a lot more adversarial too, that's why I'm really not in any hurry to get up there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Plus it gives me, you know, and it's not even so much a time thing but an energy thing.  If I'm not, you know, stressing about work, I have more energy to give to the sanctuary which is what I want to do and to other projects I'm involved in, so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you doing other things too now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, the sanctuary and I'm on a committee, actually I'm heading up a sub committee for developing a cross training program, that's a lot of stress.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cross training where?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I'm also, I'm also signed up for a class for getting my associate in claims.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When are you doing that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, that's home study.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I've barely cracked a book and I already had to move the exam once and it costs seventy five bucks every time you move the exam to the next quarter and I have to take my exam like by December, so I need to do that but it's like I've been developing and plus I told my brother, you know, he bought me a thousand dollars worth of software to help him do web design and I haven't done one single thing for him because I'm so busy doing all the stuff at the sanctuary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it's like, yeah, I think I need to have [NAME OTHER] take me off the license because I don't need that extra stress.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I really don't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, stress is -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I'm not enjoying it, it takes away the purpose for doing it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, because that's why I did it, it was for enjoyment.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yep and you're</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I do enjoy it because it's the only volunteer thing that I've ever found that I was that passionate about.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm almost too passionate about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, yeah, you've got to find the limit so you don't over do it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and setting limits has always been very difficult for me.  I'm getting better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, a little bit at a time, getting better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what it takes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean the last two, well it's almost three now, three years now since I was diagnosed bipolar.  I mean I've come leaps and bounds and that's another thing [NAME OTHER] and I were talking about recently, along with this whole medication change and everything else was that, you know, how far I've come, like even when I do have, you know, "an episode" which I hardly ever have any at all anymore, you know, it lasts ten seconds and I'm done.  Like I don't even really think I even need the Xanax, just when I'm having a manic day where it keeps going, where the mania is not, I'm not being able to control it, that's the only time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I shouldn't even need it as often as I do.  I think I still kind of rely on it more but there's so much you can do for behavior wise and the more you learn and like study, I mean there's so much information on the internet and this gal named [NAME OTHER], she's written some books and stuff, she's great, she has bipolar, in fact she has very high mania, I guess hypermania or whatever you call it bipolar, and I get emails from her and I've read one of her books, I mean she's got some really good practical how to get through life and how to not just survive but, you know, really function well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, good, so you sound you're pulling at a lot of good resources.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, I think I'm doing pretty good, I mean considering where I came from.  I can't even remember the last time I had, you know, a big episode where I completely shut down.  When I always have the worst ones is when like if I'm running late trying to get ready for something and usually it's stupid because it's on the weekend and I'm trying to get out to the sanctuary, I've got to be there for the nine o'clock tour, you know, and I didn't plan ahead, I didn't pack my lunch the night before, you know, I didn't want to get out of bed on time so now I'm running late, you know, and I'm just dumb because I don't plan ahead and that's the thing with being bipolar, you have to plan ahead, you have to be prepared.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because you can't be running around at the last minute, because then I get upset and then if something doesn't work out, oh the shirt I needed to wear isn't clean and then I'll, you know, if I say the F word it's all over because the F word like makes me more mad, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I try to stay away from that at all but it's like you kind of, you learn what your, you know, if I snap at [NAME OTHER] it's like, whoops, you know, as soon as it comes out of my mouth I'm like whoops, obviously, somebody is having an episode here, you know, take some medicine or, you know, what he'll tend to do, you know, just sit down and relax for a minute, you know, one more minute is not going to make you late, why don't we just sit down and relax for a minute or he'll, the best thing he does that helps when I'm having those is that he, you know, he'll go pack the lunch and he'll get everything, I'll have my shoes laid out, he'll do everything that he possibly can to help me to get ready or whatever but then, you know, he can't do that so much because then he's enabling me, you know, I depend on him so much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm getting better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean I've gone and done things a lot, like I went to Wisconsin to visit my mom all by myself.  I drove to [DEIDENTIFIED], I parked up there, even with the rush hour traffic, I parked up there, I flew by myself, you know, my plane was three hours late, I handled it just fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I spent the whole weekend with my family which should have sent me into bipolar hell if nothing else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Had a great time, had a wonderful visit with my grandma, went for a swim at the lake, you know, and came back and drove back all by myself and like two years ago I couldn't have done that, I would not have been functional.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At all, so I've come a long way so maybe he does have a good point, maybe I don't necessarily need a medicine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe you don't right now, I mean it sounds like, and I agree [PATIENT NAME], you've come a long way.  I remember a few years ago when you would have an episode where you'd just fall apart, you'd get rage and get upset -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you don't do that</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't remember the last time I really raged.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Now I mean, if you get upset, yeah, you get upset, it doesn't keep going, it doesn't escalate -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And just, it's like before it turned into a forest fire -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now it's just a little flame and you put the fire out and it's done.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right, exactly and it's like, you know, the worst thing that still happens that I'd like to be able to stop doing, I'd like to catch myself before the words come out of my mouth because I'll say things and they're not necessarily any more really hurtful things to [NAME OTHER] but, you know, nobody likes to be snapped at, especially when he's trying to help me, you know, that's not fair to him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you know, I realize it right away and I apologize right away and like the funniest thing, you know, he finally learned, you know, he's working real hard on not enabling me so like, you know, I'd have an episode, you know, a year ago or two years ago and, you know, I'd be like just leave me alone, you know, then he'd go downstairs and then I'd freak out because he'd go downstairs.  Well now what he'll do is, you know, if I say that he'll like, he'll say are you sure that's what you want me to do and if I say yes then he does what I say, even though he knows that's not what I want, if that's what I said.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He respects your wishes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But he won't leave the house.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No leaving the house, that's our rule.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When you're mad, no leaving the house.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So he'll go downstairs and a lot of times he won't even get all the way downstairs, I'm like I'm sorry, can you please come back, I obviously need some help.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, so the fact that I'm recognizing that so fast is great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I mean I've still got a ways to go but it's only been a couple of years.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've come a long way.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not going to undo, you know, forty years worth of stuff in a couple years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But a lot of it is just behavior modification, really a lot of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For me, I mean I'm sure that's not the case for every bipolar person but for me that seems to be the biggest component is just, you know, learning what things I can do to prevent and what things I can do to minimize and, you know, whatever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, okay, yeah, it sounds like you're doing a good job of learning.  Your stress management techniques have improved a lot, your ability to manage stress when it comes up</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm still not so good at work about like if I have an upsetting phone call which I hardly ever do anymore and I think that's a lot of just because, you know, not letting people get to you but if I do, it's like, you know, I won't even finish my notes in the file, I'll just, you know, when I'm done, I'll go walk away for a minute but I need to get better at like taking a break every hour, just go walk around and come back or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I need to get better at that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have a lot of work to do yet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, we can always improve can't we, there's always -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Room for improvement if we're willing to keep trying and keep looking.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but I think I'll talk to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] tomorrow about, you know, whatever kind of, you know, heavy duty pain relievers are there out there that could help that aren't narcotic because like I've tried Ibuprofen, I've tried Tylenol, none of that ever seems to even touch my headache.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I wonder if temporarily, you know, if I could take like 800 mg of Ibuprofen maybe that would help, you know, this beginning stuff enough that I don't need the other stuff, I don't know but I think I am going to stop carrying it in my purse</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Except when I'm, you know, way far away from home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a good idea.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well but then like, you know, it's amazing the stuff I can survive through and yet the every day stuff is what gets me.  Like I was out at the sanctuary a couple of weeks ago, I literally worked myself to the point of definitely heat exhaustion if not mild heat stroke because, and I was drinking fluids and stuff but I wasn't taking enough break and it was really hot and by the time I went to leave about two. two thirty I was getting stuff in the car and I knew I was in bad shape and I wound up throwing up like a gallon of Gatorade and water, I thought oh, you know, and then I got in my car and was on my way home and as I started to cool off, I felt worse,  like I got like kind of numb and tingling and my scalp was tingling and I started getting the shakes real bad and then I got about ten minutes down [DEIDENTIFIED] and I had to pull over and throw up again and then it was the granola bar from earlier in the morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I sat there, you know, just shaking for a couple minutes and I almost called an ambulance because I just didn't know how I was going to drive home.  I thought about going back but by the time I'd get back I would be more than halfway home so I just went home and it was like I really had to just, it was almost like being really tired or something, I really had to concentration on just, and I'd get in the right lane and I'd just stay there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know and I made it home and, of course, I had a huge headache by then too and I took a migraine medicine and I took a Percocet and I took a shower.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I laid down and within an hour I was feeling fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was hungry, you know, so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's like, you can't do that to yourself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's hard on you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I hope I learned.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I think you are learning [PATIENT NAME] and I'm really impressed by how much you've learned over time.  I mean you've gotten so much better at managing your stress so it doesn't manage you, it doesn't take over and cause you to have these intense emotional swings.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have a relationship with my mother again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we had a wonderful visit and, you know, there was a couple times, you know, my brother was there a lot of the time with me and there was a couple times where I noticed, you know, she doesn't listen and she likes, everything has got to be about her but, you know what, I don't care.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's my mom and I love her anyway and I just shut up and let her talk and she interrupts me and if I don't want to be interrupted I just keep talking right over the top of her until she gets the hint and she doesn't, so I don't worry about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you don't let her get the better of you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We had a great visit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was the best visit we'd had in years, not one single moment of tension the entire time and here was the key, here was key, the last time we went home it will be two years ago for Thanksgiving, the whole time I was worried, you know, what's grandma going to say about my weight and who's doing to cause a fight and I stressed myself and then I got there and nothing happened.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's like, you know, okay let's do without the week or two of stress.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you know if something happens, we'll deal with it but most of the time I'm going through all the scenarios, okay, she's going to say this and I'm going to say that and then she's going to say this and I'm going to do this and it never happened.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's catastrophizing, that's what I call it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent, excellent.  You recognize it, excellent.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, I'm horrible at it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well but the good news is once we recognize we're doing it then we can put a stop to it.  If we don't recognize what we're doing, we just keep going.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure, sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that's another huge step you're taking [PATIENT NAME], huge step.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, I'm getting there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think really the biggest thing is just, you know, to really research and learn what kind of things and, you know, having [NAME OTHER] is a tremendous help.  I don't know how anybody could do it without a support system.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well it's very difficult.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You have to have somebody outside of you until you learn to do it for yourself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Telling you whoa, stop, you're having an episode, slow down, you know, and you don't want to listen, even when you know that they're right and that they're telling you for your own good, you don't want to listen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's so hard.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But once you get to that point where you're recognizing it yourself, you know, then it's just a matter of practice and the more you practice the behaviors, the easier it gets.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're right, you're absolutely right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm getting there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're doing really well.  I'm really proud of you, so yeah, my suggestion would be let's not change the medicine right, work with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] with the Percocet.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And get something else to see if you can get the headaches under control to get off some of the narcotics and, you know, that may help some more in terms of how you feel emotionally too and give you more control because -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because you're not really being yourself when you're having that in your system on a regular, and I'm talking pretty much every day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I don't think that's good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It can effect people in a lot of different ways that they're not aware of until they get off of it and then they can sometimes tell the difference and [PATIENT NAME] for some people, I've had people tell me it took up to six months after they were off the medicine for their brain to get back to functioning the way it did before they went on the narcotics.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So even though -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I don't remember what like was like before the narcotics.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's kind of scary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, the good news is that even though the medicine gets out of your system fairly quickly and it takes a long time for the effects of the medicine to wear off, it's constantly, it's continual improvement, you can feel better and better, think better, you know, it's a good thing.  Excuse me, so you can continue to improve.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I think so, I'm going to talk to him about that tomorrow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I think that's an excellent idea.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Where are we, September?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So let's can we do a follow up in November?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We can.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Instead of waiting three months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That sounds like an excellent idea.  [INAUDIBLE], right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, in fact I'm wondering, maybe lets do like six weeks or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If that's all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That'll be fine.  I have to see where that puts us, it'll be one, two, three, four, five, six weeks is the week of [DATE] through the [DATE].  Is that a good week?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That might a good week because I have a big fundraiser on the [DATE[.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so after that's over and what time of day is best?  Something early morning, later?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Gosh, you know, this actually didn't work too bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Around 1 o'clock.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Let's try that again, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've got -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Twelve thirty or 1 o'clock, anywhere in there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That week I have Monday the [DATE] at one o'clock, would that work do you think?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'd rather not do a Monday because Mondays tend to be kind of hectic at work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, what if we did a Tuesday at one thirty?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I want to do an eight o'clock appointment.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Eight o'clock, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I like those better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, that week at eight o'clock I have Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How about Wednesday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wednesday the [DATE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, let's do Wednesday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah because this didn't work too bad but a lot of times I wind up getting stuck on a phone call and, you know, if I'm not rushing then I can just sit in the right lane, I don't have to worry about, you know, getting around people and stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Smart</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's why I always, I'll rush to get out the door but then once I sit in that car, it's all calm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, if I'm late, I'm late, too bad because I will not drive in a hurry.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just can't, I can't do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it's not</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I get too manic and I wind up, I don't want to road rage on somebody.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not safe, yeah, and you're more likely to have an accident.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean crap, if I had known twenty years ago or even ten years ago I was bipolar, well it doesn't matter anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well we learn as we go, don't we?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've still got a lot of time, hopefully.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, hopefully, you've got lot of time to enjoy it and things keep getting better so, all right, so there's the card.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Cool.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you need anything before then, let me know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Can I borrow your pen?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm just going to write on there that I owe you twenty for today and I'm going to call [NAME OTHER] and make sure that [NAME OTHER] got that other one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Paid.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I think we're still good with refills.  If you find you need more, just let me know the pharmacy and I'll take care of that for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah and I think I really think the more that I keep progressing, the less, I think I still have a refill on there but I think the less I need.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think you're right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, and I think if I can get away from, because honestly, you know, the stuff takes long enough to work then if I'm having a severe episode of mania, it doesn't help anything because I've got to do something myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To get out of it, so the only time I really take it is if I'm like, you know, if I'm like manic for the day, kind of like if I'm having one of those days where I can tell it just keeps, one thing after another.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's when I take it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I take one and that does it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean I don't ever take more than one in a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anymore, so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well it's there as kind of a safety net if you need it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I think you're right, as you continue to get stronger and stronger, I think you're going to need it less and less often which is good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well and the only time I every like take one for just in case is like when I'm going to the dentist.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and that's fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take one that morning just because, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To reduce your stress.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's perfectly all right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah because the dentist doesn't do very well for me but I have a good dentist so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, well keep up the good work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Cool, then we'll see you in -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Six weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That sounds good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'll have more to report about how things are going with me and reducing my stress at the sanctuary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, good luck.  I hope it calms down.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh you know, well that's why they really want me to be on the license because, you know, if things, the shit hits the fan or whatever, we can just walk away, if I'm on the license I can't walk away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, take care.  Bye bye.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> See you in October.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where do you want to start today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure. I'm still feeling (pause)... I mean I'm not having as many breakdowns as I've been having before but I'm still feeling easily overwhelmed at stuff. Like I finally, finally, finally got myself back to being motivated about writing job applications and I did two of them Friday and I was actually working on one outside.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you! And did you come early on purpose to save time for yourself to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of that was at first I was wanting to eat something between being at Alex's place and being here so both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't finish it yet but I...I guess now I'm less and less concerned with the quality of the cover letters rather than getting them out because I get stuck. But the other thing is I get stuck when it's something I (pause) I think if it's something I'm less likely to get I, like I don't quite meet the qualifications or something like that, whether it's the experience or knowing specific programs and stuff it makes it that much harder for me to be motivated to write that application. [00:01:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you say get stuck is that the same thing for you as feeling overwhelmed or are those separate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think they're separate because a lot of the overwhelming stuff doesn't have anything to do with job applications but like even (pause) last night I was feeling down for some reason and I couldn't figure out why. My concert was over...or even Friday too. I've done all the hard things and I had written these job applications and I wasn't really feeling that good and maybe just like a week of not getting enough sleep or (inaudible) week. This week I can catch up but I'm not really sure what's wrong or if it's just overall stress about not having a job and now with the whole effect that it took me until the end of last week to get back to writing job applications and now it's (pause) hard for me to...now I'm like, "Oh my God, I should have done things in the past few weeks," and haven't. But I'm not sure how many positions I was actually qualified for that I could have applied for and didn't. [00:02:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you can't know now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I could know. I could go back and look at all the old posts and see what it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there's nothing you can do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even the one that I was working for outside that I'm sort of mostly qualified for but it's been up for a month now so I don't know if it...I mean, I assume if it's still up it's still open and I should still apply.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what you have to go on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of the new stuff for this week hasn't even been posted yet so it's not like there's much that I could do. (pause) I just have so much trouble being motivated when it's like I probably won't get this job anyways. I don't fit all the qualifications. There are people who are better qualified. [00:03:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those kinds of thoughts are certainly not motivating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I guess the ones I applied to on Friday...one I was like maybe slightly under qualified for though the cover letter I wrote made it sound like I was qualified because I...it basically required experience setting up in (inaudible) stuff. Or it didn't require it but that was one of the preferred qualifications because that's what you're doing in this position. And that's essentially what I'm doing at the historical society. I still wrote it as if I've already done the things that I'm going to be doing eventually at the historical society. So it wasn't like a super duper stretch but it definitely was a stretch.</p>

<p>The other one I was like actually very overqualified for because it was like a position that (pause) was a pre-professional position. It was processing assistant. It's just like the end of it so you're not doing the intellectual stuff. It's mostly like numbering folders. But it also mentioned entering stuff into EAD (ph). So it didn't say that it was only open to students so it was 14 or 15 hours a week so it was definitely...I figured it was worth it even though I... [00:04:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also just thinking about these things as a step into the door, getting something in the field and maybe once you get your foot through the door maybe something else could come about. You meet someone at least. You think a lot of this is about making connections. You don't enjoy the networking process. It's just sometimes applying for something that might be sort of what you want to do but not really is another way of making connections with people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this was at the library which is where Tara's friend works so actually I ended up, when I was working on that job application, calling Tara and asking her if I should write to her friend and what should I write and so then I sent the e-mail to Tara before I sent it to the person and Tara was like, "Yeah that works," because Tara had e-mailed her friend too so now her friend actually e-mailed me back today so I'm going to meet with her sometime next week. [00:05:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you! That's networking!</p>

<p>CLIENT: The post came out Friday afternoon and I applied right away and I think the deadline for applications was June 1<sup>st</sup> so...she's not the person who the cover letters are supposed to be sent to so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she knows that person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She knows that person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's a contact and it's putting a little bit of personal connection, even if it's sort of a step removed, into the process and that's...taking those kinds of steps, does it guarantee you a job? No. But is it a step in the right direction of getting a little bit more exposure? It is. Building on things like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just also so hard to then...I'm still jumping a zillion steps ahead but if I did get this job what would I do about health insurance and like I still don't know what I'm going to do about health insurance, especially when I (pause) lose it in August. Like whether or not I could buy insurance for myself, like how expensive that would be. [00:06:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well your options are going to be either purchasing private insurance or if you are doing something part time that doesn't disqualify you for some assistance, applying for state assisstance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except that then I would...I assume that since it's federal their not going to reimburse out of network therapists.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. I have worked with clients who have switched their insurance to state assisstance because of graduating or something like that and not having a job right away. And sometimes they are very amendable to being able to help apply and continue the therapist they've already established a relationship with and sometimes they're not. And I'm happy, if it comes to that, I'm happy to do the paperwork and help you apply for that. [00:07:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really reassuring so now I at least know that I have that option if I don't find anything by August.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the other thing is sometimes it makes sense, the difference in price, if you qualify for state assisstance and we don't get those sessions approved, sometimes the price difference is worth it to kind of pay for your mental health out of pocket rather than pay for insurance privately. So sometimes it works out to be a numbers game. And you and I will talk about your options and I will help you in any ways that I can. And you and parents can talk about the options and we'll figure it out when it comes to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I feel like I'll be worried until I have a job but now at least I'm finding motivation I guess because I don't really have anything else I need to be doing anymore. Not that I had that much I needed to be doing but now I don't have...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have things that were distracting. [00:08:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I just need to be better about doing it and I think it helps if I'm spending time by myself and not having Sydney over or being over at Sydney' place because then I'll be distracted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're scheduling some time away to work on that stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like the other two on Friday I did well. I was (inaudible) and today I was working on (inaudible). I'll probably work on it this afternoon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're welcome to camp out in the waiting room after session if that's a distraction-free zone. There's not that much action usually in the waiting room.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I will do that at least until I finish it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, if you want to set that as a goal you're certainly welcome to do that. We're open here till 6. [00:09:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just so hard to know which ones I should apply for. Well theoretically I could apply for everything but I can't actually apply for everything and keep my mental health and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well let's talk about what your process is for figuring out what makes sense to apply to. Do you have a set of criteria in your head?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, anything that is an unpaid internship I do not apply for, hands down. Things that I feel like I'm definitely qualified for as long as like...even within an hour of driving distance, I can apply for those. Things that I have everything but the experience for or only have some of the experience I start feeling less confident about applying for them. If it's in the preferred section then I don't have any qualms but if it's like required five years experience or three years experience then it makes it a little bit harder for me to want to do it because I'm like, "Why should I bother when they require something I don't have?" If these people aren't going to write me back anyways because I don't have the experience and they posted it for a reason. [00:11:06]</p>

<p>Even though the whole thing about experience it's just so subjective and you learn so many things on the job anyways. I could definitely do all the things that most of those job descriptions have it's just that I don't have any experience doing them yet. And the only way to get the experience is to get a job unless I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you are getting some experience as you volunteer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm getting some experience as I volunteer. If I'm applying for any sort of reference experience (ph) that's a little bit harder to get experience especially because...I was lucky in that I had reference experience in my internship last summer. Most people don't let their interns just go and interact with the public and do reference so it would be really hard to get another volunteering thing doing reference work or anything like that. [00:12:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you in the unpaid internships? What do they tend to be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would have to apply to them. So far some of them were cataloging. I don't want to have to apply to get an unpaid internship if I'm going to spend all this effort applying for jobs that do pay money. It just seems silly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you don't want...you certainly don't want, if you're only going to apply to a limited number of things depending upon figuring out what you have the motivation and energy to do, you certainly don't want to apply to unpaid things in lieu of paid things. If there's nothing...if it's not going to stop you from applying to something else then I wonder if doing a part time internship or something to get the experience, I wonder if that would be worth it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it would also be a question of whether or not they'd let me leave right away if I found something paying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, like if you continue to look for paid work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean most of them I don't think...well no, because most of them won't let their unpaid interns do reference either. I was the exception. You don't usually do that. That's only what more professional librarians do because they don't want these random people who they don't really know that well and aren't fully trained to interact with the public. And the only reason I was able to do it was because it was internal reference. And it's not something I can really do at the historical society yet or anytime in the near future because the collections aren't accessible or ready to be made accessible to the public so we don't want people coming in poking around for things when we ourselves don't have any clue what's in all the boxes yet so it's like not something I can really do yet. [00:13:54]</p>

<p>So reference work will be harder. Other stuff, I mean it's just a matter of how many years experience you have and I can't really do much with that yet. And I guess it's also a question of do I apply for the ones that I'm really, really super duper overqualified for that needs a high school degree or something for like shelving books. And I guess if the hours and pay are good then I might consider it though I don't know if they'd consider me. But I don't know if it would add anything to my resume but it would be better than not being paid anything at all. Or if it's far away, like if it's not something that I'm going to have to pay to work there with the commute or whatever then that also strikes it out of my list of options. [00:14:47]</p>

<p>If it's a temporary job that's a year or more then those I definitely consider. If it's three to six months it's whether or not the rest of it makes it worth it. (pause) There's a bunch that have been one year or two year and stuff like that and I haven't...I don't mind applying for those because that would be fully...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It means you'd have] (ph) more time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And some of them it's like...or if they're a short amount of time that has potential to become long term, those also don't scare me off. It's basically whether or not I'm qualified or under qualified or overqualified and there are very few that I'm just qualified for, like the Yale one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot of it is so subjective.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's the one that was specifically set up that they wanted someone within...who had graduated in the past two years and so they can't require that much experience so that was like (pause)...but that's so not normal. Only if they're thinking specially like, 'Oh yes! We want to set this up for new archivists so they can have jobs." Very few people actually do that. Yale had the money to do that so they did. And that Yale job I think was like the end of May was when they were going to... [00:16:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you applied for that and haven't heard?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I applied for that and yeah I think they were accepting submissions until May 21<sup>st</sup> or something so I knew I wasn't going to hear from them right away so there's nothing I can do about that one. I only applied to one of the two because the other one didn't really seem that interesting and was sort of out of my field. There was one that I could do and then there was one that was like copyright stuff and I was like I don't really know anything about copyright and pretend that I do and, "Hey look, I wrote this other letter."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I'm glad to hear that you are getting back into the habit of renewed (ph) booking and weeding through them and putting in some applications.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have I hit the point where I should start looking for the administrative assistant type other...like what other jobs are there that I could apply for outside of my field that I would be qualified for with my degrees that I wouldn't hate and that wouldn't pay way too little money? [00:17:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what wouldn't you hate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't hate working in the yarn store. I definitely don't want to be in the food service industry. In theory I wouldn't mind working for a bookstore but I hear that a lot of them are not that fun to work for and they give people long hours and are not nice about scheduling and stuff like that so not really worth it and probably pay like ten dollars and hour anyways. (pause) There's retail. I don't think I'd mind an administrative assistant job depending on how fast paced the environment is because I don't want something that's 40 hours a week, super duper fast paced, always on your toes, don't have any down time to breathe or anything like that. [00:18:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you overqualified for that? You have two masters degrees.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm both over and under qualified for them because I have two masters degrees but I have the year working at [inaudible] (ph) as an office assistant but I haven't been a full administrative assistant before. There are people who have an associates degree in administrative assistant stuff and I'm like well I have two masters. So I have way more education but they have more focused education.</p>

<p>I could make the argument now that my librarian (ph) degree makes me qualified but yeah. And data entry is also another one that I'd be way over qualified for but not sure if I could... (pause) if they'd consider me for something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What types are...if you were to focus on your degree, what kinds of jobs do people usually look at for a terminal masters?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it isn't a terminal masters because if it was I would have gotten one of those fuzzy robes. The Masters of Divinity is a terminal masters but Masters of Theological Studies isn't. It's actually like a lot of people will use that degree and then go into PhD programs because it isn't enough to become a minister or something like that. That's a Masters of Divinity. I guess like social services, I could theoretically work for a Jewish organization or something like that. So I guess I could look at those and that would probably be something I'd enjoy. [00:19:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that might be another area, not necessarily to start applying, but maybe opening up your job search to start looking in that area.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like non profit stuff. I'd rather have something that has less hours, less good pay, but good benefits. That would be my ideal, 20 to 30 hours a week with benefits would be my ideal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe looking at some of the non profit stuff or looking at the religious organizations because you certainly have education in that area.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and there's actually this one religious librarian one that I would have been qualified for except that it's actually a discriminatory thing in which they posted this on the job blog, mind you, but they had all these different requirements and then the last one is like "agreement with the mission statement, statement of Tara and community life statement" of this Christian (pause) seminary school. But on like the other things, including having experience... (pause) like having been educated at a seminary, which I have, but I'm not...and then the statement of Tara is all, "We accept Jesus Christ" blah blah blah, etc. [00:21:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not going to fit for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's whether or not...you know, theoretically I could apply for it and take the Jew things off my resume, get an interview, they figure out I'm a Jew, not get the job, and like sue or something but it seems like so much effort for something that I could just rather spend my time applying for jobs that I could get. But yeah, they're freezing (ph) Christians.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Apply for jobs you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if it were Unitarian or something like that or like something more like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if you felt like you would be respected.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because there's another one I saw for something else that was just like, "Don't mock our Tara," and stuff and accepting and that I'm fine with but the ones that...there's no reason why you, on the job description, there's no reason why you need to be a believing Christian to do this job. And if it just said, "Respect our community," I would have been fine with that. But I'm not going to pretend to be a believing Christian for this. [00:22:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well there's a difference between respecting somebody else's Tara and being asked to believe in particular.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or pretend to believe. So yeah, I just could not do that. (pause) And I was just like, "Damnit, I was so close." And then they want a Christian. But they should have just not posted that last requirement and all they had to do is interview people and I'm sure there would be Christians that would apply and just take a Christian person and then they'd avoid the whole discrimination thing. But you're not allowed to post saying that you'll only hire a person of your religion and there are definitely a lot of non-Jews who work at synagogues and stuff like that and Jews who work at churches and stuff. [00:23:08]</p>

<p>It would be one thing if it was (pause) a position as a priest or something like that but I'm kind of annoyed that I couldn't apply for that one but I'm like, "Screw that." I'm not going to try and I'm not going to pretend to be something I'm not. Maybe there will be a less crazy divinity school that wants a librarian. Of course there's no...the one job that opened at Yale Divinity while I've been looking for jobs was the head librarian position.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you felt that was too over your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah just a little. Some of them are five to ten years experience with increasing supervisory responsibilities and stuff like that that I just do not have and do not want. I wouldn't want to be thrown into something as a head librarian when I have no experience as a regular librarian. I wouldn't know how to do my job. That's the other thing I guess is I don't want to apply for anything where I wouldn't know how to do my job. [00:24:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to feel confident.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't have so...yeah I want to feel confident and at least have that they'll train me to do what I need to do. Like have a superior who I can ask questions to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think your plan is one to follow to start looking at the other...start looking at the divinity school websites or options in the religious organizations and just expand your criteria a little bit. And use that same criteria that you've been using for library jobs. Do you meet the requirements? Is the job description interesting to you? Does it have benefits? Is it something that could be — if it's not full time — is it something that could be extended? Use that same criteria and look and challenge yourself to send out as many applications as possible. Those are things that are reasonable and things that (pause) would be possible. [00:25:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really don't know what like my...how many job applications I need to send out until I stop feeling guilty about not doing enough and I really think the only answer is until I get a job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then keep sending them out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is just annoying but I mean there are other things I'd like to do with my time. Some of them are actually even productive like someone over the weekend bought like 70 dollars worth of yarn from me and someone else just bought this custom order and so I have to make the custom order. Now I know certain things that I do with yarn sell and I can spend more time doing that. But it's still not enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not necessarily about a specific number of applications but sending out the applications that matter. You could send out a gazillion but if they are for jobs that you're not qualified for or you're not going to take if you got it, then that's a waste of time. [00:26:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I try not to send out anything that I wouldn't take if I did get it. Like that at least...if I'm maybe on the fence about it or need to learn more about the job to decide then I would send it out like with the ancestry.com one that had turned out to be, I would not be making enough money for getting a car to commute and all that. So but if it's...but in general I don't try to...I try not to apply to things that I'm just not going to take. What's the point? There are some people who would be like, "Oh, you could get an interview and interviews are good practice," and blah blah blah but I want to get an interview with a place that I know what I'm...a place that I might actually get a job that I want. [00:27:16]</p>

<p>I don't know, then there's a part of me that wonders if there's something wrong with me for the fact that I don't want to work full time. If there was a 40 hour a week archivist job I would totally take it but I would much prefer 35 hours a week job or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just fits with your personality. It's not that something's wrong but you know about yourself that you don't want to be that unbalanced. That having a certain amount of free time and time to do things with friends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But so many people work 40 hours a week and a friend. I feel like the majority of people in the country work 40 or more hours a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That may be true but that doesn't feel like a good fit for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and it would be great. If I did get a job at the library it's $14.50 an hour for 15 hours a week. I calculated it and so working 52 weeks a year would be about 11 thousand dollars which is not quite enough to live off of but like supplemented by something else or having my parents pay for a little bit, it would almost be enough to live off of and it would be a job in my field. [00:28:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well don't...how many steps ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah well considering I...considering the deadline for applying hasn't even happened yet so they're not going to do anything with my application yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's take it piece by piece. If you get an interview there then go in the interview and do the best job you can. If you get an offer, decide whether or not you're going to take it. Let's not jump too many steps ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just like I really wish I had a job so I could just have a job and stop being stressed about everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that would relieve a lot of stress. So instead of wishing you had a job you turn those wishes into motivation to put out the applications and do some of that networking that you did and be thinking about that all the time about how can you make a personal connection. [00:29:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Those are a fluke. I can also ask Tara who else she knows. She probably does know other people too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ask the question. That may have been a fluke but then when you get those and you get those lucky things try and build on them. So yeah, asking if she knows other people would be a good start. I did want to check in, last session we focused a lot on your frustrations and concerns about Sydney and I wanted to follow up on that again and see how he was doing, how you were doing with that. Let me also give myself a check of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I mean I've been feeling a little bit better. I've still been worrying about him sometimes but he's at least getting better about taking his medicine and stuff though he's still staying up really late and stuff. But he doesn't have things to do during the day so much so that I guess it's okay that he's doing that but not ideal. But last week (pause) I did end up being able to get home all the nights. [00:30:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you get home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So Monday night and Tuesday night Michelle gave me a ride because she was giving Andrea (sp) a ride so those worked out. Wednesday night I had the car. Thursday night I actually had a couple girls walk me back because I was going to meet Sydney. He was going to pick me up from there but he wanted to go to bed early and rehearsal also ran late. It was supposed to end at 12 and it ended at 12:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow!</p>

<p>CLIENT: So when he asked me at 12 and stuff I was like, "I don't know what to do." But then when rehearsal was running late I was like, "Well we're running late so it's not really your fault now because I didn't know it was going to run late." So yeah, Cam and Corey walked me back. And then Saturday night I had the car. [00:31:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, you put lots of different things into place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I could have...I guess if Cam and Corey hadn't been able to walk me home then I would have ended up taking a cab. I guess it would have only been one night that I would have had to pay for a cab.</p>

<p>(pause) And his libido still isn't really back yet but I've been (inaudible) about not asking him about it since I sort of know. I think he realizes...because you know with the new drugs I think (pause) he's still just so stressed about being unemployed and that's probably the big reason though at least now...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That can be a libido crusher.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I did at least get him to like...he looked at a few jobs at Yale and now he's possibly going to apply for them or other things and stuff in the mean time like meeting with a career counselor and stuff. Because if he got some sort of...he's okay right now doing some sort of cook (ph) monkey job and they pay well enough and he's qualified and so of course no masters degree. His field pays way more than my field, either of my fields with two masters degrees.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That often happens. [00:33:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just really annoying. I'm like, "Damn, why I didn't I go into tech?" Oh wait, because I don't like tech.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The pay scale is not transferable from one field to the next.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just so annoying because it's like...you know and then that's the other thing, I sort of feel irresponsible having gone off and done liberal arts but it's what I like to do and what I'm good at.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't choose your career based upon the compensation for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I didn't. But I did choose a career originally thinking that I'd be able to get a job in it. But then again, growing up I thought I could get a job in anything. Because you're always taught, "You can be anything you want to be when you grow up! You could be President of the United States." (pause) And when I was growing up it wasn't like there was this huge economic recession and did find jobs right out of college. Everyone found jobs. [00:33:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not something you could have predicted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now it's just...the economy is so bad and (pause) I don't know. I still haven't applied to the temp agency. Now that it is summer maybe I should but (pause) I don't know if I want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is your deal with your parents?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right now I don't have a deal with my parents and they haven't asked me about the temp agency in a while and the stuff that I've been telling them that I've been sending out job applications.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they feel like that's enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I haven't told them how many job applications I have or haven't sent out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we're going to keep you good on your word and keep sending them out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like on Friday for example, I was like, "Oh I can totally post to Facebook 'wrote two cover letters!'" And then like oh wait, no I can't. My parents are on Facebook and then they'll realize that writing two cover letters is a big deal and therefore I haven't been doing that all along. So I didn't. (chuckle) [00:35:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The social media world makes things tricky.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) When I'm making more money with the yarn stuff now I feel less guilty about spending money on things like going out to eat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do have some income when you're successful in that. And that is a job. It's not a full time job, it's not benefited.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it is a job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you are making...yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not even making enough to pay my rent. Actually at this point I might barely, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're making enough for some of the extras that you're paying for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, this is true. (pause) I don't know if it's better to...I don't know, and I guess that's why I'd rather have that part time job at the library than doing a temp job because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well at least it's in your field.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's in my field and yeah, it's part time but it's not like only for a short period of time. I mean, yes, there are lots of temps who hire but all those jobs would be not in my field. [00:36:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be unlikely or less likely in your field. You mentioned in the beginning of the session that you felt like you were still getting more easily overwhelmed and I wonder if that's because often your thoughts do go to some of those "what ifs" and in the future. And I wonder if you would feel less overwhelmed if you pared it back down to what you actually have control over right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, though a lot of it also sometimes happens when things change and plans like for getting (inaudible) something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you feel out of control.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and when the easy solution would be just like okay, make a box of pasta. It's not that hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And something stops you from doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something stops me from doing that/I'm like, "Oh my God, I've had pasta every day," even though I haven't. I used to be fine with that and now I get all these strong cravings for food and I just can't really deal with it. I don't know why all of a sudden I get these...like I'm wanting meat all the time now for no good reason. [00:37:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you know it's no good reason?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because there's nothing that's changed and I've been like fine not having meat all the time for the past four years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well is it possible to - I mean if that's what you're noticing and you're paying attention, you're aware of that feeling — is it possible to create more meat in your diet? Can you get things like...is there a kosher deli that you could have...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's the deli so it depends when I get that craving if it's like...sometimes we have stuff at home. We actually talked in the house meeting about getting a second microwave because that would like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would make it a lot easier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so we're going to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so there's something...and it creates variety and if you can keep some of that stuff in the house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but sometimes it's just like I don't feel like I have the energy to make anything. But before that would mean okay, then I'll just have a bowl of ice cream instead and now it's like I'll just have nothing. It's not very constructive and I'd be better off with a bowl of ice cream. So I don't really know what the deal is. (pause) But I'm trying to overcome it and just be okay with eating pasta or whatever and not what I'm craving. [00:38:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are the feelings? When you don't have what you want, what do you feel (pause) in addition to hungry if you don't eat?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do end up eating something and just thinking whatever I eat, it's not going to solve my craving, like this isn't going to help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, so you feel quite powerless because I hear that, "Whatever I do it's not going to help." And I hear that line for different things. So you're saying it now in context of having a craving for a particular food but I think I heard the same line earlier with regard to an application. "Whatever I do I'm not going to get called back." And that's really a hopeless feeling, helpless and hopeless. So changing that to, "What is the thing that I can do that would have some impact?" It might not be...you might not have control over the whole thing but it's probably also untrue that no matter what you do you're not going to have any impact. You're breaking it down to, "What's the thing that I do have control over?" With an application, is there some perfect sentence you can put on to guarantee you get the job? No. You don't have control over that. But is there something you can do to make it more likely? Maybe. Definitely sending it on time. It doesn't guarantee the outcome but it has some impact. And with food, you know thinking about well certainly yeah...having a discussion with your housemates about getting a second microwave so you can have meat microwaved, that's something you can do. [00:40:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean we did have the discussion. Now we're just like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, so you did...but that's something that you actually did have some control over that. Maybe is there...do you need to be making it to schedule that there's a more frequent run to that butchery? (pause) Finding what is the...ask yourself that question. "What is the thing that I actually can do?" Not looking at what you can't do. Are there other things we should be catching up on or processing that we haven't gotten to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess just also during my tech (ph) week the thoughts came back and were really bad and I think it might just have been tech (ph) week because during previous rehearsals I've been fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you haven't talked about them much at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like, tech (ph) week it was (pause) so distracting and I'm like, "I need to sing my songs now." I mean it's also because once I got to the point of tech (ph) I was thinking less about the music since like... [00:41:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you felt like you knew it pretty well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, at least for most of the songs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you mentioned that some of the rehearsals were really late. Were you really sleep deprived at tech (ph) week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to think about that. What did I have to wake up for on the next days? Tuesday I (pause)...so if I had Monday night rehearsal and Tuesday I didn't have anything until [inaudible] (ph) at one so probably I slept in. (pause) Tuesday night I ended up staying up really late after the rehearsal and (pause) deciding to sleep in on Wednesday. I think I still normally get eight hours. I think most nights I got like...and there might have been a couple nights where it was like seven hours instead of eight but I don't think there was any night that I didn't get at least seven hours. [00:42:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what were you feeling before you noticed the thoughts? Do you know what it was that came right before they arrived in your head?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't. I really, really don't. It seems like they came out of nowhere. Because it wasn't like I was nervous about the fact that our concert was coming up because I wasn't. And I felt prepared and none of the rehearsals...usually we have three hour rehearsals for tech (ph) week and this week we had...there was one two and a half hour rehearsal but like the rest of them were all two hour rehearsals.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were fairly sure they were late. But they were really late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were really late. They're always really late though. So it wasn't like it was a surprise that they were really late.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We haven't talked about the thoughts much recently so let's try to keep some tabs on it. Clearly they have surprised you that they were much stronger and more frequent during tech (ph) week than they had been. But I'd like to keep tabs and what happens now that the show is over. See where they go and whether paying more attention to them might give us some ability to understand why they're coming up and what to do about it.</p>

<p>Why don't we stop there for today? I know there was some question about your schedule coming up. [00:43:23]</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) I think I was just sort of, well, recalling last night and thinking about my attitude toward things since then or including then.  And at first I think I was feel—, I was feeling a certain sense of relief and, I don't know, release to be able to do something and not sit feeling kind of paralyzed as I was feeling yesterday but—.  I don't know, now I was—, when I was just thinking about last night and how I think my attitude was sor—, it wasn't as bad as I had thought it might be.  But that was partly because I just—, I was able to feel I didn't care, and I did act more myself than I usually do and—.  I don't know, I don't think the couple was any different than they ever are, and I didn't—.  My enjoyment of it was just simply because I was more relaxed and being more myself.  S_ so they were what I had thought, because they were the way they always are.</p>

<p>But, uhm, I don't know, now it—, it's almost—.  It jus—, it just was striking me that it was almost as if I got through that and somehow—.  I mean I don't think the way I was feeling yesterday was because of that particular engagement.  But yet it was one more thing I'd had to get through in the day, and it—.  It's almost as if it began to take on the proportions of being the source of the whole feeling I had.  And once I got through that I was alright and I was putting—.</p>

<p>I don't know, I have the feeling I'm kind of slipping away from everything else, that I was thinking about since the beginning of the week.  And I can't recall what situations have been or what kinds of thoughts I've been having in my mind and that type of thing.  And this has happened before, but, uhm, I know it's happened a lot recently and I th—.  I don't recall the dream that I was having this morning, but I—, when I woke up I realized I'd had a dream that somehow involved MSCZ and my trying to have intercour—.</p>

<p>Oh, I do remember, now.  It was another one of those dreams of our trying to have intercourse and my being in a state where I wanted to, but there were other people around.  And this time I think FNI and MW were in it and other friends.  I don't know if any family was in it or not.  And I don't know whether we had our own bedroom or not, but somehow it turned out there was a place in the bathroom we could go.  So I said I was going to go take a shower.  But there was a bed in the bathroom in this dream.  And we locked the door to the bathroom and still people came in.  And they were all in a hurry to use the bathroom, too.  So I was feeling, I don't know, rushed, sort of guilty that I was using the bathroom for something like that.  Except that was the only place we could go.  And MSCZ's just sort of, I don't know, he wasn't a strong personality in the dream.  I mean he wasn't taking over the situation, deciding how we were going to solve it or anything like that and—.  Uhm, I was just very aware of my sexual feelings.  And then when somebody came in despite the locked door, I had to jump up and pretend I was taking a shower.  And then I had to do it, and I don't know, MSCZ just kind of disappeared and that was the end of that.  (pause)</p>

<p> I was just wondering, too, uhm.  Because somehow thinking about this dream—, well, I don't see why yet, but there must be a reason—, does make me keep remembering something that I remembered yesterday.  And I didn't remember it too clearly, but when we went—, the couple we were with last night had just gotten a new house.  And when we were goi—, we'd been in the house before, but not since they'd moved and were living there.  So it wasn't that it was the first time going to this house, but when we were going to it—, I mean walking up the steps to the door, I suddenly recalled that, uhm, very recently, some time this week, I had a dream c_ connecting FYC and MEIR in a house.  It wasn't any house that they have, but it was some house that I was imagining.  And I was there visiting them, and I don't recall now what was happening about this house.  But somehow their having this house and all the features of it were very important.  And the way FYC was acting was very important.  I think MEIR was sort of in the background.  He was very much a background figure in that dream.</p>

<p>But there was something, some feeling I had when I was going up to the house of this couple that made me recall that.  And I think I've had other dreams about FYC and MEIR, or FYC.  MEIR's there, too, but it's really about FYC I think, recently.  That's the only one I remember.  And it just makes me wonder if there isn't something about this couple, too, that I haven't recognized that, I don't know, there's some feeling that I do have about FYC and MEIR that I've transferred to this couple.  Because there are other similarities.  He's, uhm, well, their last name is JSZ.  And I don't know if old families or anything, and I don't really know how old family his family is or just what the connections are.  But you get the feeling from the way they talk that his family is a well established PKW family, just the way MEIR's is in PNOTS.  And that there's been a great deal of money in his family.  And just his kind of taste and the way they do things and I don't know, things he knows about, his experiences, remind me very much of MEIR, too.  Uhm, I mean, so they—, there is a similar background they come from.</p>

<p>And I do know when they bought this house, that they could buy it partly because an aunt of MSAZ's had died and left money and then also a lot of furniture, very good old antiques and things of that sort so—.  I mean it all just shows this kind of background.  And it's very much I think what I think of is MEIR coming from, or that he does come from and then FQF, MSAZ's wife, is from a background more like ours, FYC and mine.  And she's the one—, well, I don't know.  I think MSAZ's more so than we used to think, but at first she struck us as being extremely pretentious, and it always takes a long time in the evening to get through that, to what, I don't know, you might feel she is underneath.  I mean that is part of what she is because it's what she values but—.  She's more so than FYC, but I don't know, there's I think something similar there, too, that they both married s—, into somewhat different backgrounds, and they wanted to assume that background they married into.  The way FQF does it is different than FYC, because FYC will pooh-pooh what FQF is pushing.  But on the other hand, FYC underneath it all, values it and just isn't being as frank.  Perhaps that's what it is.  But I don't know.  There was so—, there's—.  I didn't think of this last night but now it—, I just wonder if that isn't part of the tension I always feel when we see them.  (pause)</p>

<p>And when I think of how I always have felt, except I didn't feel it last night, and it's been gradually getting better lately because I have been feeling more and more why does it really matter to me.  The best way for me to enjoy them is to be myself, and then if we find we don't get along then, well it's better than trying to be something I'm not.  But before, and even now sometimes, I would feel extremely awkward and clumsy in that I would say all the wrong things or say things that they would think were stupid.  And I don't know, it just—.</p>

<p>Thinking of all that right now just reminds me of how I used to feel all those times when I'd be going into FYC's room.  And I knew she'd be nasty to me, but I would still go in.  And I would stand there, and she'd either ignore me or, you know, immediately, "Well, what do you want.  Don't do this.  Don't do that.  Stop making that noise."  That kind of thing right away to me.  And somehow the feeling I had then was exactly the same.  (silence)</p>

<p>Because then what I thought of next was remembering how recently I've come to think that I've put on to FYC, feelings—, well, feelings—.  I was having feeling, but somehow either I brought out—, I concentrated on feelings I had with FYC that really weren't the issue or weren't the most important, to avoid others and— (clears throat).  Just like my feeling when I first came in here was I might now be making this visit to the JSZ's sort of the point I had to get through yesterday.  And once I got through that I was free and everything could go back to normal, when really that's not true.  And yet that seems to be sort of the way I was reacting.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  And in the process, what get's lost is the dream you had.  Which in some way must be connected with all the things you've been talking about this week.  Because you say you have a feeling that's what's being lost, and then you sort of stumbled on the dream.  It came back to you.  Which means I think they're connected.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But what's striking is, that dream reminds you of a dream about FYC, MEIR, and then you think about that, but not about the dream you had last night.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  I was, I was ve—, I think very aware, too, this morning that I had trouble sleeping and we got to bed very late last night so—.  I don't know, I don't know what I kept thinking, maybe that is was warm or something.  That was why.  But yet now that I think about it I was very aware after I woke up from this dream of being disturbed and really not wanting to have it happen again, and therefore I guess not really wanting to get to sleep again.  And I was just thinking that's a very different reaction from (sniff) times when I've had a dream that has involved sexual feeling, but not obstruction to it as there was in this dream.  There were people stopping me or there was something I was hiding. Eh, there were—, I mean in this case there were people I was hiding from, but—.  (pause)</p>

<p> I think the feeling I came out of the dream with was, uhm, I don't know, guilty I think.  (pause)  There was no assumption in it that MSCZ and I should have a place where we could go wh—, I mean a—.  I think in the dream we were married, because there was nothing about our not being married that I could think of.  It was assu—.  I was assuming we had the right to be together.  Except that we had to sneak around to have any kind of sexual relations, and—.  And those were wrong.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I think that's a feeling that I've had often at home, or in PTN when my parent are there.  Again that feeling has been getting less strong, but—.  It is a feeling of I don't want my parents to hear or to think that that might be what's going on.  And I don't know, at first I was thinking, well, because it's personal."  But really it's not.  I don't want them to know because somehow I think I have to sneak and do it.  It's not—.  (pause)</p>

<p>And again it was a woman who came in.  I don't know whether it was FNI.  I think I had FNI and MW in the dream, but I think there were other people there, too.  It was again this feeling of a house crowded, and no place anybody could go and be alone.  And yet the person who walked into the bathroom, just like in that dream a while ago that who—, wherever—, whatever room we were in, somebody came in, it was a woman the, too.  And this was a woman, or a female.  And I keep wondering, well how does this connect with what I was thinking about earlier this week and—.  Or with FYC that I think of next and—.  I'm not too sure about FYC at all, but what— (exhales).  The only thing I think of when I wonder about how's it connect with other things this week is, I remember the day I was talking about not being able to express feelings and—.  Then I was thinking that particular day, the feelings I couldn't express were pleasant ones or ones involving pleasure, happiness, things like that.  And how it led to my thinking about expressing sexual feelings and then feelings toward my brother and my father.  And that's what I think of when I think of how does this connect to it and—.  Well, for my father my mother would stand between us, would come in.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I, I don't know, I just had this feeling just now—, it's not very clear either, that somehow just like I think maybe I was concentrating feelings of FNA onto FYC, because somehow those—.  My relationship with FYC was more something I knew I could handle or I don't know s_ s_.  I think it makes sense although I can't seem to verbalize it right now.  But anyway I feel as if maybe I was concentrating on FYC, too, feelings I had about my mother or—.  I felt wrong and I felt that my mother had a right to come between me and my father, and that she should and I felt guilty.  I don't know.  It just seems that maybe I was making that take part of my relationship with FYC, or my feelings in reaction to her.  And that—, and then somehow she took on a role of—, well, I mean it came out sort of like a punishment, because of this, because I couldn't really do it openly with my mother.  (pause)</p>

<p>Or another word that just comes to my mind is rivalry.  I had a rivalry with FNA.  I had a rivalry with my mother.  And I always thought I had a—, and a—, what I've always thought of—, never that I had rivalry with my mother or with FNA, but that I had one with FYC.  Except now when I think about it, I couldn't have ever admitted the other two, because I'd felt I'd lose in those two cases, or that I did lose.  And that with FYC I knew I had a chance.  (pause)In fact of everybody in the family, MLWZ, too, the one I could feel at all that I had a chance in handling a rivalry with was FYC.  (pause)</p>

<p>But this I think of, well, both what I used to do when I'd go and stand in her room and have her yell at me, and just stand there asking for it.  And I also think about that dream I had when we were in this house that I was imagining they had just finished building or something.  They are building a house up in PTB, which I haven't seen.  But from what I've heard of it, it's nothing like the one I was dreaming about.  But in any case, uhm, I was being shown the house, I think, in the dream.  But there was some aspect of being pushed around.  But putting myself in such a position that I was bei—.  I mean it wouldn't have worked out that I was being pushed around, except for my attitude toward it.  And just—, I mean that's the same as if I'd gone into FYC's room with a different attitude, she wouldn't have been pushing me around, but she was, because I wanted her to.  And I don't know how that fits.  With this other feeling I would have thought, I don't know, somehow that I'd be fighting her a little more actively or something.  (pause)</p>

<p>Well, except there was something about the role of being the put-upon one, the persecuted one that I liked.  Because I know that later when I began to think about it, long after that kind of relationship with FYC—, I mean it had certainly gone under if not somewhat disappeared. But, uh, I mean it never disappeared, but it was—, we were superficially getting along a lot better and—. I mean we probably really were, too.  But I mean then I could start thinking about it, and I enjoyed thinking about the fact that I'd been persecuted and thinking how sorry people would feel for me if they really knew the true situation between FYC and me, and how horribly she treated me.  So somehow that I thought was going to serve me in this rivalry between us.  They'd think better of me and less of her if they really knew how she treated me.  (pause)</p>

<p>That makes me think of my mother again.  And I don't know, I guess I wonder first is that a way to, to be treated badly other than this—, what I just was saying about how I might gain from it with FYC—, be a way of sort of getting rid of my guilty feeling.  Because of these other feelings I had that I knew my mother stood between me and my father, and—.  Then I began to remember how lately, too, I've enjoyed thinking of how put- upon I was with my mother, too, that sh—, she didn't give me the kind of love I needed and she knew it.  And realized she wasn't and still couldn't and didn't and—.  But, but I was much less passive with her.  Or at least I was—, I was more passive with FYC as I got older.  I fought with her more when I was younger, and then got more passive and took verbal beatings from FYC more as I got older and asked for them.  But I got more, uhm, disagreeable to my mother.  Except there was always the element of fighting with FYC, and there was always the element of fighting, even when I was little, of fighting with my mother, too, of trying to assert my will.  When she was trying to assert hers.  (silence)</p>

<p>And I was just, I don't know, I guess because I was feeling either that I'm kind of getting off the track or I'm not understanding something, so I'm going to end up off the track if I keep talking about this.  Or anyway, I started thinking back again to your saying these things are—, must be related to what we've been talking about all week or I don't know exactly how you put it now.  But in any case, I was just thinking about what was discussed different days this week.  And I know that each day kind of tied in with the day before.  And I keep thinking, well, there's some overall pattern that I don't quite get a feel of.  But the feeling I have is that there've been a million ideas that I never—, that were new to me this week, and I can't handle them.  And if I take each day separately, I don't feel so overwhelmed, but I guess it's because I keep thinking there's some pattern in all this that I'm not seeing. (silence)</p>

<p>And if I start thinking about each day, I don't know, I can remember sort of one main thing for Monday.  I'm not sure about Tuesday or Wednesday, one of those days I'm mixing up with the other, but I think there's one day I've lost.  And then I'm finding that there are probably a lot things within each day I've lost.  And it, eh, just reminds me of your, I don't know if it was a question or what yesterday of pointing out anyway that there's something about the fact I do forget, that means something.  And yesterday I know I was thinking of it in terms of—, I didn't want to feel I needed anyone, but there seems to be something more to it.  Or maybe that wasn't it at all.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  You know, one of the striking things about the dream it that, uhm, the, you know, central feature of it is that you found yourself sexually excited and aroused, in the bathroom, having to pretend you felt to be there for some other reason.  And MSCZ's role in it is played down.  But you're sexually excited and you're frustrated and you're having to pretend that's not what you're there for when you're discovered.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  What I think of immediately, and it seems practically—, except I don't know if I ever was discovered, but it was a fear of discovery always on this, is that little toy I had when I was around 6.  I used to pretend it was a penis, and I use—.  And the place I'd—, I had it in the playroom, but the place that I could really use it, because it had a hole through it so I could put water in it, and, and then it would be like urinating, was to use it in the bathroom.  And that's where I used to play with it most, which must have been exciting to me.  Because it was such an important thing.  And it was one that I felt, I don't know, guilt or anxiety over remembering and hoping nobody would ever know, ever since and—.  And then when I think of the dream again, what was—.  I wanted to have—.  Well, I don't know, it's hard to say when I (exhales) wh—, I was already aroused or I mean I wanted to have something happen.  That's why we went into the bathroom.  But yet what was happening was that when the person came in, because we weren't actually having intercourse.  I was masturbating against MSCZ's penis then.  I don't know whether that's come out here or something MSCZ's always maintained, but it's something I thought of immediately in terms of this, too, as being true.  That that is another way to feel as if I have a penis.  It's not inside of me, which is another way, too, but yet I don't know, it's like getting it in an unnatural way and not, not in a feminine way.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  And you kept that secret from me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  Yeah, I think what I did was, eh, I th—, I don't think it—, I'd completely forgotten that, but I—, it was sort of like it was a detail I didn't think was very important.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Mm.  (pause)  But you recall earlier this week when the central things that, uh, you were feeling was that if I discover something very valuable that you have that I'll want to take it away from you.  And this was ostensibly about money.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  (pause)  And then I think later there was—, I can't clearly recall this but there was something about a day when you were asking me about my not telling you things, keeping things from you.  I mean when my—, I think we'd already—.  It was after we talked about the money, and so it was involving thoughts or feelings.  And I eith—, I think I either came up with the thought that I hi—, I hid feelings that were pleasurable and then I associated it with sexual feelings for my father.  Or I didn't want to feel I needed anyone, therefore had to tell them things so that they could help me.  But now this just makes me think that I'd hide feelings or thoughts that were making me feel competent and masculine and in control or feelings that were pleasurable, because the feelings that were pleasurable were ones where I was pretending I had a penis.  And that would be the easiest thing in the world to take away from me.  And that's kind of my secret, the secret to my strength that I don't want anyone to know about.  Because I certainly—, my strength I think of as a very masculine thing.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  That you were literally in your dream masturbating—</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  — with your penis.  Or a penis.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  But—.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But why would I want to take something like that away from you, deprive you of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, because I guess just by saying it it proves—, it just shows up how untrue the situation is.  I don't have a penis, and I've lost it by saying it.  Or I mean I have to admit that it's an untrue state.  I can't pretend.  So it's not you're actively—, well, except sometimes I guess I do feel as if you are actively out to get me in some way.  Like the day money was being discussed, it was very much this feeling that you were active in trying to take something away from you then if you knew the details.  But right now I think of it more that just you're somebody that knows the truth, and I'll have to face it if I verbalize these things.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But you know you say that when you had this stick, that you used for a penis when you were 6, that you had to keep that secret?  From whom?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I'm not even sure that anyone knew.  I don't know whether FYC knew or you know, FNA, I guess, would have been old enough to know.  Something.  I mean it was anybody who would be in the playroom that we had then that we all used but—.  I know I was alone in the bathroom playing with it.  And I'm—, I don't know whether—.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  How would you play with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  How?</p>

<p>ANALYST:  UmHmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I think I used to, uhm, somehow fill it with water and then experiment, as if I w—, had a penis by putting it to my body and then urinating into the, uhm, toilet.  I don't think—, I don't know maybe I did other things, but I don't think so.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I think of it in connection with something else I had a fascination with for a while, but I'm not sure if this came at the same time.  I mean I'd have to face the toilet to do this, but there was a time when I wanted to urinate by facing the toi—, sitting on the toilet facing the back.  Because I thought of that as a masculine way to urinate.  I mean, I don't know, I think maybe I'd seen my brother being put on the toilet that way sometimes.  I can't—.  I don't know why now, but it was before he could have stood.  But anyway I definitely associated that as a very masculine way to urinate.  And it—, that gave me pleasure, too, for a while.  And I didn't want anybody to know that either.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, this time I think of it as more feeling guilty or, uhm, ashamed or something.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Which is after all what you were feeling about the dream z____ this morning.  Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Guilty? Of what?  What were you guilty of?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  Well, this is something that—, it's only because of something you said that is comes to my mind.  And I could see how it might be working, but it's something I've never—, it never has occurred to me.  But, uhm, I used to think I'd be feeling guilt because I was trying to be something I wasn't.  Or ashamed.  I didn't want anybody to know I was pretending to be something I wasn't.  But just now I remembered your saying, "So in your dream, in effect you were masturbating, with a penis."  But it was very much as if it were completely disconnected with any body.  And when I think of the stick and your question of what did you do with it and my—, I know I pretended to urinate.  But my first thought was did I masturbate with it in some way and, uhm.  I don't know.  Now when you ask, "Well, guilty of what?" it just seems like even pretending to urinate, that I have a penis, it was in effect a way of masturbating.  I mean the kind of pleasure it gave me.  And that maybe the pleasure wasn't in pretending I had a penis and therefore was something I wasn't, but it was to have a penis so I could masturbate.  It just takes on a different connotation.  (pause)</p>

<p>And if I deny being a female and having these feelings which I certainly tried to deny. And I don't know, I just remember lots of times t_ talking in my teens as if intercourse was the most disgusting thing I could think of.  And I had no feelings toward it.  Uhm, and I don't know if I tried to be masculine—, this is what I've always thought of in trying to get a penis.  It would be to deny these sexual feelings that at one point I'd felt so strongly and that I'd tried to satisfy and was feeling very guilty about.  And that it wasn't—, I don't know, maybe—.  I mean MLWZ had the solution because then he was a male.  And if I could be a male, then I wouldn't—, I mean I guess I assumed I wouldn't be having these feelings that are making me feel guilty because of what I did or maybe guilty because I had them but—.  Right now I'm thinking that the rivalry I had really was with FNA, not with MLWZ, in that sense of competing for attention.  That it wasn't I wanted to be male, because somehow MLWZ got attention that I wanted. Or m_, I don't know, I guess things could be so complicated that maybe it was a part of it.  But yet on—, yet some part of my mind accepted he was different and therefore his attention, attention he got would be different.  But FNA was a female, and then with all these other things, I felt she was the favored one.  And it's—, I don't know if that's part of my affection for my grandmother, because the only person— (clears throat).  Well, later I began to wonder about my mother, but all through my growing years, I knew my grandmother—, if she disliked anyone, if she would have allowed herself to admit dislike in a family and that kind of thing, she disliked FNA and—.  And I knew this, despite the fact that she very rarely said anything and she did try to cover it up pretty much but—.  There was some k_, strong feeling of antagonism toward FNA.  And I think FNA reminded her of her si—, of her—, the sister that was—, well I guess she was closest to my grandmother in age.  She had a lot of sister, but, uhm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  We really got rid of masturbating quickly, didn't we?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, I guess so. (laughs)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Our time's up.</p>

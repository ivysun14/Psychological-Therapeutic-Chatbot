<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi! </p>

<p>CLIENT: This much?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahh, So, ummm, logistics stuff. Are you seeing a chick named Helen?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can't really acknowledge that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, you can't. Ok. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ethically.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ehhh. Alright. Cause, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you have thoughts or feelings or, I mean I can talk about what's in your mind now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cause if you are and its, if its right before me on Monday, then what, I don't know. it's a little awkward. I, I, I was not involved with her, but she works at that school, and she's kind of a psychopath. So I feel weird. I, I don't kinda. She's a kind of a nut. I mean, I'm not trying to be mean, but I mean she's crazy. [00:01:02] So I'm like, you know. Anyway. I'm just saying. So if I'm, if I'm going to see her like</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's recording. I'm, I'm trying to</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: have the conversation (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's all good. All good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) protection of everyone involved.</p>

<p>CLIENT: it's like, I just feel like if I'm going to see her every week at that time. it's just kind of like ahhh. (inaudible) Cause I kind of have to fake saying Hi to her, or whatever. I don't know. it's just, its kind of weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok. it wouldn't feel comfortable to bump into that person, if I were seeing them (inaudible) yeah. Ummm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not if it's every Monday. (laughs) Yeah. She's just a little, she's a little, she's crazy. So. Kind of like, although, when I, I mean, it's humanized her. I just, I felt, I was like Oh she's getting help. That's good. But, I mean she's, I just the other night heard another something else she did that's, I mean, she's just, I, I mean, whether she's seeing you, or whoever, it's good that she's getting help. But, she's not the kind of person I would want to run into (inaudible) you know. Anyway. Whatever. [00:01:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not because of a personal relationship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing. No, because I want to keep it the way I've kept it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is, I want nothing to do with her. You know. So, you know, if I, it's a small town. So if I see her somewhere on the street, I'm like Hey, What's up? And I just keep going. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know. A little waiting room. You know. Every week. it's kind of like. And also because she's not like me, she's, I mean, I've told you about that, they're, they're all big mouthed. So I ask a little, I don't care that people know that I see you. But, only if I'm telling them, not if it's a gossip thing. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalking) protect your privacy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. Anyway. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll se...ummm. I'll see what I can do to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Figure out how to avoid that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Cool. Thanks. So. So, what else. Yeah. [00:02:55] So I definitely been, I, I feel like I think tired, kind of. And this is not helping, you know, the, the time change, weather change, all that shit. I think, and I think, today I was thinking about something. I think it's like a combination of, like I think very old, kind of loneliness is coming out. And I think that's tiring. Kind of. You know. But on the other hand, I was thinking, but you know, some of it is also weirdly good. in the sense that, like for example today, I slept in. And, I'm programmed to feel shitty about that. You know what I mean? But, then is like, well wait a minute, it's shitty outside. it was shitty yesterday. I love my apartment. I love my fucking cat. [00:03:59] We're, we're take...we're sleeping in. You know. She's all curled up next to me. Like, it's the first time I've had that experience. You know what I mean. Where, hey, what, for whatever it's worth, I'm lucky. I work from home. So you know what, if I want to sleep in, I'm going to fucking sleep in. I'll get the shit done later you know. So that was interesting, I was like, uh, it's like this weird combination, and part of it is, I do feel kind of, not drained, but, it's hard to feel lonely. Especially when it's like it's coming from a deep place. Ummm. But then on the other hand, I was like, umm, cause I'm comfy. You know, and I, I actually feel relaxed. I'm not in bed, like scared of the world. My body is just like, I feel like it's a deep, deep decompression or something. You know what I mean? Like, I feel relatively stable. You know, So, when I'm sleeping in, I'm literally really feeling good. My body is just like, you know, I'm curled up to kitty cat like it's, these are new things. I've never felt these things before you know. Does that make sense? [00:05:06] (pause) You know? But more to the negative, not negative side, but the drain side. Like, we're playing a show on, Saturday, and even we're practicing tonight and tomorrow. I kind of don't want to. You know. I don't know what that is. I, I just feel kind of tired, and like, I don't know. it's hard to explain. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't want to practice? (crosstalking) Do you want to do the show?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know the practice, yeah, I just, I fee... yeah. All of it. I just feel kind of like it... I gotta fucking drive into the city, and I feel tired, and maybe I feel like. Maybe it's going to feel different when the record's actually out. But right now I feel, I don't know, we're playing these songs o... like, maybe the songs are getting old to me. Cause they are old. [00:06:02] You know. But they are not old to other people, but they are old to me, So maybe I'm starting to feel like I, I, I'm already writing a million new songs that are kind of, chang... like, different. So I want to get to where I am now. instead of playing these old, you know. So maybe that has something to do with it. I don't know. But, and in also maybe just mentally. I'm just kind of drained. You know. So maybe I'm just kind of like, I don't know. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You may be having, just having feeling. Sadness. Ummm. Grief. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know of someone you loved die. You wouldn't feel like going and playing a show that week. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it doesn't have to mean something about losing motivation. it's just it's, it's just really difficult.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. That's how I feel. I feel, I.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's not outward energy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you're in that place. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [00:06:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or, also one of the things that could be happening, is, old motivations, based on old stuff, might start to change. So, why would you, the old reasons for doing a show might start to die. And then why would you do a show.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you're like, before you know the new reasons, it might just feel like, well then I don't want to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know. And there's a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a lot (crosstalking)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know what you're saying. Like, that old feeling of, I just want validation, and I want, I want to be a rock star, or whatever </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Those childhood things were.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That yeah, now I kind of just, it's like I'd rather not play a show until it's really the right show. Or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I think I do feel a little bit that way. it's a benefit. So that's great. We're going down there to help people, but, you know, I don't give a shit about these other bands. I don't. You know. Who cares? Like, but ummm, [00:07:58] Yeah, but you're totally yeah, it's just like a mixed, totally a mixed emotions and lots of new stuff going on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like with women. if, if needing, to recognizing the old need for being with someone, hooking up with someone, having sex as a, like being instantaneous validation of that. You start to feel like, I just don't, that doesn't really do it for me anymore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't want to. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that could be happening even with performing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Other things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Also.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it's, it's, it's, it's definitely like, it just makes me sad, cause I feel like, [00:08:57] sad, scared. You know? Cause I feel like, well, if I'm gonna feel this way for a while, it's like I, it's hard. Because I have to be extra careful, because, then I st...that, what we talked about last time. Then I get worried, that well then, this kind of, kind of seem like I'm desperate for a relationship, or needy, or, or just that I just seem down, or something. I don't know. Like, I just worry that I'm going to project, and it's not going to be very attractive to. You know what I mean? (pause) I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe I'm still not sure what feels like it would be So bad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea. I don't even know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what does that even mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: For, well, for example, like yesterday, Kelly and I were going to go to the show. [00:10:00] Weather was really shitty. She said that she had to turn around. She was like, it's really like, bad. Now, I was bummed. You know. And of course that part of me was like, is she lying. Like, you know. But, whatever. it, it was bad. You know. And I.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kelly is the new relationship (crosstalking).</p>

<p>CLIENT: The girl I saw Saturday. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You never said her name.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, but it was like I, I told her, cause see I was, then when I went outside to go to the show. it was like shitty, it's way worse here to. Like, this is bad. You know. And, and then at the show we kind of text, we were texting each other. So what ends up happening is, I, this was kind of what I mean by the needy. Like, I, I started, a little bit, going to that Samantha place. Like, I was like oh. Like for example, at one point, I was really like, I was like, alright I like this texting back. You know. Like it was good, like. And then one point, she's like, So how's the show? You know? [00:10:59] So I said, well, cause it was a reunion show of some bands, and it was a benefit for this chick I kind of know, whatever. So I saw a lot of people I hadn't seen in years. You know. So I was like, oh, So it's pretty good, I said, you know, but it's also kind of wacky, you know, I was like, just. I said it's really nice to see some of these people, but I was like, on the other hand, like, some of them, they, they just haven't changed at all. And they're in the same routine, and I was like, that's ok. But it's not. I was like, I don't know. it just feels you know. So, she was like, well you know, ok for them, you know, might be, whatever. So, immediately, I, I got weird in that moment. I was like oh, does, does she think that I'm like judging these people. And she means like, well it's ok for them, So, So what, you know. Like, or something, like, I just, So then I got, like fuck, why did, like, you know what I mean. So that's what I worry about. Like, that was fine. Oh, and oh, and because then after that she was, it was like, you know, almost midnight, eleven forty five or some shit. [00:11:59] So like, well, So I guess I should go to bed, you know, whatever. So have a great you know, enjoy the show, have a great night. Whatever. And I was like thanks, sweet dreams. We, we gave each other a smiley face. But, I was, that's perfectly fine. You know. But I read into it. You know. I was like, ohhh. And now she's going to bed, and did I say something wrong. Or, you know, it's like, come on man. Like, that's just old stuff, just trying to find ways to just make me feel shitty you know. And also, even fa...like, see I just thought of this now. Even, let's say she was. Let's say, which she wasn't, but let's say she was like, well it's ok for them, So why you, Well, no. I am judging. Because I'm here, and I know these people, So some of them are pathetic. So, I mean. You know what I mean? The fact that I would even...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even a worse case scenario, So that</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if she was judging you for judging them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. That even she would, that clearly she's right. And I'm some loser. [00:12:59] You know what I'm saying? Like, what the fuck? You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Rather than maybe you disagree about it. That's it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that, Yeah, that we disagree about, but number two though, she's not there. I'm there. And I know these people. She doesn't know these. Like, that's why, and also, clearly that's not what she means. I mean, everyone knows people like that, and everyone. Especially once you hit your thirties. You know people who, you might like them, or whatever,, but, they seem to just be, you know, they're still hanging out at the bar, drinking, and thinking they're rock stars or whatever the fuck. And it's just the same little cliques, and whatever. some, you know, that's not what she meant. You know. But, ok, and now today, I'm like alright well I'm not going to text her today. You know because, let's just leave it. You know, it's just, I don't know man. I'm just. I'm just, I hate getting that overly, like overthinking, and getting overly, I don't know. [00:14:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See, one of the things you're describing, is you get into the specifics of that moment by moment example. Maybe this is what you mean by desperate. it's like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Desperate for in every moment to know you're totally ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Loved by her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: it's good, she loves you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever. She likes you. it's cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nothing. No ruffled feathers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And meaning to, the feeling meaning that every exchange, every text.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you feel like, oh, it's threatening, but there's something that's a little neutral. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could be interpreted in a number of ways that, that deficit of feeling ok with you. Like, ok, enough, feels glaring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. See, a lot of times, when I say desperate or needy, I don't even mean to them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just mean I don't like feeling, whatever you want to call it. I don't know what you want to call it. But, I don't Like feeling that way. it's like, come on man. Everything's fine. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:14:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, like, (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you could be meaning, you know the next day, okay I won't text today, is that because, is that what you would have otherwise done, or is that the compensation for </p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No exactly</p>

<p>THERAPIST: might actually (crosstalking) </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I'm saying, that's what I'm saying. I, I, of course I want to text her, but I feel like, nope, I should act like, I'm not, let her, well, you know, whatever, that game, you know what I mean. (pause) Even, I took, I took a, Dave took a really cute picture of me and his dog, last night. And now, I was, I would have totally sent that to her, but now, I'm gonna feel like oh yeah, because of that comment, and now if I send this picture and maybe I don't look good in this picture or something, you know what I mean, like (chuckle) it's just like fucking ridiculous. (pause) brutal, fucking brutal. [00:16:01](pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're talking about dealing with 1 percent your life across 100 women, meaning the constant stream of reassurance that you are loveable and if there's a moment when it breaks off, for whatever, even if its a disagreement, a momentary judgment, you or someone saying no I'm not interested in a bar, it will bring up this well inside you from your childhood. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep (sighs) (pause) I don't know. yeah I mean because at the end, the irony of all ironies is who the hell, I mean maybe I'm not going to like her? I mean, we just started, kind of, you know, I mean</p>

<p>THERAPIST: it has nothing to do with you as people yet</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry what were you saying? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: it doesn't have anything to with who she actually is, and (crosstalking) </p>

<p>CLIENT: it doesn't have anything to do with her, yeah, it's just another pretty girl, a certain kind of pretty girl that I just want validation from. You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who falls into the groove inside. That with either open up feeling good about yourself or feeling bad about yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. [00:17:35] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wonder what you remember about looking for your mother's approval? Waiting for it, and wanting it, or you've talked a lot about things you'd overhear her saying, do you remember,</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not a lot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what your relationship was with her as a kid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not much, isn't that weird? No, not really. My dad, yeah. My mom not So much. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, like, would you read stories at night, or snuggle in bed or, that kind of thing, </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't even </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the thing you were saying about the sleeping. But one thing I can specifically remember is, I loved playing with my mom's hair. I had curly hair too, my hair was very curly, So I just had a habit of like, yeah, but I remember </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're own hair you mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Either my own hair, or when I was going to sleep I would play with her hair . So I remember that. (pause) Yeah, I don't, in many ways, it was pretty just standard, like you, I don't remember like story telling, maybe a little bit, like she would, like fable, like—Like old school kind of fables, my grandmother and my mom. I remember some of that but </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or play with you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really playing. I remember she would dress me up, she liked me to be like nice an cute whatever. But yeah, I don't, no playing no. I don't remember playing. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even the memories that your described, (inaudible) and then she would come in, it's not as if she were absent. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there still is a kind of, when I see this memory in my mind, its kind of devoid of a lot of affection? There's sort of, there's not a kind of positive relating. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: it, it may be there, but it's not in your description of her. You're connecting, you're relating, you're loving, you're hugging, your kissing, you're</p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind of don't remember that as much, that is weird. Because I'm pretty sure it had to have been there, I mean my mom, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's an affectionate person. [00:20:17] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if for all the negative stuff, it was like smothering love, I mean,, yeah, my mom, she doesn't, wasn't one of those like waspy, like, oh, you know what I mean? No, no, no. But yet, for some reason, I don't remember a lot of, I don't know. (pause) I mean she'd take care of me when I was sick, and she, you know, she wanted me to eat right, you know. You know. if I was going outside, she made sure I was bundled up or whatever, and stuff, but, I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: it's like the basic needs were met, but not </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, but for some reason I felt that more warmth, maybe it's because I liked my dad more, So that's what I, for some, I just felt really warm and loved by my dad, you know. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You remember liking him more than your mom. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. I mean to this day I say it I mean, yeah. As a person, like would I chose my mom to be friends with? I don't think so. You know what I mean? She's a downer. You know, I would definitively chose to be friends with my dad, if I didn't know him, You know what I mean? My mom's and her whole family, I don't think I'd be friends with them. They're whiners, a bit, they are complainers, they are a little bit prejudice, you know, they're a little bit conspiratorial. Yeah. They don't get a joke, often, you know. (pause)[00:21:49] Huh (long pause) I don't know. (pause)[00:22:57] some of this is making me think of the Kelly thing again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know I just, (pause) like worried, or unsettled, or I just so don't want to have those Samantha type feelings you know. I'm just worried that all this stuff is like bringing out, you know what I mean, like. But then I'm like yeah, because I'm not acting any way with her I'm totally, I'm just, it's happening, I'm just scared of my own</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feelings</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, my own feelings. You know. (pause) When I just got this coffee, I walked in and there were two women talking at a table. One of them was so pretty, she was kind of older, well, maybe not that much, I don't know how old she was but, somewhere between 40 and 50 but she was just like really pretty and I was like, man and it was like someone stabbed me. like that's what happens. And that's always happened when I've seen a really beautiful, kind of, I just have this pang of like first it's just like, wow, she's so beautiful, now it's like, eh. Why is this So hard? (chuckle) like just to have someone to like, you know. I kind of hate that, like that's, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me more about this like feeling stabbed, stabbed you where </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just you know I know she was married and stuff. it's like why, why is it so hard for me. You know what I mean? Like what, what. Of course all of this happened very quickly and subconsciously you know, then I'm lik.. But I think it's like, at this point, I know that I know on a much deeper level, that I know I'm a really good catch. So it's just like, what is going on here. Then, and then I think, well I'm so fucked up that, this is where I am. You know. And then that just makes me feel shitty and then I feel like, and now I'm fucking 40 So by the time I figure this shit out, you know, I'm gonna just date while I'm retired or something, it's like fuck me. you know. it's just (pause) a combination of like sad, frustrated, confused, I don't know. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you are starting to really wonder why aren't you married. Why aren't you marrying, why haven't you found someone. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I've said in here, like when I look back, turns out I've not had one really stable relationship. Like that's, I can't, like even saying that drives me insane. You know, I haven't. I've not had one long term, stable, like Hey let's go see a movie, let's go for a walk. You know? like Hey I've gotta do some errands today, want to come with me. I've had nothing like that. Everything's been intense and wacky and like a moving to Europe and whatever the fuck, and people with nutjobs with kids and you know. I don't know man, like it's just. (pause) it's like a really tough pill to swallow. [00:27:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: well (inaudible) When feelings start to bundle up and, does this mean something about you, what does it mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's the problem to, then that voice pops up and you, I'm not even sure what it says anymore because I've, I've kind of </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The old you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think it's just that, like, you're just going to be this older dude that's alone you know. And, that's pathetic and scary and (pause) (crying) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're terribly worried about what (inaudible) [00:27:59) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. ([pause) I mean yeah, if you think about it last night when we were texting, before the whole thing of she asked me how the show was and all that, right before that, You know I was kind of flirting with her and I was like, you know I'm here, but I keep thinking about this chick in Portsmouth, you know, sort of kind of, and she was like, oh, So what's she like? whatever, So you know. And it ended with her saying, well I bet she really likes you too. Now, if I wasn't, if I didn't have this fucked-up-ness, that would be it, I would just take that, bank it, and be like this is a done deal (chuckle) I mean, no girl has to do any of that. So, you know what I mean? So then, whatever we talked about after that, that would be like, whatever, who the fuck cares, you know what I mean, I'm going to just focus on the positive of like, this girl like's me, it's all good, it's going great, I'm at a show, that's fun. But you know what I mean? it's nice and snowy outside, I'm seeing Dave and Buddy, and I kind of was, the one good thing I will say is, I was kind of like that. Like I wasn't at the show like brooding, and I felt pretty confident, I was seeing people and I kind of felt good to be like, I kind of don't want to be here, like I'm here, it's a benefit for this girl, that's great, I chipped in, but. The music's not that great, lot of these people have nothing fucking to tell me, or that there's no, you know, so I went upstairs and had a beer with Dave and Buddy, and that was great you know. But what I guess I'm saying is, that what I was feeling about Kelly, like, it would feel so good to be just like awesome, she clearly likes me. Cause I don't know, we really, I was like you know, whatever. She was like, what's she like, and I was very honest, I was like she's fucking smart, and funny and thoughtful and beautiful, whatever, she is fucking awesome. Then I joked around and said, not that I actually like her, but she has all those traits, or whatever. (chuckle) And she was like, you know, I bet she likes you too, now, that would feel great to just be at a point where I could be like Fuck. And also to feel good about myself, to be like, I'm good at this shit. Like, you know what I mean? (chuckle) I didn't feel any of that. I immediately was like, Oh .Two words, or no, three words, Okay for them. I let that (chuckle) like totally, you know what I mean? That's, like So not connected with reality. There's no way a girl is telling you, 30 seconds ago, I bet she likes you too, and then just because you said, you know it's good to be here, but it's also, that's some shit, oh no, we're done, we're fucking done. That's, you know what I'm saying? That's, insanity. Like it's no connection to fucking reality. [00:31:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even as you are describing, you said I bet a normal person would take in her saying I bet she likes you to, some of the words that crept out were still, basically like it's in the bag, we're a done deal here or she, she definitely likes me </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I mean in the moment. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, </p>

<p>CLIENT: That you would just savor the moment, I don't know what's going to happen next week, but there's nothing to over think about right now. that's what I'm saying . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, in other words, there's not, it doesn't even matter in the moment, whether it, what's happening or not, that you would just know, I'm likeable enough. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, that's yeah, that's what I mean. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm loveable enough, and maybe this will work with this person who's also loveable enough or maybe it won't </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, exactly, exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: it's so dependant on the outside, from moment to moment to moment. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right. [00:32:02] yeah. (pause) to the point of we're even saying all this, is not convincing that voice. Like right now, it's not working. Because I really like this girl, So that voice, you know what I mean. It's like oh yeah no, Abby agrees with you, you're totally like, logically it all makes sense, but, yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) you don't have inside you. And I don't think that makes it automatically makes it be inside you then. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like it feels nice that you're agreeing with things I'm saying, but it doesn't mean its at a gut level, its just up here, in this case. in other cases, it has been on a gut level, but, you know. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: See, I wonder if even just seconds ago if you started to feel anxious even about talking about it. Like, is some of those feelings of Uh oh, this makes me look, someway I don't want to look, even just to talk about this. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does bother me, just hearing the words come out of my mouth, it's tiring. You know, I just, and also when I hear the words, it's like a shock, like I'm like Wow. You know, when you hear words out loud, it's very different than thoughts. So when I hear myself saying, going play by play, going, (non verbal sounds) What? How does that make any fucking sense? So you're telling me this girl, whether it works out or not, seems like a very nice person, you're telling me, that in a one second, whatever, one minute exchange, she went from saying, I bet she likes you too, saying, Oh whoa, whoa, I'm fucking done with this guy. how dare you, —-what the fuck you know? But, but you're right, but when I say it, on the one hand I'm shocked, but that voice is So strong, that it's like, I don't know, I can't verbalize that, but it's some kind of like, but it doesn't matter, the worst is still going to happen. And, or something. [00:34:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or, I don't know how to put this. it feels like on the one hand you could be shocked by how irrational it is, So that's something came to you I bet, but at the same time, the fact that you are speaking what, part of you knows is irrational, I think can also feel like it's embarrassing here. Like you, you, start to have this observing voice, like if you step outside yourself, what am I saying, this is crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know what you're saying, because at the time I don't have that feeling, I just have the feeling of beating myself up, but when I say it out loud, it's sounds insane, I mean. Because I also imagine like I'm telling a friend of mine. Dude what the fuck, why? what? (laughter) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you imagine that makes you look pathetic or desperate to me or to a friend. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I would never tell friend, I would never tell a friend this. To you, not so much anymore, I'm feeling a little bit more steady about that. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little bit, I think that in your head is a quite thought, it's one think to disturb to actually say, I think it makes all these fears, about what she might think, actually feel like they are happening here too. like what am I thinking about what you are saying is really going on inside. (pause) I felt that when I said like you don't really know if anyone's gonna ever love you. Like that, and it jarred you. Though that actually isn't rocket science, it's not like I thought you probably never thought before, but said out loud its, its a pretty big thing, to be seeing, we know how you feel about yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You're good. yeah. Yeah, because even that, one the one hand, it's jarring, on the other hand it sounds insane. you know what I mean? (chuckles) Like, first of all, everyone at some point or another, of course ahs that fear. Even when they're married, you know what I mean. You don't know when things are gonna not last, or suddenly your husband is going to be leaving you or you know what I mean? Like, So, that's not even based in, like the subtext or the subtitle of that, is not you're afraid no one's ever going to love you, it's that no one is that, you're mom or whoever in your family, hasn't loved you in the right way. So now, there's this irrational fear, it's like being scared of any dog that you see. it's almost like a phobia, it's like, somehow there's this very black and white, foretold, destiny that's going to play out you know. [00:37:38] That's pretty articulate. (pause) I think my healthier side is like saying, dude you know what? You should text her, you like this girl . She likes you. There's no, you don't have to, and just cause you text her, it's not like you're some chump. You're not going to text her like, will you marry me, (chuckle) you know. Be like Hey, how's it going? Okay, here' s a picture of me and Buddy, whatever, like, that's what people do when they like each other. They don't have to (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh</p>

<p>CLIENT: it's not black and white. You can send someone a picture of you and Buddy and still be, not aloof, but you're not texting her every second, or texting her that you're in love with her, or, I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's just the thing. just as you could imagine here that I would think that what you feel is desperate that I would think that it is too, it's just a projection. You can't, it's hard to feel like she would not think of it, the way you think of it, the way you're worried about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, When I get into these places, that's when I worry. That's very narcissistic you know. I, I assume that I know what people are thinking, they are in my world of thinking. you know, that they are not separate people, that, not only have their own thoughts, they have no fucking clue. That Brian, she don't, she's this girl in Portsmouth who's texting some dude that she's into. I mean, she, like why, why, why, am I, she's probably nervous to. What the fuck. like, you know what I mean. Two things happen, One, I assume that everyone's in my mind, So my thoughts are their thoughts and that somehow I'm transparent, they can totally fucking, there's a radar you know. And two, Oh fuck, two's going to be good, Awww, God damn it. Oh fuck. Oh, power. That, that, the other thing I've realized over time, is that look what I'm doing in the terms of the power relationship. it's like she has all the power. like I'm dissecting texts, I'm, and that's what I hate, that makes me feel like a chump, or like a woman. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or like a child. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like a, yeah, I feel like a child yeah. That instead of thinking that wait a minute, this chick is totally, we had like amazing sex Saturday, that she instigated. She kissed me at the, she contacted me, I mean, she's into me, what she's supposed to do, write me a letter, or sky writing that say sar—just to be clear— you know what I mean? Like, and so I don't feel like any man would—Fuck yeah. you know what I mean, like that's a great feeling and just letting it be. You know. And I've done that every time. it's like I have no power. I go on a date with Samantha, she just happens to be into me. As if it's magic. I know she's into me, because I'm "be-in-to-able" (laughter) you know like, but I don't. its as if they are cat's and they are just kind of like, they can do just whatever. One minute they like me and the next thing its just completely fucking irrational. [00:41:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I heard that totally powerless, they have all the power. Or, there are moments we've been talking about you being seductive and maybe you, that you temporarily maybe you have this power. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but it's completely fake, which is why I don't like it anymore you know. That's completely false. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: just as is the powerlessness. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just as the powerlessness is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well really it's just the flip side, it's just the flip side, because really I feel powerless, So in those stupid moments, you know. it's nonsense. (pause) To the point where I can't even navigate, like I get stuck, should I text her, should I not, you know I think, if I was a little more, I hate saying it this way, healthy or whatever. I just, you know I feel like something men or women, I think, it's not just that much of a thought you know what I mean. You text her or you don't. And if you don't, that's ok, and if you do it's ok. You know. I don't have that. I feel like if I text, then how soon is she going to text me back. And if she texts me back, should I text back again, right. Because its a whole, you know, it's just like, what the fuck man. it's like childish and </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or even if you are somebody who, there's a little bit of a game happening where you say, yeah, I want to text, but I'll text later. That's it, it's, it's </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it okay, it's okay,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A thought and that's all it is, it's gone and then you text later. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It comes from trusting yourself more and intuition and a kind of gut sense of who you are and </p>

<p>CLIENT: And also not having an irrational thought of well, if I don't text her today this is, she' s going to be like, fuck, wait, stopping some of the irrational thinking, like if I don't text her today, that say's something about me or, it's going to put her off, or, like, in other words, whatever I decide to do, goes somewhere irrational. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really interesting that it's another fantasy of power. As odd as that sounds, is like the way you get power and control that kind of situation is imagining, if I do this, then, this, it will ruin it this way, if I do this, it will ruin it this way, it sort of keeps it in your control as long as you can find the exact right response then you can keep her there. Which is a fantasy, it, like whether you text or not today, its not going to be </p>

<p>(crosstalking) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, exactly </p>

<p>THERAPIST: but it, its still a fantasy of retaining some kind of control. As though there's fatalistic path that follows every move. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, yeah. it's trying to make things formulaic that aren't formulaic. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: it's not about yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah, right right. (pause) yep </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tomorrow? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Tomorrow at 3:10? yeah thank you. Have a good one. </p>

<p>(door opens and closes) </p>
